1
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,360
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees:

3
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,390
(Office of Transmission)
Though He Wenshen

4
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,390
has attained the rank in the exams,

5
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,120
he has abused his authority

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,000
to settle private grudges,

7
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,430
acting deceitfully in secret.

8
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,080
He's unfit for greater duties.

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,920
He is hereby banished to Yingtianfu.

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,110
Thus decreed.

11
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,710
Citizen Zhuang Hanyan

12
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,780
requests an audience with His Majesty.

13
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,700
=Episode 28=

14
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,780
(Light, Fu Residence)

15
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,620
(A Few Days Later)

16
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,710
You're finally awake.

17
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
You saved me.

18
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,270
Not just me.

19
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,920
Also Mr. Wen,

20
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,230
Mrs. Wen,

21
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,390
Deng Chan,

22
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,480
Li Jiaqi, Yao Wangshu,

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,040
Mu Feng, and Mu Yan.

24
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,710
Even Zhou Ruyin helped a bit.

25
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,070
Look at this.

26
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,460
(If anything happens to me,
use this to prove innocence.)

27
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,640
This letter

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
was sent by Mrs. Wen?

29
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,880
Mr. Wen left it before he passed away,

30
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
but did not inform his family

31
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,990
where it should be sent.

32
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,600
The other day, to save you,

33
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,190
I revealed at the Judicial Review

34
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,200
(Being a spy…)
that you were working undercover.

35
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,360
Only then did Mrs. Wen understand,

36
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,270
this letter was meant for you.

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,480
By the way,

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,030
look at this.

39
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,260
(Yunxi's a spy hidden in Pei faction)

40
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,120
You've entered the Palace?

41
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,320
This memorial is just a copy.

42
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,270
His Majesty compared it with the original.

43
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,140
That's how he believed in your innocence.

44
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,590
To get this copy,

45
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,760
I almost fell into He Wenshen's trap.

46
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,910
But he faced the consequences.

47
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,680
Now he's assigned a minor role in Yingtianfu.

48
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,320
However, His Majesty issued an oral decree.

49
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,390
Once you wake up,

50
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,920
you are to enter the Palace

51
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,080
for questioning on the Pei faction matter.

52
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,080
I was nearly at death's door.

53
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,710
Why risked so much for me?

54
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,350
You once took a risk for me,

55
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,830
saving Chai Jing from prison.

56
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,910
Now I've returned the favor,

57
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
and we're even.

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,590
As for other matters,

59
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,830
we'll settle them later.

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,870
I'm afraid

61
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,320
I don't have much time left

62
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,150
to figure it out.

63
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,350
Now His Majesty

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,910
knows I'm not truly the adopted son.

65
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,600
What about Zhuang Shiyang?

66
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,390
I did not tell His Majesty

67
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,240
about Zhuang Shiyang.

68
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,070
Why?

69
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,000
Since the poisoned wine was his doing,

70
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,830
your life

71
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,950
is in his hands.

72
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,320
If he hands over the formula,

73
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,390
perhaps

74
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,560
a cure can be found.

75
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,710
I've been poisoned for a long time.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,510
Even with the antidote,

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,710
my days are numbered.

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,270
Moreover, it's a rare opportunity.

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,440
If I reveal everything at the Palace,

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,910
Zhuang Shiyang will have no chance left.

81
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,270
Then, the vengeance weigh upon you…

82
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,190
Fu Yunxi.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,350
Now I regret it.

84
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,750
Regret what?

85
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,120
Our deal.

86
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,320
The old and weak of the Fu Family,

87
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,880
I no longer wish to care for them.

88
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,470
If you truly want to protect them,

89
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,710
then live well.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,590
Otherwise, if you die,

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
I'll remarry with that money.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
I have the divorce letter.

93
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,440
No one can stop me.

94
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,510
Mrs. Fu,

95
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,710
Mr. Zhuang came to visit again,

96
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,340
inquiring about the Master's condition.

97
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Zhuang Shiyang?

98
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,080
Mr. Fu survived a great ordeal.

99
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Good fortune follows the blessed.

100
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,320
Cut to the chase.

101
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
Speak your mind.

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,600
Hanyan,

103
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,760
did you relay my plan

104
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
to Mr. Fu?

105
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,590
You can tell him yourself.

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,840
Mr. Fu,

107
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,590
let's be honest with each other.

108
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,070
Years ago,

109
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,070
I didn't know you were undercover.

110
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,820
I thought you worked for the Judicial Review.

111
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
Back then,

112
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,390
I managed Director Pei's assets,

113
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,080
aiming to transport a portion

114
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,750
to Danzhou Chamber of Commerce.

115
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,950
Unexpectedly, you intercepted it midway.

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,390
If you'd handled it routinely, it'd be fine.

117
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,000
But you're sharp and observant.

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,920
You found some clues

119
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
and insisted on getting to the bottom of it.

120
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,310
You feared the truth would implicate you,

121
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,830
so you secretly poisoned me.

122
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,510
Poor thing,

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,440
my dear Yuqin.

124
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,590
She was a new mother,

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,510
yet perished so young.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,560
But perhaps you regret more

127
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,950
not having poisoned Fu Yunxi.

128
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,830
Then none of this chaos would follow.

129
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,350
Mr. Fu,

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
how is your health now?

131
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
Are you alright?

132
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
What do you think?

133
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,390
If the poison wasn't strong,

134
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,830
there might still be hope.

135
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,470
Just say it.

136
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,120
What do you want from me?

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,600
Rest assured.

138
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
I've prepared your explanation.

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,910
When you meet His Majesty, tell him

140
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,680
you are both a spy
and Pei's adopted son.

141
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,200
Indeed,

142
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,910
Pei's assets were managed by you

143
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,030
because you had no choice.

144
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,200
You adapted to the situation.

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,120
Then,

146
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
the Zuohang Gang was destroyed.

147
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,710
You intended to return the illicit funds,

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,480
but feared rash actions could be risky.

149
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,920
Thus, you hesitated,
waiting for the right moment.

150
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,840
Until the truth was exposed.

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,080
This explanation seems plausible.

152
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,710
His Majesty might even commend you.

153
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,990
Does this sound good?

154
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,040
You've planned this thoroughly.

155
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,960
Matters of life and death require caution.

156
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,520
This is a major crime.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,280
If I go along with your plan,

158
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,390
I would be tying

159
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,630
both our fates together.

160
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,550
Thus,

161
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,280
it can save your life.

162
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
If I agree with you,

163
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,160
when will you give me the antidote?

164
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,520
After the task is done,

165
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,230
I'll hand it over.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
Return for now.

167
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,950
I'll give you my answer tomorrow.

168
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,120
Hanyan,

169
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,950
it's about Yunxi's life.

170
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Advise him

171
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,280
not to act rashly.

172
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,920
Don't act rashly.

173
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,440
Was Zhuang Hanyan here?

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,750
She requested an audience

175
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,440
to beg you to save Fu Yunxi.

176
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,320
I thought you'd be upset knowing this,

177
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,040
so I sent her away.

178
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,870
Who do you think you are,

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,830
to presume my thoughts?

180
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,960
Such a great opportunity.

181
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,320
You've ruined it.

182
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,030
I've already scolded her for you.

183
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,950
You...

184
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,520
Fool!

185
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
She needed my help,

186
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,520
which meant I had leverage over her

187
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,200
to force her to marry me.

188
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,870
Who asked you to scold her?

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,920
Sir,

190
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,560
what do you mean?

191
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,350
Why are you scared?

192
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,830
I'm not divorcing you.

193
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,680
At most,

194
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,950
you both can serve me together

195
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,680
as equals.

196
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,830
Isn't that wonderful?

197
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,750
Are you joking?

198
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,320
I'm not.

199
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,110
When did you fall for her?

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Since when do I need your permission

201
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,470
to fancy a woman?

202
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,680
Why?

203
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,590
Why do you like her too?

204
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,830
Absolutely not.

205
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,470
Anyone but her!

206
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,680
Yingyue.

207
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,600
- Don't.
- You're misbehaving again.

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,520
No.

209
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,990
Have you decided?

210
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,590
Have you ever thought

211
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,870
if I do as he says

212
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,870
and enter the Palace,

213
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,630
taking all the blame

214
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,710
upon myself for him,

215
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,070
when that day comes,

216
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,990
would the antidote he sends

217
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,160
still be just another cup of poison?

218
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,350
I know his nature.

219
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,990
He is not to be trusted.

220
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,990
If he gives up the formula,

221
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,630
we can make the antidote ourselves.

222
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,230
Even if I take the antidote,

223
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,560
it might just extend life a bit.

224
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,150
In the end, death still looms.

225
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,830
But there's a slim chance to live.

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,350
Don't you want to give it a try?

227
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,200
Give me a little more time.

228
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,950
Let me think it through

229
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,350
to see if there's a flawless plan.

230
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,350
For now, we need to not reveal

231
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,990
that you have awakened.

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,830
Let's think of a strategy.

233
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,520
Otherwise, His Majesty

234
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,520
will summon you immediately.

235
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,670
Hanyan.

236
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,400
Thank you.

237
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,630
If you truly wish to thank me,

238
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,950
then live.

239
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,180
(Zhuang Residence)

240
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,750
Master, you called for me?

241
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,870
If Fu wants to enter the Palace,

242
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,230
he must report to the Transmission.

243
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,110
Send a few people

244
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,750
to watch the Fu's entrances.

245
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,670
Also,

246
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,360
the entrance of the Transmission.

247
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,270
If anyone related to Fu Yunxi
enters or exits,

248
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,440
report to me immediately.

249
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
Yes, Master.

250
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,900
(Safe)

251
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,500
(Duke Qi's Mansion)

252
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,400
Even with that golden butterfly hairpin,

253
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,950
you simply don't carry it well.

254
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,230
It's a pity your sister Hanyan

255
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,040
doesn't know her place.

256
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,590
Why not bring her here,

257
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,000
drug her,

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,320
and take her by force?

259
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,160
Will you help me?

260
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,990
I'm not that dispicable.

261
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,110
I can't capture Zhuang Hanyan,

262
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,830
but I can handle you.

263
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,990
Even a wild horse can be tamed

264
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,080
by a skilled trainer.

265
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,830
I've been pretending to be your late wife,

266
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,950
yet you remain unfaithful.

267
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
You all

268
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,400
are worse than beasts.

269
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,830
I'll kill you!

270
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,160
You wrench!

271
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,110
I'll kill you!

272
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,020
(Fragrant Tea Melody)

273
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,910
Sir,

274
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,950
you summoned me?

275
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,360
Tomorrow morning,

276
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,520
deliver this sealed letter

277
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,040
to Consultant Hu
at the Office of Transmission.

278
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,440
He'll present it to the Emperor.

279
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,360
Say nothing

280
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,320
to anyone about this.

281
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,270
Sir,

282
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,190
are you going

283
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,960
to report Zhuang Shiyang's crimes?

284
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,630
Not all poisons

285
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,870
have an antidote.

286
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
Zhuang Shiyang's words are mixed.

287
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,390
I'm unsure how much of him to believe.

288
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,240
I only want to take this chance

289
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,240
to rid us of this threat once and for all.

290
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,790
Sir, you would trade your own life

291
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,000
for that wretch's?

292
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,160
It's not worth it!

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,920
No.

294
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,110
I am using my remaining time

295
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,110
to take one final risk

296
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,630
to pave the road

297
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,030
for the Fu family

298
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,520
and for Hanyan.

299
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,040
If this succeeds, it'll be a great merit.

300
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,350
It'll secure them a place

301
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,150
in the Capital

302
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,670
and win them more allies.

303
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,910
It's fulfilling the promise I made

304
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,000
on the day I proposed to Hanyan.

305
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,510
Sir.

306
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,230
Rest assured.

307
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,190
I know what I'm doing.

308
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,150
I am not acting recklessly,

309
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,150
seeking my own demise.

310
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,910
What's your plan?

311
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
Shouldn't you discuss it with Mrs. Fu?

312
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,430
If I tell her,

313
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,670
she'll surely forbid it.

314
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,670
If it succeeds,

315
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,720
I'll just share the good news.

316
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,110
But what if

317
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,400
it fails?

318
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,070
It's almost ready.

319
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,000
Pour it into the bowl.

320
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,320
Yes.

321
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,670
Mother.

322
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,400
Lingzhi?

323
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Lingzhi,

324
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,280
why aren't you having breakfast?

325
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,110
Mother,

326
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,350
Grandmother went to the countryside
with Ms. Kou.

327
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,390
But they wouldn't take me with them.

328
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,400
They are not out for pleasure.

329
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,440
It was Qingming a while back.

330
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,590
But they were too busy

331
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,080
to sweep the graves.

332
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,800
They're paying respects to the departed.

333
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,910
Do you have someone to honor?

334
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
Take me with you.

335
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,560
Our teacher has given us the day off.

336
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,880
He assigned us

337
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,110
to write a poem about spring outings.

338
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,520
Father is still recovering.

339
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,280
He can't get out of bed.

340
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,430
Only you can take me.

341
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,560
Please?

342
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,520
If you wish to go, then go.

343
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,320
It's only

344
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,630
a half-day trip.

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,920
Alright.

346
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,790
Lingzhi,

347
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,880
let me finish this first.

348
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,670
Can you wait for me?

349
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,080
Keep an eye on Fu Yunxi.

350
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,510
If anything seems off,

351
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,910
send word immediately.

352
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,080
Yes.

353
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,940
(Light, Fu Residence)

354
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,840
Master,

355
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Mr. Zhuang's here again.

356
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,640
Let him in.

357
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,190
Yes.

358
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,560
Close the door.

359
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,140
(Calligraphy and Painting)

360
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,800
Have you decided?

361
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,600
Yes.

362
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,350
I don't want the antidote.

363
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,960
I want your death.

364
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,400
Mr. Fu,

365
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,880
if not for yourself,

366
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,320
think of Lingzhi.

367
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,830
Lingzhi lost her mother,

368
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,110
must she lose her father, too?

369
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
How could you bear it?

370
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,960
That's interesting.

371
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,560
How could I bear it?

372
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,800
What about you?

373
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,150
I infiltrated the Pei faction as a spy,

374
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,430
but over the years,

375
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,190
I've done some bad deeds.

376
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,080
I dare to admit them.

377
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,190
Do you?

378
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,350
You must be mistaken.

379
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,320
I've never done bad deeds.

380
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,070
I was forced into the Pei faction

381
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,800
to launder his money.

382
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,790
Yet I cared deeply for the poor commoners.

383
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,240
I devised a comprehensive plan

384
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,110
to lend all funds

385
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,200
to the displaced refugees,

386
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,300
so they could buy land

387
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,480
to farm and to survive.

388
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,590
It has saved countless lives.

389
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,650
My deeds are commendable.

390
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,640
Is that so?

391
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
Then why did you

392
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,400
visit me several times to persuade?

393
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,790
Such a noble endeavor

394
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,280
must be reported to His Majesty

395
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,520
and declared in the Capital.

396
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,000
That would honor your intentions.

397
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,760
Do not be afraid.

398
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,180
On your journey to the underworld,

399
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,000
I will find someone to accompany you.

400
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,720
What do you mean?

401
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,030
Duke Qi has troubled the Capital for years.

402
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,270
He has repeatedly acted against my Family.

403
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,880
The matter with Noble Consort Miao

404
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
was orchestrated by you two.

405
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,790
Now I will,

406
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,640
in front of His Majesty,

407
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,160
reveal everything openly.

408
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
It's a misunderstanding.

409
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,190
I never conspired with Duke Qi.

410
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,800
How dare you provoke Duke Qi?

411
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,390
Do you not value your life?

412
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,110
Not the first time I've done so.

413
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,230
What's there to fear?

414
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,960
I must bathe and change.

415
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,960
I can't be late for the Palace visit.

416
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,430
Mr. Zhuang,

417
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,880
please leave.

418
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,160
Mrs. Fu left by carriage.

419
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,670
You can catch up on horseback.

420
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,920
It concerns life and death.

421
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,070
No time to lose.

422
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,110
Understood.

423
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,680
Open the door.

424
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,150
Open up. It's me.

425
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,670
Hurry. Open the door.

426
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,880
Open up!

427
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,800
Open it.

428
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,790
Open the door.

429
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,710
It's me.

430
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,440
- Ms. Yushan?
- It's me.

431
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,480
Quick. Close it.

432
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,550
Take me to Father now.

433
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,150
Master left early this morning.

434
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,240
He's gone out?

435
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,320
Then I'll wait for him.

436
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,030
Don't tell anyone

437
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,110
you saw me, okay?

438
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,840
- Yes.
- Alright.

439
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:09,260
(Duke Qi's Mansion)

440
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,840
Sir.

441
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,270
I was just about to look for you.

442
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,720
But here you are.

443
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,280
Where is the Duchess?

444
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,470
The Duchess?

445
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,720
Yushan is not here?

446
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,960
Don't play dumb.

447
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,110
She escaped.

448
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
Other than the Zhuang's,

449
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
where else could she be?

450
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,880
I...

451
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,590
You didn't see her?

452
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,070
I didn't.

453
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,000
I left in the morning

454
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,240
and didn't see the Duchess.

455
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,560
Then why are you here?

456
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,110
I came to report

457
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,960
the spring tea from Mount Emei is ready.

458
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,590
Too many people around.

459
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,720
Sir, there's trouble.

460
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,920
Fu Yunxi has woken up.

461
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,590
He's entering the Palace today to report.

462
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,280
What's that got to do with me?

463
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,270
Sir, you are unaware.

464
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,350
About Noble Consort Miao,

465
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,680
Fu Yunxi and my disgraceful daughter

466
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,040
have noticed some clues.

467
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,910
They insist you were behind the chaos

468
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,680
and colluded with the Observatory

469
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,920
to mislead His Majesty.

470
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,960
This is a serious crime. Punishable by death.

471
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,910
Fu Yunxi is going to the Palace today

472
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,720
to report on the Pei faction case.

473
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,270
He stated himself

474
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,350
that he'll reveal everything.

475
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,480
I've tried to dissuade him,

476
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,830
but he remains determined,

477
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,560
to set you up, sir.

478
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,110
There's no time to waste.

479
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,280
You must act quickly.

480
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,800
The matter was handled discreetly.

481
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,630
What evidence does he have?

482
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,080
I do not know.

483
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,910
But he seems

484
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,430
utterly confident.

485
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,590
You can't take the risk.

486
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,150
Seems he bears a grudge against me

487
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,110
for his previous downfall,
and for my attempt

488
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,590
to marry Zhuang Hanyan.

489
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,080
So he wants to fight me to the end.

490
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,000
When will he enter the Palace?

491
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,320
Sometime today.

492
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,430
Probably very soon.

493
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,760
No worries.

494
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,430
As long as he is killed before he enters,

495
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,190
even if he's skilled,

496
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,350
he'd have to plead in dreams.

497
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,270
Your Highness,

498
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,150
nothing can go wrong.

499
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,560
And as for

500
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,720
your daughter Hanyan,

501
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,480
she cannot be spared either.

502
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,800
Do not worry, Father-in-law.

503
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,480
Just send the Duchess back.

504
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,590
Someone will care for you in old age.

505
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,100
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

506
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,590
Master has returned.

507
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,640
Why is the door shut in broad daylight?

508
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,430
Master, Ms. Yushan is back.

509
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,440
Where is she?

510
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,220
In the study room, waiting a long time.

511
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,060
Alright.

512
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,230
Yushan?

513
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,640
Father.

514
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,240
Father.

515
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
Yushan,

516
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,960
why do you look like this?

517
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,880
The Duke…

518
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,720
Father.

519
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,640
Yushan.

520
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,870
Father.

521
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,350
I'm sorry.

522
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,320
I shouldn't have let you be the Duchess.

523
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,390
It's my failure.

524
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,960
I've let my dear daughter suffer.

525
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,440
I won't go back.

526
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,680
I won't go back.

527
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,590
I'd rather die than go back!

528
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,640
Father,

529
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,550
please prepare some money

530
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,790
and help me leave the Capital quickly.

531
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,440
You're all alone.

532
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,670
How will you survive outside?

533
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,080
Don't worry, Father.

534
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,670
The world is vast.

535
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,800
Surely, there's a place for me.

536
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,550
I'll ride away

537
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,000
and travel to distant lands.

538
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,510
Or find a safe haven

539
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,040
and make my own living.

540
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,640
Better than enduring endless suffering.

541
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,510
Alright.

542
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,870
Go pack your valuables.

543
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,590
I'll arrange for you to leave.

544
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,030
But,

545
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,870
if I leave,

546
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,200
and Duke Qi comes looking for me,

547
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,510
how will you handle it?

548
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,520
Silly girl.

549
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll just insist I haven't seen you.

550
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,790
What can he do to me?

551
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,640
Don't be afraid.

552
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Don't worry about me.

553
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,670
Go to the Gongtong Chamber

554
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,590
and pack your things.

555
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,870
Hurry. Go now.

556
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,560
- Father.
- Go.

557
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,430
You're always so kind to me.

558
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,230
Go.

559
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,030
Who are you?

560
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,000
Your Highness,

561
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,760
the Duke ordered us to take you back.

562
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,190
How did you get in?

563
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,590
I'm not going back.

564
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,510
I'm not.

565
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,760
Father! Father, save me!

566
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,160
After her!

567
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,820
(Fleeting Grace)

568
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,600
Father.

569
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,880
Father!

570
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,520
Duke Qi's men are here.

571
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,590
Get them out of here!

572
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,710
Father.

573
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,080
What's going on?

574
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,990
Yushan,

575
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,000
my good daughter.

576
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,630
My dear.

577
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,590
Can you save me once more?

578
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,640
Father,

579
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,870
what do you mean?

580
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,110
The Duke has promised me

581
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,720
he'll never lay a hand on you again.

582
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,240
If you return this time,

583
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,390
you'll only have honor and privilege,

584
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,110
never suffering again.

585
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,830
Our Zhuang family

586
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,350
has no other support left

587
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,870
but Duke Qi.

588
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,350
I'm begging you.

589
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,400
Father.

590
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,630
What's wrong with you?

591
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,430
Have you forgotten?

592
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,440
Didn't I show you?

593
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,390
Look again at the wounds he left on me.

594
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
Look. Here.

595
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,190
It's from whippings.

596
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,550
This bruise is from his fists.

597
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,960
This was from when he burned me.

598
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
You've seen them all.

599
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,400
Father, you've seen them all.

600
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,480
Why?

601
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,720
Aren't you the one who loved me most?

602
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,510
I saw it.

603
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,910
I saw everything.

604
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,760
It was my fault.

605
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,390
Our Zhuang family failed you.

606
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,710
No.

607
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,870
Father, you're not like this.

608
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,320
Do you remember?

609
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,000
When I was six,

610
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,110
you told me,

611
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,960
even if I wanted the stars,

612
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,350
you'd get them for me.

613
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,920
When I was nine,

614
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,550
you said if anyone bullied me,

615
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,760
you'd fight for me.

616
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,150
At twelve,

617
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,070
you told me,

618
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,800
though I'm a daughter,

619
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,870
I'm still the one you cherish most.

620
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,870
When Mother forced me to marry Duke Qi,

621
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,240
you were worried for me.

622
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,630
You said you were afraid I'd be hurt.

623
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,000
Why?

624
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,800
Why has everything changed?

625
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,800
You must have a reason, right?

626
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,110
You must be hiding something, aren't you?

627
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,400
Father.

628
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,800
Father, tell me.

629
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,280
I'm Yushan.

630
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,310
I'm your most cherished daughter.

631
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,590
I'm Yushan!

632
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm Yushan, Father!

633
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,670
I'm Yushan! Let me go!

634
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,390
Father!

635
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,820
(Pure Heart)

636
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,150
Xiwen has left.

637
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,310
Ruyin has left.

638
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,520
Yuchi has passed.

639
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,150
Both daughters are married.

640
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,780
(Prosperity and Longevity)

641
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,190
Now this once bustling home

642
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,710
is just us two left alone.

643
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,670
A little peace and quiet isn't so bad.

644
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
With so few people,

645
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,000
life feels empty.

646
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
It's better to take another wife.

647
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,670
Do you have someone in mind?

648
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,480
What does you think?

649
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,670
I'm old and foolish now.

650
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,750
I rarely step out of the house.

651
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,890
You decide.

652
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,110
Then I'll look around

653
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,360
for a suitable match.

654
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,520
I'll show you later.

655
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,110
Alright.

656
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,230
Fine by me.

657
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,560
Just don't ruin another life.

658
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,880
It's a sin.

659
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,150
Train soldiers for years,

660
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,110
and use them in a moment.

661
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,920
All these years,

662
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,670
I've never treated you poorly.

663
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,880
Now,

664
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,920
it's time to prove your loyalty.

665
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,040
As your command.

666
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,520
Remember.

667
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,920
Leave no survivors.

668
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,030
Ay!

669
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,470
Mother,

670
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,590
now Fu Yunxi and I

671
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,150
have the chance
to bring down Zhuang Shiyang

672
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,310
to avenge you,

673
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,710
but I

674
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,790
am hesitant.

675
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,670
If I avenge the deceased,

676
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,630
I must sacrifice a living soul.

677
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Even if he's not Fu Yunxi,

678
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,150
but a stranger,

679
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,110
shouldn't I refrain from

680
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,480
being so selfish?

681
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,570
Mother,

682
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,630
I paid respects, too.

683
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,710
I thank you on their behalf.

684
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,700
Mrs. Fu.

685
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,580
Mrs. Fu.

686
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,150
Shuhong sent me to inform you.

687
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,600
Master is going to the Palace.

688
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,670
When is he leaving?

689
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,000
I don't know exactly.

690
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,030
But Shuhong said

691
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,400
you should return immediately.

692
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,000
Mother, what's happened to Father?

693
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,150
Quickly. We must go back.

694
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,070
Yes.

695
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,980
(Light, Fu Residence)

696
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,070
Let's go.

697
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,280
Master.

698
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,280
What are you doing?

699
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,110
Before leaving, Mrs. Fu

700
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,280
instructed me

701
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,560
to watch over you

702
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,230
and not let you leave.

703
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,110
She's meticulous in everything.

704
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,440
I've sent someone swiftly

705
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,550
to bring her back.

706
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,920
She should arrive soon.

707
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,550
Then I must leave even sooner.

708
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,470
Hold her back.

709
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,840
Master.

710
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,760
Let go. Master.

711
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,840
Master.

712
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,240
Master.

713
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,760
Let go.

714
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,400
Yingyue.

715
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,110
These servants are so rude.

716
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,520
How can you treat Yingyue like this?

717
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,760
Yingyue,

718
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
today is a joyous day.

719
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,790
Will you

720
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,590
make tea for me again?

721
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,200
Today

722
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,670
is Fu Yunxi's final day.

723
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,630
And Zhuang Hanyan as well.

724
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,560
I've sent people to ambush her
outside the Capital.

725
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,040
Yingyue,

726
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,000
you won't have to be jealous of her again.

727
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,590
Are you happy?

728
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,440
Untie the ropes.

729
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,520
I'll make tea for you.

730
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,190
That's more like it.

731
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,400
Untie her.

732
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,710
Spring tea.

733
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,710
Ancient tree tea.

734
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,630
I want the finest

735
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,710
Zhang Ke ancient tree tea today.

736
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,030
Guards!

737
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,590
Imperial Physician!

738
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,750
Imperial Physician!

739
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,440
Help!

740
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,590
Help!

741
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,080
Imperial Physician!

742
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,070
How dare you?

743
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,040
I'll show you.

744
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,400
I warned you, didn't I?

745
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,320
Cong!

746
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,630
Stop it!

747
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,480
- Stop!
- I warned you.

748
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,400
- I warned you.
- Stop now!

749
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,920
Cong.

750
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,190
It's okay.

751
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
There's the Duchess.

752
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,320
Get her!

753
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,640
- After her!
