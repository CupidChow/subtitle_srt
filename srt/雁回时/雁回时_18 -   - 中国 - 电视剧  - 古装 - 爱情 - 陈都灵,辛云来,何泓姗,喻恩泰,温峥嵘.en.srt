00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,150
(17 years ago)
What a vile eunuch!

3
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,490
He threatened me

4
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,260
and asked me to hide
his ill-gotten money.

5
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,500
(Zhuang Hanliang, Hanyan's grandfather)
How shameless.

6
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,490
Father, please calm down.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,480
Our family has been in business
for generations.

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,760
You're widely respected
in the business world of Yinan.

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,920
You can easily pull some strings.

10
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,710
No wonder Director Pei
would ask for your help.

11
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,080
How do you address that rebel?

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Director Pei?

13
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,030
Father, don't get me wrong.

14
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,360
That eunuch is cunning and powerful.

15
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,590
I'm only worried...

16
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,200
The one who should worry is him.

17
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,830
I've already warned him.

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,910
I'll write a memorial tonight

19
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,230
and report it to the Emperor
tomorrow morning.

20
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,960
Let's see if he can bear the charge

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,310
of corruption and misconduct.

22
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,760
Father, please don't be foolish.

23
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,760
Eunuch Pei holds great power.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,080
To move him would be
like an ant shaking a tree.

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,470
Do you want me
to become the eunuch's tool

26
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,830
and a laughingstock to the world?

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
I dare not.

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,190
I'm willing to meet Director Pei
on your behalf

29
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,120
to apologize and seek peace.

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,110
Perhaps there's still room
for negotiation.

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,520
Father, please don't risk your life

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,030
and the lives of the whole family.

33
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,320
You wretch!

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,710
You brat!

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,920
Kneel!

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
You ungrateful,

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,400
disgraceful coward!

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,990
You spineless coward!

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,520
All those books you read

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
have gone to waste!

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,950
I'll teach you a lesson today!

42
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,230
(Zhuang Hanliang offended Director Pei,)

43
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
(but I don't want to die.)

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,790
(You brought this disaster on yourself.)

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,950
I have followed your orders.

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
Zhuang Hanliang is dead.

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,830
Director, please have mercy.

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,040
From now on,

49
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,160
I'll treat you as my master and father,

50
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,990
willing to do anything for you.

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,080
(After that, I hid in the shadows,)

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,310
(using the Yinan Chamber of Commerce
to clear Pei Dafu's money)

53
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,870
(and exchange it for land and property.)

54
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,320
(I became his most favored adopted son.)

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,400
(He handed over all his wealth)

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,710
(to me to manage.)

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,990
(I lived in constant fear,
walking on thin ice,)

58
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,760
(always afraid of being exposed
and ruining my family.)

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,350
(There wasn't a night of peace.)

60
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,470
(Later,)

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,200
(through Pei Dafu's trust,)

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,390
(I slowly poisoned him.)

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,640
(But after Pei Dafu died,)

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,950
(my only support fell,)

65
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,760
(and I grew terrified)

66
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,430
(Spirit Tablet of Zhuang Hanliang)
(of the exposure of my crimes.)

67
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,800
(I trusted no one,)

68
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,760
(not even my closest family.)

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,470
(I've been living in constant fear.)

70
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,420
(Harmonious Family)

71
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,420
=Episode 18=

72
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,590
You promised me

73
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
that whenever I asked you,

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
you'd tell me the truth.

75
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,510
So, tell me.

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,470
Is Pei's adopted son

77
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,680
really you?

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Yes.

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,710
You asked me to marry you

80
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,440
but didn't inform me of this beforehand.

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,030
Did you want to pull me
out of one fire pit

82
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,710
only to push me into another?

83
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,170
Hanyan,

84
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,580
how can you still want to marry him?

85
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,740
He brought our whole family
to the execution ground.

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
We were almost beheaded.

87
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,200
If I hadn't used a trick in prison,

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,320
forcing him to hand over
Wu Youzhi's corpse,

89
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,710
you would be an orphan by now.

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,070
How can you entrust yourself

91
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,510
to such a dangerous man?

92
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,390
Forcing him?

93
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,920
The day we met in prison,

94
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,560
I suggested you look for Wu Youzhi.

95
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,900
You left and didn't return.

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,000
As dawn approached
and we were about to be executed,

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,680
I had no choice but to take a risk

98
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,270
and have the jailer bring Fu Yunxi

99
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,710
to meet with me in prison.

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Mr. Zhuang,

101
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,880
you urgently called me here.

102
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,240
Are you admitting it?

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,240
Wu Youzhi told me

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,030
he discovered you were
investigating him.

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
Therefore, he was very anxious.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,710
Soon after, he disappeared.

107
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,430
You must know

108
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,350
where he is.

109
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,240
Did you kill him?

110
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,910
Nonsense.

111
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,470
Fine, I admit it.

112
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
I am Pei's adopted son.

113
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,430
Good.

114
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,150
Then I'll take the indictment here,

115
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,950
and you just need to sign it.

116
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,440
Wait, wait.

117
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,550
What?

118
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,070
Are you backing out again?

119
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,990
What's the rush?

120
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
I haven't finished speaking.

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
As Pei Dafu's adopted son,

122
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,680
I have some hidden secrets

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,000
to report to you.

124
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,350
Mr. Pei was good at choosing people.

125
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,320
Before he died, he told me in person

126
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,030
that besides me,

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,640
there was another adopted son.

128
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,510
Don't you want to know who he is?

129
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,190
Go ahead and tell me.

130
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,470
Forget it.

131
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,640
The Zuohang Gang has fallen.

132
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,030
The Director is dead.

133
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,590
Why add more restless souls?

134
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,150
Everyone has family and blood ties.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,710
If this is exposed,

136
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
their whole family
will be buried with it.

137
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,710
I'm willing to keep his secret,

138
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
but I don't know

139
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,440
if he would spare me.

140
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,910
If you want to drag him down,

141
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
you must present some evidence.

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,680
In such a life-or-death moment,

143
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,910
who would easily show
their life-saving elixir to others?

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,680
Mr. Fu, you only need to know

145
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
that I will never

146
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,510
treat the lives of my entire family

147
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,800
as a joke.

148
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,440
Is this true?

149
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Yes.

150
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,310
So,

151
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,080
your permission to let me
take Wu Youzhi's corpse,

152
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,480
and later, your dismissal

153
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,560
and punishment

154
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,320
were just to protect yourself.

155
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,470
That day at Nanshan Clinic,

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,920
did you know

157
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,400
I was hiding outside the window?

158
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,800
Were those words
meant for me to overhear?

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,470
Mu Feng saw you first.

160
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
I only found out

161
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,950
you were outside later.

162
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,590
That day in prison,

163
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,040
I was indeed forced by Zhuang Shiyang,

164
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,520
but before that, I'd made up my mind

165
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,480
to give you Wu Youzhi's corpse

166
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,040
to help you save your family.

167
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,040
How can I trust you now?

168
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,320
I've said it before.

169
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,160
I never want to harm you.

170
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,670
No matter who I am,

171
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,950
this has never changed.

172
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,390
You claim to serve
at the Judicial Review

173
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,350
and are responsible
for catching the adopted son.

174
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,710
But now it seems,

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,510
the world has been mistaken,

176
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,020
thinking there is only one adopted son.

177
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,670
If you capture Zhuang Shiyang,

178
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,520
you will have nothing to fear.

179
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,750
Since my return to the Capital,

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
you've seemed to help me
again and again,

181
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,920
but it was only to use me

182
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,470
and coerce me,

183
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,000
treating me as a pawn

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,150
to draw out a scapegoat,

185
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,920
and playing me like a puppet.

186
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,710
Is that true?

187
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,950
At the start,

188
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,830
that's how it was.

189
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,590
Has anything changed now?

190
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,230
Do you want to tell me

191
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,230
you've developed real feelings for me?

192
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,990
What if I say yes?

193
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,240
Hanyan, don't be deceived by him.

194
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,520
Shut up, Zhuang Shiyang.

195
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,240
Do you think you're a good person?

196
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
Are you going to disown me?

197
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,400
Why?

198
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,830
Because I once served Pei Dafu, right?

199
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,350
I did it to save our family.

200
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,880
I endured the pain,

201
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,470
biting

202
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,830
and swallowing it alone.

203
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,950
I carried it on my shoulders.

204
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,670
As long as I kept the secret
and took it to the grave,

205
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,110
no one would find any evidence.

206
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,750
However, my daughter is against me now.

207
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,790
Hanyan,

208
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,800
what else do you want from me?

209
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Stop pretending

210
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,710
and acting righteous.

211
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,030
Do you really think Mother

212
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,160
hasn't told me everything?

213
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,830
The reason why you killed Grandfather,

214
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,040
framed me as a barefoot ghost
to be your scapegoat,

215
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,080
crippled Mother for years,

216
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,830
and caused
the Ruan family's fall overnight.

217
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,100
Can you explain all of this

218
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,050
to me clearly?

219
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,620
When your grandfather
was on his deathbed,

220
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,400
the Judicial Review sensed something
wrong and wanted to investigate.

221
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,210
At that time,

222
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,470
Zhou Ruyin framed you
as a barefoot ghost

223
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,800
and blamed
your grandfather's death on you.

224
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,450
I merely went with the flow.

225
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,320
But I never intended

226
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,830
to harm your life.

227
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,270
Even a tiger won't eat its own cubs.

228
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,110
You're my daughter.

229
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,870
You don't need to argue anymore.

230
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,110
What you've said

231
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,800
is no excuse for your wrongdoings.

232
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,950
There's one more thing.

233
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,710
Let's discuss it all tonight.

234
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,440
Mr. Zhuang, you enjoy cooking

235
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,590
and know medicine well.

236
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,710
When Yuqin died from poisoning,

237
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,110
I fear this

238
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,160
has something to do with you, right?

239
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,400
When the incident occurred,

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,320
I had found clues
about Pei Dafu's private assets.

241
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,550
But the informants died overnight.

242
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,550
The food and wine at home
were secretly poisoned.

243
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,480
It was you who noticed the signs

244
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,960
and tried to poison me

245
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,030
fearing I'd uncover you.

246
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,800
But by mistake,

247
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
you poisoned Yuqin instead.

248
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,800
I guessed right, didn't I?

249
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,160
Yuqin was indeed killed,

250
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,160
but the murderer was you,

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
her husband.

252
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,230
If you hadn't stirred up trouble,

253
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,230
Yuqin wouldn't have died.

254
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,630
Fu Yunxi.

255
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,400
Zhuang Shiyang.

256
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
No wonder the powerful Pei Dafu

257
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
chose both of you
as his trusted adopted sons.

258
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,920
This Capital is truly a place

259
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,070
that devours people
without spitting out their bones.

260
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,380
No wonder Mother

261
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
tried everything to keep me away

262
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
from a land of chaos.

263
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,470
No wonder that when we first met,

264
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,800
you warned me,

265
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,630
saying this is the Capital,

266
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,990
and I shouldn't regret it.

267
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,630
Now, let me tell you.

268
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,830
I do regret it.

269
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,160
From the very beginning,

270
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,510
I should never have stepped
into this hellish place.

271
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,620
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been
schemed against

272
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,920
by all of you treacherous people.

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,160
Did he betray you?

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,590
I just got his feelings wrong,

275
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,870
bringing it all upon myself.

276
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,920
You're so heartbroken.

277
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,080
Is it only

278
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,630
because he lied to you?

279
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,520
Should I not be heartbroken?

280
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,040
If someone lies to me,

281
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,320
I'll only want to kill them.

282
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,590
Only when you lie to me,

283
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
I'll be heartbroken.

284
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,870
Are you trying to say

285
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,110
that I've truly fallen for him?

286
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,200
It was just an illusion.

287
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,680
Now that illusion has shattered,

288
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,240
everything

289
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,500
has returned to the starting point.

290
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,870
Do you remember

291
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,830
what you wanted the most

292
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,870
in the beginning?

293
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,120
Yes.

294
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,200
I wanted a home,

295
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,680
a place to come from,

296
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,470
and a place to return to.

297
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,320
Have you ever thought

298
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,670
that now,

299
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,860
you've gotten exactly what you wanted?

300
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,680
You have a mother,

301
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,040
and you're no longer a homeless orphan.

302
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,560
Chai Jing,

303
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,830
come with me.

304
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
From now on,

305
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,950
my home

306
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,590
will be your home.

307
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,590
Where are we going?

308
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,440
Let's leave this land of chaos

309
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,230
with Mother

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,400
and never return.

311
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,560
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

312
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,940
My mind is made up.
Please don't ask further.

313
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,550
However,

314
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,990
I once made a dear friend

315
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,920
in Danzhou.

316
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,580
She's an orphan named Chai Jing,

317
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,560
now living alone on the outskirts.

318
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,440
I want to take her with us.

319
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,660
As long as you're following your heart,

320
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,100
I will agree to everything.

321
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,600
I'll have the divorce letter

322
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,960
tomorrow.

323
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,430
Lingzhi.

324
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,720
Why aren't you asleep yet?

325
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,210
What about you?

326
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,520
Why are you sitting here drinking alone?

327
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,670
I lied

328
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,600
to someone.

329
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,240
Grandmother often tells me

330
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,150
that lying is bad.

331
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
So, I'm a bad person.

332
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Father, why did you lie?

333
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,480
At first, it was to protect myself,

334
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,520
but I didn't expect to hurt her.

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,190
I was wrong.

336
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,870
So, you just need
to admit your mistakes.

337
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,110
The world of adults

338
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,240
is not that simple.

339
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,560
I fear

340
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,520
she may never forgive me.

341
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,480
Uncle Feng also lied to me,

342
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,870
but he brought candied hawthorns
to apologize

343
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,430
and even lay on the ground
barking like a puppy.

344
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,670
So, I forgave him.

345
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,960
Father, you don't even want to try.

346
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,410
That shows you don't have any sincerity.

347
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
Lingzhi, do you even know
what sincerity is?

348
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,910
Of course, I know.

349
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,700
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

350
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,360
Father,

351
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,480
do you believe in cause and effect?

352
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,480
In hell, Yama King serves as a judge;

353
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,960
in the mortal world,
there is the Emperor for that.

354
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,430
Does it matter

355
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,490
whether I believe it or not?

356
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,670
If you don't believe it,

357
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,520
why use this incense every day

358
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,800
to suppress Grandfather's vengeful soul?

359
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,110
If I could choose,

360
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,240
I would rather not come to this world

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,280
to avoid this cycle.

362
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,520
But since I have come,

363
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,280
then I must live.

364
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,790
Even if

365
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,710
you think

366
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,240
I'm extremely guilty,

367
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,870
deceptive, cunning, and heartless,

368
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,520
it's only because

369
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,280
I want to survive.

370
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
Since that's the case,

371
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,520
write a divorce letter.

372
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,920
Is it what your mother wants?

373
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,520
Just write the divorce letter,

374
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,960
and Mother and I will leave the Capital.

375
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,430
Whether you're a criminal, a remnant,

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,560
or a powerful official,

377
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,830
it has nothing to do with us anymore.

378
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,150
As a child,

379
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,560
how can you separate your parents?

380
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,240
Mother has been trapped here
for half her life.

381
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,630
Can't you set her free now?

382
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,110
The most painful moments

383
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,680
of our family are over.

384
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,480
We can live in peace and harmony now.

385
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,920
Wouldn't that be good?

386
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,670
Stop deceiving yourself.

387
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,710
This family

388
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,480
has long been destroyed
by your own hands.

389
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,520
Your mother was my legally wedded wife.

390
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,040
She bore my surname,

391
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,150
entered my family tree,

392
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,190
and when we die,
we will be buried together.

393
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,520
Why

394
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,240
must you separate us?

395
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,840
You...

396
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,590
No need to talk to him anymore.

397
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,000
You can walk now.

398
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,190
With such good news,

399
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,960
why does your face look so frightened?

400
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,800
Aren't you happy for me?

401
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,800
Of course, I'm happy for you.

402
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,180
Was the imperial physician here
to treat your legs,

403
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,590
instead of looking after your health?

404
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,240
You must be worried

405
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,430
that from now on,

406
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,150
you won't be able to trap me
in the inner chambers anymore.

407
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,680
As for the divorce letter,

408
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,280
you have no choice but to write one.

409
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,030
Xiwen,

410
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,630
we've been married for 20 years.

411
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,590
Are you really so heartless?

412
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,000
Heartless?

413
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,040
Let's put aside the Pei faction for now.

414
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,040
Let me handle an old case for you.

415
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,080
Back then, my family fell in one night,

416
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,640
and Yuwen Chang'an was suddenly
reassigned away.

417
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,000
How did our marriage

418
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,510
come about?

419
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,670
What vile methods did you use?

420
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,830
You know all of this?

421
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,560
Back then, the Emperor asked my father

422
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,280
to draft a eulogy
in honor of the late Emperor,

423
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,310
and you took advantage of your position

424
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,560
to tamper with the eulogy,

425
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,350
which led to my father's
unjust punishment

426
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,760
and sudden death.

427
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,190
I regret that I was deceived by you

428
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,390
and married a beast like you.

429
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,110
Now in the court,

430
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,870
there are still my father's disciples.

431
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,040
If I bring up this case again
to clear his name,

432
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,240
I'll surely find some traces.

433
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,160
Can you imagine

434
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,480
what would happen to a hypocrite

435
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,960
who harms his teacher
and frames the upright?

436
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,720
That was because I loved you.

437
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,760
I didn't want you to marry someone else.

438
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,390
I can forgive you,

439
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,760
and I don't have to blame you.

440
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,390
As long as we didn't divorce,

441
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,000
whatever wish you had,

442
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,790
I would grant it.

443
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,480
My greatest wish in this life

444
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,590
is for you to die.

445
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,080
No, no.

446
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,430
After we married,
we had a few years of happiness.

447
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,440
We read books and brewed tea.

448
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,730
When I was punished by my father,

449
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,760
you personally bandaged my wounds.

450
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,560
You even made Yunni pastry for me.

451
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,110
Have you forgotten all that?

452
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,030
Do you know why I'm best

453
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,430
at making Yunni pastry?

454
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,440
Because it's Yuwen Chang'an's

455
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,480
favorite snack.

456
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,950
Let's go.

457
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,740
(Husband: Zhuang Shiyang)

458
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,660
(Husband: Zhuang Shiyang)

459
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,910
Madam.

460
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,030
We've shared a husband for years.

461
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,830
There's always some sisterly bond.

462
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,080
Why are you leaving
without saying goodbye to me?

463
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,860
The divorce letter has been signed.

464
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm no longer the madam.

465
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,350
Don't call me that anymore.

466
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,590
Are you really leaving?

467
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,090
Do you want me to stay?

468
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,190
Have you thought this through?

469
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,560
Once you leave the family
and the Capital,

470
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,430
you'll be nothing.

471
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,870
Yuwen Chang'an was dismissed,

472
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,680
you're not a lady anymore,

473
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,390
and the nobles won't accept Hanyan.

474
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,090
What exactly do you want?

475
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,150
If you knew what I wanted in this life,

476
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,320
you wouldn't have fought
with me for half of it.

477
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,800
You can still ask me this question,

478
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,060
so I won't waste more words on you.

479
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,040
Ms. Ruan, you're generous.

480
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,480
I truly didn't expect

481
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,520
that you could let go
of all those past grievances.

482
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,280
I've never really hated you.

483
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Do you believe me?

484
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,830
I only pity you

485
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,390
that you've wasted your prime years

486
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,040
in the Zhuang family

487
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,760
being manipulated

488
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,150
as a pawn.

489
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,670
Madam, since you're leaving,

490
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,240
must you turn me against the master?

491
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,040
You really are beyond saving.

492
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,480
This will be

493
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,150
our last meeting.

494
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,390
You think I'm beyond saving,

495
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,800
but I don't know why.

496
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,720
Please enlighten me.

497
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,480
Zhou Ruyin,

498
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
you were once a thorny bush

499
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,560
with the ability to stand on your own,

500
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,150
but you chose to pull out your thorns

501
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,480
and became

502
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,560
a parasitic plant.

503
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,280
You're even doing
the same thing to your daughter.

504
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,110
Isn't that pitiful?

505
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,480
Moreover, the one you're clinging to

506
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,110
is already a rotting piece of wood

507
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,920
eaten away by bugs,

508
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,000
unfit to withstand a blow,
weak and hollow,

509
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,520
and not even as strong as you are.

510
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,550
But you never dared to believe

511
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,570
that you had the power
to grow independently.

512
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,240
Isn't that beyond saving?

513
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,760
That's all I have to say.
Take care of yourself.

514
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,520
Nanny Chen, escort her out.

515
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,520
Miss Hanyan,

516
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,340
Mr. Fu wants to see you.

517
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,560
Mr. Fu, what else do you have to say?

518
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,920
Nothing much.

519
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,520
Just two words:

520
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,510
I'm sorry.

521
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,800
If that's all, please leave.

522
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,630
Regarding the adopted son,

523
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,350
there are a few things
I want to clarify.

524
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,190
You're a high-ranking official
in the Capital,

525
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,430
but I'm just a common woman now.

526
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,190
Moreover,

527
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,670
this has nothing to do with me.

528
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,520
You need not explain anything to me.

529
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,110
I do not seek your forgiveness,

530
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,830
but I don't want you to leave
with misunderstandings.

531
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,140
Whether there's a misunderstanding,

532
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,390
it no longer matters.

533
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,480
After all of this,

534
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,350
no matter your hidden intentions,

535
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,040
I will always

536
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,590
remember your kindness.

537
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,520
You helped me during the Danzhou case

538
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
and Chai Jing's imprisonment,

539
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,910
so I didn't end up
with the worst result.

540
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,320
After this curtsy,

541
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,720
we are even

542
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,910
without debts or grudges.

543
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,670
Zhuang Hanyan.

544
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,630
Do you still remember

545
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,830
the kite I gave you on New Year's Eve?

546
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,670
Of course.

547
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,910
I gave you the kite without the string

548
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,000
because I didn't want to bind you.

549
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,510
If a kite can only soar

550
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,670
when tethered by a string,

551
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,240
then it would be better
to fall to the earth,

552
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,670
leaving behind
only a lingering fragrance.

553
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,480
That too is a kind of freedom.

554
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,000
This is what my heart has longed for
in this life.

555
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,950
Perhaps,

556
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,220
it is also what your heart seeks today.

557
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,750
♪Open my eyes in this life♪

558
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,760
I fear that after today,

559
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,040
we may never meet again.

560
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,150
I wish you freedom from now on,

561
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,040
no longer a lone goose
flying north in winter.

562
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,720
Thank you.

563
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,720
From this day forward,

564
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,240
we shall go our separate ways.

20 years ago, I entered this door,

573

never imagining that I'd only

574
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,040
break free from this cage today.

575
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,390
When I returned home,

576
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,830
I never thought

577
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,040
that one day,

578
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,150
I would walk out

579
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,430
with you

580
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,280
and never come back.

581
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,190
Xiwen,

582
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,000
we can set off now.

583
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,840
Don't worry.

584
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,790
Mr. Yuwen has hired people

585
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,800
to safely escort us out of the Capital.

586
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,800
You go pick up your friend.

587
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,720
Let's meet at the Shili Stop
on the outskirts.

588
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,080
Okay.

589
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,590
Mr. Yuwen,

590
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,590
take care of yourself and Mother.

591
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,840
Don't worry.

592
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,270
We're leaving then.

(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

594
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,480
Miss,

595
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,040
this harness doesn't fit well.

596
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,110
Please wait a moment.

597
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,560
I'll fix it.

598
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,750
Sir,

599
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,110
you seem unfamiliar.

600
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,480
You're one of our coachmen.

601
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
I'm from the carriage service you hired.

602
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,110
We have two carriages at home,

603
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,320
so why were you hired?

604
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,000
I don't know.

605
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,550
Maybe one of the masters

606
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,830
also needs to go out today.

607
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,870
Miss, what's wrong?

608
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,270
Sir,

609
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,070
can I borrow a horse from you?

610
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,430
Wait here.

611
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,340
(Shili Stop)

612
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,190
I've waited for 20 years

613
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,520
for today.

614
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,190
Finally, it's come.

615
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,430
I don't know why,

616
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,080
but my heart is always uneasy.

617
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,520
It feels like a dream.

618
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,180
I fear that when I wake up
from the dream,

619
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,590
I will lose everything before me.

620
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,520
Isn't life also like a big dream?

621
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,560
I only hope for a moment of joy
in this dream,

622
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,760
so that when I wake up,

623
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,150
I'll have no regrets in this life.

624
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,800
Mr. Yuwen,

625
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,450
thank you for waiting for me
all these years.

626
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,670
You still call me Mr. Yuwen?

627
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,520
It should be as before.

628
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
You should call me

629
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,840
Chang'an.

630
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,840
Chang'an.

631
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,240
Don't worry.

632
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,150
Though I'm not Hanyan's
biological father,

633
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,840
I will fulfill the responsibilities
of a father.

634
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,030
In the future,

635
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,560
I will try to make up

636
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,950
for the regrets

637
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,150
in her life.

638
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,230
You don't have to do this.

639
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,030
Xiwen,

640
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm willing to be

641
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,560
your harbor for the rest of your lives.

642
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,790
When the storm comes,

643
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,590
I'll provide shelter and refuge.

644
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,150
When times are peaceful,

645
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,790
we'll travel

646
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,920
the world together,

647
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,230
seeing the beauty of the world,

648
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,510
without concern for any directions.

649
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,510
Alright.

650
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,360
Enough with those promises.

651
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,000
Let's see how well I do in the future.

652
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,730
We're having ginger
and vinegar fish today.

653
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,440
I know you never liked it,

654
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,040
but it's my favorite.

655
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,110
I think

656
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
this ham

657
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,840
is cooked differently from other places.

658
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,150
Try it again.

659
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,150
Is it different?

660
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,560
I just tasted it,

661
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,790
and it still tastes like
the homemade flavor I've had before.

662
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,000
Are you feeling unwell?

663
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,590
Stop it. The dish is poisoned.

664
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,670
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,400
This dish is poisoned.

666
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,110
It was him?

667
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,080
I'm sorry.

668
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,310
We've eaten quite a bit.

669
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,590
It's too late.

670
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,670
It's fine.

671
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,110
Xiwen,

672
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,230
today is our wedding feast.

673
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,520
In this life,

674
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,230
we only have this chance.

675
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,110
How could we stop eating?

676
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,150
Come on.

677
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,080
Let's eat.

678
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,280
Xiwen.

679
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,320
Xiwen.

680
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,480
Are you alright?

681
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,630
I'm fine.

682
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,190
I just want to look at you a bit longer.

683
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,590
Alright.

685
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,040
You must've put a lot of thought
into these things.

686
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,710
I really like them.

687
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,880
I'm glad you like them.

688
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,000
In this life,

689
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,710

with putting in a little effort?

693
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,400
Let me look at you again.

694
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,270
Let's perform the wedding ceremony.

695
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,920
After the ceremony, we'll be married,

696
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,230
regardless of death.

697
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,670
Even if we go to the underworld,

698
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,440
we can walk hand in hand.

699
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,000
Alright.

700
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,180

I, Ruan Xiwen,
take Yuwen Chang'an as my husband,

707

as proof of my sincerity.

708
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,630
First, bow to heaven and earth.

709
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,560
Second, bow to the parents.

710
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,230

we've become husband and wife.

Even if we go to the underworld,

720
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,560
we will

always stay together.

I'm not afraid.

723
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,440
You shouldn't be afraid either.

00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,790

that no matter what,

797
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,590

802
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,560
leave me,

803
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,560

Zhuang Shiyang,

805
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,270
I'm afraid you'll never understand

806
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,310
what true love is.

807
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,360
I don't understand it,

808
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,920
but you don't understand me either.

809
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,400
From my parents

810
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,670
to my wife and children,

811
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,150
who truly loved me?

812
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,550
You should not blame me.

813
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,080
I gave my heart,

814
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,360
but it was never returned.

815
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,560
Even if you married me

816
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,080
and bore me a daughter,

817
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,400
I know you love Yuwen Chang'an.

818
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,190
If not for your legs being broken,

819
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,760
your muscles severed,

820
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,810
and you've been confined
to a wheelchair for years,

821
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,110
I'm afraid

822
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,750
you would've long eloped with him.

823
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,000
You don't deserve to mention his name.

824
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,790
He is a gentleman of integrity,

825
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,190
while you are a shameless wretch.

826
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,040
He's always better than you.

827
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,360
When the poison took effect,

828
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,880
did he suffer?

829
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,040
Did that ginger and vinegar fish

830
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,560
suit his taste?

831
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,110
You don't like ginger and vinegar,

832
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,590
so that dish was specially made
for Yuwen Chang'an.

833
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,840
He'd secretly been gathering
evidence of my crimes,

834
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,960
planning to kill me.

835
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,000
How could I possibly let him off?

836
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,750
I was sure

837
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,000
that after he ate the fish,

838
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,230
he'd die in agony

839
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,030
to avenge

840
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,790

841
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,520
Xiwen,

842
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,880
you know too many of my secrets.

843
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,310
If I let you go,

844
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,590
how can I sleep in peace again?

845
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,520

846
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,840

853
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,560
Do you really want to kill me?

854

Xiwen,

855
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,630
have you never loved me,
even a little bit?

856
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,040
My greatest wish in this life

857
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,590

and left behind maps and books

956
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,040
to help us become wealthy
and powerful

957
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,840
and maintain peace.

958
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,750

We deserve to die a thousand deaths.

962
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,190
I deserve to die a thousand deaths.

963
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,670
Your Majesty, I have a bold advice.

964
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,710
I have an excellent memory,

965
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,670
once served Ma Fei'ao,
the Western scholar,

966
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,080
and worked with him to compile

967
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,110
the Comprehensive Encyclopedia
and the world map.

968
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,920
Now, I remember over 90% of it.

969
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,400
I am willing to atone for my sins

970
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,190

971
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:04,040

972
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,360
Your Majesty,
please allow me to do this.

973
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,710
My life is insignificant,

974
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,630
but rewriting and restoring the books

975
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,040
is a matter of national importance.

976
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,790
To prevent further schemes,

977
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,480
I dare to request an imperial decree

978
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,000
to appoint a trusted general

979
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,670
