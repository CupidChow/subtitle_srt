1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I really don't know.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Father, haber gorilla live for me.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No kidding.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If I touch it,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
are you going to kill me?

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Father, what are this?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's food?!

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Never mind it.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
?!

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You've had enough.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now it's time for the test!

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you know what is called havingæ·· going far away?

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No!

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Now, the party is all under the charge of the Fu Chao Qing.

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,600
We have to kill him.

45
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,800
It's hard for the next step to take us to the capital.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Yes.

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,400
I don't want to help.

48
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,200
I really can't open my mouth.

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
Mr. Zhuang.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,000
I have 70-year-old mother and a child.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,400
It's a long way from the imperial court.

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I really can't read it.

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Mr. Zhuang.

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
No, no, no.

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,800
Mr. Zhuang, help.

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm used to killing.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Mr. Zhuang, help.

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Mr. Zhuang, help.

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Mr. Zhuang, help me.

60
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,200
I've been taken by the good thing of your company.

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,600
It's hard to get married at night.

62
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm...

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,600
You don't have to drink.

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
It's hard to protect yourself.

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
What are you holding?

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Yes.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
It's just a painting.

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,200
This is the true story of the imperial court.

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
It's worth the money.

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
It's so precious.

71
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Since Pei Zhang Yin entered the imperial prison,

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
that Gu Ye in our family

73
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
has been in the capital for a while.

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Every time he comes to our door,

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I feel so sorry for him.

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I always feel that it's not normal

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
to come to lock the door.

78
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Now he's in the imperial prison.

79
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I feel so sorry for him.

80
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
No matter what,

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
it's just a painting.

82
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Compared to the car and land in the left bank,

83
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
no one will care about it.

84
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I can't afford it.

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,200
We can't die in this painting.

86
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
It's late.

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Master, why don't you take a rest?

88
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I'll think about it tomorrow.

89
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Ru Yan, you go back to rest first.

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Let me rest.

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Yes, master.

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Why did he give you this painting?

93
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I was in the imperial court that year.

94
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I asked the courtier to take it.

95
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Pei Zhang Yin, he's a relative of my nephew.

96
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
So he asked me to take it.

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
It's a big deal.

98
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Master, I know that I'm guilty.

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Please forgive me for my behavior.

100
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I've been sick for years.

101
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Pei Zhang Yin has been in the imperial prison for a long time.

102
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
He's been looking for me.

103
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I dare not do it again.

104
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Get up and talk.

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
There's no reason for you to kneel.

106
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I've been in the capital for many years.

107
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
This is a long-standing thing.

108
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
If we're going to investigate it,

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm afraid that Zhao Yu can't do it.

110
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
No one can support the imperial court.

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
The whole capital will be in trouble.

112
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
So you mean...

113
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
we're not going to investigate it?

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
The Dali Temple is still in the mountain.

115
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
I don't think it's going to happen.

116
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Pei Zhang Yin is a relative of my nephew.

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
What's the big deal?

118
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
We're going to investigate it.

119
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
It's a national emergency.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
No need to be in trouble.

122
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
It's not a problem.

123
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Pei Zhang Yin has been in the capital for many years.

124
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
He should have paid for the country.

125
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,200
But the Dali Temple is still in the mountain.

126
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
It's much more powerful than the Lianli Temple.

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
It must be strange.

128
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Now we're trying our best to investigate

129
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
the crime he committed.

130
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
That's good.

131
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I've known him for many years.

132
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
He's just a small person.

133
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,200
He's never involved in such a big thing.

134
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Please take care of it.

135
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Mo Mo Mo,

136
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I'll take care of it.

137
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Please take care of it.

138
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
If there's any problem,

139
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
I'll give you a few more points.

140
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Do you think it's good?

141
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
It's good.

142
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Thank you.

143
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I'll take care of it.

144
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Take care, Mr. Zhuang.

145
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Please take care of it.

146
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Okay.

147
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Mo Mo.

148
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Mo Mo.

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Are you coming out or am I going to catch you?

150
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Miss San.

151
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Miss San, you're here tonight.

152
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Is there anything urgent?

153
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
The Dali Temple is still in the mountain.

154
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Why don't you go to the Dali Temple?

155
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
You're going to the Dali Temple?

156
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Why don't you guess it?

157
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Su Wen's brother-in-law is very clever.

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
He won't do anything impolite.

159
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Unless,

160
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,200
the Dali Temple is just a prince.

161
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,200
He's a private investigator.

162
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
You heard it?

163
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
What happened next?

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
It's a big problem.

165
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
You were watching the whole city.

166
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,200
So you're going to stand up and hide.

167
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
How do you think

168
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,200
the Dali Temple is related to the Dali Temple?

169
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
The Dali Temple has a port,

170
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
a port of the sea,

171
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
a valley,

172
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
a city,

173
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
and a city.

174
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
If I have a piece of

175
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
ungrateful money,

176
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
it's a good idea

177
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
to leave it to the Dali Temple.

178
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Miss San, you're so wise.

179
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
But it's all because of

180
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
the uncle's advice from the Dali Temple.

181
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I just want to know

182
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
what's your purpose in hiding it?

183
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
When we first met,

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Miss San told me a story.

185
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
She said your uncle in Danzhou

186
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
loved you so much.

187
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
He told you how you grew up

188
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
without worries and happiness in Danzhou.

189
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I heard a lot about the Danzhou

190
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
before.

191
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Why don't you tell me

192
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,200
a story about Miss San?

193
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Just tell me.

194
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
17 years ago,

195
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
there was a carriage

196
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
carrying a girl

197
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
from the capital

198
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
in a half-dark city.

199
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
She was a girl

200
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
who was changed by the city.

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
She was driven out of the house

202
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
by the monster.

203
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
She was raised in Danzhou's

204
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
same-sex family.

205
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
The capital would be

206
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
high-ranking and rich,

207
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
but she never got her hands on it.

208
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Shen Shen is a blind man.

209
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
He is full of words

210
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,200
and is arrogant.

211
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
But compared to that,

212
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
men in the family

213
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
are more terrible.

214
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
His uncle

215
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
is a low-ranking and poor man.

216
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,800
He is lonely and

217
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
has a hard time every night.

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
He even makes his girl

219
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
recite the old-fashioned

220
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
script of his daughter.

221
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
He is a wrong person.

222
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
He doesn't sleep

223
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
and doesn't get up.

224
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
He was in trouble at home.

225
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
In that small village,

226
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
he was also a victim of the 70s.

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Everyone calls him a beggar.

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
He has always been playful

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
and naughty.

230
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
He always pushed her down the street.

231
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
He took her shoes off

232
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
and made her walk with her feet.

233
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
17 years ago,

234
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
the enemy in the capital

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
was so envious of her.

236
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
She grew up one day

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
and finally

238
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
had the strength to fight back.

239
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
She finally

240
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
killed her enemy by herself.

241
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
She fled from Danzhou

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
and returned to the capital.

243
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
One is a tiger-dead and a tiger-dead murderer.

244
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
The other is a woman who is in the world.

245
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Miss.

246
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,200
These two stories are true and false.

247
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I wonder where

248
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
these rumors come from.

249
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
How do I know the truth?

250
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
It's late at night.

251
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
You should rest early.

252
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I'll take my leave.

253
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Mr. Fu, please take care.

254
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
You don't know the truth.

255
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
What are these scars?

256
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Miss.

257
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Get out of the way.

258
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
No.

259
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Let me go.

260
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Mr. Fu.

261
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
What do you want to do?

262
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Even if I make a mistake,

263
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
you ruined the house

264
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
and entered our house.

265
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
You knew that

266
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Zhuang Yushan was so obsessed with you

267
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
but you still tried to

268
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
make her suffer

269
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
and make her suffer.

270
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
What on earth do you want?

271
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
If you want to kill her,

272
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
what is the purpose?

273
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
If you want to catch me,

274
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
you can take all your doubts

275
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
and evidence

276
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
and take it to the Dali Temple.

277
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
But you can't trust me.

278
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I want to tell you that

279
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
your lies are not worth watching.

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
As long as you have a new person

281
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
to investigate,

282
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
you can make a decision.

283
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I hope you remember

284
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
that the real liar

285
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
is not lying.

295
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Sir,

296
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
you assigned me

297
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
before you go to Danzhou.

298
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,880
If you see the name of Duan Tian in the city,

299
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,440
send Jiang Zitiao to the candle

300
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,040
and send him to Miss San's place.

301
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,560
Do you remember that?

302
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,880
You did a good job.

303
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,560
Why didn't you tell Miss San

304
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,040
that you were so worried about her?

305
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
It sounds like a demon's spell.

306
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,080
Don't say it.

307
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,600
How do you know

308
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,000
that she will come to the capital?

309
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You finally can't run away

310
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
in the name of hersoft flower.

311
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,040
If you want to harm her,

312
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,080
you should look for rice customer.

313
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,000
Since you have any initial feelings about her,

314
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,880
I Ğ²ÑĞ¾Ğ´ information on it specifically,

315
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,720
why not just suggest it out before sailing?

316
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,360
Maybe.

317
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,000
I find it really smart.

318
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
Even a sissy like that

319
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
can yahht this show showers.

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,360
I can't think of any new clothes.

321
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,320
She left with the defense.

322
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,880
This is not a real matter.

324
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,840
Even if you go to Danzhou

325
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,560
to investigate Pei Dafu's personal property,

326
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
he can guess it.

327
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,000
I have some surprises, too.

328
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,840
He actually thought of this.

329
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,000
By the way,

330
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,680
Pei Dafu has been in the capital for a while.

331
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,800
Should we also

332
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,840
investigate the progress

333
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
and report it to the Dali Temple?

334
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,120
Do we have to report it?

335
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,120
What do you mean?

336
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
If the mastermind

337
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
makes the family rich,

338
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,600
Liu Chen and I

339
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,120
willæ¬ take home

340
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,780
what you and Mu Feng

341
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,320
share their own experience.

342
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,560
Can you yeah that?

343
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Lord

344
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,000
are you serious?

345
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,840
Of course.

346
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,600
Lord

347
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,840
I have followed you for years.

348
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,200
You don't put too much money on me.

349
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,500
King how could you put the phone

350
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I have to do it for Ah Zhi's future.

351
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
But, sir,

352
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
you want to find a woman who has the right to be a part of your family,

353
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
and you want to make a living by doing business.

354
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Is something wrong?

355
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Just now, I said it as if I didn't say it.

356
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
It's late. Go back and rest.

357
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Yes, sir.

358
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
She's really good at making a living.

359
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
She's always been so mean to Fuyun Xi.

360
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
But she's been doing business for the night.

361
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
And she's still so innocent.

362
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Miss, you should go to bed early.

363
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Qianyuan,

364
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
go to the South Hill Hospital tomorrow morning.

365
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
South Hill Hospital?

366
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I heard that there are several people who have been treated.

367
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
The entire hospital has been closed for many days.

368
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Go find a pillow.

369
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I want the people who have been treated.

370
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
This...

371
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Miss, this...

372
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
The blood of the flowers.

373
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Once it's on the top,

374
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
it's hard to cure.

375
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Even if it's a fully recovered cure,

376
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
the face will be completely healed.

377
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I don't believe it.

378
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Even if she's Fuyun Xi,

379
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
she'll still be angry with her.

380
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Miss, this...

381
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
What?

382
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
You don't want to help me?

383
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
This...

384
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
What?

385
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
You don't want to help me?

386
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
The hospital is closed for many days.

387
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
The blood of the flowers.

388
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
The blood of the flowers.

389
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
The blood of the flowers.

390
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
The blood of the flowers.

391
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
The blood of the flowers.

392
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
The blood of the flowers.

393
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
The blood of the flowers.

394
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
The blood of the flowers.

395
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
The blood of the flowers.

396
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
The blood of the flowers.

397
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
The blood of the flowers.

398
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
The blood of the flowers.

399
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
The blood of the flowers.

400
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
The blood of the flowers.

401
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
The blood of the flowers.

402
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
The blood of the flowers.

403
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
The blood of the flowers.

404
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
The blood of the flowers.

405
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
The blood of the flowers.

406
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
The blood of the flowers.

407
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
The blood of the flowers.

408
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
The blood of the flowers.

409
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
The blood of the flowers.

410
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
The blood of the flowers.

411
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
The blood of the flowers.

412
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
The blood of the flowers.

413
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yushan.

414
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
What's happened?

415
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
The CASA nodule was moved.

416
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,800
I have checked it earlier.

417
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,500
The candidate from Tangi's hospital

418
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
used it for the disease.

419
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
The disease?

420
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It's her birth maid.

421
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
That's all?

422
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
How?

423
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Take the baby to the hospital first.

424
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
You go to the South Mountain Hospital.

425
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Help me find some Dou Jia from the Tianhua patient.

426
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Dou Jia?

427
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
You go first.

428
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I'll talk to you later.

429
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Okay.

430
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I wish you a happy new year.

431
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I wish you a happy new year.

432
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
You're so lucky.

433
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Good.

434
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm glad you like it.

435
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I like it.

436
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I heard from Baochuan that

437
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
you want to be a butterfly.

438
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
But you're afraid of being wasted.

439
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Yushan has been living for half a year.

440
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
She chose a beautiful place

441
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
for you.

442
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Please come to the wood.

443
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
How can this work?

444
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm old.

445
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I can live in the East.

446
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Why should I be so stupid?

447
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Baochuan,

448
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I'll just mention

449
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
your daughter.

450
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Why are you so confused?

451
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Mother, take it.

452
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
It's your size.

453
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
It won't fall off.

454
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Look at this.

455
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Take it, mother.

456
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
It's all sister's heart.

457
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I like it.

458
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I like it.

459
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
The fabric is so good.

460
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Really?

461
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
It's good for your work.

462
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
It's good for your skin color.

463
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Good night to mother.

464
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Sister San,

465
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
why are you holding your hand?

466
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
It's my first time to go home for New Year.

467
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I don't know the rules.

468
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Today,

469
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm going to give mother a gift.

470
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It's okay.

471
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
It's good that you're here.

472
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Mother, forgive me.

473
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
I'll prepare a new year's gift

474
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
for mother another day.

475
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Okay.

476
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I spent a lot of money.

477
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Exactly.

478
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
It's been a long time.

479
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It's so good.

480
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
The fabric is so good.

481
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
I've never seen such a good-looking leather.

482
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Sister San,

483
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
what do you mean?

484
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
The cold salt is normal.

485
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
There is no cold in the winter.

486
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Mother,

487
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
why don't you give this lake to the cold salt?

488
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
You have a thick skin.

489
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
You don't only have to hold your hand.

490
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
You also have to run away.

491
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Mother, look at her.

492
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
The cold salt is normal.

493
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
You're crazy.

494
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
I made this leather for mother.

495
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
What kind of face are you?

496
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Take it off.

497
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Mother.

498
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
It's the first time I've ever

499
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
asked mother for something.

500
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Mother, just give it to me.

501
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Don't be a fool.

502
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
No one eats your food.

503
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Take it off.

504
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Take it off.

505
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
I'll take it off.

506
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
I'll call my mother.

507
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Don't take it off.

508
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Mother, look at her.

509
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Mother, it's enough.

510
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Don't make a scene.

511
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
It hurts my head.

512
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Since Han Ye likes it so much,

513
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
give it a try.

514
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Mother.

515
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Enough.

516
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Go back.

517
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Thank you, mother.

518
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Mother.

519
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Go back.

520
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
It's been a long time.

521
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Enough.

522
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Go back.

523
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Mother.

524
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Thank God, the bracelet is not visible.

525
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
This is the Heavenly Flower Fight Club.

526
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
What do you want to do?

527
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I've heard a way.

528
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
The name is Bimiao-zhong-dou.

529
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
It's to imitate the powder of the Heavenly Flower Fight Club

530
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
and blow into the nose.

531
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
It's so sensitive that the Heavenly Flower is very light.

532
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
It won't hurt the root of the life.

533
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
After the fight,

534
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
it can be free from the Heavenly Flower.

535
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Why?

536
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Someone said something to me last night.

537
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
It makes sense.

538
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
He said,

539
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
you're a really good liar.

540
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,500
It's not a lie to lie to others.

541
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
You're so stingy.

542
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Since he insisted on hurting me,

543
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I'll let him succeed.

544
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
You go and help me do something.

545
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Okay.

546
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
You go to the South Mountain Hospital again.

547
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Since the needle in the Heavenly Flower Fight Club

548
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
can be used,

549
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
there must be someone who can help.

550
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
I don't want to be left behind by Second Sister.

551
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
I don't need to worry about it.

552
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Han Yan wants to know the truth.

553
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
How could he do this?

554
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
He grew up in the country.

555
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
I'm not a fool.

556
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm not a fool.

557
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
You said a daughter is so stingy.

558
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
She'll be a joke

559
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
when she goes out in the future.

560
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
There's still some time

561
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
before the New Year's Day.

562
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Master, Madam.

563
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Third Miss seems to be sick.

564
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
She's sick again?

565
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
She's got a cold again?

566
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I didn't dare to go in.

567
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
It looks like the Heavenly Flower.

568
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Master, Madam.

569
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Dr. Wu from the South Mountain Hospital is here.

570
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
What is he doing here?

571
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
He said that someone had been infected with the Heavenly Flower.

572
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
He came to save people.

573
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I didn't dare to let him in.

574
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Is it your colleague

575
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
who sent people to get the doctor?

576
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
I don't know about that.

577
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Forget it.

578
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Dr. Wu, Dr. Wu.

579
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
What's wrong?

580
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I'm sorry.

581
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
I'm sorry.

582
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Why are you so sick?

583
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Master, Dr. Wu is here.

584
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Dr. Wu,

585
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
please hurry up.

586
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
She's my third daughter.

587
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Master, don't worry.

588
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
I'll go in here.

589
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Thank you.

590
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
What disease did I get?

591
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm afraid that

592
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
the Heavenly Flower is infected.

593
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
I've been out for days.

594
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Why is the Heavenly Flower infected?

595
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,500
What's the meaning of the three Miss's rooms?

596
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Dr. Wu,

597
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
what's the meaning of the three of you?

598
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm not sure.

599
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm just a little worried.

600
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
I'm just a little worried.

601
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm just a little worried.

602
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm just a little worried.

603
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
What's the meaning of the three of you?

604
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Have you ever met

605
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
any creatures?

606
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
For example,

607
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
a pillow.

608
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I've got a letter from you today.

609
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm so worried.

610
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Dr. Wu, this is the letter.

611
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Can I take a look?

612
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Miss,

613
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
don't worry.

614
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
I'll go and get the medicine for you.

615
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

616
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Miss.

617
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Yushan,

618
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
you did it.

619
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Miss,

620
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
what did Dr. Wu say?

621
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Why didn't he come back?

622
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
It's really you.

623
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Tell me about it.

624
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
I can help you.

625
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
I...

626
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I...

627
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
I...

628
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
I...

629
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
I asked Cui Yun to go to the South Hill Hospital

630
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
and bought a pillow for the hospital.

631
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
It's in her pocket.

632
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
You're so stupid.

633
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
How could you let a girl do this?

634
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I...

635
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Miss, I really know I was wrong.

636
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
I was just angry at the head.

637
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Who knows

638
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
why the nurse in the hospital

639
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
was so upset?

640
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
I heard that the doctor in the South Hill Hospital

641
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
was in a bad mood.

642
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
So I asked Cui Yun to go out.

643
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I've lost my mind.

644
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Where's Cui Yun's girl?

645
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Call her back.

646
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Miss,

647
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
I did this for Cui Yun.

648
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Lang'er was kicked out of the house.

649
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I can't let her go out

650
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
to apologize to anyone.

651
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
You're still so stupid.

652
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
She's a slave.

653
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Your life is important.

654
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Her life is important.

655
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
I've been watching her for a long time.

656
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Although she's a slave,

657
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
I've given her a lot of money

658
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
to go out of town.

659
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
You can't find her.

660
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
You...

661
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
How is it?

662
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Is it a flower?

663
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,500
This is a rare thing.

664
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
What's the meaning of Dr. Wu?

665
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I was just trying to catch Xiao Tong

666
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
to apologize to her.

667
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
I heard that there was a maid in the mansion.

668
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
She bought a pillow

669
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
that was used by a swan.

670
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I was so hurried

671
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
that I was still in a hurry.

672
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
You mean someone

673
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
killed Han Yan?

674
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Who's that girl?

675
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
She's trying to kill the master.

676
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
This girl is Cui Yun.

677
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
I didn't find her

678
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
in Miss San's room.

679
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
But on this

680
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
winged dress,

681
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
I found the flower-pulled family.

682
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
I think it's also

683
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
the master of our mansion.

684
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
This is the mountain.

685
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
It's the one that gave me the ball.

686
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
This is all because of the mansion.

687
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
If you have any report,

688
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
I won't be sorry.

689
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Dr. Wu, you're too serious.

690
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Or

691
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
you should hurry to get Han Yan's medicine.

692
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
There are many people in the capital.

693
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Don't be so serious about it.

694
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I understand.

695
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I'll go back to the clinic to get the medicine.

696
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

697
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Shu Hong,

698
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
go get the medicine with Dr. Wu.

699
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Yes.

700
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Where is Miss San?

701
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Master,

702
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I brought her here.

703
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Lv Shan, kneel down.

704
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
You can say it yourself.

705
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Divide the money and the consequences.

706
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Then you can ask father for forgiveness.

707
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I did it.

708
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
It's not a good idea.

709
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
You can punish me if you want.

710
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
You...

711
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
You're so impulsive.

712
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,500
I've liked my brother since I was a kid.

713
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
You insisted on marrying

714
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
my big sister.

715
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
I haven't been willing to get married

716
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
for so many years.

717
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
You should know why.

718
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
What does this have to do with this?

719
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Since my sister's family was back,

720
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
she's been so close to my brother.

721
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
She's determined to fight with me.

722
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
I can't tolerate her.

723
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Lv Shan,

724
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
I've asked myself.

725
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
I've never treated you well.

726
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Even if you can't tolerate the cold,

727
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
why did you come to hurt me?

728
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
What's the meaning of this?

729
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
I've never hurt you.

730
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
You...

731
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Stop talking nonsense.

732
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Let me ask you.

733
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Where did you get the flower

734
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
from the butterfly you gave me?

735
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Father, what are you talking about?

736
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
What do you mean?

737
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
I didn't hear it.

738
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Master,

739
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,500
that butterfly is a flower made by Lv Shan.

740
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
It also has the best quality in the capital.

741
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
It's made specially for the grandmother.

742
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
How could it be so soft and fluffy?

743
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Go and ask Dr. Hu yourself.

744
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I can't control this family.

745
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Little girl.

746
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Little girl.

747
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Master,

748
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Miss San is here.

749
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
She's not well.

750
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Why did she come here?

751
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
She insisted on coming.

752
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I can't do anything about it.

753
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Haiyan,

754
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
what are you doing?

755
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Father,

756
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,500
I want to go back to the Danzhou.

757
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I can't stay here anymore.

758
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
What are you talking about?

759
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
I've already made a decision.

760
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
It's like I said goodbye to my father and grandmother.

761
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I won't come back to the capital again.

762
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
If father misses his daughter,

763
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
he can send her to Danzhou.

764
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Aunt Sun,

765
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
go and help Miss San.

766
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Help Miss San?

767
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
You're so ill.

768
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Stop making trouble.

769
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Go back to your room and rest.

770
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Don't keep talking about it.

771
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Since I came back,

772
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
I've been living in a poor family.

773
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
I'm living in a bad house today.

774
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
I'm living in a house without face.

775
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
How can you blame me for this?

776
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
If you didn't take the balloon,

777
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,500
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble again.

778
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
It's good that you're healthy.

779
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I should take it.

780
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Aunt Sun,

781
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
don't take me in.

782
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
I can go by myself.

783
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Thank you, Miss San.

784
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Miss San,

785
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
what do you mean by that?

786
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
What do you mean by that?

787
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
You deserve it.

788
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Aunt Sun, stop asking.

789
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Zhuang Han Yan,

790
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
you're clear about it.

791
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Why would the balloon be in the wind?

792
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
There's a flower-like house.

793
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Did you put it on yourself?

794
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Yes.

795
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
I put it on myself.

796
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
I have nothing to do with you.

797
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Miss San, you're right.

798
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
It's like a gift from Yushan.

799
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Wait.

800
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
I think it's weird.

801
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
If you had to hide from me

802
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
in the morning,

803
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
you would have known

804
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,500
that there's a flower-like house in the wind.

805
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Aunt Sun, stop asking.

806
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
It's all Han Yan's fault.

807
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Han Yan,

808
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
tell me what's in your mind.

809
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
You'll be the eldest in the family.

810
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Han Yan has no problem.

811
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It's just that

812
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
he's a real man.

813
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
But I've been a coward for years.

814
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
I'm afraid that

815
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
he'll be sick again

816
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
and his father will be in trouble.

817
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
He'll be blamed for everything.

818
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Han Yan doesn't want to be killed.

819
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
You mean someone is going to hurt me?

820
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
This is a chance to get rid of the coward.

821
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,500
And then get rid of him.

822
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Han Yan,

823
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Han Yan has no problem.

824
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Aunt Sun,

825
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
don't be so pitiful to him.

826
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
He just wants to get rid of the coward.

827
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Don't worry, sister.

828
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Han Yan will never come back.

829
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Sister Zhuang'er and her husband

830
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
have a family of their own.

831
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,500
They've been together for a long time.

832
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Zhuang Han Yan,

833
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
you're so mean.

834
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
You're talking for me.

835
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
You're going to make me suffer.

836
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Sister,

837
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
no one will take their own life

838
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
and count others.

839
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
I didn't say you were a coward today.

840
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
If you still miss your sister,

841
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
please let me go.

842
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
You!

843
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Stop!

844
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Yun Shan!

845
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Yun Shan!

846
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
You're so mean!

847
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Han Yan.

848
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Come here!

849
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Get Miss Er'er down.

850
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Bring her back to the room.

851
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
No, Miss Er'er.

852
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
I didn't touch her.

853
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
She fell down by herself.

854
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
Shut up!

855
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Mother,

856
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
come here.

857
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Bring Miss Er'er back to the room.

858
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
No,

859
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
she fell down by herself.

860
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
No, Han Yan.

861
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
She didn't fall down.

862
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Don't worry, father.

863
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Father,

864
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Han Yan loves me.

865
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Please stay away from me.

866
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Han Yan,

867
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
why did you

868
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
do that to your child?

869
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
If you found out that

870
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
the fox has a good temper,

871
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
why didn't you just say it?

872
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Han Yan is unwell.

873
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
I didn't want you to be

874
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
so rude to her.

875
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I was wrong.

876
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,500
I was wrong about you.

877
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Master,

878
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,500
please bring Miss Er'er back to the room.

879
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Don't stay in the palace anymore.

880
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Yun Shan is so mean to Han Yan.

881
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
I'm afraid she'll be in trouble again.

882
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Han Yan,

883
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
why don't you go to Yong Shou Hall?

884
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
From now on,

885
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
your food and drink

886
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
will be kept in the garden

887
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
and taken care of by yourself.

888
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Shiya,

889
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
do you think it's good?

890
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Han Yan,

891
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
she's been calling for a while.

892
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
She's not hiding from me, is she?

893
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
If I don't protect her,

894
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
where else can I send her to?

895
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Of course,

896
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
I'll take care of

897
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
my own daughter.

898
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Ximen,

899
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
what's your problem?

900
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
From now on,

901
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
you can go with me

902
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
to see him.

903
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Do you have any suggestions?

904
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
It's a good idea.

905
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
It's just that

906
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
I met my mother for the second time.

907
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I didn't expect

908
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
she'd suddenly appear

909
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,500
when I was in trouble.

910
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
This time,

911
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
the gate of the House of Pavilion

912
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
finally opened for me.

913
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I finally had the chance

914
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
to live with my mother

915
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
under a roof.

916
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,500
But when my mother's death was coming,

917
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
how can I

918
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
really get to know you?

919
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
I'm sorry.

920
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
I'm sorry.

921
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
I'm sorry.

922
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
I'm sorry.

923
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm sorry.

924
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
I'm sorry.

925
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
I'm sorry.

926
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
I'm sorry.

927
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I'm sorry.

928
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm sorry.

929
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
I'm sorry.

930
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm sorry.

931
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I'm sorry.

932
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I'm sorry.

933
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
I'm sorry.

934
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
I'm sorry.

935
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
I'm sorry.

936
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm sorry.

937
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I'm sorry.

938
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
I'm sorry.

939
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
I'm sorry.

940
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
I'm sorry.

941
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
I'm sorry.

942
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm sorry.

943
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
I'm sorry.

944
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I'm sorry.

945
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I'm sorry.

946
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm sorry.

947
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
My mother is different.

948
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Is it all right?

949
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
I don't think I'm timid.

950
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Miss San,

951
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
it's late.

952
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Give me the Marquis Marquis Long'sï¿½ï¿½cher book to make an appointment with me.

953
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
I tillg them earlier because

954
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm not supposed

955
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,100
to remove the book.

956
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,500
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

957
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
I'd better go.

958
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Miss San,

959
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
I am please.

960
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Please leave the doctor.

961
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,020
Miss Jilan.

962
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,900
Miss Jilan.

963
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,520
Lady Jilan,

964
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,620
ladies and gentlemen,

965
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,740
I have a ÑĞ°Ğ´ness for you.

966
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,940
Well, miss Jilan,

967
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,460
here comes Miss Jilan.

968
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,180
See you later.

969
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,120
Say thanks to my ma'am for meeting me,

970
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,420
Chano.

971
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,700
Mrs. Chan.

972
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,460
Miss.

973
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,700
Mom is a special oilå

974
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,580
for Hengdu Hospital here.

975
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,920
You can cure the flower, but you can't keep the heart.

976
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Try it.

977
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
Thank you for your concern, Mother.

978
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
And...

979
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,220
Mother, what's the meaning of this?

980
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,020
These materials have not yet been inspected in the manor.

981
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
It's a waste of money.

982
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,020
Go find a doctor in the wolf's den.

983
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,020
The rest of the materials are enough to eat for ten years.

984
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Not enough?

985
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,020
The carriage is ready for you.

986
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,020
You can leave while the sun is still up.

987
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,020
I'm not a good girl.

988
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
I don't understand.

989
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,020
Mother, where do you want me to go?

990
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,020
As long as I'm up tonight, don't appear before me again.

991
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,020
So where do you want me to go?

992
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Mother, why do you insist on driving me away?

993
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,020
This is not your home!

994
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,020
Your son is unwell.

995
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,020
You can't leave the house.

996
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,020
You can't hide your dirty tricks from them.

997
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
The house is full of people.

998
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
There's no home at all.

999
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
If you really have some intelligence,

1000
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
you can take the materials and leave.

1001
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
You can go to the husband and daughter-in-law.

1002
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
You can go to the Yunyou Jinshang.

1003
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,020
It's better to be so self-sufficient.

1004
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,020
You must be hungry and not hungry.

1005
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,020
I've never thought of fighting with others.

1006
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
I just want to ask Mother to love me.

1007
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,020
Now that I've changed my life, I'm in a high position.

1008
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,020
Why do you still want to ask me?

1009
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Even if you don't love me,

1010
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,020
aren't you afraid of getting involved in the matter?

1011
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,020
I'm sure I can give birth to you.

1012
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Thank you for your compliment.

1013
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,020
I'm not going to talk about my family.

1014
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,020
I've been saying this for countless times since I was a child.

1015
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,020
I look like my mother's youth.

1016
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,020
I'll take care of you one by one.

1017
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
I'll take care of you.

1018
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Since you insist on staying,

1019
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,020
I want to see how long you can love me.

1020
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
I'll take care of you.

1021
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:43,020
Who did she forget to be a woman?

1022
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:51,020
The night is dark, the sky is dark, and the fog is silent.

1023
00:42:51,020 --> 00:43:00,020
She has walked into this battlefield, and she has no way to break up.

1024
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:06,020
Love is a hate, and you don't have to ask.

1025
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:14,020
Who is a fake, who is a true, and why do you still need someone else?

1026
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,020
I'm afraid that I can't be a woman,

1027
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,020
and I can't be a woman.

1028
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:29,020
Who can be a woman?

1029
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:37,020
She has walked into this battlefield, and she has no way to break up.

1030
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:45,020
Love is a hate, and you don't have to ask.

1031
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:53,020
Who is a fake, who is a true, and why do you still need someone else?

1032
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:58,020
I'm afraid that I can't be a woman,

1033
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:04,020
and I can't be a woman,

1034
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,020
and I can't be a woman,

1035
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,020
and I can't be a woman,

1036
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:17,020
and I can't be a woman,

1037
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,020
and I can't be a woman.

1038
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:28,020
Love is a hate, and you don't have to ask.

1039
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:36,020
Who is a fake, who is a true, and why do you still need someone else?

1040
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:47,020
Who is a fake, who is a true, and why do you still need someone else?

1041
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,020
Zhou Yi Niang and her father have been together for many years.

1042
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,020
She is gentle and kind, and she has raised the Zhuang family's female family's reputation.

1043
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,020
Naturally, she also makes her father more affectionate.

1044
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,020
Zhuang Yushan and Zhuang Yuchi, these sisters,

1045
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,020
they are all very good-looking and kind-hearted,

1046
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,020
but they are hard to see and understand.

1047
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,020
They are very modest.

1048
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,020
My grandmother has a decent status,

1049
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,020
but in the family, she can't say anything.

1050
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,020
She is more heartless and virtuous.

1051
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,020
And my mother, Ruan Xiwen,

1052
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,020
she is the real owner of Zhuang's mansion.

1053
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,020
Everyone is afraid, and everyone is afraid.

1054
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,020
In my life, I don't count the words of the three,

1055
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,020
but the words of the three,

1056
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,020
they are always on my head,

1057
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,020
and I can't go back to my original self.

1058
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,020
When I got the chance to get the mother's life back,

1059
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,020
I already knew that I would be in this situation.

1060
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,020
As the daughter of Zhuang family,

1061
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,020
if I want to be a part of the Jin City,

1062
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,020
I must...

1063
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,020
wash away my insolence.
