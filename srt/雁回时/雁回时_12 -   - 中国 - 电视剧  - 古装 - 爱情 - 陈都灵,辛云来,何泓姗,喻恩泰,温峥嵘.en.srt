00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,250
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

4
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,740
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

5
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,100
(Scholarly Glory)

6
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Come on.

7
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,520
Mr. Yuwen, any news from the Palace?

8
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
Have you got any results?

9
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
Mr. Yuwen,

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
we should be brought to the Supervision.

11
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,590
Why have we been locked here?

12
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,430
- Yes.
- Exactly.

13
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,030
This case is of great importance.

14
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,630
The details can't be disclosed.

15
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,560
I've said before

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,280
that tonight, there are 12 households

17
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,030
in the guild hall,

18
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,910
and Pei Dafu's adopted son

19
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,470
is one of the heads of these households.

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,030
If you have any clues,

21
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,360
please report them at once.

22
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,030
Otherwise...

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,520
Otherwise, what?

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,560
Do you plan to kill us?

25
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
Young Master Zaiye,

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,030
you don't understand.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,470
Tonight, all the people here

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,920
are already halfway

29
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,430
in the gates of hell.

30
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,070
The Emperor has granted me
the Imperial Sword,

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,870
which gives me the right
to execute before report.

32
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,750
After the Zi hour tonight,

33
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,310
I will execute one person

34
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,840
every two hours

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,720
until you reveal the identity

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,680
of Pei Dafu's adopted son.

37
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,470
- Mother!
- Mother...

38
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,710
Mom,

39
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
Father is innocent.

40
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,590
Right?

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Mom.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
Speak up, Mom.

43
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
It's over.

44
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
Completely over.

45
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,030
Don't be afraid.

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,400
What should we do, Yushan?

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,840
What are you going to do?

48
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,070
This must be related to you.

49
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,360
Tell me the truth.

50
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,830
What makes you think it's related to me?

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,240
You and Mr. Yuwen
have met twice at night,

52
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,360
mentioning a major plan.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A few days ago,

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,430
you vaguely told me

55
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,070
that I'd soon understand everything.

56
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Since returning to the Capital,

57
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,080
I've sensed that you hold
some hidden resentment toward Father.

58
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
But where does this hatred come from?

59
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,510
Do you want

60
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,390
to take this opportunity

61
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,120
to frame Father
as Pei Dafu's adopted son

62
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,240
as the madam of the family?

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
Nanny Chen,

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,870
Miss Hanyan has gone mad with fear.

65
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,830
Make her stay away from me.

66
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
Miss Hanyan,

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
please don't make it hard for me.

68
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,750
It's not me who is mad; it's you.

69
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,680
The whole family
might be executed for this.

70
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,950
Shut your mouth.

71
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,070
Fu Yunxi,

72
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,560
you've been in charge

73
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,240
of the Zuohang Gang case all along.

74
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,050
After investigating for so long,

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
haven't you found any clues?

76
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,600
If I had found any clues,

77
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,040
how could I end up like this?

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,240
I think you're covering things up

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,720
and too scared to go deeper.

80
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,560
Even the eunuchs are gossiping,

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,610
saying that your father
likely died last year

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,830
by suicide due to guilt.

83
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,360
Pei's adopted son

84
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,630
is clearly your father, Fu Pingsheng.

85
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,750
Didn't his father die
of illness last year?

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
Because of the Zuohang Gang case,

87
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,270
there has been turmoil in the Capital,

88
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,750
and many remnants of the Pei faction,

89
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,950
unable to bear the pressure,

90
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,040
have committed suicide.

91
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,710
Now,

92
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,820
they're using us as scapegoats.

93
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,020
It's only right that the son pays
for his father's crimes.

94
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,740
Fu Yunxi, don't you admit it?

95
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,740
If that's true,

96
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,840
(Zheng Ziyan, Mr. Zheng's eldest son)
stop protecting your father.

97
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,260
Yes.

98
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,260
I'm indeed protecting someone.

99
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,100
Who?

100
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,780
Pei Dafu has a residence in the Capital.

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,160
A month ago, the Judicial Review
received a report

102
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,020
saying that someone had seen

103
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,580
Mr. Deng's carriage

104
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,420
in front of Pei Residence.

105
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,380
Zaiye...

106
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,440
(Deng Chan, Mr. Deng's granddaughter)
Grandfather...

107
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,220
Mr. Fu, Pei Dafu has been
influential for years,

108
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,940
and he likes to invite guests
to his residence.

109
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,800
All the officials in the court
have been invited to his banquets.

110
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,140
If we judge based on this,

111
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,020
it might not be convincing.

112
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,940
Miss Deng's words make sense.

113
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,780
Because of this,

114
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,220
I instructed to suppress this first.

115
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,460
Who is slandering my family?

116
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,540
I knew it.

117
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,340
I knew it'd be you, You Yong.

118
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,420
As I know you used
your grandfather's name

119
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,660
to sell official positions,

120
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,120
you want to slander my entire family.

121
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,060
Don't talk nonsense.

122
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,860
I saw it. How could I be slandering?

123
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,700
Go to hell.

124
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,340
Let go.

125
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,850
Who are you?

126
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,800
Why have you kidnapped us here?

127
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,220
- Let go.
- Behave yourself.

128
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,700
Who are you?

129
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,140
Why are you treating us like this?

130
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,420
Lingzhi, don't be afraid.

131
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,780
What crimes have we committed?

132
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,700
Why have we been arrested?

133
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,660
Lingzhi.

134
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,860
Father.

135
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,060
- What are you doing?
- Yunxi.

136
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,740
- Go back.
- Yunxi.

137
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,060
Step aside.

138
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,140
- Yunxi.
- Mom.

139
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,130
Don't go.

140
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,860
Yunxi, don't come over.

141
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,100
We're fine.

142
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,100
It's okay.

143
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,940
Mr. Fu,

144
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,340
we're only following orders tonight.

145
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,420
Are you going to defy
the imperial edict?

146
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,560
This is punishable by death.

147
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,620
Mr. Fu, don't make things hard for us.

148
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,860
Father.

149
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,980
Lingzhi. Lingzhi.

150
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,820
Lingzhi.

151
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,900
Are you okay, Lingzhi?

152
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,300
Lingzhi.

153
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,140
Don't go.

154
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,140
It's dangerous.

155
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,660
Thank you.

156
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,940
Fu Yunxi, stop.

157
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,020
Give me the saber.

158
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,780
Are you trying to ruin your family?

159
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,900
Stop right there.

160
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,460
Anyone who steps out of the hall tonight

161
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,460
is defying the imperial edict.

162
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,460
What is the imperial edict?

163
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,300
Has anyone read it out loud?

164
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,380
This is entirely under the control
of Mr. Yuwen.

165
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,260
Where is the imperial edict?

166
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,180
Since there's no imperial edict,

167
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,120
how can anyone be accused of defying it?

168
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,080
Those locked in the hall tonight

169
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,060
are all family members
of high-ranking officials.

170
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,180
Even if we are to be executed
after the Zi hour,

171
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,940
there is still time.

172
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,900
Why point swords at us?

173
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,180
Who is the one

174
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,700
defying the edict and causing chaos?

175
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,700
Yunxi.

176
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,140
Come here.

177
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,740
Lingzhi, don't be afraid. I'm here.

178
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,420
Are you hurt?

179
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,260
No.

180
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,220
- Father.
- Are you okay?

181
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,260
Mother, take Lingzhi to the hall.

182
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,620
Hurry, your aunt...

183
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,260
- Behave.
- Let go.

184
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,660
Aunt Kou.

185
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,980
A bunch of blind fools.

186
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't even know to help me up.

187
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,800
Save your strength
for your father's funeral.

188
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,220
I want to see Mr. Yuwen.

189
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,080
Where is he?

190
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,420
Mr. Yuwen is too busy

191
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,660
to see you now.

192
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,780
Everyone, go back to the hall,

193
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,500
or I won't be so polite.

194
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,860
I have info about Pei Dafu's
adopted son.

195
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,180
Miss, just tell me your info.

196
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,100
I'll pass on the message.

197
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,060
This is too serious

198
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,980
for you to hear.

199
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,620
Stop pretending to be mysterious.

200
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,620
Go.

201
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,540
(Yinan Guild Hall)

202
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,980
Are you alright?

203
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,260
Don't worry.

204
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
Thank you for just now.

205
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,660
I don't want your thanks.

206
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,500
I want to know the truth.

207
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,420
What truth?

208
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,980
Since you sent your family
out of the Capital,

209
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,180
you must've known
that this would happen today.

210
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,980
If I really knew the truth,

211
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,740
why would I wait until today?

212
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,580
The Zi hour is near. Aren't you afraid?

213
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Torture and devilish tricks...

214
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,980
These psychological tactics
have been used countless times

215
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,580
in the Judicial Review.

216
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,380
Haven't you

217
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,820
seen through it?

218
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,140
Of course, I have doubts.

219
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,180
Even if the Pei faction is heinous

220
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,980
and the Emperor is
presiding over the case,

221
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,340
how could they dare
to execute the innocent,

222
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,740
let alone the family members
of officials?

223
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,660
But I'm more curious

224
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,540
about how much secret wealth

225
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,980
that adopted son has

226
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,100
to warrant such a major effort.

227
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,930
The less you know about this case,
the safer you are.

228
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,980
This isn't like you.

229
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,660
So, what should I do?

230
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,380
I've already told you about my mother

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
conspiring with Yuwen Chang'an.

232
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,300
Can't you guess

233
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,540
that they're behind this crisis

234
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,260
that has befallen us?

235
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,860
Of course, I guessed it.

236
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,980
Then why haven't you done anything?

237
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,700
Have you got any info

238
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,500
from your mother?

239
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,860
No.

240
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,340
You're helpless as her daughter,

241
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,580
so what can I do?

242
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,780
Are we

243
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,500
just going to wait?

244
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,700
This case is under the control
of Mr. Yuwen.

245
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,300
We can only wait.

246
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,220
Besides,

247
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,380
I also want to see what backup plan

248
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,500
Ms. Ruan has prepared.

249
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,100
Young Master Ziyan
has drawn the first lot.

250
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,420
Sorry. Take him away.

251
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,380
- No!
- No!

252
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,500
- Mother, no.
- Please...

253
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,260
Ziyan, Ziyan.

254
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,300
Let Father save me.

255
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,780
- Mother...
- Ziyan.

256
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,180
Hurry, save Ziyan.

257
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,940
No!

258
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,380
Ziyan!

259
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,540
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

260
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,580
Did they

261
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,620
really kill him?

262
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,780
Unless

263
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,220
everyone has gone mad.

264
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,500
No.

265
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,860
I can't wait anymore.

266
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,900
Whoever that adopted son is,

267
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,220
whether it's to save my mother's life

268
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,540
or for my own sake,

269
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,580
I can't wait any longer.

270
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,640
What do you want to do?

271
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,900
No, no.

272
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,300
Move.

273
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,020
I'm innocent, sir.

274
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,340
Sir...

275
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,460
- Hurry.
- No.

276
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,860
What are you doing?

277
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,340
Let go of me.

278
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,250
Go.

279
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,120
Hurry up.

280
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,660
- Let go of me.
- Hurry.

281
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,060
Let go of me.

282
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,220
Behave yourself.

283
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,880
Where is Zhuang Yuchi?

284
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,700
Yuchi.

285
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
It's your turn now.

286
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,660
No, no.

287
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,820
Sir, let me do it.

288
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Let me do it first.

289
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,280
Don't take my son.

290
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,500
The drawing makes the decision.

291
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,820
The rules can't be changed.

292
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,700
Take him away.

293
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,260
No, no, no.

294
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,600
- Don't.
- Mom.

295
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,120
- Don't take my son away.
- Mom.

296
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,220
Don't take my son.

297
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,060
Mom.

298
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,460
Yuchi.

299
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,380
No!

300
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,100
I know who the adopted son is.

301
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,140
Who is it?

302
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,060
There are too many people here.

303
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,440
Take me outside, and I'll tell you.

304
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,000
Take him away.

305
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,180
- Go.
- Behave yourself.

306
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,420
- Yuchi.
- Mom.

307
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,020
- Yuchi.
- Yuchi.

308
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,060
Miss Hanyan, Madam,

309
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,140
I beg you.

310
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,340
Please save my son.

311
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,860
I'll do anything for you

312
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,220
without any complaints.

313
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,440
Does Yuchi really know
the adopted son's identity?

314
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
How would he know about this?

315
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,380
I just taught him.

316
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,460
It was only to buy him some time.

317
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,180
Mom, they can't even protect themselves.

318
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,220
What can they do for you?

319
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,060
Hurry up.

320
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,180
I just heard it.

321
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,140
I heard Miss Hanyan and the madam

322
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,580
arguing behind the curtain.

323
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,980
So...

324
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,540
So this disaster today

325
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,340
must be related to you.

326
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,140
Right?

327
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,020
It's related to you, isn't it?

328
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,220
What did she say?

329
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,000
Who is responsible
for this disaster today?

330
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,340
Who is the adopted son?

331
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,380
You know, don't you?

332
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,940
It's your family's master, right?

333
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,300
Young Master Zaiye, stop slandering us.

334
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,500
Then tell me.

335
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,580
Who is the adopted son?

336
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900
Everyone, please listen to me.

337
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,300
What we've encountered today

338
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,500
is because of Yuwen Chang'an.

339
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,380
According to the law

340
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,540
and societal customs,
this is without precedent.

341
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,580
Even in the Palace,

342
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,940
even before the Emperor,

343
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,060
things must be reasonable.

344
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,140
Why must we be slaughtered like this?

345
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,380
Miss Hanyan,

346
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,020
what do you think we should do?

347
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,740
Yes, what should we do?

348
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,420
I just went out.

349
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,500
There are only
about 10 officers in the yard.

350
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,220
Right now, there are more of us

351
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,060
in the hall than them.

352
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,420
Tables, chairs, candlesticks,

353
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,580
and dishes can all be used as weapons.

354
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,100
Are you willing to charge out with me?

355
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,340
Yuwen Chang'an holds the Imperial Sword.

356
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,420
If we forced our way out,
we'd defy the edict.

357
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,980
How cunning and cruel of you.

358
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,100
We'll have to die
whether we obey or not.

359
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
If you want to be a coward, go ahead.

360
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,300
I would rather die

361
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,060
than die unjustly.

362
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,300
If anyone in this hall

363
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,580
is innocent and unwilling
to die in vain,

364
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,580
take up weapons with me.

365
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,100
If this interrogation is a trap,

366
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,340
we'll break through the door
and expose it.

367
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,900
If Yuwen Chang'an
truly kills the innocent,

368
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,780
then even if we die,

369
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,940
we'll make sure
the world knows about it.

370
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,260
Miss Hanyan,

371
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,140
I'll charge out with you.

372
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,900
If we must die today,

373
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,380
let's die together with them.

374
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,980
I'll go with you.

375
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,020
Let's fight.

376
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,940
- Let's fight.
- Fight.

377
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,700
Fight.

378
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,190
- Fight.
- Fight.

379
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,260
Let's go and fight.

380
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,700
Let's fight.

381
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,940
Mother.

382
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,620
No matter what,

383
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,900
you must not die today.

384
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,060
I can't

385
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,340
die in vain either.

386
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,540
Are you really going to defy the edict?

387
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,020
Where is Yuwen Chang'an?

388
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,740
- We want to see him.
- Let him come out.

389
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,100
- We are all innocent.
- Yes.

390
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,510
Let him come out.

391
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,860
We are innocent.

392
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,990
Let him come out.

393
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,540
Yes. Who dares to slaughter us?

394
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,250
- Go back now.
- Let him come out.

395
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,180
- Who dares to kill us?
- You'll get hurt.

396
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,660
Mr. Yuwen,

397
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,380
the Emperor is not above the law.

398
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,980
Even with the Imperial Sword,

399
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,220
you must still obey the law.

400
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,540
You have locked us here

401
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,460
and wantonly killed us.

402
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,060
What's your basis?
What evidence do you have?

403
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,860
Mr. Chen.

404
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,320
Mr. Yuwen invites Miss Hanyan
to the study for a discussion.

405
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,420
Lead the way.

406
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,700
(Virtue and Vice)

407
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,660
Miss Hanyan,

408
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,540
I truly underestimated you.

409
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,340
Mr. Yuwen,

410
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,260
as things have come to this,
tell me honestly.

411
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,300
Was that blood outside

412
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,900
human blood,

413
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,100
or animal blood?

414
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,140
Don't worry. They're all alive.

415
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,420
It was just a play.

416
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,460
What play? Who is it for?

417
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,700
Everyone.

418
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,340
From the Emperor

419
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,180
down to the people in the guild hall.

420
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,300
They are not criminals

421
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,180
but witnesses.

422
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,180
What were you

423
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,500
and my mother doing?

424
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,540
Mr. Yuwen,

425
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,780
you still haven't married.

426
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,660
Is there someone you can't let go of?

427
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,420
Since you already know,

428
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,860
why bother asking me?

429
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,700
Now, in the hall,
the families of officials

430
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,140
have been so humiliated.

431
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,060
Everyone is filled with anger.

432
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,980
If they find out

433
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,780
that this was orchestrated by my mother,

434
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,620
I'm afraid they will

435
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,580
tear her apart in a fit of rage.

436
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,460
What do you mean?

437
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,260
If you refuse to tell me the truth,

438
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,700
I'll return to the hall

439
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,740
and make everything I know public.

440
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,580
You...

441
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,100
She's your mother.

442
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,540
How can you bear to do this?

443
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,900
Then how can you bear it?

444
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,020
If you still have feelings for her,

445
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,660
why would you want to harm her?

446
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,740
Mr. Yuwen,

447
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,460
I think I can guess

448
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,100
why you've acted this way today.

449
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,380
Mother must've coerced you
with your feelings.

450
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,940
I'm sure you don't want to watch her

451
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,020
do something so foolish.

452
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,580
While there's still some leeway,

453
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,220
tell me the truth,

454
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,380
and let's find a way out, okay?

455
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,980
A few days ago,

456
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,100
the Head of the Yinan Chamber
of Commerce

457
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,900
sent a message for a meeting,

458
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,220
but he was vague in his words,

459
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,500
and there was no news for a long time.

460
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,100
So, I went alone to Danzhou.

461
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,540
I made some inquiries after I met him,

462
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,260
and he finally confessed

463
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,780
that over the past ten years,

464
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,660
an official from the Pei faction

465
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,420
had been using them to launder money,

466
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,020
involving a huge sum.

467
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,220
But this man's identity is mysterious,

468
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,260
and he only showed up two years ago.

469
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,540
However, it was very dark,

470
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,180
and he couldn't see the man's face.

471
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,980
He only knows that this man is over 40

472
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,260
and is an official

473
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,660
from Yinan in the Capital.

474
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,900
So,

475
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,900
the 11 people detained in the Palace

476
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,860
match these two conditions.

477
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,420
And the 12th person

478
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,060
is Fu Yunxi's Father, Fu Pingsheng.

479
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,980
He passed away last year,

480
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,660
but he also matches

481
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,860
the head's description.

482
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,820
So, on New Year's Eve,

483
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,660
I brought the head into the Palace
to meet the Emperor.

484
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,900
He confessed this to the Emperor,

485
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,660
so the Emperor assigned me to this case.

486
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
So, you sneaked into my home
multiple times

487
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
to discuss this with my mother?

488
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,660
She asked me

489
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,580
to report this to the Emperor

490
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,460
and have

491
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,780
Zhuang Shiyang arrested

492
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,140
for her sake

493
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,220
and for the sake of justice

494
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,300
and the well-being of the people.

495
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,860
Even so,

496
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,500
you have 12 suspects.

497
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,060
How can you frame my father

498
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,540
as that adopted son?

499
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,620
Miss Hanyan...

500
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,340
Sir, a female relative claims

501
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,700
to have confidential info for you.

502
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,980
Let her in.

503
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,460
Mother.

504
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,540
You told her everything?

505
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,100
Xiwen,

506
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,260
just listen to me.

507
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,420
Let's drop this.

508
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,780
Don't be so stubborn.

509
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,660
You know me.

510
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,060
Mother,

511
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,740
even if you want to uphold justice,

512
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,060
do you not care

513
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,780
for my life at all?

514
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,580
Ever since your return,

515
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,540
I've tried every way to drive you out,

516
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,020
but you insisted on getting involved

517
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,660
in this mess.

518
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,820
It's not my fault.

519
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,700
Even if you want to frame Father
as the adopted son,

520
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,660
that would never work.

521
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,460
Frame?

522
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,260
Then today, I'll tell you

523
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,620
what the evidence is.

524
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,940
Xiwen, what are you doing?

525
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,660
- What are you doing?
- Go away! Go!

526
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,620
Xiwen.

527
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,980
Open the door.

528
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,700
Miss Hanyan,

529
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,420
your mother isn't doing this

530
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,780
just for herself.

531
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,380
Just let her.

532
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm Ruan Xiwen, madam of the Zhuangs.

533
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,900
Unable to withstand the torture
of the Supervision,

534
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,740
I voluntarily confess today.

535
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,460
My husband, Zhuang Shiyang,
is Pei Dafu's adopted son.

536
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,980
In our backyard kitchen,

537
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,980
there's a secret passage
directly to Pei Dafu's residence.

538
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Something's wrong.

539
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,820
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

540
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,100
(Two years ago)

541
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,100
(Rear garden, Pei Dafu's residence)

542
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,940
I'm innocent, Eunuch Feng.

543
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,360
The Emperor is wise. I'm innocent.

544
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,140
(Dutiful and Blessed)
Someone is framing me.

545
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,980
How could there be a secret passage
in my house?

546
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,220
The evidence is right in front of you,

547
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,260
and your wife has confessed.

548
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,860
You can't deny this.

549
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
(Scholarly Glory)

550
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,300
Bring the Zhuangs to the backyard.

551
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,500
Keep an eye on them.

552
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,500
Father,

553
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,020
is Aunt Hanyan not leaving?

554
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,420
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

555
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,740
My Lord,

556
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,140
are you okay?

557
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,100
It's fine. What's going on?

558
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
The Emperor has ordered us to work
with the Supervision on this.

559
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,060
Mr. Yan needs you.

560
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,330
- Let's go.
- Yes.

561
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,860
May the Bodhisattva bless us

562
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,540
and protect our family

563
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,420
through this calamity.

564
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,220
- Mom.
- May the Bodhisattva bless.

565
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,540
Father has been deceiving us.

566
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,500
Even you didn't know about this, right?

567
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,840
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

568
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,380
I don't believe it.

569
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,140
How could Father be an evil man?

570
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,160
When Yunxi returns
to the Judicial Review,

571
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,580
he'll investigate this thoroughly.

572
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,300
Someone must be framing us.

573
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,120
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

574
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,160
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

575
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,120
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

576
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,500
Nanny Chen,

577
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,780
you should leave.

578
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,500
Why stay?

579
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,100
Madam,

580
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,140
allow me to speak

581
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,780
out of turn

582
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,540
and call you Xiwen.

583
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,820
Back then,
the Ruan family was prominent,

584
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,340
but now,

585
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,580
only you and I are here.

586
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,900
After all these years,

587
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,660
I know that you don't just see me

588
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,700
as a servant.

589
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,020
If you don't mind,

590
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,300
let me accompany you
on your last journey.

591
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,780
Mr. Yuwen,

592
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
where is my master?

593
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,100
What does he say?

594
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,980
Zhuang Shiyang refuses to admit it,

595
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,540
but the evidence is irrefutable,

596
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,620
so he can't deny it.

597
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,140
Take account of all the Zhuangs

598
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,400
and bring them to prison.

599
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,960
There's no need to wait until autumn.

600
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,820
Execute them at the Wu hour tomorrow.

601
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,300
Zhuang Shiyang, the master,

602
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,140
Ms. Wei, the grandmother,

603
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,060
Ruan Xiwen, the wife,

604
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,460
Zhou Ruyin, the concubine,

605
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,340
Zhuang Yushan, Zhou's daughter,

606
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,340
Zhuang Yuchi, Zhou's son.

607
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,060
There are six people

608
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,260
in Zhuang Shiyang's family.
Take them away.

609
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,340
What's going on?

610
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,940
Why isn't Zhuang Hanyan listed?

611
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,540
According to the family register,

612
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,140
Zhuang Hanyan, the lineal daughter,

613
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,100
was removed from the family register
two years ago

614
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,860
and adopted by Zhang Youchang
from Nanzhang, Danzhou.

615
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,940
She is not a Zhuang family member.

616
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,580
Take them away.

617
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,100
Yuchi, Yushan.

618
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,440

619
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,740
