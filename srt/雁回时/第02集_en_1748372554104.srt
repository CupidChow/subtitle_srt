00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
My friend...

ν

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,400
You're winning.

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,040
A House With!(Carriage 적ies, وهont Abdaraat.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,360
Tsim Sha Tsim

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,760
When I was too young,

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,360
the daughter of the noble woman

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,960
was very hard to find.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,320
I thought

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,040
as long as I can be like the ordinary

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,160
and educated girl in the painting class,

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,600
I can be considered a noble woman.

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,760
So I found various types of books

45
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,040
in the uncle's room.

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
I thought

47
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,880
the noble woman had a noble hair style.

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,360
So in the later years,

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,960
I dreamed

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,680
that I could have a hair style

51
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,960
that belongs to me.

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,960
Only then

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
that I could see my mother

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
think I was the same as her.

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,600
She would like me.

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,920
But...

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
Master, hurry up.

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,880
Your mother must be

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,960
unable to protect Miss Sanxiao.

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
But in the Han family,

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
we had a few drinks.

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
How could it be like this?

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
Master, you finally came back.

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,040
Where are Ruyi and Hanye?

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
Where are they?

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,040
Master,

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,320
hurry up.

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,120
Wait.

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,880
This is...

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,400
This is Hanye?

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,480
Miss Sanxiao is angry with Master.

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
Master ordered us

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,200
to get her out of the house.

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
Nonsense!

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Let go of her!

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
What are you doing?

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
How could you make her

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
into this?

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,560
Hanye.

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,400
Hanye.

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm your father.

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,120
You've suffered.

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
Father.

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,760
I've seen you before.

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,920
Come on.

86
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Hurry up.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
Go to the room.

88
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,280
Who dares?

89
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,400
Xiwen.

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,600
Hanye has been abroad for many years.

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,920
She finally returned to her home.

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Our family has finally reunited.

93
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Why do you have to do this?

94
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,840
Master has known Han Linyuan for many years.

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,480
He's been learning to not see her for a long time.

96
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,400
But he knows you're not too far from her.

97
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
What?

98
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,880
You're not feeling well today?

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,520
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
What did I forget?

101
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,560
Master forgot that

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,560
she's not the daughter of the Zhuang family.

103
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,080
She's the daughter of the evil ghost.

104
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,000
She's the father of the child's grandchild.

105
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,840
In just one day,

106
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,560
she's got caught by your son

107
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,680
and you even report to the criminal.

108
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,920
You are quite straightforward.

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,940
And so she treats us as liars,

110
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,120
so that if we argued,

111
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,360
we'll always have nothing to fight back.

112
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,980
Well,

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,080
this is the best help

114
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
for getting rid of the mother of their child.

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
Really?

116
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,580
That's not theアnlua family.

117
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,020
You've been in the manor for half a night.

118
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,180
I'm afraid you haven't been able to get along well.

119
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,140
Master.

120
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,900
Dad, I'm finally back.

121
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,940
I'll beat up my mother and I.

122
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,180
Master, don't be angry.

123
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,180
Yes.

124
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,380
I've done the housework and the ritual.

125
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,140
I didn't do anything wrong.

126
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,860
Ximen.

127
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
You...

128
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,700
If you're in pain,

129
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,620
why don't you put me in this soup?

130
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,460
And punish me?

131
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,540
Why are you so upset?

132
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,220
Why don't you two stand still

133
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,140
and drag her out?

134
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Let go of me!

135
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,340
I'm not making any more trouble!

136
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,300
Ximen.

137
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,140
Master,

138
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,100
it's our own daughter.

139
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,580
She's been in the manor for many years.

140
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,860
I've been wanting to take her back every year.

141
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,020
But you've been in the manor for a long time.

142
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,180
Now you're finally back.

143
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,820
How can you be so emotional?

144
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,660
I'm a family member.

145
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,420
I'm not the one to blame.

146
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,900
I'm sorry.

147
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,460
But...

148
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,660
Did you hear that?

149
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,780
Your father is right.

150
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,700
You've been in the manor for so many years.

151
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,260
You've been in the manor for so many years.

152
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,380
You've been doing this all because of me.

153
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,180
Do you hate me now?

154
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,340
I don't dare to.

155
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,300
I'm not in the manor.

156
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,260
I'm not in the mood to be sorry.

157
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,500
I'm sorry for being so emotional.

158
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,940
I'm sorry, mother.

159
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm sorry.

160
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,260
We've never met each other

161
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,100
since we were children.

162
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,340
How did you know?

163
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,340
I was in the manor when I was little.

164
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,620
But I heard that

165
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,340
my mother was a noble girl.

166
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,820
She was a good girl.

167
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,660
Mom is one with talent and style.

168
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,460
There was only one left to Ji нan

169
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,820
and get justice for her.

170
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,780
I bet she's a noble girl.

171
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,660
And she's also noble.

172
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,140
Whenever after a couple of love,

173
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,900
the two canutter to our death

174
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
You're a scoundrel.

175
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
You're trying to protect me.

176
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
I can't even protect myself.

177
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,900
If I didn't have you as my servant,

178
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
how could I have been so cruel?

179
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
You're so cruel.

180
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,900
You're trying to protect me.

181
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Xiwen, don't say that.

182
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Let me be.

183
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
You...

184
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
You're all a scoundrel.

185
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
You're all a scoundrel.

186
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
You're a scoundrel.

187
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
I should have burned this camp

188
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
and become a scoundrel.

189
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
I've seen the truth.

190
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,900
How could I be a scoundrel?

191
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
You...

192
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Close the door.

193
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Xiwen!

194
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
You're a scoundrel.

195
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
You're a scoundrel.

196
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
You're a scoundrel.

197
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,900
You wanted to kill me.

198
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Now you regret it.

199
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
I'm doomed.

200
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm doomed!

201
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm doomed!

202
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Zhongmu, don't be angry.

203
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Go back to Jianjia.

204
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
I'm so sorry

205
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,900
for this terrible fate.

206
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,900
I've heard many rumors since I was a child.

207
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
My mother is soft and gentle.

208
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
She's talented and gentle.

209
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
She's a gentle and elegant girl.

210
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
She's the first daughter in the capital.

211
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
But what I saw tonight

212
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,900
is a man of fate.

213
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
He's so emotional.

214
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
He's so innocent.

215
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
What has he experienced

216
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,900
in these years?

217
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
I don't know what you want to do.

218
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
I just want to ask you.

219
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
Is Miss San good?

220
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Thank you for your concern.

221
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
I'll just stand here.

222
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,900
I wanted to ask you about the murder of Danzhou.

223
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
I've got a secret.

224
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
I'm afraid you'll find out.

225
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
I'm not sure.

226
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Hold it!

227
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
All right.

228
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Why are these close characters

229
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
and guns on Han people?

230
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
Like you said.

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Hello?

232
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,900
I can't think of anyone.

233
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,320
ItVIe helps to define your purpose.

234
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,880
get rid of you

235
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,400
to berat

236
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,600
begins

237
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,960
to bring through

238
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,640
internal calm

239
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
ok

240
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,720
because

241
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,780
all

242
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,840
us

243
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,280
Bark

244
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,360
Really now

245
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,080
a

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
In the end, you're the only one

247
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
who can make such a big deal of money.

248
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Everyone in the Zhuang family

249
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
is just a stranger.

250
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
They're all strangers.

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
How are they?

252
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
They're close to each other.

253
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
They're close to each other.

254
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
You don't know that.

255
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Everyone knows you.

256
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
So,

257
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
you want to figure out

258
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
who's the main character

259
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
and who's the one

260
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
who's willing to take you.

261
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
You're the one who finds the body.

262
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Am I right?

263
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Han Yan has a long and strong personality.

264
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
He's a man of character.

265
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,080
I don't understand what you're talking about.

266
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
That assassin.

267
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
You're the one who hid it, right?

268
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Brother-in-law,

269
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
the man and the woman are great.

270
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Please help yourselves.

271
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
To me,

272
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
there's no one who can separate the two.

273
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Brother-in-law,

274
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
the man and the woman are great.

275
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Please help yourselves.

276
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
To me,

277
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
there's no one who can separate the two.

278
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
If you're so clear-headed with me,

279
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
I'll call someone.

280
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Why don't I help you?

281
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Let's see

282
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
how you can separate the two

283
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
from the southern part of the capital,

284
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
the capital,

285
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
and the southern part of the capital.

286
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
What I don't understand

287
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
is why you're coming back.

288
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Han Yan has a long and strong personality.

289
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
This time,

290
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
I want a home.

291
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
I want a home.

292
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
This is the secret medicine for the Dali Temple.

293
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Take it.

294
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Don't worry.

295
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
It's not poison.

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Zhuang Han Yan,

297
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
this is the capital.

298
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
I hope you won't regret it.

299
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
I'm sorry.

311
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
I'm sorry.

319
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm sorry.

320
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm sorry.

321
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
I'm sorry.

323
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
I'm sorry.

328
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
I'm sorry.

330
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
I'm sorry.

335
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
I'm sorry.

336
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm sorry.

337
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm sorry.

338
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Please sit.

339
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Did Yin Xi

340
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
not put you in a bad spot just now?

341
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
No,

342
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
he is very upset with Shushi.

343
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,760
My president had brought me to thisША

344
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
life or death

345
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
As to how my behaviorики

346
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,160
got to you

347
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,160
when my father died

348
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
that year

349
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,000
it was when our destinies

350
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,480
were nearing end

351
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,360
but when there were three dragons

352
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,000
in DANzhou

353
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,880
to doe the lewd

354
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,080
then

355
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,480
We have great grudges.

356
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,600
If not, we will be in trouble.

357
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,800
I have sent someone to Danzhou

358
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,960
to help with the food.

359
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
In the spring,

360
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,840
we will go back to the village

361
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,600
and give them

362
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,560
a big meal.

363
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,160
Father,

364
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,680
don't get sick.

365
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,400
Don't worry, mother.

366
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,720
She has you in her heart.

367
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,760
Just be patient.

368
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
You two will get along well.

369
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
It's too long.

370
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,280
There will be no trouble.

371
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Father, don't worry.

372
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,480
I never hate my mother.

373
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Han Yan,

374
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,760
you are a good boy.

375
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,120
We were the ones who made you suffer.

376
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,800
You finally came back.

377
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
Father is a good boy.

378
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,080
But your grandfather

379
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,240
still left some family business.

380
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Don't worry.

381
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,040
I won't be able to treat you.

382
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,520
I will listen to your father.

383
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,880
All right.

384
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,280
Yanshan,

385
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,240
take a rest.

386
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,520
I won't bother you.

387
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,560
I will go to see my mother.

388
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Mo Dong.

389
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,680
Mo Dong.

390
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,120
You are leaving.

391
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,760
You are leaving.

392
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Yes.

393
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,200
Take care, father.

394
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,720
This is the medicine for the secretion of the Dali Temple.

395
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,560
Don't worry.

396
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
It's not poison.

397
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't hurt you just now.

398
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Does it hurt?

399
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,880
Justin is unwell.

400
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,360
Be careful, mother.

401
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,880
Iṇ taki her name releasing

402
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,560
puree from N Catholic Church.

403
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,680
Since the water Jia Shanghai.

404
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,960
Morgenau Bandie.

405
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,640
They don't believe me

406
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,360
No.

407
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,080
She's my mother.

408
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,800
Don't worry.

409
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,400
You must remember,

410
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,320
this is the capital.

411
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,400
It's different from the days we lived in Danzhou.

412
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
It's different from the days

413
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
you swam in the sea.

414
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,280
We have

415
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,000
many eyes to watch.

416
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,600
And you have the right

417
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,640
to be able to do nothing.

418
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,160
Yes.

419
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,480
I understand.

420
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,120
Mother,

421
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
she does protect me.

422
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,680
But tonight,

423
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,320
there's something else.

424
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,240
You should keep it in mind.

425
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,800
If I really need you to do something for me,

426
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I'll tell you my demands.

427
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,400
You gave me my life.

428
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,840
You can do anything.

429
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,440
Don't say that.

430
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,680
I saved your life

431
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,040
not to repay you.

432
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,520
That's the truth.

433
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,440
I'm willing to do it.

434
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,440
I suffered a lot

435
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,240
tonight.

436
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,280
But the people who came to the house

437
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,600
have a clear understanding

438
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,880
of the basic skin and fragrance.

439
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,400
Zhou Yi's mother and father have been together for years.

440
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,240
They've been close to each other

441
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,640
and have been close to each other.

442
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,200
Of course,

443
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,440
they've been more in love with each other.

444
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,480
Zhuang Yu Shan and Zhuang Yu Chi's brother

445
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,760
are good friends in front of their father.

446
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,680
But they can't stand their nature.

447
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
They're very modest.

448
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,360
My grandmother has a great father.

449
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,480
But in the family,

450
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,880
she can't say anything.

451
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,600
She's not a good person.

452
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,040
My mother,

453
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,840
Ruan Xi Wen,

454
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,960
is the real master of Zhuang Fu House.

455
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,280
She's a great person.

456
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,800
But everyone has

457
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,680
all kinds of secrets.

458
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,160
This lady

459
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,240
can't be the one who lost her tracking.

460
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,360
To chit-chat

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,560
is not gonna be a bad thing.

462
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,380
The Hahn's path

463
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
is gonna be even longer.

464
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,000
In a place where you can't see Kendra,

465
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,240
I'll be there for you.

466
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,480
tears.

467
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
The one and only

468
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,880
I can wait for.

469
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I know.

470
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
You protect yourself

471
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
by protecting me.

472
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I understand.

473
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
But I'm not in a good mood.

474
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
I'm not in the house of Zhuang.

475
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Where?

476
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Dali Temple.

477
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
My lord, it's hard to find a way to go.

478
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Let's go tomorrow morning.

479
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Don't talk nonsense.

480
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Go to work.

481
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Where are we going?

482
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Danzhou.

483
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Dali Temple

484
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Dali Temple

485
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Dali Temple

486
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,280
After work, Danzhou likes to sleep.

487
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Dali Temple

488
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Dali Temple

489
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
A-Song, come.

490
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Sister,

491
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,280
last night, the commandant asked them to fight.

492
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
I don't know what you and the little girl are doing.

493
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
You just fight with each other.

494
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
You are a fool.

495
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
You don't know the hard work of the little girl.

496
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
If it weren't for us,

497
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
we would have been in trouble.

498
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm afraid that today,

499
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I'll be locked up in the house.

500
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
I see.

501
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Second sister, you really are a spy.

502
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
You are so stupid.

503
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
How is it?

504
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
I asked her.

505
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
She said that

506
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
she would take me to Yongshou Hall.

507
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
I see.

508
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Third sister,

509
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm afraid that you can't get through.

510
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Why don't you have dinner first?

511
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
It's okay.

512
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Father, don't you even care about your son's future?

513
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Do you have to protect that little girl?

514
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
If father really wants to keep her,

515
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
he just wants to drive me away.

516
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
Yushan, stop.

517
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
And you.

518
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
You will find out

519
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,280
the reason behind the death of the father.

520
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Your father gave you the name of the teacher.

521
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,280
It's because you are so kind and kind.

522
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
You are so stubborn.

523
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Why don't you have a long memory?

524
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Then let the grandmother come to the fair.

525
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Who can make her happy in our family?

526
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Yes.

527
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
I'm a rich man.

528
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
I have a short life.

529
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
What else can I say?

530
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
It's the master of Yang's family.

531
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Shiyang, mother will listen to you.

532
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
I'm a hero in the Hanling Courtyard.

533
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,280
I've been in the court for many years.

534
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,280
The officials in the whole city are watching us.

535
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,280
If I were to take the girl back to the house,

536
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
what would I do?

537
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Besides,

538
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Han Yan is a good man.

539
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
He has no wrongdoers.

540
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,280
You can't be so kind.

541
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Master, don't be so anxious.

542
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Did Han Shilang say anything?

543
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
He said nothing.

544
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Before the ceremony,

545
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
he drove Han Yan out of the house.

546
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,280
That's why he promised to take the girl back to the house.

547
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Then he drove her out?

548
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Yes.

549
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
I have no right or wrong in the court.

550
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Han Wenzheng can't see our family's house.

551
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,280
He must be afraid of the sick.

552
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
If I say it,

553
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
it's over.

554
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Father,

555
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
if Tan'er can't go inside,

556
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
I'll be a killer and go to the mountain.

557
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
What are you talking about?

558
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
I'll kill you.

559
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I'll kill you.

560
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
You're the only son of our family.

561
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
You're also the only son of your parents.

562
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
How can you say such nonsense?

563
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Master,

564
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
I have a stupid idea.

565
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
I don't know whether to say it or not.

566
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Tell me, Jin Li.

567
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
The saying goes,

568
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
men are married, women are married.

569
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,280
The three ladies have been married for a long time.

570
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,280
They're also married.

571
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Don't go.

572
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
I haven't finished yet.

573
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
It's like this.

574
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
It's like this.

575
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
I think so.

576
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
If the Zhou family can't do it,

577
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
we can consider the Sun family.

578
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
We can discuss it.

579
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Madam, I really can't help with this.

580
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
No, no, no.

581
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Mei Jin, you can open it.

582
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
We can go out for a walk.

583
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
How is it?

584
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
It's already the sixth one.

585
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
But it's gone.

586
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
Please go and have a look.

587
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Yes.

588
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
The one who is in charge of the capital city is still not here.

589
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
If he goes out,

590
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
he won't come back.

591
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Where do you think he is?

592
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
I only look at the direction.

593
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
It's south.

594
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Stop.

595
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I'm worried about you.

596
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
I'm afraid he will come back.

597
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
I'm afraid he will come back.

598
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
I don't know.

599
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I don't know.

600
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
I don't know.

601
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I don't know.

602
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
I don't know.

603
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
I don't know.

604
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
I'm worried about you.

605
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
I don't know.

606
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Zhuang Jia

607
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
is making a marriage for you.

608
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
The name of the ghost

609
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
has been passed down for a long time.

610
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
No one would accept this marriage.

611
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
No one would want to beg.

612
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
You have a family.

613
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Of course I don't.

614
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
But I have to choose to go back.

615
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I can't be taken by others.

616
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
I can't be

617
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
the one who is the name of the ghost.

618
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Mr. Zheng

619
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
has been saying that

620
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
he will be taken by the general.

621
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,280
It must be the old general of Yilan.

622
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
The one who is the leader.

623
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Here.

624
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
And

625
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Mr. Deng

626
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
who is a very thoughtful person.

627
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
And

628
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
this Tu Sun Dong.

629
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
By the way, Ru Yan

630
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
you go to the dungeon later.

631
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Take some of my Yong Chun vinegar

632
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
and I will take it.

633
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Okay.

634
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Every year

635
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
they always have to work hard

636
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
to set up a big banquet for the old general.

637
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
We are all the same.

638
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
We are in the same family.

639
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
I can take the bridge

640
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
and take the bridge

641
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
to take care of my cooking.

642
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
It's all because of the people.

643
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
It's good to have a good time

644
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
in our house.

645
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
This time

646
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
I finally invited Mr. Han.

647
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Then

648
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
I can talk about the wedding

649
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
with Yu Chi.

650
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
What about the wedding of Han Yan?

651
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I can't do it.

652
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
It's really hard.

653
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I can't blame you.

654
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Mr. Duan Zhenren said

655
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
that

656
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
eating a little ghost is a matter of time.

657
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
I think that's just a trick.

658
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
What can we do

659
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
to make a woman

660
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
a good daughter?

661
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
No.

662
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
No.

663
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
No.

664
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Master.

665
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Madam.

666
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
She is in a bad mood.

667
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Don't come over.

668
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Don't come over.

669
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
Don't come over.

670
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Mother.

671
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Master.

672
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Mr. Wang.

673
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
What's going on?

674
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Madam is sick.

675
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
She didn't push the door open.

676
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
She said...

677
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
She said...

678
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
What did she say?

679
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
She said that there is a ghost in the house

680
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
to protect her.

681
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
She said that she would kill her.

682
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Master.

683
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Madam.

684
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Will she

685
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
be the one

686
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
who is responsible for this?

687
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
I am also an old woman.

688
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
I don't know

689
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
how young girls

690
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,280
are like back then.

691
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
But I still remember

692
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
the past.

693
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Master.

694
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Tomorrow is the Yinan Festival.

695
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Will we have to change the mood?

696
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
The wedding dress is all sent out.

697
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
How can we change it?

698
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,280
We will stay here tonight.

699
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Let's invite some wolves

700
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
to see it.

701
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Tomorrow,

702
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,280
we will have the Yungshou Hall.

703
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Don't let mother get shocked.

704
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
We will start the front yard.

705
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
We will leave the house

706
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
in the afternoon.

707
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Yes.

708
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Yes.

709
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I understand.

710
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
The yard is all sealed.

711
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
The old madam is seriously ill.

712
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
She is just like the old madam.

713
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
It's all because of you, Miss San.

714
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Is there a Taoist

715
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
coming to the house today?

716
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Taoist?

717
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
I don't think so.

718
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Is it because of the old madam?

719
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
No.

720
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Greetings, Second Sister.

721
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Sister, why are you

722
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
saker dut is so impolite?

723
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Open the window.

724
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Promise me

725
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,880

726
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
It's too thin to carry.

727
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,640
Miss San,

728
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,400
you grew up in the south.

729
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,760
But you can't stand the winter in our capital.

730
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,440
Go and change your bed.

731
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,360
Second Sister,

732
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Han Yan has been in the house for a few days.

733
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,080
He hasn't offended you.

734
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,200
Third Sister,

735
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,120
what are you talking about?

736
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,520
Father and Mother are in Yongshou Hall.

737
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,760
They can't get out of their house.

738
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
I'm the elder sister.

739
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,240
I'm the elder sister.

740
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,640
I came here to take care of your food.

741
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,040
Why don't you take care of your love?

742
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,520
I dare not.

743
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Thank you, Second Sister.

744
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,480
It's good to be late.

745
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,960
Let's go.

746
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,920
Miss San.

747
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,160
I'm afraid that the fire and the charcoal

748
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,360
won't bring us back.

749
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,640
Go and close the window.

750
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,840
Yes.

751
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,560
I will go back and go.

752
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,640
Senior Sister.

753
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
You are okay, my comin sister.

754
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,720
It won't do you good.

755
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,080
What for you?

756
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,360
Stop talking about Han Da.

757
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,600
iereful.

758
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,760
Bullshitting.

759
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,360
My parents and my mother didn't want to go out with me.

760
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,560
Now, only Second Sister and I are together.

761
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,160
Second Sister,

762
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,160
did you say that I and Tan'er's marriage is a mess?

763
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,960
Don't worry. Tomorrow, Father will be celebrating.

764
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,560
When you see Uncle Han, you must be quiet and calm.

765
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,960
You must be serious. Don't play with your temper anymore.

766
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,760
The rest of you will be in the same boat with you.

767
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,760
Second Sister still loves me the most.

768
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
When Father is in a hurry,

769
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,760
I'll go to the Anzi Bureau and buy back the last one you paid for last time.

770
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,560
I'll surely get it back.

771
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,360
Really?

772
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,760
You'll be happy to see me.

773
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,560
When I get Tan'er married,

774
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,760
Uncle Han will definitely help me get a big husband.

775
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
In the future, he will become our family member.

776
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,960
Second Sister will not let anyone bully him.

777
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,160
All right. Tomorrow, let's talk about your future father-in-law.

778
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,160
What are you doing here?

779
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,360
You still think that this yard isn't messy enough?

780
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm here to find Master.

781
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
What a joke.

782
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,360
Old Madam is seriously ill.

783
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,560
Master is in bed and is having a hard time.

784
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,360
What kind of mess do you have?

785
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,060
You dare to come and disturb me now?

786
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,560
Old Fan, you helped to inform the doctor about Third Miss.

787
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,160
Go, go, go.

788
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,960
If you get old, you'll be in trouble.

789
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,560
Go.

790
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
How is it?

791
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,960
Second Master is guarding the Yongshu Hall gate.

792
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,360
He's just blocking us. He can't even put a word in.

793
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,160
Second Sister of our Zhuang family is really in a bad mood.

794
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Young Mistress, why don't you go and hide in other yard?

795
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,360
No need.

796
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,960
I can also be in a big trouble.

797
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,560
Young Mistress, you go back.

798
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,960
I'm going to rest.

799
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
Yes.

800
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,760
What is this?

801
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,760
How is it? Have you found out?

802
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,560
I've found out.

803
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,160
Back then, the Chizhi Ghost Division

804
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,160
was a person who was a self-sufficiency.

805
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,160
He has already come to the capital, right?

806
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,760
Yes. He entered the city yesterday.

807
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,360
Grandmother is really ill.

808
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,560
It seems that someone doesn't want me to stay in Zhuang's Mansion.

809
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,760
They want to re-examine the Chizhi Ghost Division 17 years ago.

810
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Since that, you should make another plan.

811
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,760
There's not much time.

812
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,360
I'm afraid that tomorrow,

813
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,760
the Chizhi Ghost Division will be closed.

814
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,360
How many cities do you still have to decide?

815
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,760
I know the enemy.

816
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,760
I don't know how to decide

817
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
the day after tomorrow.

818
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,160
What kind of situation will be left?

819
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,560
But I've got this tonight.

820
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,760
Maybe I can take it.

821
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,760
I'm not a common person.

822
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
The three words Chizhi Ghost Division

823
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
has always been the sound of my head.

824
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,760
I can't stop it.

825
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,760
When I got the chance to get rid of the monster,

826
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,760
I knew that this was the end.

827
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
That three words

828
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
is like my warning.

829
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,760
I've known that this day would come.

830
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,760
I can't keep it to myself,

831
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,760
but this time, I must make the wrongdoings

832
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,760
and the truth come true.

833
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
As the enemy of Zhuang's Family,

834
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
I must leave the Chizhi Ghost Division

835
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,760
and get rid of the 17-year-old monster.

836
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,760
The night is dark, the night is silent,

837
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,760
the fog is silent.

838
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,760
When I walk into the battlefield,

839
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I can't see the mountains.

840
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Love and hate,

841
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
don't ask.

842
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Who is the enemy?

843
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Do you still need someone?

844
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,760
The fear is in the middle of the earth.

845
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,760
It's hard to be laughed at.

846
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,760
The waves are still strong,

847
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,760
who can get rid of them?

848
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
I'm willing to live,

849
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,760
but I can't get rid of it.

850
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Even if I meet you,

851
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
my eyes are still open,

852
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,760
you can't see me.

853
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm willing to live, but I can't get rid of it.

854
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm willing to live,

855
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,760
but I can't get rid of it.

856
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,760
I'm willing to live,

857
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:09,480
It's just zealous
