=Episode 22=

3
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,560
Is that Chan?

4
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,120
It's her.

5
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,270
Chan.

6
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,150
Mother.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Chan,

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,870
I owe you an apology.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
From now on,

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,520
I won't be able to stay by your side.

11
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,430
Mom.

12
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,150
I've always worried

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
that after I get married,

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,360
you'd be left all alone there,

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,470
feeling isolated.

16
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,400
It's hard to bear.

17
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
But now,

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,560
both you and I

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
have found a place to belong.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Good girl.

21
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,000
Good girl.

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
Good girl.

23
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,710
Don't cry.

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,710
Mr. Cheng,

25
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,870
though my mother left the Dengs,

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,680
she's not all alone.

27
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,960
Wherever she goes,

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll always be her daughter.

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,470
I hope you treat her kindly.

30
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,310
If not, even to the ends of the earth,

31
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,630
I won't let you off.

32
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,960
Don't worry.

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,630
I'll take good care of her.

34
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,550
Mother.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,200
Madam,

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,750
why not settle in Min'an?

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,630
Why Min'an?

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,150
Mr. Zheng's from Min'an.

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
When Deng Chan returns with him
for family visits,

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,710
you two could reunite.

41
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,430
Indeed.

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,710
That's a great idea.

43
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,520
Thank you, Miss Hanyan.

44
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,990
Hanyan,

45
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,960
you always know what to do.

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Dear saviors,

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,630
please accept our gratitude.

48
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Mother.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,920
- Madam.
- Please rise.

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
We can never repay the kindness

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,870
you've shown us.

52
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,560
We too had our motives.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,190
It was mutually beneficial.

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,720
No need to thank us.

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Mr. Fu,

56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,520
if it were only for motives,

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,030
you wouldn't have come

58
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,470
to see us off today.

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,030
Thank you both.

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,310
We are not far from the Capital.

61
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,520
You should hurry on your way.

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,030
Good girl.

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,800
Take care of yourself.

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,270
I'll wait for you in Min'an.

65
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,000
Mother.

66
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Mom.

67
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,590
Just now,

68
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,560
you were thinking of your mother, right?

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,830
This time,

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,010
finally, no accidents happened.

71
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,390
No mistakes were made.

72
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,000
Now we've identified the mastermind.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
We just need to take down Yao Zhidong.

74
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,630
Then Noble Consort Miao will be safe.

75
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,190
We're closer to toppling Zhuang Shiyang.

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,400
Yes.

77
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,600
Let's go to the Yao Mansion.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,840
Now?

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,720
From the moment Mr. Deng

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,190
revealed Yao Zhidong's name,

81
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,070
I already knew

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
the next move to take.

83
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,120
You mean

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,480
Duchess Qi?

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,260
(Yu Pavilion, Yao Residence)

86
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,630
(Officials Rule and Rectify)
If Mr. Fu has official matters,

87
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,430
please go to the government office.

88
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
I won't be hosting guests here.

89
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,360
It's well-known Mr. Yao is strict,

90
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,950
so I dare not engage privately.

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,430
I joined Mr. Deng and others

92
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,420
to petition against
Noble Consort Miao's influence.

93
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,420
(Yao Zhidong, Grand Secretary
of the Hall of Literary Glory)

94
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,480
Yet you and your wife obstructed it.

95
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Now that Mr. Deng has withdrawn his petition,

96
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,240
are you here today

97
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
to persuade me to do the same?

98
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,160
Lately in the Capital,

99
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,870
someone's distributing
the Precepts for Women.

100
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
You are behind this, aren't you?

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
In the past,

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,070
King You of Zhou sought Bao Si's smile,

103
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,720
even lighting beacons as a jest.

104
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,430
Emperor Xuanzong of Tang
adored Noble Consort Yang,

105
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,360
making sons less valued than daughters.

106
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,680
Throughout history,

107
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,360
many upheavals were due to women.

108
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680
Noble Consort Miao held favor for years,

109
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,160
now daring to meddle in state affairs.

110
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,830
As officials,

111
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,800
how can we watch our nation's stability

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,120
fall to a woman's hands?

113
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,430
Your story is quite engaging.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
If Bao Si's beauty could ruin a nation,

115
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,800
then who sent such a temptress

116
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,630
into the palace?

117
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,630
King You indulged in the pleasures of beauty.

118
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,830
A loyal minister advised him

119
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,070
and was falsely accused and jailed.

120
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,510
His kin presented the clan's
fairest lady to the palace.

121
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,270
The loyal minister escaped his plight.

122
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,480
That lady was Bao Si.

123
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,090
Women in this world

124
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,000
can't even control their own fate,

125
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,070
let alone influence a nation.

126
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,950
If you were in such a position,

127
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,750
and had a daughter like Bao Si,

128
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,360
would you help her escape?

129
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Are you here

130
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,560
for my daughter's matter?

131
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
I've heard

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,430
you have an only daughter

133
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,600
named Yao Wangshu,

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
who was forcibly married to Duke Qi.

135
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,510
Duke Qi is known for being cunning

136
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,120
and domineering in the Capital for years.

137
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,920
Your daughter has suffered for years.

138
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,630
I do have a way to help her escape.

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,600
As they say, no reward without effort.

140
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,830
If you've come

141
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,510
to offer me a favor in exchange

142
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,390
for withdrawing my petition,

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,760
then,

144
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,040
I cannot comply.

145
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,110
Guards.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
See them out.

147
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,640
Master,

148
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,080
Ms. Yao sent word again earlier,

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
saying the days are unbearable

150
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,450
and begs you to save her.

151
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,360
He's impervious to persuasion.

152
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,240
It won't be easy to persuade him.

153
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,670
Not exactly.

154
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,630
If he were a selfish man,

155
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,150
this would indeed be difficult.

156
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,150
But if he only fears Duke Qi's power

157
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,200
and does not dare act,

158
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,360
then there is still a chance.

159
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,510
We cannot simply offer Ms. Yao
a temporary escape.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,170
We must help her break free
from Duke Qi entirely.

161
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go to Duke Qi's Mansion.

162
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,220
(Duke Qi)

163
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,460
(Zhuiyue Pavilion)

164
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,700
(Yao Wangshu, Yao Zhidong's only daughter)

165
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,630
Does it resemble?

166
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,750
The late Duchess was unmatched.

167
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,510
For others to imitate her,

168
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,720
it would take time.

169
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,720
The teapot must be placed only

170
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,870
when the fire is blazing hot!

171
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,910
Is it blazing yet?

172
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,780
I've taught you,

173
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,200
yet you still can't learn.

174
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,270
You've been here over three months,

175
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,360
and I've given you nothing but luxury.

176
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,080
I only ask you

177
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,080
to act and behave like Yingyue

178
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,600
in every manner and step.

179
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,840
Yingyue was thorough in everything,

180
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,720
especially skilled in tea-making.

181
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,360
Why can't you do it?

182
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,000
Because I'm not her!

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm Yao Wangshu!

184
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,390
Wrong!

185
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,630
You are Pei Yingyue!

186
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,120
You're my Yingyue!

187
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,870
Yingyue.

188
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,870
Yingyue.

189
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,550
I'm sorry. Did it hurt?

190
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
The talisman water.

191
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,150
I won't drink it.

192
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,360
I won't.

193
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Please.

194
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm begging you.

195
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,510
I don't want to act as her.

196
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,750
Please, I don't want to.

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,870
Speak. Answer me.

198
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,000
What's your name?

199
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,590
I'm

200
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,680
Yao

201
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,680
Wangshu!

202
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,130
- Sir, Fu Yunxi from…
- Pei Yingyue!

203
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,910
Leave!

204
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,750
No visitors!

205
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,820
(Duke Qi's Mansion)

206
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,670
Please return.

207
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
His Highness is occupied

208
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
and cannot meet visitors.

209
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I've heard

210
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,200
Duke Qi keeps a close watch on Yao Wangshu.

211
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,550
If we can't enter his residence,

212
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,440
it may be hard to meet her and plan.

213
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,150
It's no ordinary official's residence.

214
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,000
We cannot force our way in.

215
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,670
We must find some excuse.

216
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,380
Do you have any case

217
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,650
that can be used as a pretext?

218
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,870
Even if we offend him first,

219
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,240
we can apologize later.

220
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Then we might naturally get in.

221
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,350
Lingzhi.

222
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,350
- What's up?
- Father,

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,910
I heard Mr. Zheng opened a private school.

224
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,910
The boys are going.

225
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,200
I want to go, too.

226
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,840
Do you want to study there?

227
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,150
Can you take me there today, Father?

228
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,990
Please?

229
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,150
Be careful, Lingzhi.

230
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,480
You kicked the ball into the water.

231
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
Go get it back for me.

232
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,270
It wasn't me. It was you.

233
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,120
Everyone,

234
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,200
did he do it?

235
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,960
Yes, it was you.

236
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,240
Hurry up and get in there.

237
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,270
Get in there.

238
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,200
In you go.

239
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,030
You kicked the ball into the water.

240
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,030
Why blame someone else?

241
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
You're so righteous.

242
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,860
Why don't you help him pick it up?

243
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,880
Go on.

244
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,440
- Lingzhi.
- Lingzhi.

245
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,350
What happened?

246
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,480
Who's this ill-mannered girl

247
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,200
- daring to hurt people?
- Are you okay?

248
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,120
This boy had ill intentions first.

249
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
That's why he fell in.

250
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
How dare you? Do you know who he is?

251
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,550
I am Fu Yunxi of the Judicial Review.

252
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,790
If you want to settle this, come find me.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,870
What?

254
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,670
I suggest you prepare a gift

255
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,720
and personally apologize at our mansion.

256
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,750
Let's go home. I'll tell Father.

257
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,120
Father,

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,960
now you can enter Duke Qi's Mansion.

259
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,390
That's the heir of Duke Qi?

260
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,670
That's right.

261
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Aunt Hanyan, I'm amazing, right?

262
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,000
Thank you, Lingzhi.

263
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,200
Fu greets Your Highness.

264
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,440
Zhuang greets Your Highness.

265
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,790
How dare you indulge your daughter

266
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,080
to hurt my heir?

267
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,600
Do you know…

268
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,720
Are you

269
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,790
Fu's wife, Zhuang Yanhan?

270
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,000
Your Highness, I am Zhuang Hanyan.

271
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,590
It's alright.

272
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,530
My daughter, Lingzhi, is quite mischievous.

273
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,440
She intended to play with the heir,

274
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,270
but accidentally knocked him over,

275
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,670
causing him to fall into the pond.

276
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,150
Zhuang's lineal daughter from Danzhou.

277
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,910
I've heard of you.

278
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,390
This is entirely our fault

279
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,720
for poor parenting.

280
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,270
We have come today to apologize.

281
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,570
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

282
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,080
I heard the Duchess studies the art of tea.

283
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,030
Though I'm not skilled, I know a bit.

284
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,550
May I have the honor to share tea with her

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,550
to make peace?

286
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,080
You know the art of tea?

287
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
My mother was renowned
for her mastery of tea.

288
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,270
I learned some from her.

289
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,080
I see.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,750
My wife must learn from you.

291
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,390
Come.

292
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,320
Please follow me to the garden.

293
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,940
(Zhuiyue Pavilion)

294
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,870
Please, have a seat.

295
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,550
Sir, the Duchess shuts herself
in her chamber.

296
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,870
I called for her many times,

297
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,240
but she refuses to see any guests.

298
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,150
She refuses?

299
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Very well.

300
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
I'll go get her myself.

301
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,710
Your Highness,

302
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,630
I apologize for our abrupt visit.

303
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,510
We shouldn't have troubled the Duchess.

304
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,720
Nor do we wish to upset you both.

305
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,080
Perhaps my wife should seek a visit,

306
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,870
and we can wait here for a moment.

307
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,000
It was improper of me.

308
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,960
I should invite her myself.

309
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,870
Your Highness, would you allow it?

310
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,110
Fine.

311
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,270
Take Mrs. Fu there.

312
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,510
Yes.

313
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:57,660
(Fragrant Tea Melody)

314
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,390
Madam,

315
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,000
Mrs. Fu has come to visit.

316
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Madam?

317
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,240
Mrs. Fu, you...

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,510
Wait outside.

319
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,440
Who are you?

320
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,240
Are you trying to take your own life?

321
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,580
What does it matter to you?

322
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,350
Mr. Yao has only one daughter.

323
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,110
If he knew about this,

324
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,790
he'd be heartbroken.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,840
Are you

326
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,270
sent by Father?

327
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,960
I did visit the Yao Mansion yesterday.

328
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,640
Did Father come up with a plan

329
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,270
to get me out of here?

330
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,030
Perhaps you could tell me first,

331
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,670
how does the Duke

332
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,240
really treat you?

333
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,790
He's obsessed with his late wife, Lady Pei.

334
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,110
He makes me imitate her,

335
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,160
orders me to learn tea-making,

336
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,000
and forces me to drink talisman water.

337
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
If I don't comply,

338
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,590
he resorts to violence.

339
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,550
I'm a person.

340
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,830
Not an animal.

341
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,160
I'm not his plaything.

342
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,310
If Father doesn't find a way to save me,

343
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,650
I'd rather face death

344
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,030
than endure this humiliation.

345
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,440
What's talisman water?

346
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,880
After Lady Pei passed away,

347
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,750
Duke Qi met a Taoist

348
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,880
named

349
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,510
Taoist Master Duan.

350
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,640
He spread deceitful words,

351
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,400
claiming that by marrying another woman,

352
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,440
having her drink soul-summoning
talisman water every 10 days,

353
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,960
and making her assume Pei's identity.

354
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,200
Once she had consumed nine doses,

355
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,400
there'd be a chance Pei might return.

356
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,030
Such absurd superstition.

357
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,000
Yet he believed them completely.

358
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,310
It's Taoist Master Duan again.

359
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,550
The rumors outside are barely a fraction.

360
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,600
Ma'am, you've endured so much.

361
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,680
Who exactly are you?

362
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,790
Did Father truly send you here?

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
All you need to know

364
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,640
is that I came to help you escape.

365
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,350
Duke Qi is of royal blood,

366
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,550
and I am now his wife.

367
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,070
Even my father wouldn't dare go against him.

368
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,750
How could you possibly help me?

369
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,960
Seeking death is easy; survival is harder.

370
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,240
If you truly don't fear death,

371
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
do you dare take a risk?

372
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,030
You resemble her more than I do.

373
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,280
Who?

374
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,960
Her name was Pei Yingyue.

375
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,310
She was the late wife of the duke.

376
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,200
You don't

377
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,480
look exactly alike,

378
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,400
but the coldness in your eyes

379
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,960
is quite similar.

380
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,390
Ma'am,

381
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,510
I ask you just one thing.

382
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,640
If there's even the slightest chance,

383
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,110
would you take it?

384
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,400
What is your plan?

385
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,120
Rather than go against the tide,

386
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,640
why not ride the current instead?

387
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,000
Mrs. Fu is truly skilled in tea art.

388
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,720
Even the teaware is exquisite.

389
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,000
As I understand,

390
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,960
she's not your first wife.

391
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,410
No.

392
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,400
My late wife was Zhuang's eldest daughter.

393
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,030
You must miss your late wife,

394
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,640
thus you married her younger sister.

395
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,400
The past cannot be changed.

396
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,000
Now, I only treasure the present.

397
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,100
(Zhuiyue Pavilion)

398
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,720
Mrs. Fu, how's it going?

399
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,160
The Duchess seems troubled.

400
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
She doesn't wish to speak much with me.

401
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
I've tried to comfort her,

402
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,550
but she refuses to listen,

403
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,890
even threatens to suicide.

404
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,550
Truly,

405
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,310
she doesn't know how fortunate she is.

406
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,030
Mrs. Fu, what do you mean?

407
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,920
I heard the late Duchess died of illness.

408
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,560
Yes.

409
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
The day before Mid-Autumn that year,

410
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,480
we planned to admire the moon together.

411
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,910
Sadly,

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,670
she couldn't make it through that night.

413
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,480
Leaves fall after the frost.

414
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,920
A lone bird flies without its mate.

415
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,310
You mourn your beloved wife,

416
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,750
never forgetting your love.

417
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,590
Such devotion is rare.

418
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,350
If all women

419
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,110
could find husbands like you,

420
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,310
there'd be no poems of longing.

421
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,030
All these years,

422
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
only Ms. Zhuang eased my sorrow.

423
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,680
People are often unfaithful,

424
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,750
forgetting old love for new ones.

425
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,920
A new bride replaces the late wife.

426
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,270
My sister's tablet is at Fu Residence,

427
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,550
but it's covered in dust.

428
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,380
No one maintains the offerings.

429
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
Ms. Zhuang is now a new bride,

430
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,550
how can you expect him to recall the past?

431
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,920
Seasons change, year by year,

432
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,790
new faces become old memories.

433
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,270
I just realize

434
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,920
today's scene shows me the future.

435
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,590
I've spoken too much.

436
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,750
Please don't blame me, dear.

437
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,270
Words that come from the heart

438
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,270
cannot be called misspoken.

439
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,510
We've disturbed you long enough.

440
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,750
My wife and I will take our leave.

441
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,160
Maybe I can

442
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,920
learn tea art from you some other day.

443
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,880
Thank you for your favor.

444
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,590
I dare not refuse.

445
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,220
(Duke Qi's Mansion)

446
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,240
What scheme are you plotting now?

447
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,920
I've told you many times

448
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,420
to get a bigger carriage,

449
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,310
but you won't listen.

450
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,120
It's so cramped.

451
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,240
The bumpy ride home is unbearable.

452
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,920
Why not

453
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,550
let me send a carriage for you?

454
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,160
Forgive me, Your Highness.

455
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,400
We wouldn't dare trouble you.

456
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,270
Hurry up and leave.

457
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,070
Send someone to investigate

458
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,310
how their marriage truly is.

459
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,520
Yes, sir.

460
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,640
Do you want to marry the Duke

461
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,310
to bring out Ms. Yao?

462
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,750
What if I really mean it?

463
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,830
What are you planning?

464
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,920
Just putting on a show.

465
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,830
What's the next act?

466
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,440
Next,

467
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,240
Pei Yingyue takes the stage.

468
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,440
Yingyue,

469
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,270
among all the women,

470
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,830
even if some may resemble you,

471
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,030
none can compare to you at all.

472
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,870
Sir!

473
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,830
Something terrible happened!

474
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,160
The Duchess attempted again.

475
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,590
Quick, get the talisman water.

476
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,430
Alright.

477
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,860
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Wife, Pei Yingyue)

478
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,520
Yingyue.

479
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,910
Yingyue.

480
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,160
Yingyue.

481
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,400
Don't die. Stay with me.

482
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,680
The talisman water!

483
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,080
Yingyue!

484
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,590
Don't leave me.

485
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,790
Just one more dose.

486
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,550
You'll be Yingyue.

487
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Yingyue.

488
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,240
The talisman water! Now!

489
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,520
Hurry!

490
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,560
Yingyue.

491
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,800
Yingyue.

492
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,840
Yingyue.

493
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,880
Imperial Physician.

494
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,510
Summon the physician!

495
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Ma'am, you're awake.

496
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,400
I will inform the Duke.

497
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,720
Honey.

498
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,240
Honey.

499
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,150
Yingyue?

500
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,590
Honey,

501
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,550
you've lost weight.

502
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,910
You...

503
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,880
Why the panic on your face?

504
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,070
Is it because I've been sick too long?

505
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,720
Do I not look good anymore?

506
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,950
You...

507
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,400
Are you really Yingyue?

508
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,920
Of course.

509
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,030
Who else could it be?

510
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,280
Well...

511
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,310
Did I sleep too long?

512
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,110
Has Mid-Autumn Festival passed?

513
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,750
Why has the Osmanthus lost its scent?

514
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,000
Ordinary folks

515
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,440
often indulge in wine.

516
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,440
Who understands tea's aroma?

517
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,200
I hold a bowl in vain…

518
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,830
To offer it to tea lovers.

519
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,590
It's the poem we recited together

520
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,960
when we first met over tea.

521
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,270
How did you...

522
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,160
Yingyue, is it really you?

523
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,640
You've returned.

524
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,160
I've missed you so deeply.

525
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,550
Honey, what happened?

526
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,110
Yao Wangshu?

527
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,640
Have I truly

528
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,830
been gone for three years?

529
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,030
That wretched woman

530
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,200
dared to smash your tablet

531
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,240
and take her life before you?

532
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,520
However,

533
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
because of this,

534
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,800
you were able

535
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,750
to be reborn in this body.

536
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,200
Taoist Duan was right indeed.

537
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,870
In this world,

538
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,480
there are such wonders.

539
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,680
It must be your true devotion

540
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,830
moved the King of the Underworld.

541
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,310
That's why I was revived.

542
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,960
From now on,

543
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,790
we shall

544
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,070
never part again.

545
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,280
Yes.

546
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,040
You and I

547
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,750
shall never be parted again.

548
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,260
(Waiting for the Moonlight)

549
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,350
Am I beautiful?

550
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,280
You…

551
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,720
Are you human or ghost?

552
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,560
Honey,

553
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,070
I fortunately revived,

554
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,590
not knowing how long I'll stay.

555
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,400
This can't last forever.

556
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,880
I thought a lot.

557
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,640
If you and I journey together
to the underworld,

558
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,440
we'll never part, even in death.

559
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,520
Honey,

560
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,030
will you journey with me?

561
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,310
Nonsense.

562
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,880
This butterfly hairpin is our love token.

563
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,110
Let's use it to cut our throats

564
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,960
and die together!

565
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,430
No! Help!

566
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,030
The Duchess has lost her mind!

567
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,510
Fortune telling.

568
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,840
- Sir.
- Never fails.

569
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,200
Let's return home.

570
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,050
- She's looking for you.
- Fortune telling.

571
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,070
- Shut up.
- Never fails.

572
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,920
I don't care.

573
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,920
Fated one, please stay.

574
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,110
Who are you?

575
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
She's still the same person she was.

576
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,510
But things have changed now.

577
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,830
You're entangled in old ties,

578
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,550
but they are not true bonds.

579
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,000
Trouble may be coming.

580
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,070
What do you mean by that?

581
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,520
This…

582
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,200
cannot be revealed.

583
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,960
This must not be revealed.

584
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,640
Fortune telling. Never fails.

585
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,590
Fortune telling. Never fails.

586
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,430
Let's go home.

587
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,100
(Duke Qi's Mansion)

588
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,340
Your Highness,

589
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,090
half the Capital is talking about it today.

590
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,240
It's said Fu Yunxi and Lady Zhuang

591
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,080
had a fight at home.

592
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,860
He declared to divorce her and remarry.

593
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
What is the cause?

594
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,480
Fu Yunxi wants a concubine,

595
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,430
but Lady Zhuang refuses.

596
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,000
They've been arguing,

597
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,110
growing more distant.

598
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,200
Sir, Lady Zhuang sent a visit letter,

599
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,180
seeking guidance on the tea art
from the Duchess.

600
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,540
(To Duchess Qi)

601
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,310
Granted. Take her to the garden.

602
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,720
Also,

603
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,790
lock the Duchess in the annexe.

604
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,480
Without my permission,

605
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,000
she must not leave freely.

606
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,320
Understood.

607
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,300
(Zhuiyue Pavilion)

608
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,590
I used the tea set on my own.

609
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,830
Please forgive me.

610
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,310
Where is the Duchess?

611
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,240
She's unwell and resting.

612
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,030
I haven't tasted your tea yet.

613
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
There are three ways to brew tea.

614
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,510
Which one would you prefer?

615
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,080
The high method.

616
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,110
Then I'll draw water at a brisk boil

617
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,590
to protect the tender leaves.

618
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,190
Tender tea leaves can't stand boiling water.

619
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,000
Just as a companion
who is not the right one

620
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,320
would be

621
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,590
so tormenting.

622
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,920
You hold brilliance, unlike others,

623
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,320
thus, understanding tea and hearts.

624
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,320
Wise birds choose strong trees.

625
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,960
Why not seek a better branch?

626
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,630
I insisted on marrying Fu,

627
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,760
which led to a rift with my father.

628
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,150
If I were to part ways now,

629
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,400
I fear

630
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,280
I'd have nowhere to go

631
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,630
and no branch to perch on.

632
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,800
That's not a problem.

633
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,070
I will marry you.

634
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,440
Sir, do you truly mean it?

635
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,840
As for the Duchess…

636
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,630
If you're marrying me,

637
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
casting her aside

638
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,030
is not a big issue.

639
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,680
It's…

640
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,840
Do you still have doubts?

641
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,550
To have you as a confidant

642
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,110
is already enough for me.

643
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,190
Though I barely know the Duchess,

644
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,190
I can't bear to see her
cast aside because of me.

645
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,280
Perhaps you should write a divorce letter

646
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,440
to preserve her dignity.

647
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,550
As you wish.

648
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,740
(Divorce Letter)

649
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,400
Sir, the Duchess refuses to go to the annexe

650
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
and insists on seeing you.

651
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,070
She forced her way out.

652
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,910
Useless.

653
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,260
You cannot even stop a woman?

654
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,890
She's holding a hairpin to her throat.

655
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,230
We dared not stop her.

656
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,190
Honey.

657
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,800
Honey.

658
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,230
I missed you so terribly.

659
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,430
Honey.

660
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,840
Honey.

661
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,880
Do you really not want to see me?

662
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,230
(Divorce Letter)

663
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,320
Honey!

664
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,280
Move aside. Let me in.

665
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,500
(Zhu Qin)

666
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,630
Honey.

667
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,470
Hurry.

668
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,260
- Get her out.
- Honey, come out.

669
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,710
Don't let her get in here again.

670
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,550
Yes.

671
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,800
I'll die before you!

672
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,590
- Honey!
- Ma'am.

673
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,390
His Highness decided to divorce you.

674
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,710
Take the divorce letter and go.

675
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,620
(Divorce Letter)

676
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,280
If she refuses to leave,

677
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,710
just carry her out.

678
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,140
Don't bother me again.

679
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,520
Sir,

680
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,060
the Duchess took the divorce letter

681
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,400
and left on her own.

682
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,800
She's gone?

683
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,910
Yes.

684
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,280
She didn't make a scene?

685
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,280
No.

686
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,740
This is not right.

687
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,760
Quickly.

688
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,880
Stop her.

689
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,760
Bring her back!

690
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,160
Yes, sir.

691
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,030
I can't repay your great kindness.

692
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,480
Thank you both.

693
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,160
No need to be formal.

694
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,230
Ma'am, wait.

695
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,120
His Highness asks you to return.

696
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,760
Hurry. They might suspect something.

697
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,700
- Ms. Yao.
- Ma'am.

698
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,030
As we agreed before,

699
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,400
- I'll help you escape,
- Ma'am.

700
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,000
- but I'm going
- Ma'am.

701
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,280
- to keep the letter.
- Open up.

702
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,510
- Why do you
- Ma'am.

703
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,800
- need this?
- Ma'am.

704
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,870
- You'll understand when you reach home.
- Ma'am.

705
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,730
- Give me.
- Open up.

706
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,280
Ma'am, His Highness asks you to return.

707
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,180
- It's locked?
- Open up.

708
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,050
Let's go.

709
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,550
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

710
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
- Why is it locked?
- Ma'am.

711
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,450
His Highness asks you to return.

712
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,510
(Yu Pavilion, Yao Residence)

713
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,550
Ms. Yao is back.

714
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,910
- Father.
- Master.

715
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,390
- Ms. Yao is back.
- Wangshu.

716
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,350
Father.

717
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,030
- Wangshu.
- Father.

718
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,390
Wangshu.

719
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,670
Father.

720
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,510
Wangshu,

721
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,150
how did you return?

722
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,630
Thanks to the Fus' help.

723
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,920
I escaped from that nightmare.

724
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,930
Father,

725
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,550
Duke Qi has written the divorce letter.

726
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,000
I am free now.

727
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,240
You don't need to fear him taking me back.

728
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,150
You are truly impressive.

729
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,070
You really saved my daughter.

730
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,710
Mr. Yao, no need to thank us.

731
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,070
Father,

732
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,480
Mrs. Fu not only advised me,

733
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,950
but also pretended
to accept Duke Qi's proposal.

734
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,710
That's why he agreed to the divorce.

735
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,370
I'm afraid in the future,

736
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,000
he might trouble the Fu Family.

737
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,000
Mrs. Fu…

738
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,110
This success is due

739
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,190
to Ms. Yao's strategic planning.

740
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,110
It wasn't just my effort.

741
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,840
You helped my daughter

742
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,400
to make me withdraw, right?

743
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,320
Through this matter,

744
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,210
I understand

745
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,790
you are not a rigid and heartless person.

746
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,320
Nation's stability

747
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,840
may fall to tyrants or corrupt officials,

748
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,360
but never to a woman

749
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,030
trapped in the palace.

750
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,150
Yet, scholars

751
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,550
embellish the emperor's reign,

752
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,070
none write for women.

753
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,840
That's why history's filled
with demonized consorts

754
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,150
and slandered women.

755
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,920
I believe,

756
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,880
you know the truth, Mr. Yao.

757
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,070
Mr. Yao,

758
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
you cherish your daughter,

759
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,670
but Noble Consort Miao also has parents

760
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,280
and is cherished by them too.

761
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,670
I trust today,

762
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,440
you can empathize with us

763
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,680
and understand our feelings.

764
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,320
Allow me to bow to you both.

765
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,350
Mr. Yao,

766
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,710
please do not humble yourself.

767
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,870
I am

768
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,030
truly ashamed as a father.

769
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,480
Back then,

770
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,630
I did not dare oppose Duke Qi,

771
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,670
fearing that my daughter's situation

772
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,880
would worsen.

773
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,840
Thus,

774
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,190
I did not know how to act.

775
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,920
If Duke Qi

776
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,670
dares trouble the Fu family,

777
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,800
I will face any danger without hesitation.

778
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,240
However,

779
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,070
regarding the joint petition,

780
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,820
I can only delay for now.

781
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,440
If the Noble Consort Miao harbors ill intent,

782
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,510
I won't stand by and do nothing.

783
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,660
What do you think?

784
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,670
I've inquired about it.

785
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,870
These past few days,

786
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,760
no one has submitted petition against her.

787
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,920
Since that's the case,

788
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,510
we don't need the divorce letter.

789
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,820
Send it to the Yao Family.

790
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,760
Once Noble Consort Miao hears the rumors,

791
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,330
she will surely become suspicious.

792
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,590
I'll find a way to let her know

793
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,320
the success is thanks to your support.

794
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,320
I must gain an audience
with Noble Consort Miao soon.

795
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,190
I need to see her in the palace.

796
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,990
You will.

797
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,920
I've asked an attendant
to pass the message.

798
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,070
We'll hear back soon.

799
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,880
Ma'am, Master,

800
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,070
Duke Qi sent another invitation.

801
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,310
With Noble Consort Miao's protection,

802
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,370
even if Duke Qi acts arrogantly
in the Capital,

803
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,510
he's not a threat.

804
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,840
As usual, tell them Mrs. Fu is unwell.

805
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,320
Yes, sir.

806
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,670
Your Highness,

807
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,260
Mrs. Fu claims to be ill

808
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,190
and won't see visitors.

809
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,680
Visitors?

810
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,190
In just a few days,

811
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,400
I've gone from a confidant

812
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,320
to a mere visitor?

813
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,860
Your Highness, don't get angry.

814
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,710
Please take care.

815
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,030
What about that wretched Yao?

816
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,160
The Duchess…

817
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,690
Yao is now hiding in her chambers.

818
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,840
Mr. Yao is arranging a marriage for her,

819
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,740
likely trying to marry her off

820
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,710
and end your hopes.

821
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,920
Wretched women! Both of them!

822
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
They conspired to deceive me.

823
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,070
It's completely outrageous!

824
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,190
Do they think I'm easy to fool?

825
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,430
- Excuse me.
- Get lost!

826
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,280
Fu Yunxi!

827
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,470
Zhuang Hanyan!

828
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,920
Come out here!

829
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,120
Fu Yunxi!

830
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,070
Your Highness,

831
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,400
what brings you here?

832
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,920
Fu Yunxi,

833
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,600
I heard you want to dismiss your wife
and remarry.

834
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,960
Today,

835
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,880
I shall witness it for you.

836
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,920
Write the divorce letter now

837
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,150
to cast Ms. Zhuang out.

838
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,430
Couples argue but then reconcile.

839
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,030
Harsh words should not be taken seriously.

840
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,110
Serious or not,

841
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,880
I have made up my mind today.

842
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,320
I will turn this pretense into reality.

843
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,480
This divorce letter.

844
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,320
Will you write it

845
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,480
or not?

846
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,760
What if

847
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,350
I won't?

848
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,240
Then you are courting disaster.

849
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,550
As the saying goes,

850
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,800
better to tear down a temple than a marriage.

851
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,960
Sir, you are truly warm-hearted.

852
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,590
Forcing someone to divorce in their own home.

853
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,480
Mrs. Fu, you truly are formidable,

854
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,360
daring to show yourself.

855
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,760
I have neither forced anyone to marry,

856
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,070
nor bullied a helpless woman.

857
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,760
Why wouldn't I show myself?

858
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,720
You…

859
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,880
Your Highness, though noble,

860
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,440
must also follow the rules of propriety.

861
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,960
It's best not to escalate this matter.

862
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,000
If this matter escalates,

863
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,880
it will only harm your reputation.

864
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,190
Fu Yunxi,

865
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Zhuang Hanyan,

866
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,030
today

867
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,480
is your end!

868
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,960
Under the Emperor's rule,

869
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,960
you abuses power,

870
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,280
mobilizing private soldiers.

871
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,800
Don't you fear the court's wrath?

872
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,340
I shall kill you both.

873
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,880
Any consequences,

874
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,880
I alone shall bear!

875
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,070
Get them!

876
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,570
Stop.

877
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,260
(Eunuch Feng,
Chief Eunuch of the Imperial Stables)

878
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,280
Duke Qi.

879
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,630
Eunuch Feng?

880
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,590
Why are you here?

881
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,460
Where is Mrs. Fu?

882
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,840
And you are…

883
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,760
By order of Noble Consort Miao,

884
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,510
Mrs. Fu, Zhuang Hanyan,

885
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,230
is summoned to the palace immediately.

886
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,840
I am Zhuang Hanyan.

887
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,960
I accept the decree.
