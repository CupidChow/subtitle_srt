3
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,730
Why are you wearing
this hairpin again?

4
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,520
It always protects me,

5
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,520
turning danger into safety.

6
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,150
Go.

7
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,010
I'll wait for your good news.

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,470
Fu Yunxi.

9
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,870
What's wrong?

10
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,590
I hope this journey

11
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,240
will lead to a good outcome.

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,460
(Yongkun Palace)

14
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,190
Your Highness, Mrs. Fu is here.

15
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,470
Everyone, leave.

16
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,730
Her Highness has ordered

17
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,280
that no servants are allowed in
without a summons.

18
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,100
(Yongkun Palace)

19
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,510
Greetings, Your Highness.
I'm Zhuang Hanyan.

20
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,560
Zhuang Hanyan,

21
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,680
do you know what is inside this box?

22
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
I have dismissed the servants.

23
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,480
You may speak freely.

24
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,950
I am dull-witted. Please enlighten me.

25
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
In the civilian world, elderly people

26
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,870
who know their time is near

27
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,510
often prepare their coffins in advance.

28
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
I also prepared for myself

29
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,270
this white silk after my return

30
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,270
from the Lantern Festival banquet.

31
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
Your Highness, with your longevity,

32
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,580
you'll live a long and prosperous life.

33
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,510
There's no need
to prepare for your death.

34
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,160
You have saved my life
for the second time.

35
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,230
So?

36
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,830
You must be very pleased with yourself.

37
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,480
Do you think

38
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
that I should thank you, reward you,

39
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,480
and praise you?

40
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,190
I dare not.

41
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,270
Though you are in the Palace,

42
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,830
we women all have our own problems.

43
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,160
What problems do I have?

44
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,720
Go ahead and tell me.

45
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,070
Let me tell you a story.

46
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,730
There was a Noble Consort Chen
in the previous dynasty.

47
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,480
She was greatly favored in the Palace,

48
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,480
and she had many enemies,

49
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,160
yet she could not bear children.

50
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,600
As the Emperor grew old and weak,

51
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,510
she had to find a way

52
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,160
to secure her future soon,

53
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,360
or she would not end well.

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
Since the outcome was determined,

55
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,800
why not take a gamble?

56
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,750
Perhaps she could find a way to survive.

57
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,920
But she underestimated
the fear and suspicion

58
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,950
of all the officials.

59
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,360
They feared a powerful mother,

60
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
the influence of her family,

61
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,670
and her hidden intentions.

62
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,360
They thought she'd emulate Empress Lü
and stir up political chaos.

63
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
Some even died to advise the Emperor,

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
forcing him to have her executed.

65
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,050
But they didn't know

66
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,750
that she only wanted a way to survive.

67
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,240
And then?

68
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,870
This was a high-stakes gamble.

69
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
Her bet was

70
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,950
the Emperor's
lingering affection for her.

71
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,600
But under the persuasion
of the officials,

72
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,920
the Emperor became displeased

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
and grew distant from her.

74
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,680
The Noble Consort Chen
underestimated the officials

75
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
and overestimated herself.

76
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,710
How dare you!

77
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,750
Your Highness,
if you don't like this story,

78
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,040
I will stop.

79
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
What are you trying to say?

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
Previously,

81
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,310
the officials distributed Precepts
for Women to lecture you.

82
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,830
You can order my husband
to investigate this.

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,040
This was secretly
orchestrated by Mr. Yao.

84
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,160
He has stopped now,

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,730
and the Emperor
is no longer pursuing it.

86
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,560
Why investigate it further?

87
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,190
Even pretending to investigate

88
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,430
would be better
than letting it go so easily.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
Otherwise,

90
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,310
don't you fear that others
will follow his example

91
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,750
and cause a stir again?

92
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,740
Once this is resolved,

93
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,560
you just need to stabilize
the Crown Prince,

94
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,830
and you'll be at ease.

95
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,870
Zhuang Hanyan,

96
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,800
you've gone to such lengths
to scheme for me.

97
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,680
What do you want in return?

98
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,310
I want a decree from you.

99
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
What decree?

100
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,070
My father, Zhuang Shiyang,

101
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,800
is now responsible for rewriting
the Comprehensive Encyclopedia.

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,720
He is thus guarded by elite soldiers.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,360
Your Highness, please order him

104
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
to finish it in ten days

105
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,860
and then remove the officers
at Zhuang Residence.

106
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Why?

107
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,290
You need not inquire into the details.

108
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,640
A consort must not interfere
in state affairs.

109
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,390
If this must be handled,

110
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,480
I will have to ask the Emperor.

111
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,670
Why do you think I'd take
such a risk to help you?

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you going to cast me aside
after using me?

113
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,510
This is your wishful thinking.

114
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,630
How can you accuse me of that?

115
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,360
Your Highness, you're now my only hope.

116
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,120
If you stand by and do nothing,

117
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
then I will...

118
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Then what will you do?

119
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,320
Please forgive me

120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,510
for being rude.

121
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,720
Even if you saved her,

122
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,030
are you sure she will help you?

123
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,730
As long as I enter the Palace,

124
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,270
this matter will surely succeed.

125
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,910
I must be summoned
by Noble Consort Miao

126
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,750
and enter the Palace to meet her asap.

127
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,630
Why are you wearing this hairpin again?

128
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,030
It always protects me,

129
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,320
turning danger into safety.

130
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,440
I hope this journey

131
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,840
will lead to a good outcome.

132
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,730
Mr. Fu, please stop here.

133
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,480
Go send a word. Noble Consort Miao...

134
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,240
What's wrong with her?

135
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,240
The Palace

136
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,910
is heavily guarded.

137
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,120
How dare you, a mere woman,

138
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,510
attempt to assassinate me?

139
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,550
I have no other choice now.

140
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,960
I can only take this risk.

141
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,750
What do you want?

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,510
I've done everything I can

143
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,550
to save you from your doom,

144
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,360
so I can enter the Palace to meet you.

145
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,900
If you remember our past and offer help,

146
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,420
it will be a happy resolution for all.

147
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,000
If you refuse to help,

148
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,960
then please call out for help now,

149
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,480
so the servants
will come in and see this.

150
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,840
Your Highness, please

151
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,320
grant me this performance.

152
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,320
Your goal is Zhuang Shiyang?

153
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,600
He deserves it.

154
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,200
Ruan Xiwen, she...

155
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,440
At the Shili Stop
on the outskirts of the Capital,

156
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
she was stabbed multiple times.

157
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,080
I thought

158
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,510
she had finally escaped her cage

159
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
to live the life she wanted.

160
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,630
But I never expected...

161
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,510
I never expected

162
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,600
there would be no winners in the end.

163
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,960
No one ever told me

164
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,000
that polo match from years ago

165
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,960
was to select a consort for the Emperor.

166
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,600
I went to great lengths to win the match

167
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,480
just to win her respect.

168
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,390
At the Lantern Festival banquet,

169
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,480
I asked the imperial physician
to treat her legs.

170
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
Did you think

171
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
I really just wanted her
to kneel before me?

172
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,550
Have you ever thought about this?

173
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,150
It was me

174
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,750
who grew up in the Capital with her.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It was me

176
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,390
who had been entangled with her
in love and hatred for decades.

177
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,600
I studied her tea brewing skills

178
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,320
with great effort.

179
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,440
Even now, I can still recite the poems

180
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,910
she wrote before she got married.

181
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,550
I've always wanted to live like her.

182
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,670
In this world,

183
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,320
I am the one who understands her best.

184
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,920
So,

185
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,440
you are willing to help me.

186
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,480
It's you who failed to protect her.

187
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,790
The hairpin in your hand

188
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,720
should not be pointed at me.

189
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,120
Now, you finally understand

190
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,440
what it feels like to be deceived

191
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,670
after you trust someone.

192
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,790
Zhuang Hanyan,

193
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,750
are you trying to get us all killed?

194
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,720
I only want Zhuang Shiyang dead.

195
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,550
When you hid your identity
as the adopted son

196
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,480
and proposed to me,

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,360
did you ever think that it might kill me

198
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,550
if was exposed in the future?

199
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,320
Since my return to the Capital,

200
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,670
you've been using, manipulating,

201
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,440
and deceiving me, treating me as a pawn.

202
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
Now, you can't stand

203
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,200
the change in our status?

204
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,750
From the moment you agreed to marry me,

205
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,270
you made all your plans, right?

206
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,390
No.

207
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,390
When I asked you

208
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,390
about your connection
to the Pei faction,

209
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,000
I had already made all my plans.

210
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,510
At that time, I was just testing

211
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,790
whether you could be my pawn

212
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,600
and be used by me.

213
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,270
Fu Yunxi,

214
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,510
I want to ask you one more thing.

215
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,160
What?

216
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,840
What is your connection

217
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,120
with the Pei faction?

218
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,750
So, you didn't listen

219
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,360
to anything I said that night.

220
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,910
You told me to remain calm and rational,

221
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,270
plan slowly,
and act when the time is right.

222
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,750
I took all your advice,

223
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
so I made the choice I did.

224
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,000
That's how I succeeded.

225
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,440
I must thank you.

226
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
Zhuang Hanyan,

227
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,840
you've completely gone mad.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,200
I've said it before.

229
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,200
This time,

230
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm making a big bet.

231
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,270
No matter what,

232
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,510
no one will die this time.

233
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,510
If this works, it will also save you.

234
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
In ten days,
you'll be relieved of your duties

235
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,910
and no longer responsible
for protecting Zhuang Shiyang.

236
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,390
If we can kill him this time,

237
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,320
no one will ever know

238
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,510
your identity as the adopted son.

239
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,790
Have you forgotten?

240
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,310
Besides Zhuang Shiyang,

241
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,480
there's one more person
who knows this secret.

242
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,550
Do you want to kill me too?

243
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,720
I just hope

244
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,000
you won't force me.

245
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,510
Remain calm and rational.

246
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,010
This is also my advice for you.

247
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,350
You should know

248
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,270
what to do for your own benefit.

249
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Now, I have Noble Consort Miao's help.

250
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,590
If you want to kill Zhuang Shiyang,

251
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,590
I'm your strongest ally.

252
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,830
If you are smart,

253
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
you should help me
instead of killing me.

254
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,680
What else do you want me to do?

255
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,160
Noble Consort Miao has promised me

256
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,000
that you'll be responsible
for investigating

257
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,200
the printing and distribution

258
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,270
of Precepts for Women
without permission.

259
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,830
Mr. Yao is behind this.

260
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,980
What's there to investigate?

261
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,480
If you take this case,

262
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,940
you'll have free access
to all the key places in the Capital,

263
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,090
including the Department of Supervision.

264
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,780
You want to take this chance

265
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,910
to search the sandalwood box

266
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,590
left by Mr. Yuwen?

267
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,720
Yes.

268
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,590
I want to know

269
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,360
what evidence he left behind,

270
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,680
whether it can be used for my benefit,

271
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,640
and if I can use it
to eliminate Zhuang Shiyang.

272
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
What if I refuse?

273
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,080
My Lord.

274
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,290
Mr. Yan requests your presence
at the Judicial Review.

275
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,990
The Emperor has issued an edict.

276
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,840
Mr. Fu,

277
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,000
with the imperial edict,
you have no choice.

278
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,830
I told you before

279
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,550
that those who flatter the powerful

280
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,830
ultimately wouldn't end well.

281
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,510
Today, you may rely on power to succeed,

282
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,350
but power will also trap you later.

283
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,170
Be careful of your actions.

284
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,700
(Court of Judicial Review)

285
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,070
The Precepts for Women incident
caused quite a stir

286
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,680
and ruined
Noble Consort Miao's reputation,

287
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,110
which also damaged
the Emperor's authority.

288
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,160
Today, there's an edict from the Palace,

289
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,610
ordering you to investigate this case

290
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,750
and find out the mastermind
manipulating public opinion.

291
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,160
Yes, Mr. Yan.

292
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,990
The Emperor has another secret order.

293
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,590
You just need to make some noise.

294
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,920
No need to capture the culprit.

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,920
I understand.

296
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,200
However, to investigate this case,

297
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,980
we'll need to access various
government offices in the Capital

298
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,680
and conduct surprise raids.

299
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,400
I fear there will be many obstacles.

300
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,800
(Earnest Meeting)
The Palace has prepared for this.

301
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,720
This is a badge from the Emperor,

302
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,790
so you may move freely
in all areas without obstruction.

303
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,680
I will not disappoint the Emperor.

304
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,520
My Lord,

305
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,650
shall we go directly to Mr. Yao's house?

306
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,370
Let's go to the Supervision first.

307
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,060
Does this matter also involve
the Supervision?

308
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,720
No more questions. Just listen to me.

309
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
Understood.

310
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,480
(I haven't heard from you for so long.
How have you been?)

311
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,100
Who does Noble Consort Miao
think she is?

312
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,440
How dare she send messages to me

313
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,790
and ask me to spare Fu Yunxi
and Zhuang Hanyan?

314
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,470
Your Highness, please calm down.

315
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,070
Send for the matchmaker.

316
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,350
Your Highness,

317
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,670
the matchmaker has visited
all the eligible ladies

318
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,480
of noble families in the Capital.

319
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,840
What does that mean?

320
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,440
Your Highness, forgive me.
I deserve to die.

321
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,590
I have so many servants here,

322
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,850
but they can't even
watch over a Duchess.

323
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,750
I was even deceived at my home.

324
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm at least a Duke,

325
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,000
but now I've become an old bachelor.

326
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,920
The people in the Capital
will laugh at me.

327
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,070
Even if you have to steal,

328
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,750
you must find me a Duchess.

329
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,750
Yes, yes.

330
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,070
Add something here.

331
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,910
Good.

332
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,270
This part is very well done.

333
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,590
Master.

334
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,310
Have you found out?

335
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,920
Why did Duke Qi let soldiers
to Fu Residence?

336
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,030
It's because of Duchess Qi.

337
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,590
The only daughter of Mr. Yao?

338
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,190
Yes.

339
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,330
I heard that Zhuang Hanyan interfered,

340
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,260
tricking Duke Qi into writing
a divorce letter,

341
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,550
and this enraged Duke Qi.

342
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,200
Why did she meddle in this?

343
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,030
Master, something strange

344
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,880
also happened this morning.

345
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,040
What is it?

346
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,940
Noble Consort Miao ordered

347
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,310
a eunuch to go to Fu Residence

348
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,440
and summon Zhuang Hanyan
into the Palace.

349
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,310
Now, everyone is saying

350
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,480
that Miss Hanyan
is even resourceful enough

351
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,000
to win Noble Consort Miao's favor.

352
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,790
Mr. Yao, Noble Consort Miao...

353
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Master,

354
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,840
the Palace has sent someone
with an edict.

355
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,640
The Emperor has thus ordered:

356
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,830
Zhuang Shiyang has been appointed
as the chief editor

357
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,270
for the Comprehensive Encyclopedia
and the Complete Map of the World,

358
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,400
but it has shown no progress,

359
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,270
showing a sign of dereliction of duty.

360
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,440
Now, all officials at the Hanlin Academy

361
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,240
shall assist Zhuang Shiyang

362
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,550
and get the job done within ten days,

363
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,400
or he will be charged with the crime
of deceiving the Emperor.

364
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,030
I acknowledge my mistake.

365
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
Thank the Emperor for his mercy.

366
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,000
Hanyan,

367
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,480
how have you and Yunxi been lately?

368
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,510
Father, you need not worry.

369
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,400
I've come today just to remind Ms. Zhou.

370
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,640
You shouldn't stay here for long.

371
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,920
You and Yushan

372
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,750
should leave the Capital asap

373
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,720
lest you two be implicated

374
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,640
by someone else.

375
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,070
Hanyan.

376
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,030
I'm still your father.

377
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,350
I...

378
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,070
After ten days,

379
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
you will be like this cup.

380
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,590
Hanyan...

381
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,720
Hanyan, don't leave.

382
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,070
I'm your father after all.

383
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,200
Do you really want
to destroy me completely, Hanyan?

384
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,150
Hanyan,

385
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,590
you have such immense power.

386
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,720
Don't leave. I surrender.
Please spare me.

387
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,880
You can beat me if you want.

388
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,480
I won't utter a word of complaint.

389
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,550
It pains me deeply

390
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,400
that your mother left me.

391
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,110
What are you trying to do?

392
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,100
Mr. Zhuang,

393
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,380
you now have an important task.

394
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,220
In the next ten days, you should focus
on rewriting the encyclopedia

395
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,550
and not leave the residence.

396
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,330
Are you going to put me
under house arrest?

397
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,270
Father, didn't you say

398
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,070
that villains were going to harm you,

399
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,110
and they might even kill you?

400
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,240
The encyclopedia is nearly complete,

401
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,960
so the villains will surely
make another move.

402
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,480
These officers are here on orders
to protect you.

403
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,590
Naturally, nothing will go wrong

404
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,550
at such a critical moment.

405
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,160
Your residence is guarded
by soldiers at both the gates,

406
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,490
and outside the walls,

407
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,960
there are guards every five steps.

408
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,550
In the next ten days,

409
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,880
we will ensure your safety, Mr. Zhuang.

410
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,110
Hanyan...

411
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,120
You've trapped yourself.

412
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,290
This is your own fault.

413
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,110
Master,

414
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,140
what should we do now?

415
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,030
Though I can't leave,
I can ask someone to visit me.

416
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,450
Send someone to deliver a letter for me.

417
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
To where?

418
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,240
To Duke Qi's Mansion.

419
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,310
Aunt, Aunt.

420
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,000
Aunt, you've finally come home.

421
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,110
I've been waiting for you.

422
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,560
Lingzhi.

423
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,160
It's been many days now.

424
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,830
Have you made up your mind?

425
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,390
Lingzhi,

426
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,960
if I tell you

427
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,110
I once did something

428
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,350
that might hurt you,

429
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,680
would you still want me
to be your mother?

430
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,270
How will that hurt me?

431
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,400
I might

432
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,510
make you sad.

433
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,310
Aunt, you've married my father.

434
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,030
If you don't want to be my mother,

435
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,640
that will be the saddest thing for me.

436
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,510
Aunt Hanyan, if you don't want to,

437
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,550
then forget it.

438
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,240
I don't want to upset you.

439
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,790
I just feel

440
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,960
that both of us

441
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,550
have lost our mothers.

442
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,590
When we miss our mothers,

443
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,400
I can hug you,

444
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,960
and you can

445
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,920
hug me.

446
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,590
I never thought about it before.

447
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,510
Both of us have lost our mothers.

448
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Lingzhi,

449
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,240
from today on,

450
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,030
you can call me Mother.

451
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,550
Really?

452
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
Of course.

453
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,030
Mother?

454
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,920
Mother.

455
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,070
Thank you, Aunt Hanyan.

456
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,110
I finally have a mother now.

457
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,960
Mother,

458
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,400
will you play hide-and-seek with me?

459
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
I'll hide in this room.

460
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,350
If you find me,

461
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,240
I have a gift for you.

462
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,000
What gift?

463
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,030
I can't tell you now.

464
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,550
Then go hide.

465
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,520
Mrs. Fu,

466
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,820
Lady Qiu wants you to come
to the front hall.

467
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,480
Yunxi's job has made
many enemies for us.

468
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,200
All these years,
our family rarely attends

469
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,790
social occasions,

470
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,200
and we've often been criticized
behind our backs.

471
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,110
Who would've thought
this day would come?

472
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,140
The Wang family invited us to a banquet,

473
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,460
and the Xie family invited us
to a painting exhibition.

474
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,270
Even your aunt and I
have benefited from this.

475
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
It's all thanks to you.

476
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,070
It's because of Noble Consort Miao.

477
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,480
Her influence has benefited us.

478
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,110
Hanyan,

479
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,200
even some noble families

480
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,750
have sent their invitations.

481
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,310
Since they want to make friends with us,

482
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,350
we shouldn't turn them down.

483
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,160
This will also benefit

484
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,720
Yunxi's future career.

485
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,640
Don't worry, Mother.
I know how important it is.

486
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,470
I happen to have free time these days,

487
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,720
so I'll go meet them.

488
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,590
I heard that Noble Consort Miao

489
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,160
invited you to teach the Princesses.

490
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,830
She asked me to tell some stories

491
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,920
about remarkable women in history

492
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,400
to entertain them.

493
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,550
What stories did you tell?

494
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,240
Last time,
I told the story of The Faithful,

495
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,240
written by Li Bojian,

496
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,310
and later adapted into a storybook
by Huang Tian.

497
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,480
It's about a woman named Meng Wan,

498
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,680
who avenged her close friend Lin Rulan

499
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,880
and brought the villain
Wu Lian to justice.

500
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,110
Hurry and write it down.

501
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,310
Ling, you write it down too.

502
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,230
Mrs. Fu, when you enter
the Palace next time,

503
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,920
what stories will you tell
the Princesses?

504
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,240
I'll tell the story
of the novel Golden Branch.

505
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,940
It's about a slave girl

506
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,200
named Chen Que'er,

507
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,110
who slowly grew into a titled lady.

508
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,200
Write it down. Don't make mistakes.

509
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,310
I think there's no need
for us to write it down.

510
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,110
Why not start a private academy

511
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,160
and invite Mrs. Fu?

512
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,670
That's a good idea.

513
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,920
The Faithful and Golden Branch

514
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,350
are stories only Princesses

515
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,790
are allowed to hear.

516
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,110
I wonder if Mrs. Fu

517
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,070
would allow us to share these benefits.

518
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,790
If you don't mind,

519
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,270
I certainly won't refuse.

520
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,550
Mrs. Fu is truly a role model
for women in the Capital.

521
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,640
Her biological mother

522
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,640
was once the noblest lady
in the Capital,

523
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,790
so naturally,
she's inherited her legacy.

524
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
Here.

525
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,700
(By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees)

526
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,550
The Principal Graduate is He Wenshen.

527
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,200
Congratulations, Mr. He.

528
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,350
Congratulations.

529
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,660
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

530
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,180
- Thanks.
- Congrats, Mr. He.

531
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,680
Congratulations.

532
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,840
Thank you.

533
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,880
Mr. He.

534
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,720
Congrats, Mr. He.

535
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,110
Thank you, thank you.

536
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,480
Madam, Mr. He really topped the exam.

537
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,070
Luckily, the betrothal before

538
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,120
didn't affect his success
in the Imperial Exams.

539
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,920
Madam, you don't look well.

540
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,580
Though I now have power and prestige,

541
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,400
I've made many enemies along the way.

542
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,510
I'm afraid I'll pay the price
in the future.

543
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,720
Justice will prevail.

544
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,610
As long as we have no regrets,
that's enough.

545
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,890
But unfortunately, not everyone

546
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,720
acts based on justice.

547

(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

548
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,740
Zhuang Shiyang.

549
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,550
(Fine and Leisure)
You've raised a good daughter.

550
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,750
She played tricks on me

551
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,400
and deceived the Duchess.

552
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,480
You should've come
to my place to apologize,

553
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,830
while you sent a message
asking me to visit you.

554
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,890
Your Highness, forgive me.

555
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,220
The encyclopedia isn't completed,
and I must obey the imperial edict,

556
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,790
so I can't leave the residence.

557
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,040
As for my daughter,

558
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,720
I did fail in disciplining her.

559
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,510
Since you invited me here,

560
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,790
what matter do you wish to discuss?

561
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,960
I wish to ask you

562
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,070
to save Hanyan.

563
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,400
Zhuang Shiyang,

564
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,980
are you also trying to fool me?

565
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,190
I dare not.

566
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,350
Hanyan has caused great trouble.

567
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,240
As her father, I have no choice

568
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,880
but to seek your help.

569
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,150
What trouble has she caused?

570
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,360
My daughter lost her mind

571
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,760
and chose to serve Noble Consort Miao.

572
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,280
That is a dead end,

573
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,670
and she'll sink with that large ship.

574
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,670
Noble Consort Miao has
the Crown Prince's support.

575
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,550
She'll only rise steadily.

576
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,030
What do you mean by that?

577
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,880
Your Highness, you must know

578
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,280
that the higher one climbs,
the harder the fall.

579
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,190
After the storm,

580
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,700
there are bound to be hidden currents.

581
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,630
Noble Consort Miao
may appear unscathed,

582
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,710
but she's actually
the most vulnerable now.

583
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,900
Her relationship with the Emperor
has already soured.

584
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,230
The senior officials in the court

585
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,800
won't miss this opportunity.

586
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,070
Once there's the slightest disturbance,

587
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,110
even the smallest ripple,

588
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,510
that large ship will surely
capsize and sink,

589
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,710
involving the innocent.

590
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,960
That makes sense.

591
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,710
No matter how I tried to persuade her,

592
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,230
my daughter refused to listen.

593
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,710
I had no choice
but to come to you for help.

594
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,230
Zhuang Shiyang,

595
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,480
no wonder you're still a Junior Compiler

596
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,320
after all these years.

597
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,710
You're so foolish.

598
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,480
Zhuang Hanyan tricked me.

599
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,800
If it weren't for Noble Consort Miao,

600
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,480
I would've killed her long ago.

601
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,030
And now you expose this to me

602
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,190
and ask me to save her?

603
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,070
Do you think

604
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,480
I'll help you?

605
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,920
I've heard rumors

606
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,510
that you once wanted to marry her.

607
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,000
Was it not out of affection?

608
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,440
I liked her, but she deceived me.

609
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,780
That's made her even more hateful.

610
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,830
Your Highness, please show mercy.

611
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,210
My only son passed away,
and I'm left with two daughters.

612
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,000
My daughter, Yushan, remains unmarried,

613
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,000
while Hanyan married
into a prestigious family.

614
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,280
Now, I must rely on Mr. Fu.

615
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,630
You have another daughter?

616
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,030
The one who loves to ride horses.

617
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,510
She looks rather fine.

618
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,590
What do you mean by this?

619
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,190
Zhuang Hanyan has meddled

620
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,230
and tricked my beloved wife,

621
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,280
making me a lonely man

622
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
and a laughingstock in the Capital.

623
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,120
Zhuang Shiyang,

624
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,760
don't you owe me a woman?

625
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,110
I'm ashamed.

626
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,760
I am guilty.

627
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,360
Zhuang Hanyan must die,

628
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,800
and Noble Consort Miao
must be eliminated.

629
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,880
Mr. Zhuang,

630
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,510
if you seek shelter,

631
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,920
I'm far more reliable than Fu Yunxi.

632
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,280
Mr. Zhuang,

633
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,280
think carefully.

634
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,910
Master.

635
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:04,950
Master.

636
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,360
This way. Sit.

637
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,550
I just heard all of that.

638
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,110
Why are you so troubled?

639
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,510
This is great news.

640
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,630
Dear, you don't understand.

641
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,400
Duke Qi has always been unruly,

642
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,750
and his reputation is dreadful.

643
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,680
In recent years,

644
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,760
he's married three or four times.

645
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,760
His wives either died or escaped.

646
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,030
Any family with daughters

647
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,920
avoids him like the plague.

648
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,590
Even if we were to let Yushan marry him,

649
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,550
I'm afraid she wouldn't agree.

650
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,140
As long as you agree,

651
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,760
I'll go persuade Yushan.

652
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,240
Go out.

653
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,200
Yushan,

654
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,230
how can I harm you?

655
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,320
This man is known
for his violent temperament.

656
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,960
Are you trying to push me into the fire?

657
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,630
Life between a couple

658
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,320
depends on whether the woman
knows how to manage her husband.

659
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,230
Don't you know how to overcome
the hard by being soft?

660
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,680
Moreover,

661
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,760
you're no longer young.

662
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
There aren't many choices left for you.

663
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,840
These days,

664
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,230
I've been inquiring

665
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,510
about your marriage prospects.

666
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,000
The families in the Capital
are all so proud.

667
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,590
If you can only be a concubine

668
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,590
in a prominent family,

669
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,510
you will still have to be subservient.

670
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,320
Is that what you want?

671
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,670
Besides, have you considered this?

672
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,360
Zhuang Hanyan has married

673
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,670
the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review.

674
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,400
She's favored by Noble Consort Miao

675
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,800
and mingles with the noble and powerful.

676
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,110
She is now a renowned
noble lady in the Capital.

677
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,190
But Duke Qi is not an ordinary noble.

678
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,480
If you can win his favor,

679
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,110
perhaps you'll be honored with a title
in a few years.

680
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,400
Zhuang Hanyan will have to kneel
before you.

681
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,670
Think carefully.

682
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,480
Since the moment you were born,

683
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,120
though you are a concubine's daughter,

684
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,110
you've been treated
as a lineal daughter.

685
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,320
It was because your father
loved you, cherished you,

686
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,510
and had pity on you.

687
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Now, I'm the madam,

688
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,760
and you are a lineal daughter.

689
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,710
Everything we have

690
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,760
and enjoy now

691
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,710
is thanks to your father.

692
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,480
But now, Zhuang Hanyan is powerful,

693
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,320
trying to cause trouble for your father.

694
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,400
These days,

695
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,030
your father is so worried
that his hair has turned white.

696
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,320
Don't you understand his feelings?

697
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,110
Father...

698
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,360
Yushan, since you became sensible,

699
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,360
I've often told you

700
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,630
your father is the sky for our family.

701
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,190
The more your father loves you,

702
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,440
the more you gain.

703
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,110
If you stand up now,

704
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,200
not only will your future be bright,

705
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,320
but your maternal family
will support you as well.

706
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,360
Think about it.

707
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,110
What a glorious scene that would be.

708
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,920
I've planned so much for you.

709
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,710
You should think carefully
about your future too.

710
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,140
(Being Kind to Others)

711
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,870
Father.

712
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,400
Yushan, you're here.

713
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,840
It's still cold in the spring.

714
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,800
Why didn't you put on another coat

715
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,760
before coming out?

716
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,640
Father,

717
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,420
do you also want me to marry Duke Qi

718
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,630
just like Mother?

719
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,630
How could I willingly do so?

720
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,670
I'm sure you know

721
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,760
what a man Duke Qi is.

722
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,190
Besides, you have no feelings for him.

723
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,320
If you marry him, won't that ruin

724
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,030
your lifelong happiness?

725
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,630
Hanyan didn't grow up by my side.

726
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,950
Our relationship

727
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,000
is full of resentment
instead of affection.

728
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,110
Yuchi has

729
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,920
already passed away,

730
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,150
leaving you alone

731
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,030
by my side.

732
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,710
How could I bear to do this?

733
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,440
Even if I have to risk my life

734
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,030
and sacrifice my future,

735
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,280
I wouldn't want to force you
to marry Duke Qi

736
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,310
and let you regret it
for the rest of your life.

737
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,670
Father,

738
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,190
why have you never told me this before?

739
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,360
If I don't say it now,

740
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,150
I'm afraid there will be no chance
in the future.

741
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,320
Father,

742
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,920
I am willing to marry Duke Qi.

743
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,880
Even if I have no feelings for him,

744
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,480
and even if it sacrifices
my lifelong happiness,

745
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,760
I can't let my selfish desires

746
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,550
put you in a difficult position.

747
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,840
You mustn't.

748
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,030
My mind is made up.

749
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,000
Father, please tell Duke Qi.

750
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,200
Go now.

751
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,440
You are free.

752
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,360
You can go wherever you wish,

753
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,510
but I can no longer stay with you.

754
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,190
I'm letting you go. Can't you hear me?

755
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,480
Stupid horse, foolish horse.

756
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,360
Go!

757
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,480
You no longer have a home here.

758
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,030
This is no longer your home.

759
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,160
Miss,

760
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,480
these are all your cherished belongings,

761
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,760
especially this horse ornament.

762
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,920
Yuchi gave me this

763
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,000
in my hair pinning year.

764
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,680
