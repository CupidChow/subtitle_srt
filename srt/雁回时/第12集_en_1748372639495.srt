10
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,400
All of them are intangible.

11
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,400
Just accept it.

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,480
Just accept that you,

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,440
look behind you.

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:26,040
J

15
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,320

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,680
Come

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,920
To

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
What's wrong with you, Lord Yuwen?

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,760
Haven't you done that yet?

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,920
Minister Luwen

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
If Wenan is suing you, don't hesitate.

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,960
Show them the thunderenind olfactory building.

23
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
That's right

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,360
It was a grave rอะไร

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,960
We must not peek into it

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,920
I already told him

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,520
that in tonight's workshop

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
where there will be twelve heads of personnel

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,240
Pei Da Fu's son and wife

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,080
were hidden among the family members.

31
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,120
If you have any clues,

32
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,960
report them immediately.

33
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,560
Otherwise...

34
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
What if you do?

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,960
You want to kill us?

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,120
No.

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,640
Mr. Deng,

38
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,440
you have no idea.

39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,000
Half of the members of the Hall of Fame

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,840
have been transferred to the Ghost Gate.

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,160
The one who gave me the sword

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,360
is the one who gave me the right to show off.

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,000
After the death of the prince tonight,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,560
every hour,

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,440
I will kill one person.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,960
I will show you

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,720
the identity of the person who was hidden among the family members.

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,640
Mother!

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,320
Mother!

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Mother!

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Mother!

52
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,840
Mother!

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,040
Mother!

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,760
He is innocent.

55
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,040
Right?

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,320
Mother!

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,840
Mother!

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,120
Don't talk, Mother!

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,320
Don't cry.

60
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,240
Don't cry.

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,840
Don't cry.

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I love you, Sister.

63
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
What are you doing?

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
This matter must be related to you.

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Tell me the truth.

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Why do you think it's related to me?

67
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,840
You and Uncle Yuwen had a meeting twice.

68
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
You mentioned something important.

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
A few days ago,

70
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,840
you told me about Yuyan.

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
I will understand soon.

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Since I am now in the Ghost Gate,

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I have noticed that you have hatred for Father.

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,840
But where did this hatred come from?

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Could it be...

76
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,840
you want to take this opportunity

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
to use the identity of Zhu Mu?

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
To kill Father is to kill the son of Pei.

79
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Aunt Chen,

80
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Third Miss was blinded.

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Let her be a little bit more distant.

82
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Third Miss,

83
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
don't make me feel embarrassed.

84
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,840
I am not blinded. You are.

85
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
This is the death of the Ghost Gate.

86
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Shut your mouth.

87
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
I am not blind.

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
I am not blind.

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
I am not blind.

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
I am not blind.

91
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I am not blind.

92
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
I am not blind.

93
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
I am not blind.

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Bu Yunxi,

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
you have been responsible for this case.

96
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
You have been investigating for so long.

97
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
You don't have any clues?

98
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
If I had any clues,

99
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,840
how could I have read this case?

100
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
I think you are hiding it.

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
You dare not investigate.

102
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Even the eunuch in the palace

103
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
said that your father was guilty of his own fault.

104
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,840
It is very likely that he committed suicide because of his crime.

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
This is the only way.

106
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
It is clearly that your father is guilty.

107
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Father's father was guilty.

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
He was not guilty of his own fault.

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
In the capital,

110
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
because of the long and long war,

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
the blood and blood of the people were spilled.

112
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
I heard that many people were disloyal to the court

113
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
because they did not want to take the blame for their crime.

114
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Now,

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
they are taking us as the scapegoats.

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
The debt is in place.

117
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
The capital is in place.

118
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,840
You are still not withdrawing from the court.

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
If that is the case,

120
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Father,

121
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
you should not force yourself to take the blame.

122
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
That's right.

123
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
I do have a secret witness.

124
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Who is she?

125
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
She is in the capital,

126
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
and has a private residence.

127
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
The day before yesterday,

128
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
she received a report from the court

129
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
that someone saw

130
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
a carriage of the Deng family

131
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
in front of Pei's house.

132
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Brother,

133
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
I... I...

134
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Fu Shaoqing,

135
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Pei's husband has been in the imperial family for many years.

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,840
He always likes to be in private and lazy.

137
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
The whole court has accepted his love.

138
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
If we talk about this,

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I'm afraid we will not be able to do anything.

140
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Miss Deng is right.

141
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,840
That is why I am willing to

142
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
take this case first.

143
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Which Xiao Xiao?

144
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
I will take this case.

145
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Good.

146
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Guo Jun is really a good boy.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
You beat your grandfather before this,

148
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
and you are doing this because of the public opinion.

149
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Don't you dare to call me a fool.

150
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
I am a criminal.

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
How can I be a criminal?

152
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
I will kill you.

153
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Let go of me.

154
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Let go of me.

155
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Mr. Yunxi,

156
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
why did you bring us here?

157
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Let go of me.

158
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
What are you doing?

159
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Mr. Yunxi,

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
why did you do this to us?

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Ah Zhi,

162
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
what crime did you do?

163
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Why did you arrest us?

164
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Ah Zhi.

165
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Yunxi.

166
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
What are you doing?

167
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Go away.

168
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Yunxi.

169
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Get out.

170
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Yunxi.

171
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Don't go.

172
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Yunxi,

173
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
don't come over.

174
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
We are fine.

175
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
We are fine.

176
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Zhu Shaoqing,

177
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
the brothers of the family are just doing things.

178
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Can you not resist?

179
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
This is a big crime of killing.

180
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Mr. Fu,

181
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
don't make us feel uncomfortable.

182
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Dad.

183
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Ah Zhi.

184
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Ah Zhi.

185
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Ah Zhi.

186
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Are you all right?

187
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Ah Zhi.

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Ah Zhi.

189
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Don't go.

190
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
It's dangerous.

191
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Thank you.

192
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Yunxi, stop it.

193
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Give me the knife.

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
You want to kill me?

195
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Stop.

196
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Jin Yi,

197
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
if you leave the palace,

198
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
you will be punished.

199
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
What is the imperial decree?

200
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Who has ever read it?

201
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,840
It's all written by Lord Yuwen.

202
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
What is the imperial decree?

203
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Since there is no imperial decree,

204
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
why should we be punished?

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Tonight,

206
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
the imperial decree is to be followed by the officials.

207
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Even if they are not allowed to go,

208
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
they will be punished.

209
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Even if the imperial decree is to be followed,

210
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
they will be punished.

211
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Who is the one

212
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
who is so arrogant?

213
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
He is not allowed to go.

214
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
He is not allowed to go.

215
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Yunxi.

216
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Ah Zhi,

217
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
don't be afraid.

218
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I am here.

219
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Are you hurt?

220
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Are you okay?

221
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Mother,

222
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
please take Ah Zhi to the new palace.

223
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Hurry,

224
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
you and Second Aunt.

225
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Be careful.

226
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Don't move.

227
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Ah Yi.

228
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
You are so stupid.

229
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
You don't know how to help me.

230
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
You should leave Li Qi

231
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
and go to your father's house.

232
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
I want to see Yuwen Chang'an.

233
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Where is he?

234
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Lord Yuwen has some medicine.

235
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
I have no time to see him.

236
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Everyone is going back to the palace.

237
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Otherwise, I will be dead.

238
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I have some information

239
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
about the company's will.

240
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Miss,

241
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
if you have any information,

242
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
just tell me.

243
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
I will take it as a transfer.

244
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
This is a serious matter.

245
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
I am afraid you won't listen to me.

246
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Stop making fun of me.

247
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Go.

248
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Are you okay?

249
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Don't worry.

250
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Thank you.

251
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't want your feelings.

252
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I want to know the truth.

253
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
What truth?

254
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Since you can give Jiajuan a leave,

255
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
it means that

256
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
this will happen.

257
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
If I really know the truth,

258
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
how can I send them out of the capital today?

259
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
I will send them out of the capital.

260
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I will do it.

261
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Aren't you afraid?

262
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
The situation is so bad.

263
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
These public relations

264
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
are in the prison of Dali Temple.

265
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
I don't know how many times I have tried.

266
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Have you ever seen it?

267
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Of course I have a doubt.

268
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Even if the party is the biggest evil,

269
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
even if it is the emperor's own,

270
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
how can I dare to kill Wu Guo so easily?

271
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Moreover,

272
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I still want to change my decision.

273
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
But I am more curious.

274
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
I don't know

275
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
what kind of book that

276
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,840
secret property is in the hands of the emperor.

277
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
It is worth so much to pay for it.

278
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
This case

279
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
is less and less safe.

280
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
It's not like your temperament.

281
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
What should I do?

282
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
My mother and Yuwen Chang'an

283
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
had a meeting.

284
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I told you earlier.

285
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
You can't tell

286
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
that the problem we are in

287
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
is probably their fault.

288
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
I guessed it.

289
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Then why didn't you do anything?

290
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Have you asked

291
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
what's inside from the other party?

292
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
No.

293
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
You are a woman.

294
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
You can't do anything.

295
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
What can I do?

296
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Could it be that

297
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
we can only wait?

298
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
This case is already

299
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
being dealt with by Yuwen.

300
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
We can only wait.

301
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Moreover,

302
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
I also want to see

303
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
what kind of back-up

304
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
this Zhuang's mother is.

305
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
What kind of back-up?

306
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Young master Zheng

307
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
is in a serious condition.

308
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Take him away.

310
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
No.

311
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
No.

312
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Please.

313
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
No.

314
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Please save me.

315
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
No.

316
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Please save me.

317
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
No.

318
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
No.

319
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Yuwen Chang.

320
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Yuwen Chang.

321
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Could it be

322
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
that we really killed them?

323
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Unless

324
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
everyone is in danger

325
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
and is crazy.

326
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
No.

327
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
We can't wait anymore.

328
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
No matter who

329
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
the son of Yu is,

330
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
whether it's for mother's life

331
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
or for myself,

332
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
we can't wait anymore.

333
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
What do you want to do?

334
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Yuwen.

335
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Yuwen.

336
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Yuwen.

337
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Yuwen.

338
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Yuwen.

339
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Yuwen.

340
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
We are going to kill you.

341
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Kill them.

342
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Yuwen.

343
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Yuwen, please hurry.

344
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Yuwen.

345
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Yuwen.

346
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
Yuwen.

347
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Let me go!

348
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Be careful!

349
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Episode 12

350
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Where is Zhou Yuchi?

351
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
He's gone.

352
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
It's your turn.

353
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,840
No! Guan Yi, let me go!

354
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Let me go first. Don't take my Ch'er!

355
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,840
If you want to die, you can't change the rules.

356
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Take her away!

357
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
No!

358
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Don't take my Ch'er!

359
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Don't take my Ch'er!

360
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Don't take my Ch'er!

361
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
I know! I know what you mean!

362
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Who is it?

363
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
There are many people here. Take me out and I'll tell you.

364
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Take her away!

365
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Don't take my Ch'er!

366
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Don't take my Ch'er!

367
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Miss San!

368
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Mistress!

369
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
I'm begging you! Please save my Ch'er!

370
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I'll do anything for you!

371
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
I'll do anything for you!

372
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
I'll do anything for you!

373
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
You really know what you mean.

374
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,840
How did she know that?

375
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
I taught her that.

376
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
It's just to waste time.

377
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Xiao Niang!

378
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
They're all men!

379
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
What's she doing? Get up!

380
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I heard it just now.

381
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
I heard it.

382
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,840
Miss San and Mistress

383
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,840
were fighting behind the scenes.

384
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
So...

385
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
So today's trouble

386
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
is definitely related to you.

387
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Right?

388
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,840
It's definitely related to you, right?

389
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
What did she say just now?

390
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
It's definitely related to who the cause of the trouble is.

391
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Do you know who the Yi Zi is?

392
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,840
It's you, Master Zhuang, right?

393
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Mr. Deng, don't talk nonsense.

394
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Tell me who the Yi Zi is!

395
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Please listen to me.

396
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
We're in a mess today.

397
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,840
The whole world is talking nonsense.

398
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
No matter how law-abiding we are,

399
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
we're still in the royal family.

400
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Even if we're in the palace,

401
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
even if we're facing the emperor and the emperor,

402
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
we must be reasonable.

403
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Why do we have to be so harsh?

404
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Miss San, what should we do?

405
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Right. What should we do?

406
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
I just went out.

407
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
The court is just a matter of ten people.

408
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
And now,

409
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
we're still in the palace with them.

410
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
We're fighting against the enemy.

411
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
We're fighting against the enemy.

412
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Do you wish to go out with me?

413
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Yuwen Chang'an is a great swordsman.

414
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
If we go out, we'll be the resistance.

415
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Why are you so cruel?

416
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
We'll be dead if we're not.

417
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
We'll be dead if we're not.

418
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
You said you'd rather be a soft-hearted man,

419
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
but you're still a coward.

420
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Even if we're dead,

421
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
we'll never be wronged.

422
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
In this palace,

423
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,840
if someone confesses that he's innocent,

424
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
he'll take the chance to take the chance with me.

425
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
If the interrogation is a lie,

426
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,840
we'll rush out to the gate to expose him.

427
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,840
If Yuwen Chang'an knows that he's such a cruel man,

428
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
even if we're dead,

429
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
we'll be the resistance.

430
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Yuwen Chang'an

431
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Sister Zhuang Jia,

432
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
I'll go out with you.

433
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,840
If you're going to die today,

434
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
then don't go out with them!

435
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
I'll go with you.

436
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Hurry up.

437
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Give me a hand.

438
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Give me a hand, please.

439
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Mother.

440
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Give me a hand.

441
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Give me a hand.

442
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Give me a hand.

443
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Give me a hand.

444
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,640
Come on.

445
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
Mother.

446
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,640
No matter what,

447
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,840
you can't die today.

448
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,000
I can't

449
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,200
be so careless.

450
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,000
Mother.

451
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,600
You're going to be executed!

452
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,120
Where is Chang'an?

453
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,040
We need to see him.

454
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,760
Let him out!

455
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,000
We're all dead!

456
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,840
Let him out!

457
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,560
Let him out!

458
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,400
We're all dead!

459
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,560
We're all dead!

460
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,520
Let him out!

461
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,600
We're all dead!

462
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,320
Let him out!

463
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Let him out!

464
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,160
Let him out!

465
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Let him out!

466
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,760
Let him out!

467
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,920
I'm so sorry!

468
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Lord Yuwen,

469
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,240
the court is in charge of the crime of the innocent.

470
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,880
Even if we're to be executed,

471
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,280
we shouldn't be punished.

472
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,360
You're going to put us in this place

473
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,440
and kill us.

474
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,800
What's the point of this?

475
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,080
What's the point of this?

476
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Let him out!

477
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,640
Let him out!

478
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
Let him out!

479
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,520
Lord Chen,

480
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,080
Lord Yuwen, please take care of the three of you.

481
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,920
Let him out.

482
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,520
You're still here?

483
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Miss San,

484
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,400
I underestimated you.

485
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,240
Uncle Yuwen,

486
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,160
you're being honest.

487
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Just now,

488
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
those blood

489
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,920
were human blood

490
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,920
or living blood.

491
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,760
Don't worry.

492
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,000
They're all alive.

493
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,320
But it's a play.

494
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,480
What play?

495
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,240
Who are you talking about?

496
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,520
Everyone.

497
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,320
The Lord of the High God,

498
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,040
the important people in the meeting hall.

499
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
They're not the guilty,

500
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,080
but the witnesses.

501
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,960
What are you doing

502
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,320
with my mother?

503
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,260
Uncle Yuwen,

504
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,460
you haven't grown up society

505
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,720
and you still haven't had

506
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,520
a father you wanted to marry, right?

507
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,920
As for your then акку,

508
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,320
why ask me?

509
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,600
That's right,

510
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,400
all the Magists in the hall

511
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
are in such big trouble,

512
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,640
Хорошо and Wenya

513
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,440
egent Linkatai has begun living happily ever after.

514
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,280
They know

515
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,640
they have their mother

516
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,640
He is going to take his credit for his crime.

517
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
What do you mean?

518
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,640
If you don't tell me the truth,

519
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
I will go back to the hall

520
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,640
and tell everyone I know about him.

521
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
You...

522
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
He is your mother.

523
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
How can you bear to do that?

524
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
How can you bear to do that?

525
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
If you still have feelings for him,

526
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
why would you kill him?

527
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Uncle Yunwen,

528
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
I can probably guess that

529
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
your situation today

530
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,640
is because of your feelings for him.

531
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
You must not want to be serious

532
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
and look down on him.

533
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
While everything is still going on,

534
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
tell me the truth.

535
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Let's find a way together.

536
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
A few days ago,

537
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
the meeting of the Yinan Chamber of Commerce

538
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,640
suddenly passed by and I asked for an audience.

539
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
But the language was not good.

540
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
I was not allowed to do it for long.

541
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
I went to a stall alone.

542
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
After I saw him,

543
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
I asked him.

544
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
He finally admitted his crime.

545
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
He said that over the past ten years,

546
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
there was a man who was a burden to the public.

547
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,640
He used the meeting to clear up the money.

548
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
He designed a huge number of people.

549
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,640
But he was a mysterious figure.

550
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
He only showed up once a year.

551
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
But he was also very serious.

552
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,640
He did not see the face of this man.

553
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,640
He only knew that over the past 40 years,

554
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,640
he was a burden to the public.

555
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
So,

556
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
the two conditions that were met

557
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,640
were the 11 people who were pressure in the palace.

558
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
There are also the 12 of you.

559
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,640
You are Fu Pingsheng, the father of Fu Yunxi.

560
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
He is with Wang Gu,

561
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
and you are also the mastermind of the Yinan Chamber of Commerce.

562
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Therefore, in my first night,

563
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,640
I took the Yinan Chamber of Commerce to the public.

564
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
He personally told His Majesty about this.

565
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,640
His Majesty sent me to investigate this case.

566
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,960
This case has nothing to do with me.

567
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,360
You read this number of times

568
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
about my miscarriage

569
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,620
and it was me that Просто

570
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,460
coll tym.

571
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:34,880
He spend it personally

572
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,680
like a child

573
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,520
I should be held responsible

574
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,040
on behalf of him

575
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,120
and for that government

576
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
to the public,

577
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
be educated

578
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,840
What's the matter?

579
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,600
Even so,

580
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,280
there are 12 suspects now.

581
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,680
How can you put the pot of dirty water

582
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,080
on my father's head?

583
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,280
Miss San.

584
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,880
Sir,

585
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,000
there's a female witness

586
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,440
who's coming to report from the secret line.

587
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,600
Let her in.

588
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,160
Mother.

589
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,360
You told her everything?

590
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,760
Xiwen.

591
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,200
Just listen to me.

592
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,320
Let's forget about this.

593
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,720
Don't be obsessed with it anymore.

594
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,560
You know me.

595
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
Mother.

596
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,840
Even if you want to get rid of me,

597
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,920
won't you

598
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,720
risk your life for me?

599
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,520
Since the day you came back,

600
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,960
I tried to make you out of the window.

601
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,480
You were the one who made me do it.

602
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,200
Why did you put the pot of dirty water on me?

603
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,360
No wonder.

604
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,080
Even if you want to get rid of me,

605
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm sure you'll be punished for it.

606
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,080
You'll be punished?

607
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,160
Then I'll tell you what the general is.

608
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,880
Xiwen.

609
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,480
What are you doing?

610
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,400
What are you doing?

611
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,000
Let go of me.

612
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Let go of me.

613
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,360
Let go of me.

614
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,280
Xiwen.

615
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,600
Open the door.

616
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,680
Miss Sai.

617
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,560
Your mom was not your side.

618
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,000
You did all you could

619
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,560
for herself.

620
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,280
Zhuong's mother is getting away from Xiwen.

621
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,120
We don't allow the안fo Phi-Fu�� Pavilion.

622
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,680
Today they anar ecstatic.

623
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,120
They traded with us

624
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,480
and sold his body for the money.

625
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,800
You are so cruel.

626
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,240
Let'sブロイッチ

627
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,520
Be assumed

628
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,120
As the father of God

629
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,300
We'll go back.

630
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,980
I believe in the directions from your father.

631
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,660
Small L reluctantly materialized

632
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,460
Too, get lost.

633
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,660
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

634
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,660
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

635
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

636
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

637
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

638
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

639
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

640
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

641
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

642
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,660
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

643
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Seize it!

644
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,660
Seize those 데��ą.

645
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,660
You're both in trouble.

646
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,660
I'm sure my氣 could beおиться.

647
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:21,060
The

648
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060
Father,

649
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,060
won't Aunt Han Ye leave?

650
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,060
Don't worry.

651
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,060
She will be fine.

652
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
My lord.

653
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Are you all right?

654
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
I'm fine.

655
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
What's the matter?

656
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
His Majesty ordered

657
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
the four evil spirits to investigate the case.

658
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
The police are here.

659
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
Mr. Yan asked me to find you.

660
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,060
Let's go.

661
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
Yes.

662
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
I'm so sorry.

663
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
I'm so sorry.

664
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
I'm so sorry.

665
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
I'm so sorry.

666
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
I'm so sorry.

667
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Father, you lied to us.

668
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
You don't even know about this, right?

669
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
I don't believe it.

670
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,060
Why did father do this?

671
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
But Yunxi's brother is dead.

672
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,060
He will find out more.

673
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Someone must be the one who framed him.

674
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,060
I'm so sorry.

675
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,060
I'm so sorry.

676
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,060
I'm so sorry.

677
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,060
I'm so sorry.

678
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
I'm so sorry.

679
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,060
Mengmeng.

680
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
You'd better go.

681
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,060
Why did you stay?

682
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
Mother.

683
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,060
I've been so sorry

684
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,060
for you.

685
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,060
I asked you to come here

686
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,060
and you said that

687
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,060
you were a big family.

688
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,060
Now

689
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
you and I are left alone.

690
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
All these years,

691
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
I know

692
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
you are not the only one

693
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,060
who made me a servant.

694
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,060
If you don't mind,

695
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,060
I'll come to see you off.

696
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,060
Yes.

697
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
Lord Yuwen.

698
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Where is my master?

699
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
How did he say?

700
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,060
Zhuang Shiyang is guilty.

701
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
But the evidence is clear.

702
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,060
He doesn't have to admit it.

703
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Just make all the family members

704
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
and bring them to the prison.

705
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
Don't wait until autumn.

706
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Tomorrow noon,

707
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
we will have a full exhibition.

708
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
I'll be back.

709
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,060
Lord Zhuang, Zhuang Shiyang.

710
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
Mother, Wei Shi.

711
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,060
Zheng Qi.

712
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,060
Ruan Xiwen.

713
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,060
I am Zhou Ruying.

714
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,060
I am Zhuang Yushan.

715
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,060
I am Zhuang Yuchi.

716
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,060
Zhuang Shiyang is guilty.

717
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
You have six people.

718
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,060
Take them away.

719
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
What do you mean?

720
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,060
Why didn't you take the exhibition?

721
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,060
According to the plan,

722
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
Zhuang Jia's daughter, Zhuang Hanye,

723
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,060
was exiled from Zhuang City

724
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,060
two years ago.

725
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,060
She was passed on to Danzhou, Nanzhang,

726
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,060
and Zhang Youcheng.

727
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,060
She is not Zhuang Jia's daughter.

728
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,060
Take her away.

729
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Chi'er, Wei Shi.

730
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,060
Chi'er.

731
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
Wei Shi.

732
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Chi'er.

733
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Chi'er.

734
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
Mother.

735
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:43,060
What is all this for?

736
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
I told you before.

737
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
When I was not with you,

738
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
I was in pain.

739
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
I was in pain too.

740
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,460
Mother.

741
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,460
her father was angry and I was in pain.

742
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,860
Tong Chief,

743
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,060
what happened between you and proper family member

744
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,060
Do you have something to report to me now?

745
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Your father,

746
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,220
The answer is the answer.

747
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,540
Let's go.

748
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
There's a sign.

749
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
I'm Zhuang Han Yan.

750
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I went to the east of the Great Yan.

751
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,040
I came to the north of this cold winter.

752
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
I didn't have time to come from the south.

753
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
In this cold winter,

754
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I was in a very cold place.

755
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Maybe I went to the north of the Great Yan.

756
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,040
I was in the cold winter.

757
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,040
I was in the cold winter.

758
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
I was in the cold winter.

759
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
Maybe from the beginning,

760
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
I was wrong.

761
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Who is he?

762
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,040
He is a ghost.

763
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,040
He is silent at night.

764
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,040
He is silent at night.

765
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,040
He is silent at night.

766
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,040
He is silent at night.

767
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,040
How much love and hatred.

768
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,040
Don't be so stubborn.

769
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Who is the fake? Who is the real?

770
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Or do you need someone else?

771
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,040
I'm afraid to be in the middle of the world.

772
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,040
I can't be smiling.

773
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,040
I'm so anxious.

774
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Who can be the last?

775
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
I could not be the last.

776
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,040
I knew how to be the last.

777
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,040
I was afraid to be the last.

778
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,040
I was so anxious.

779
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Who can be the last?

780
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Who is the last?

781
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:06,040
I'm afraid to be the last.
