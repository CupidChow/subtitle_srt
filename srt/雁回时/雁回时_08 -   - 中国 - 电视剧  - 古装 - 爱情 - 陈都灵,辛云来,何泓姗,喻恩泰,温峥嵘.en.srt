00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,100
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,590
Zhuang Hanyan.

4
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,680
(Scholarly Glory)

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,710
It's only been a few days,

6
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,760
and now you're acting
all virtuous and graceful.

7
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,120
This is...

8
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,230
Greetings, gentlemen.

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,320
I am Yang Ping,

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,510
a scholar from Nanzhang Town
in Danzhou.

11
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,950
I live next door
to Mr. Zhang Youchang and his wife,

12
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,000
and have long been acquainted
with Miss Hanyan.

13
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,230
Forgive me.

14
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,240
I didn't notice you earlier, Mr. Yang.

15
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,560
But if I recall,
you failed the provincial exams.

16
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,120
What brings you to the Capital?

17
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,000
I came with fellow townsmen

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,150
to broaden my horizons.

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,150
What's it to you?

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
Of course, it doesn't.

21
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
It's been a while.

22
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,960
Here's a toast to you.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
I wouldn't dare.

24
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,190
Miss Hanyan, please keep your distance.

25
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,360
I fear you might
bite my other ear as well.

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,870
What do you mean?

27
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,080
Mr. Zhuang, haven't you heard?

28
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,630
Miss Hanyan was truly remarkable

29
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,120
back in Danzhou.

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Biting off ears was nothing for her.

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,910
Stealing from the neighbors

32
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,630
and beating up children was also her doing.

33
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,280
She's known as the wild and unruly girl.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
When I saw her just now,

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,220
I didn't dare to recognize her.

36
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,150
How come she's changed completely

37
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,680
since coming to the Capital?

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
She's even acting like a proper lady now.

39
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,030
Not just in Danzhou,

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,190
she was domineering even in our household.

41
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,750
What an embarrassment.

42
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,030
Look at her now.

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,840
Only when leaving the house,

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,190
does she act so pretentious.

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,400
Yuchi.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,280
Mr. Yang, is there some misunderstanding?

47
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,120
- Hanyan is…
- No misunderstanding.

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,520
Everything he said is true.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,710
Beating up children?

50
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,150
That was giving back what I got.

51
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,000
Stealing from the neighbors?

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
That was reclaiming my jewelry
after it was taken,

53
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,080
with nowhere to seek justice.

54
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,960
In a fit of rage,

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,590
I bit off half your ear.

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,310
Was it not because you called me
the Barefoot Ghost,

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,120
stole my shoes and socks,

58
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,030
and forced me to walk barefoot
on thorns and brambles

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,910
until my feet bled for your amusement?

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
I only fought back in desperation.

61
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,080
You've studied classics since childhood,

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,800
yet you took delight
in tormenting a helpless girl

63
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
without even the slightest sense of shame.

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Still sharp-tongued as ever.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,360
I was raised in the rural lands of Danzhou,

66
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,680
lacking proper manners and refinement.

67
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,890
But the Zhuang family is strict and upright,

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,270
and Father is strict
in disciplining his children.

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,560
I've been home but two short months,

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
yet under my father's guidance,

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I've worked hard to shed my old habits,

72
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,830
lest I bring shame upon my parents.

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,300
The ancients said, "A gentleman,
even when parting ways, does not speak ill."

74
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,070
Yet when you saw me today,

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,950
you cast aside propriety

76
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,600
and humiliate me over past grievances.

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,630
Who would dare befriend you after this?

78
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,470
You…

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,510
Mr. Yang.

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
This is a joyful gathering.

81
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,360
Let's not dampen the mood.

82
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,680
Hurry back and enjoy your meal.

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,040
Mr. Zhuang, with such a daughter,

84
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,680
your home may soon know no peace.

85
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,470
How insolent.

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,020
Ms. Zhou,

87
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,300
why did you choose to ride
in the same carriage with me?

88
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,660
For the incident at the banquet,

89
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,020
thank you for stepping up

90
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,180
and saving our family from disgrace.

91
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,220
I'm deeply grateful.

92
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,980
Naturally, I must properly thank you.

93
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,380
No need for the courtesy.

94
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,420
We are family. Don't mention it.

95
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,020
You've suffered injustice today.

96
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,340
Back in Danzhou,

97
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,050
your foster parents should've protected you.

98
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,980
How could they allow that scoundrel

99
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,300
to humiliate you so?

100
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,100
Foster parents have cared for me tirelessly.

101
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,740
I don't want to worry them anymore.

102
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,140
You've always been so thoughtful and caring.

103
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,060
Unlike my two little troublemakers.

104
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,580
The household matters are many,

105
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,020
and it's my first time managing them,

106
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,420
so there are bound to be lapses.

107
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,380
Miss Hanyan, please assist me
whenever you can.

108
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,620
This is all for the sake of our dignity.

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,620
You handle everything with care.

110
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,140
There is no need for me to worry.

111
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,660
It's just that during today's banquet,

112
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Yuchi claimed he's confident
about tomorrow's test.

113
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,660
All the elders are to see his fine work.

114
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,980
You may need to remind him to stay focused.

115
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,020
If he falters, and Father is shamed,

116
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,380
I fear Father's anger may turn on you,

117
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,220
blaming you for poor upbringing.

118
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,980
Thank you for your advice, Miss Hanyan.

119
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,340
This spot is indeed secluded.

120
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,300
Is it convenient for you to live here?

121
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,020
I'm fine.

122
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,700
Why are you here?

123
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,580
Do you remember Yang Ping?

124
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,900
The one whose ear you bit off?

125
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,700
He's in the Capital.

126
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,780
He's staying at the Yinan Guild Hall.

127
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,100
I never expected

128
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,740
I'd run into that scoundrel again.

129
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,100
What's he doing here?

130
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,540
It's likely Ms. Zhou's doing.

131
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,820
Zhou Ruyin?

132
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,820
She sent someone to Danzhou?

133
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,460
I'm just speculating.

134
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,540
Since she already sees me as a rival,

135
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,940
she'd want to know her enemy.

136
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,340
I don't know what other tricks
she has up her sleeve.

137
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,460
Yang Ping has held a grudge for years,

138
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
and he is a threat.

139
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,940
Should we get rid of him first?

140
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,140
Fu Yunxi is watching you.
Don't act recklessly.

141
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,260
But right now, there's another matter.

142
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,860
Today's incident was just an appetizer.

143
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,940
Maybe we don't have to start with the key.

144
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,380
If we aim to bring them down completely

145
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,700
and seize the power in their hands,

146
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,980
we must address the root cause.

147
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,860
That country girl

148
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,620
puts on the airs of a noble lady,

149
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,660
flaunting her pathetic literary skills.

150
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,260
Now she managed to win Father's favor.

151
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,380
Because of her, I'm stuck here studying.

152
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,500
You're acquainted with the frivolous.

153
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,180
Why not spread the word about our

154
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,780
Miss Hanyan?

155
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,940
Find her a husband and marry her off.

156
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,660
Then, she'll stop attracting trouble

157
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,020
and clinging to Yunxi.

158
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,060
Dear sister,

159
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,740
that's not hard at all.

160
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,340
Other girls are flawless,

161
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,580
even under a magnifying glass.

162
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,020
I told you to watch your brother study,

163
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,820
but you're gossiping here.

164
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,300
My sister doesn't know poetry or literature.

165
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
Having her watch over me is useless.

166
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,060
If you had any talent,

167
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,140
Mom wouldn't have sent me here.

168
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,260
Enough.

169
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,900
I've started managing.

170
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,860
The slightest mistake could
be used against me.

171
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,380
The last thing we need is more trouble.

172
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,020
You troublemakers had better shape up!

173
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,940
Shape up.

174
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,140
(Analects, Volume 15)

175
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,620
Regarding tomorrow's test,

176
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,500
are you fully prepared?

177
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,180
Yuchi, sit down.

178
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,300
Here.

179
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,300
Read this passage.

180
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,900
Made him leader of all the princes,

181
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,780
and brought order to the world.

182
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,070
To this day,
people benefit from his gifts.

183
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,580
But for Guan Zhong, we might now

184
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,460
be folding our robes to the left.

185
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,780
What does "brought order to the world" mean?

186
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,740
Mom, why are you suddenly asking this?

187
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,380
Mom,

188
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,060
could it be in tomorrow's test?

189
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,820
You don't need to excel in tomorrow's test,

190
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,860
just handle it calmly and steadily.

191
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,700
Don't disgrace the Zhuang family again,

192
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,820
and don't make your father angry.

193
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,180
Today,

194
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,980
you must not step out of this room.

195
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,630
Work on that phrase

196
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,380
and burn it into your brain.

197
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,680
No more questions.

198
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,580
Yes.

199
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,520
I won't embarrass you, Mom.

200
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,100
Even with this question in hand,

201
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
you still wouldn't know how to answer it.

202
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,340
You always understand me.

203
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,940
If you want my help,

204
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,380
say something nice.

205
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,220
Dear sister.

206
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,140
Dear sister, come on.

207
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,140
Sit.

208
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,620
I'll handle Zhuang Hanyan for you,

209
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,580
just help me one this time.

210
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,420
Deal.

211
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Do you have a plan?

212
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,420
Of course.

213
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,940
Zhuang Hanyan's demeanor.

214
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,380
I can manage that too.

215
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,300
Awesome.

216
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,900
(Yinan Guild Hall)

217
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,700
(Everlasting Glory, Eternal as Sun and Moon)

218
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,140
Mr. He, you're studying hard.

219
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,860
Have some tea and snacks.

220
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,940
You must be Miss Zhuang Yushan.

221
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,690
I dare not trouble you.

222
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,160
A meeting this late might be…

223
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,920
I heard your grandfather
once passed the imperial exam.

224
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,600
You're from a noble family, too.

225
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,020
Grandfather earned the title
in his twenties.

226
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,460
My father is a county-level scholar.

227
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,500
Now, he barely manages to support the family.

228
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,980
Miss Yushan, what brings you here?

229
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,100
When I read earlier today,

230
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,340
I came across a sentence in the Analects

231
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,900
that I couldn't quite grasp.

232
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,420
Word has it

233
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,660
that among the scholars from Yinan,

234
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,460
you're the most gifted in literature.

235
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,040
(Brought order to the world)
I was hoping you could enlighten me.

236
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
You flatter me.

237
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,820
(Brought order to the world)

238
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,220
So it's this sentence.

239
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,740
It's also in Cao Cao's

240
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,580
"Short Song Ballad".

241
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,780
"His achievements top the hegemons.

242
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,540
He united the lords
and brought order to the world."

243
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,940
That phrase means…

244
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Wait a moment.

245
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,700
I have no extraordinary memory skills.

246
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,540
Could you, perhaps, put your insights

247
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,040
into an essay so that I may take it back

248
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,860
and study it in detail?

249
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,580
Alright.

250
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,060
Many thanks, Mr. He.

251
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,140
By the way, at today's banquet,

252
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,580
Miss Hanyan was…

253
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,860
What about her?

254
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,220
I…

255
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,420
Nothing.

256
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,740
Miss Hanyan is quite talented.

257
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,060
If you have any questions,

258
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,540
it's more convenient to ask her.

259
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,980
Are you unwilling

260
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,540
to enlighten me?

261
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,660
No.

262
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,660
I'll start writing now.

263
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,020
(Brought order to the world)

264
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,380
(Yinan Guild Hall)

265
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,540
How did it go?

266
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,580
Like fish in a barrel.

267
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,420
Let me see.

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,580
I don't quite understand his essay.

269
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,340
You'd better read through it carefully.

270
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,440
No mistakes allowed.

271
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,540
Yes.

272
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,560
Thank you, sister.

273
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,780
If there's no issue,

274
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,060
it's best to memorize it all.

275
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,020
If someone asks about it someday,

276
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,340
make sure you can answer.

277
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,340
I'll surely do well on the test.

278
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,660
Let's go.

279
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,230
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

280
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,380
- Greetings.
- Good day.

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,350
Please, come inside.

282
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,220
Father.

283
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,780
Your son is truly outstanding.

284
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,860
He must have inherited your wisdom.

285
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,460
You flatter me.

286
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Greetings, gentlemen.

287
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,180
Greetings, gentlemen.

288
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,100
I appreciate your efforts.

289
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,460
The hour has come.

290
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,660
Test begins.

291
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,360
(Test One, Guan Zhong served
and brought order to the world.)

292
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,780
(The Emperor)

293
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,340
Sir.

294
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,860
May I withdraw

295
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,260
from this test?

296
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,340
Why is that, Scholar He?

297
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,460
While casually reading last night,

298
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,900
I came across an essay on this topic.

299
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,220
If I simply replicate it now,

300
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,900
it'd be the same as cheating.

301
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,700
Scholar He, you are upholding integrity.

302
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,980
I deeply admire that.

303
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,980
This is a small test among our Yinan peers

304
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,940
for our own enjoyment.

305
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,220
If you wish to withdraw, you may do so.

306
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,020
Thank you.

307
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,220
(to bring order to the world)

308
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,420
Your son indeed has the talent
of a top scholar.

309
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,060
This topic is drawn
from "The Analects: Xian Wen."

310
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,100
(Virtue and Vice)
It refer to Confucius' praise of Guan Zhong,

311
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,260
meant to assess one's
understanding of humanity.

312
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,060
Mr. Zhuang's essay,

313
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,540
has a polished beginning,

314
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,900
cites classical references in the middle,

315
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,170
and ends seamlessly as one cohesive piece.

316
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,190
Truly a masterpiece.

317
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,180
- A masterpiece.
- Indeed.

318
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,700
My son happened to catch the timing.

319
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,060
It's nothing remarkable.

320
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,540
Mr. Zhuang, you are too modest.

321
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,160
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

322
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,030
Kneel!

323
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,300
Kneel.

324
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,300
Recite the original line from The Analects

325
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,080
that mentions bringing order to the world.

326
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,100
Father, why do you ask this?

327
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,160
The Master said, "Guan Zhong acted
as prime minister to Duke Huan,

328
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,000
made him leader of all the princes
and brought order to the world.

329
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,900
To this day,
people benefit from his gifts.

330
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,580
You can't even remember the original text.

331
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,500
How can you write such a compelling article?

332
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,620
Father is well-read and is renowned

333
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,780
for your incredible memory.

334
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,260
But I was not blessed with the same gift.

335
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,380
Then repeat what I just said.

336
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,590
Confucius said…

337
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,340
Said...

338
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,580
This is the son you've raised.

339
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,580
Master, this is my fault.

340
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,460
Yuchi lacks a quick mind,

341
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,420
so I had him prepare in advance

342
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,300
to uphold your honor.

343
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,820
What do you mean?

344
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,500
I...

345
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,540
I caught a glimpse

346
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,540
of the question in your study.

347
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,980
So I told Yuchi in private.

348
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,140
You...

349
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,020
Did you write this essay yourself?

350
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,620
"A ruler must possess
the virtue of governance,

351
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,830
thus, the gentleman
will choose to serve him."

352
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,050
Yes, Father, I wrote it.

353
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,340
Even if the question was known beforehand,

354
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,220
producing such a work
is quite an achievement.

355
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,700
Ruyin, you're Yuchi's mother

356
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,660
and in charge of household affairs.

357
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,100
You should not have resorted to such act.

358
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,620
Master, it is entirely my fault.

359
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,220
Please punish me.

360
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,660
Forget it.

361
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,540
A few words of praise today mean little.

362
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,740
Once the Spring Exam comes,

363
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,780
the truth will be revealed.

364
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,380
Let's take it one step at a time.

365
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,580
Master, is there anything in this essay

366
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,460
that might cause trouble?

367
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,620
Only the three examiners have seen it.

368
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,460
I've already filed it away.

369
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,580
Do not let word spread.

370
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,460
If anyone praises or flatters you,

371
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,300
remember to remain humble.

372
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,980
Just say it was a coincidence.

373
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,240
Do you understand?

374
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,100
Understood.

375
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,700
Rest assured, Master.

376
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,380
I will make sure to guide Yuchi properly.

377
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,180
Yuchi, tell me the truth.

378
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,020
The examiner said the essay
has the makings of a top scholar.

379
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,840
But you've only studied for a few days.

380
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,260
How could you write
something of such quality?

381
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,300
Why? Are you unhappy

382
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,780
that I'm talented?

383
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,860
In your eyes,

384
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,300
am I nothing but a useless fool?

385
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,660
Sister.

386
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,820
Look at you.

387
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,380
(Nurturing Grace)

388
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,220
Mr. You.

389
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,660
Bottom up.

390
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,500
Cheers.

391
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,020
To be honest,

392
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,860
Miss Hanyan is more stunning
than the actresses

393
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,290
(You Yong)
of the Music Institution.

394
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,780
When can I visit her in person?

395
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,860
Leave it to me.

396
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,780
Mr. You, if you're interested,

397
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,260
you can visit anytime.

398
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,160
Deal.

399
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,100
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

400
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,420
You've been stealing the light these days.

401
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,220
I heard your essay

402
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,380
was highly praised recently.

403
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,900
Tell me, what exactly did you write?

404
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,060
Come on. Share it with us.

405
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,780
Young Master Yuchi,

406
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,020
I heard your essay is comparable

407
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,340
to "Ode to the Three Capitals."

408
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,140
How did you approach the topic?
Could you share?

409
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,140
Please.

410
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,300
Tell them.

411
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,460
Just humble work.

412
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,820
- So modest.
- You're too humble.

413
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,180
They say the scholars of Yinan
are unmatched.

414
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,540
And upon meeting today, I see
there are always

415
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,860
mightier men.

416
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,100
Well said.

417
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,820
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

418
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Please.

419
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,820
Join us at the table.

420
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,860
Alright.

421
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,700
- Please.
- Please.

422
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,020
Mr. Zhuang comes from a scholarly family.

423
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,380
We are truly humbled in comparison.

424
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,220
My father serves in the Hanlin Academy.

425
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,420
He personally taught me.

426
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,340
I have mastered all the classics.

427
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,180
That's a true scholarly family.

428
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,180
Indeed.

429
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,020
Mr. Zhuang,

430
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,740
why not seize the moment today

431
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,220
and emulate the ancients?

432
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,460
Recite a few lines from your essay,

433
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,580
then join the songstress in harmony.

434
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,980
Let us all learn.

435
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,820
Excellent suggestion.

436
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,980
Recite for us.

437
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,250
- Alright.
- Share a few lines.

438
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,180
Here we go.

439
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,980
A ruler must possess
the virtue of governance,

440
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,820
thus, the gentleman…

441
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,260
The gentleman.

442
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,600
Thus, the gentleman
will choose to serve him.

443
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,660
Serve him.

444
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,040
Mr. Zhuang, have you forgotten?

445
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,180
You forgotten?

446
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,050
No, I haven't.

447
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,320
I haven't.

448
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,020
The next line is "Gentleman."

449
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,740
Gentleman…

450
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,740
A gentleman values fairness and virtue.

451
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,100
Haven't you all not seen it?

452
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,180
How would you know?

453
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,140
I haven't seen it. Have you?

454
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,140
Let's have a drink.

455
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,980
Let's drink.

456
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,420
Full of talk about sages, reeking of alcohol.

457
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,110
How can one write like this?

458
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,620
Who's causing a ruckus here?

459
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,320
Who are you?

460
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,900
- Let's check it out.
- Let's go.

461
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,740
Let's go.

462
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,500
Mr. Zhuang, such vile men must be punished.

463
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,620
Please.

464
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,740
Go take a look.

465
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,060
Yes.

466
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,940
Who are you?

467
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,700
Where did you come from?

468
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,220
Showing off before the son
of a Junior Compiler?

469
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,180
Exactly.

470
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,620
A gentleman

471
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,220
must seek wisdom

472
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,130
from the great emperors,

473
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,540
governing with virtue

474
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,860
and using law as the last resort.

475
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,820
If Confucius knew a scholar like you,

476
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,060
he'd die of shame!

477
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,140
What nonsense!

478
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,460
That quote was from your essay.

479
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,260
You don't even recognize your own words?

480
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,700
I don't need to.

481
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,020
Exactly.

482
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,540
Memorize it all you want.

483
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
That's right.

484
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,460
It seems you hardly live up to your name.

485
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,610
Just an empty reputation.

486
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,460
Not worth my time.

487
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,570
- Let's go.
- Go.

488
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Who are you?

489
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,540
Utter foolishness.

490
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,020
Mr. Zhuang, he's not worth your attention.

491
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,860
Let's go up and drink.

492
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,340
- Ignore him.
- Drink up.

493
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,580
Seems Young Master Zhuang

494
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,660
is about to cause trouble again.

495
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,620
Mr. Zhuang's essay…

496
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,220
Zhuang Hanyan.

497
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,500
What a coincidence.

498
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,580
Mr. You, come here.

499
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,340
It must be fate.

500
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,820
Isn't the one you seek right here?

501
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,820
Greetings, Miss Zhuang Hanyan.

502
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,660
That's right.

503
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
I am You Yong.

504
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,100
It seems fate has brought us together.

505
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,980
I just heard…

506
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,320
Mr. You.

507
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,620
Be careful.

508
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,360
Watch your step.

509
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,840
Are you alright?

510
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,540
Zhuang Hanyan,

511
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,980
apologize to your future husband.

512
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,140
Yuchi, this is a public setting.

513
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,500
I advise you to restrain yourself.

514
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,740
Don't disgrace your own family.

515
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,740
Zhuang Hanyan,

516
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,860
don't be ungrateful.

517
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,060
Mr. You,

518
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,980
tonight, I shall decide for her.

519
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,700
She will be betrothed to you.

520
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,190
Prepare a fine guest room.

521
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,030
Go.

522
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,460
- They'll consummates the marriage tonight.
- Yes.

523
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,420
It's too fast.

524
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,500
Congrats, Mr. You.

525
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Congratulations.

526
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,220
Zhuang Hanyan.

527
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,300
Did I say you could leave?

528
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
From the Judicial Review?

529
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,900
Why are you here?

530
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,540
Miss Hanyan, Mr. Fu summons you.

531
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,500
We'll find another chance.

532
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,620
Miss Hanyan, what an elegant evening.

533
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,380
Drinking alone?

534
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,340
Aren't you the same?

535
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,220
We're tracking a female bandit.

536
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,540
It's said she appeared at Chaling Tavern.

537
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,060
Miss Hanyan's fish took the bait tonight.

538
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,780
But mine hasn't yet.

539
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,180
Fishing always requires bait.

540
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,460
What bait are you using?

541
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,740
Isn't she sitting right in front of me?

542
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,180
She's got excellent sword skills.

543
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,420
I'd actually like to spar with her again.

544
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,340
Must you force me this way?

545
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,020
Miss Hanyan, what do you mean?

546
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,980
Could it be that you know that bandit?

547
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,020
I don't know her.

548
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,620
What is her background?

549
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,040
How long have you known her,
and what's your relationship?

550
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

551
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,920
Since you arrived in the Capital,

552
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,300
I've helped you multiple times.

553
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,900
Yet you still don't trust me.

554
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,220
Please forgive me,

555
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,980
I don't know

556
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,060
what exactly you want me to say.

557
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,660
Your guard is impressive.

558
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,220
In the Capital, fewer words
mean fewer troubles.

559
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,540
A fish keeps its mouth shut

560
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,100
is often harder to catch with a hook.

561
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,300
If there's nothing else,

562
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,220
I'll take my leave.

563
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,620
What are you doing?

564
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,460
If I were to kill you right now,

565
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,460
do you think she would show herself?

566
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,900
Even the vice minister of Judicial Review

567
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,660
cannot take lives so recklessly.

568
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,580
Not if it's a commoner.

569
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,660
But if it's a bandit criminal,

570
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,860
then it's simply execution before reporting.

571
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,500
Finally took the bait.

572
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,220
Run. He's tricking you.

573
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,780
Who are you, really?

574
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,820
Speak.

575
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,020
Let her go.

576
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,860
Run.

577
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,180
Zhuang Hanyan,

578
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,400
this is the second time
you tried to kill me.

579
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,580
I thought you were just a sly fox.

580
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,780
Turns out, wolves hunt in pairs.

581
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,780
You forced me to do this.

582
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,380
Mr. Gao.

583
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,220
Mr. Gao, please.

584
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,060
This way, please.

585
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,570
This way.

586
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,420
Mr. Gao, please.

587
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,660
Serve the dishes.

588
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,620
Yes, sir.

589
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,900
Mr. Gao, any news
from the Ministry of Punishments?

590
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,420
Though the Three Judicial Offices
are working together

591
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,480
to eradicate the remnants
of Pei's faction,

592
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,460
but all power lies
within the Judicial Review.

593
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,220
The Ministry of Punishments
is merely a group of errand boys.

594
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,020
There are rumors that Pei Dafu
had an adopted son

595
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,780
still hiding in the Capital.

596
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,420
Are you aware of that?

597
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,660
Two years ago, Pei Dafu held a banquet.

598
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,780
I happened to catch a glimpse
of his adopted son.

599
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,780
The man stood nine feet tall,
with a face full of bristling whiskers.

600
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,140
When he spoke,

601
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,980
his voice rolled like thunder.

602
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,600
It was truly awe-inspiring.

603
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,580
You really saw him?

604
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,500
Why would I lie?

605
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,320
Here.

606
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,260
Mr. Gao.

607
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,660
What do you want?

608
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,960
Miss Hanyan is smart and resourceful.

609
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,660
Why don't you take a guess?

610
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,460
The most frequented

611
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,500
Chaling Tavern of capital officials

612
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,780
hides a secret chamber.

613
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,060
If you push me any further,

614
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,020
I'll spread the word

615
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,260
about what I saw and heard.

616
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,560
Chaling Tavern will never
get customers again.

617
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,740
As for the adopted son they mentioned,

618
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,580
I will reveal that as well.

619
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,940
Miss Hanyan,

620
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,860
play with fire, and you might get burned.

621
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,940
Play with fire?

622
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,780
I am the fire.

623
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
Sir.

624
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,980
Those two at Hongyun Hall.

625
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,280
Their words are hard to discern.

626
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,420
Bring them back for interrogation.

627
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,820
Yes, I will handle it at once.

628
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,130
I won't interrupt your fine evening
with Miss Hanyan.

629
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,100
Cut it out.

630
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,900
Sir, about that other matter.

631
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,260
Are we going to proceed?

632
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,100
Get lost.

633
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,580
What is the matter?

634
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,220
Does it concern me?

635
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,900
Miss Hanyan,

636
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,620
the case of the adopted son is critical.

637
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,460
If you're interested,

638
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,420
why not join the Judicial Review?

639
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,060
We have secret informants
across the capital.

640
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,660
As you saw tonight,

641
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,180
Chaling Tavern is part of our property.

642
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,140
If you're willing to work as one,

643
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,380
I'll ensure you're well compensated.

644
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,260
I'm not capable of such things.

645
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,260
Just use a fraction of the skills you have

646
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,460
to deal with Zhuang Yuchi.

647
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,420
Yuchi and I are bound by blood.

648
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,660
Why would I go against him?

649
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,060
What about those instigators earlier?

650
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,580
Weren't they hired by you?

651
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,180
I only just arrived in the Capital.

652
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,100
I just wanted to see the bustling taverns.

653
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,980
How could I know anyone?

654
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,180
Where is she?

655
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,540
She's here.

656
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,340
Here she is.

657
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,540
Miss, we finally found you.

658
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,460
We thought

659
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,780
you ran off.

660
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,660
Indeed.

661
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,260
Everything you asked for is done,

662
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,300
but there's still half the payment left.

663
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,500
- Right.
- Right.

664
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,580
Take the silver and leave quickly.

665
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,180
- Thank you.
- Much appreciated.

666
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,100
- Let's go.
- Call us next time.

667
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,260
Back to drinking now.

668
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,780
You two put on quite a show.

669
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,860
Your double act

670
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,580
is more entertaining than the opera.

671
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,420
It's getting late. I'll be going now.

672
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,140
We should stay out of each other's way
from now on.

673
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,540
Take care, Miss Hanyan.

674
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,540
Does it hurt?

675
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,540
Nothing serious.

676
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,900
You were too reckless.

677
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,980
He wouldn't actually kill me.

678
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,820
Why did you have to fight him?

679
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,500
His mind is as deep as a pool.

680
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,340
It's unfathomable.

681
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,980
Never trust him easily.

682
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,100
He may not want to arrest you.

683
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,220
Moreover, today,

684
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,740
I've also found a handle against him.

685
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,220
In recent days, he may not dare act rashly.

686
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,900
Be careful not to anger him.

687
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,460
Don't worry.

688
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,300
However,

689
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,740
his subordinates mentioned
one unfinished task.

690
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,420
Their words seem to involve me in some way.

691
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,980
Leave me alone.

692
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,300
Mr. You,

693
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,140
does your grandfather know

694
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,300
you're indulging in pleasure
and neglecting your duties?

695
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,500
Mind your own business.

696
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,380
Who are you, anyway?

697
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,260
I'm passing along a message.

698
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,220
Stay away from Miss Zhuang Hanyan.

699
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,660
Don't think about pursuing her.

700
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,860
Well, I'm telling you now.

701
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,990
I will have

702
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,040
any woman I fancy.

703
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,060
Just watch me.

704
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,340
Help.

705
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,380
I can't swim.

706
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,020
The water's shallow.

707
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,820
You won't drown.

708
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,660
Help.

709
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,660
Hello?

710
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,020
Is anyone there?

711
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,780
Get me out.

712
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,380
Hurry.

713
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,380
Don't let him escape.

714
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,620
Stop him.

715
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,620
How is he?

716
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,300
He's drunk.

717
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,580
He spilled alcohol on me. Disgusting.

718
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,500
That was a personal matter for you.

719
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,320
It can't be counted in the stipend.

720
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,660
(Hanlin Academy)

721
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,620
Mr. Zhuang, you're here.

722
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,540
(Endless Learning)
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuang.

723
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,380
A son should aspire to be like Zhuang's son.

724
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,340
Indeed.

725
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,140
What's there to celebrate?

726
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,460
You always said
your son was unambitious,

727
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,900
uninterested in scholarly pursuits.

728
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,620
Turns out it was deliberate modesty.

729
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,600
A punishment's in order.

730
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,460
That's right.

731
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,540
Don't pretend you don't know.

732
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,820
Your son's essay has stunned the Capital.

733
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,020
Even the Emperor has heard of it.

734
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,060
This morning, His Majesty
summoned Yinan Guild Hall,

735
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,860
requesting the finest essays for review.

736
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,560
Your son's bright future is about to come.

737
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,140
His Majesty reviewed the papers?

738
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,460
I knew nothing of this.

739
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,860
Mr. Zhuang, stop pretending.

740
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,620
When you host the victory banquet
after the Spring Exam,

741
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,380
be sure to invite us.

742
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,180
Yes, that's right.

743
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,220
Mr. Zhuang may have an excellent memory,

744
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,460
capable of reciting the classics,

745
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,100
but when it comes to literary talent,

746
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,620
you might be overshadowed by your son.

747
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,860
The student surpasses the teacher.

748
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,620
Excuse me.

749
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,390
- Mr. Zhuang.
- Mr. Zhuang.

750
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,260
(Unfulfilled Talent)

751
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,100
It's no trivial matter. It must
be investigated thoroughly.

752
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,900
Mr. Zhuang is truly anxious.

753
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,460
You've come just in time.

754
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,460
What's going on?

755
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,300
Mr. Zhuang, your arrival is timely.

756
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,460
Saves us the trouble of sending for you.

757
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,340
Fifty catties of white cogongrass.

758
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,060
Five loads each of jujube, peach,
hazelnut, plum, and water caltrop.

759
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,330
Got it.

760
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,180
Before the ritual,

761
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,140
all offerings must be placed
atop the white cogongrass

762
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,300
- to show reverence.
- Yes.

763
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,340
Mom.

764
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,680
It seems you're the one
managing the household now.

765
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,860
You've got everyone
running around tirelessly.

766
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,820
You should be studying.

767
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,020
No need to concern yourself with the ritual.

768
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,370
You might not have heard yet.

769
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,380
His Majesty has requested my test paper.

770
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,060
This is a great honor for our family.

771
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,540
I had to come share the good news.

772
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,900
The Emperor reviewing your paper?

773
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,620
Are you serious?

774
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,940
Scared?

775
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,660
What's the use of reading
the useless books all day?

776
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,340
You're nothing but a foolish woman

777
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,730
who's not qualified for the exams.

778
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,280
If I achieve greatness in the future,

779
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,220
the Zhuangs will certainly not keep you here.

780
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,500
Though we were not born of the same mother,

781
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,100
we are still bound by blood.

782
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,900
Why must you be so cruel?

783
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,600
Ruan Xiwen was in charge for years.

784
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,180
Do you know how much my mom has endured?

785
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,180
I'll make sure you and your mother
pay it back in full.

786
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,220
I will never let you off the hook.

787
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,740
Don't drive a dog into a corner.

788
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,380
Don't you understand that?

789
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,900
What do you mean?

790
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,300
If you push me too far,

791
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,180
you'll force me to fight you.

792
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,560
Are you certain you can defeat me?

793
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,070
Yuchi?

794
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,580
Mom.

795
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,380
What brings you to the kitchen?

796
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,820
His Majesty reviewed my paper.

797
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,740
How did it reach His Majesty?

798
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,340
If word of the leak of question spreads,

799
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,500
it would be a grave crime.

800
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,220
It's only known to us.

801
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,660
How could it get out?

802
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,860
No way Yushan is trying to hurt me.

803
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,860
Mom.

804
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,860
Yuchi, bad news.

805
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,220
Mr. Han and the Judicial Review have arrived.

806
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,060
They're summoning everyone
to the guild hall.

807
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,100
- Let's go.
- Go.

808
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,700
(Eternal as Sun and Moon)

809
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,060
Young Master Zhuang,

810
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,980
"Brought order to the world",

811
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,820
was this essay written by you?

812
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,700
It was.

813
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,060
Very well. Then explain this to me.

814
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,300
Why is the essay you wrote recently

815
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,820
identical to the essay

816
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,420
composed by Vice Minister Han Wenzheng

817
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,860
twenty years ago?

818
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,500
That piece has been seen by few,

819
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,460
and the manuscript's kept
in Mr. Han's residence.

820
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,060
I have no idea.

821
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,260
The examiner should explain

822
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,540
why this topic was set.

823
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,020
This question was indeed created by me.

824
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,020
In previous tests,

825
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,460
students were often tasked with topics

826
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,260
on livelihood and governance.

827
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,380
The phrase may seem simple,

828
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,940
but it encompasses countless meanings.

829
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,660
It tests the students' knowledge
of various schools of thought.

830
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,580
I wonder how Young Master Zhuang came to…

831
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,420
It seems Mr. Zhuang has raised a fine son.

832
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,260
Even before the imperial exam,
he resorts to cheat,

833
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,580
causing such an uproar

834
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,060
that His Majesty has taken notice.

835
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,380
To put it bluntly,

836
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,620
it's a crime of deceiving the Emperor.

837
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,300
Kneel.

838
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,580
I am guilty.

839
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,820
My son is young and ignorant,

840
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,760
bringing disgrace to the exam and my family.

841
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,700
I plead for His Majesty's forgiveness.

842
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,420
I shall punish him strictly.

843
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,260
Sir.

844
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,220
The essay was not written by my brother.

845
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,220
It was He Wenshen who wrote it.

846
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,860
Yes, it was He Wenshen.

847
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,700
Yes.

848
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,980
Where is He Wenshen?

849
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,460
I'm here.

850
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,500
Greetings, sir.

851
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,420
What do you have to say?

852
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,540
Sir,

853
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,380
on the night before the test,

854
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,860
Miss Yushan took "The Analects,"

855
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,020
seeking my guidance.

856
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,420
She asked how that phrase
should be explained

857
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,420
and requested me to write it down for her.

858
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,260
Only then did I…

859
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,620
Mr. Zhuang, blinded by fatherly devotion,

860
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,540
had revealed the question himself.

861
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,760
Yushan,

862
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,420
where did you get that question?

863
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,980
Father, I sought guidance from Mr. He.

864
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,300
But the essay was indeed written by him.

865
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,500
He plagiarized it.

866
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,020
Sir, may I have a look?

867
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,620
The essay Young Master Zhuang wrote

868
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,080
is not the same as the one I wrote.

869
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,060
Although I have studied for a few years,

870
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,440
I could never produce

871
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,020
such a brilliant work.

872
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,170
That night, I drafted multiple versions

873
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,100
while refining my thoughts.

874
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,060
I have the drafts.

875
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,660
You can check them to verify.

876
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,940
Present them.

877
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,460
This is indeed completely different.

878
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,460
How could this have happened?

879
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,740
Although I inadvertently
learned of the question early,

880
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,620
I dared not engage in any dishonest act.

881
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,580
I withdrew on the day
of the test.

882
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,260
All the sirs can vouch for me.

883
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,060
Zhuang Yuchi,

884
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,340
do you have anything else to say?

885
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,060
I'm innocent, Mr. Yan.

886
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,060
Someone must be trying to set me up.

887
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,420
This essay was clearly written by He Wenshen.

888
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,180
How could it be Han Wenzheng's work?

889
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,180
Zhuang Yuchi, silence.

890
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,330
Father.

891
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,580
The Emperor has issued a decree.

892
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,620
Zhuang Yuchi has acted dishonorably.

893
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,980
He is accused of plagiarism
and moral corruption.

894
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,140
Considering it's not formal,

895
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,100
he will not face severe punishment.

896
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,540
However, he is permanently barred
from future exams.

897
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,590
Take him to the entrance
of the Judicial Review

898
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:52,880
and display him for three days.

899
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,780
Mr. Yan, I am innocent.

900
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,060
Junior Compiler Zhuang Shiyang.

901
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,300
Poor parenting. Dock half a year's salary

902
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,420
as a warning to others.

903
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,060
Guards, take him!

904
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,900
Have mercy.

905
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,780
Your Majesty, please have mercy.

906
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,940
- Father, please save Yuchi.
- Father.

907
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,860
- Father.
- Father.

908
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,260
- Yuchi.
- Yuchi.
