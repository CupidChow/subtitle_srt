00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,100
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,860
(Jianjia Chamber)
Madam.

4
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,790
Why have you
remained silent for so long?

5
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,640
Have you been threatened by the thief?

6
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,790
Do not be afraid.

7
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,480
I will bring help to rescue you at once.

8
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,760
Madam, open the door.

9
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,350
Ms. Zhou, what are you doing?

10
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,640
A thief broke in.

11
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,690
Sorry for the disturbance.

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,070
Since it's a thief,

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,120
then let my people handle it.

14
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,170
Why use a butcher's knife
to kill a chicken?

15
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,000
You must've been tired
from official duties.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,960
You should return to your room to rest,

17
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,950
rather than stand here in the cold.

18
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,870
It's no trouble.

19
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,560
This concerns your safety,

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,400
and the Judicial Review
cannot shirk its duty.

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,120
The matters of the family
are ours to handle.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,710
There is no need to trouble you.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,630
Such commotion in the dead of night

24
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,240
may startle the thief into desperation.

25
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,000
What if they set this chamber ablaze?

26
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,910
Ms. Zhou, have you forgotten

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,310
how my family was burned to the ground?

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,870
Or do you wish
to bring the same disaster

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,710
upon your family?

30
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,960
Follow my command.
Keep ramming the door.

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,400
Whoever breaks through first
will be handsomely rewarded.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Yes.

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,080
It's cold and windy.

34
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,910
Ms. Zhou, I appreciate your concern.

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,280
You overpraise me.

36
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,060
Master is worried about your safety

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,720
and ordered me to search for the thief.

38
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,960
There are no thieves in my chamber.

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,870
However, there is a reckless,

40
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,910
audacious maid.

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,280
Madam, sorry for offending you.

42
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,680
But this concerned
the safety of the family,

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,190
and I acted under Master's orders.

44
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,630
Even if you want to punish me,

45
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,800
I will accept it.

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Search the place!

47
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,590
Who dares?

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,750
Mr. Yuwen,

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
do not act rashly.

50
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,080
You will become their target
if you go out now.

51
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,710
No explanation will clear your name.

52
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,030
Without my order,

53
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,950
who dares act recklessly?

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,660
What are you waiting for?

55
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,480
If you capture the thief and retrieve
the official seal for Master,

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,750
do you think he won't reward you?

57
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,470
Search!

58
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,580
Stop this!

59
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,540
Would you resort to violence

60
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,540
in the madam's chamber?

61
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,180
Xiwen,

62
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,620
did they frighten you?

63
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,300
Xiwen, I know you have disliked

64
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,260
disturbances for years.

65
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,860
But today, I lost the official seal,

66
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,380
and a thief broke in.
This is a grave matter

67
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,860
that could lead to disaster.

68
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,860
We've searched Yongshou Chamber

69
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,660
and Gongtong Chamber

70
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,540
and found no sign of the thief.

71
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,100
Xiwen, could you allow us to search?

72
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,940
Of course.

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,140
I knew you'd see reason.

74
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,910
The madam has agreed.
Everyone, go ahead.

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,670
Write me a divorce letter,

76
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,660
and you may search
every corner of my chamber.

77
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,180
Xiwen, I know you're upset,

78
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,190
but you can't joke about that.

79
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,020
I never joke.

80
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,180
I have no affection for you.

81
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,480
I only married you because fate

82
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,520
played a cruel trick on me
when my family declined.

83
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,110
Now that things have come to this,

84
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,500
it is better for us
to part ways peacefully.

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,220
All these years,

86
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,010
you forbade anyone
from entering your chamber at will.

87
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,180
Even I, the master of this family,

88
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,260
was turned away.

89
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,220
I let you have your way.

90
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,880
But now, a thief has broken in,

91
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,740
and the loss of the official seal
is a grave offense.

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,260
Why are you being so unreasonable?

93
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,060
Do you truly wish to know why?

94
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,740
Why?

95
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,020
There is a guest in my chamber.

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,380
If you see him, it may upset you.

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,700
A guest?

98
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,300
Who?

99
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,580
Zhuang Shiyang,

100
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,580
it's best to leave this matter unsaid.

101
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,140
Otherwise, by tomorrow morning,

102
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,940
you and I will become the biggest joke
in the Capital.

103
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,100
Think it over carefully.

104
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,900
Mr. Zhuang, the official seal is here.

105
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,500
It was in your study,

106
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,660
behind the antique shelf.

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,490
Unfortunately, the thief has vanished.

108
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,500
Thank you, Yunxi.

109
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,780
Good for the Judicial Review.

110
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,460
Fortunately, it snowed tonight.

111
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,260
As our Reviewer, Mu Yan

112
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,420
is skilled in tracking footprints.

113
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,900
That is how we traced it back so soon.

114
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,900
However, the thief was rather odd.

115
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,260
They took no valuables,
stole only the seal,

116
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,140
and then left it behind

117
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,780
as if they were toying with you guys.

118
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,420
Judging by the size of the footprints,

119
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,500
the thief was even a woman.

120
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,540
Is that so? How could this be?

121
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,660
As the seal has been recovered,

122
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,700
everyone may leave.

123
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,420
It is bitterly cold now.

124
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,790
The madam has been unwell for some time

125
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,610
and is unfit to manage
household affairs.

126
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,300
From today onward,

127
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,750
she will remain
in her chamber to recover

128
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,990
and will no longer oversee
the household keys.

129
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,900
Hanyan has fully recovered.

130
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,820
She'll move to Yongshou Chamber tonight.

131
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,620
Mr. Yuwen, you owe me an explanation.

132
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,630
Xiwen and I have never committed
any disgraceful act.

133
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,300
If you trust her character,

134
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,760
you should not question me.

135
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,740
If you do not trust her,

136
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,420
why should I explain myself?

137
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,020
20 years have passed
in the blink of an eye.

138
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,020
Haven't you let it go?

139
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,620
Back then,

140
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,580
I was betrothed to Xiwen,

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,420
but as the wedding day approached,

142
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,620
she married someone else.

143
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,620
If it was fate,

144
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,460
I would've long let it go.

145
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,780
But if it was human error,

146
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,420
how can I simply forget?

147
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,020
Regardless, the ship has sailed.

148
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,020
If you care for Xiwen's reputation,

149
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,580
don't ever step
into my family's door again.

150
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,740
I will reclaim

151
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,140
what you owe me eventually.

152
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,740
Master.

153
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,260
Ruyin,

154
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,900
is there something in this world

155
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,580
that you have long desired

156
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,180
but never received?

157
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,780
No matter how hard you try,

158
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,740
and how much effort you put in,

159
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,420
even if everyone else thinks

160
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,060
you've achieved your dreams,

161
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,140
only you know

162
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,700
you're just deceiving yourself.

163
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,220
The heavens will make you realize

164
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,860
that what is not yours
will never be yours.

165
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,460
How laughable.

166
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,860
It's my fault.

167
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,700
I shouldn't have angered the madam,

168
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,260
causing harm to your peace.

169
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,300
Why blame yourself for no reason?

170
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,180
When have I ever blamed you?

171
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,300
The madam's angry words
can't be taken seriously.

172
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,540
Master, do not be so heartbroken,

173
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,100
or I will be the one
to suffer even more.

174
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,460
In this household,

175
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,460
thankfully, I have you by my side.

176
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,540
My goodness.

177
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,980
How could you

178
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,130
be so thin?

179
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,700
You're like a little kitten.

180
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,600
I feel so bad for you.

181
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,330
I'm fine now.

182
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,180
Sorry for making you worry.

183
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,120
You fell ill to shield me
from misfortune.

184
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,250
From now on, just stay here and rest.

185
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,070
I have nourishing ginseng soup
and pills here.

186
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,260
They'll fatten you up in no time.

187
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,980
Thank you, Grandmother, for your care.

188
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,180
After all the commotion tonight,

189
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,500
it's already late. Rest well.

190
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,740
Grandmother, take care.

191
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,580
Why didn't you let me
enter the madam's chamber?

192
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,460
If I were there,
you would not suffer like this.

193
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
I do not know.

194
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,220
Perhaps,

195
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,340
when it comes to her,

196
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,660
I am more greedy than I am with others.

197
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,340
I seek her sincere affection,

198
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,260
so I am more afraid of her thinking
I have ulterior motives.

199
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,740
Has she treated you sincerely?

200
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,220
At least now,

201
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,220
I believe she has her reasons.

202
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,620
But I don't know

203
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,260
what secrets she is hiding

204
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,860
beyond her reasons.

205
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,100
Madam.

206
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,300
What are you doing?

207
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,260
I am here for your medicine.

208
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,900
Take it away.

209
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,020
This is the new
blood circulation medicine.

210
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,060
It won't work.

211
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,700
Take it away.

212
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,620
Madam,

213
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,740
let us try again.

214
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,380
Take it away!
I told you to take it away!

215
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,620
This leg is already useless.

216
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,460
It's useless!

217
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,500
Even the most expensive medicine
won't work.

218
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,420
Take it away!

219
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,900
I won't use it.

220
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,940
Alright, alright.

221
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,060
Alright.

222
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,540
I'll take it away.

223
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,740
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,940
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,460
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

226
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,890
The household needs a manager.

227
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,660
Ruyin,

228
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,050
you shall take over now.

229
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,660
Master, please do not jest with me.

230
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,740
Why? Are you bothered
by the tedious work?

231
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,620
With my limited abilities,

232
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,180
how could I manage the household?

233
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,780
Moreover, this is the madam's duty.

234
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,420
Do not mention her.

235
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Miss Hanyan is clever and capable.

236
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,380
As the lineal daughter of the family,

237
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,060
it'd be more appropriate for you
to take the reins in the madam's stead.

238
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,260
I've only just returned home.

239
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,380
It's too soon for me
to take on this job.

240
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,300
Besides, I cannot compare to Ms. Zhou's

241
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,660
intelligence and resourcefulness.

242
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,380
Please, do not refuse.

243
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,420
Indeed.

244
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,380
You've been back long enough
to be familiar with everything.

245
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,380
Well...

246
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,220
Since the master has decided,

247
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,660
I'll try my best.

248
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,460
Mr. Zhuang,

249
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
my home is almost renovated.

250
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,580
I've bothered you long enough.

251
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,820
It's time for me to move back.

252
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,220
Yunxi,

253
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,490
what's the rush?

254
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,340
Yes.

255
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,260
The Chinese New Year is near.
Why not stay for that?

256
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,460
I've bothered you guys enough.

257
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,180
I shouldn't stay longer.

258
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,860
After the festival,

259
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,260
I'll be here to express my gratitude
with my family.

260
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,700
Very well. It's your decision.

261
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,220
Father,

262
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,420
after Mr. Fu leaves,

263
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,420
may I stay in Yuzhu Manor?

264
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,140
Is there any inconvenience
in Yongshou Chamber?

265
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,700
Grandmother treats me
with great affection,

266
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,740
but she is elderly now.

267
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,420
I cannot bear

268
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,900
to trouble her all the time.

269
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,140
Very well. You've been home
for quite a while.

270
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,220
You should have your own place.

271
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,900
Thank you, Father.

272
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,180
I heard that the madam
angered the master

273
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,300
and was nearly abandoned.

274
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,140
Impossible.

275
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,220
The master has always been
attentive to the madam,

276
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,380
never once being mad at her.

277
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,220
Then tell me.

278
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,040
How did she lose control
over the household?

279
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,060
Well...

280
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,580
Nanny Tao, you've been here for so long.

281
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,420
What do you think?

282
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,260
She is just a cook in the kitchen.

283
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,200
How could she know?

284
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,220
In my opinion,

285
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,620
(Nanny Tao, a servant)

286
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,420
the household

287
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,820
is about to change dramatically.

288
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,780
- Ms. Zhou.
- Ms. Zhou.

289
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,140
Why is everyone so serious?

290
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,180
Are you afraid of me?

291
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,700
Ms. Zhou, you jest.

292
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,340
You are the housekeeper;

293
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,100
we are mere servants,

294
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,860
so we must show respect.

295
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,860
I am just a concubine here.

296
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,660
If we must be precise,
I am a servant as well.

297
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,260
But our master is kind and generous,

298
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,500
so once we enter this residence,

299
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,900
we are all family.

300
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,060
In the future,
there is no need for such formality.

301
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,580
You all should stop making wild guesses.

302
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,300
A few days ago, a thief broke

303
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,540
into Jianjia Chamber,

304
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,140
and the madam was so shocked
that she fell ill.

305
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,380
The master had no choice

306
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,260
but to entrust me with the madam's duty.

307
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,460
Now, as the New Year approaches,

308
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,020
and the family affairs are piling up,

309
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,580
please do not make things hard for me.

310
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,100
Let us all work together

311
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,060
to get through this New Year.

312
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,100
Is that okay?

313
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,220
Ms. Zhou, you treat us
with such fairness

314
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
and kindness,

315
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,020
so much better than the other one.

316
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,460
Do not speak out of turn.

317
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,020
You're making things hard for me.

318
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,580
It is my fault.

319
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,900
Alright, everyone, go back to work now.

320
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,060
Go on.

321
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,900
- Go on.
- Yes.

322
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,380
Ms. Zhou.

323
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,500
You are Nanny Tao in the kitchen?

324
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,580
Yes.

325
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,140
I have long suspected

326
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,860
this day would come.

327
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,660
My eyes have never been wrong.

328
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,830
Ms. Zhou, you're born a madam,

329
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,780
unlike the one in Jianjia Chamber,

330
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,960
who is born sickly and weak.

331
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,740
Don't speak ill of the madam
behind her back.

332
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,100
Don't you fear punishment?

333
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,060
Ms. Zhou, please forgive me.

334
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,780
I am a straightforward woman

335
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,620
without any tricks or deceptions,

336
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,220
but I can hear and see.

337
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,820
I only know how to serve faithfully

338
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,660
and work tirelessly for my master.

339
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,900
Nanny Tao.

340
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,770
Yes.

341
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,380
You are overqualified

342
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,460
for kitchen work.

343
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,300
Ms. Zhou, if you have other orders,

344
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,220
I'll do my best to fulfill your wish.

345
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,740
From now on,

346
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,220
go work at Jianjia Chamber.

347
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,980
The madam is ill,

348
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,700
so you must pay extra attention to her.

349
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,900
Yes.

350
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,220
I will listen to your orders.

351
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,660
(Jianjia Chamber)

352
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,500
Come here.

353
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,020
You two, go get the keys and ledgers.

354
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,900
Yes.

355
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,620
Go check the room.

356
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,500
- See if there are any valuables.
- Yes.

357
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,460
You two,

358
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,340
- take down the little kitchen.
- Yes.

359
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,260
Why set up a kitchen
in this empty chamber?

360
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,300
It's such a waste.

361
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,140
How dare you barge
into the madam's chamber?

362
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,220
Who are you? Who asked you to come?

363
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,740
Who am I?

364
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,180
It doesn't matter
if you didn't know me before,

365
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,340
but you'll know me now.

366
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,660
I'm the new steward of this family.

367
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,740
You can call me Nanny Tao.

368
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,980
With the madam,
how dare you be so impudent?

369
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,780
Forgive me for failing

370
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,620
to realize the madam is here.

371
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,580
Greetings, Madam.

372
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,740
Madam,

373
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,420
your legs prevent you
from leaving the house,

374
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,220
so no wonder you are unaware.

375
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,340
Now,

376
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,380
the master has asked Ms. Zhou

377
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
to manage the household.

378
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,380
He holds her in high regard.

379
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,340
But Ms. Zhou,

380
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,860
managing such a large manor alone,

381
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,140
has no time for details.

382
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,660
That is why I was sent here

383
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,140
to take the keys and ledgers

384
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,980
for the transition.

385
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,620
You can make that transition,

386
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,660
but how dare you make noise

387
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,520
and break things in the madam's chamber?

388
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,860
Don't you know

389
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,660
Ms. Zhou is having everyone

390
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,180
save on expenses
as the New Year is coming?

391
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,200
Madam, please bear with us.

392
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,780
Madam, the flower watering pot
in your hand

393
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,180
is a fine porcelain piece.

394
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,540
If we give it to Ms. Zhou,

395
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,100
it could be exchanged for some firewood
and rice for the winter.

396
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,580
- Give it to me.
- How impudent!

397
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,500
Give me...

398
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,460
You shameless old hag

399
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,220
with your black heart and rotten lungs.

400
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,500
May heaven strike you with thunder
and break your bones!

401
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,420
What nonsense is that?

402
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,180
You have no right to degrade the madam!

403
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,020
You despicable woman.

404
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,940
Once you gain power,
you want to mistreat your madam,

405
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,660
trying to replace her position.

406
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,580
Keep dreaming.

407
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,740
You old hag!

408
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,580
Nanny Chen,

409
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,300
give her the ledger.

410
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,540
Take it.

411
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,740
You fool, be careful.
Don't make any mistakes.

412
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,580
Get lost!

413
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,740
You old hag!

414
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,180
Listen up.

415
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,740
We'll see who has the last laugh.

416
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,660
We'll see.

417
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,340
Take your ledger and get lost!

418
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,700
You old hag!

419
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,260
- You old hag, get lost!
- We'll see.

420
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,740
- Just wait.
- Get lost!

421
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,780
- We'll see!
- Just wait.

422
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,620
Get lost!

423
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,580
Madam...

424
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,780
Enough.

425
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,100
If we don't let them know today

426
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,460
that we are not to be messed with,

427
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,220
they will only get worse in the future.

428
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,060
People tend to bully the weak
and fear the strong.

429
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,940
Let them be.

430
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,700
Cong, let's go.

431
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,780
Yushan.

432
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
Yushan, Yushan.

433
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,300
Did you hear?

434
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,900
Jianjia Chamber was quite lively today.

435
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
- Really?
- It was satisfying.

436
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,540
Cong, let's join the fun.

437
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,820
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

438
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,100
Let's go, Cong.

439
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,020
Cong.

440
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
This place is eerie and barren.

441
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,900
The people here are
neither human nor ghost.

442
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,860
Only barefoot ghosts
and cripples live here.

443
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,300
You should never come here,
lest you bring bad luck.

444
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,500
Who's there?

445
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,700
Why is there a beast
in my mother's chamber?

446
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,940
It's me. What's wrong?

447
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,180
I knew it.

448
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,300
So what?

449
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,900
I'm riding my horse in my home.
How could you...

450
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,180
Are you cursing me?

451
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,060
I have no such intention.

452
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,820
How dare you argue?

453
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,380
You're the real beast.

454
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,380
I'm dull.

455
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,980
Please enlighten me, Yushan.

456
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,660
You and I share the same blood.

457
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,700
If I'm a beast, then what are you?

458
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,620
You...

459
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,700
If you cannot answer this,

460
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,300
I'll have to ask Father.

461
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,660
I...

462
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,740
Just wait here.

463
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,780
Are you also here to mock me?

464
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,020
Mother, you've fallen.

465
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,980
Have you figured out what to do next?

466
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,780
I've been struggling here for 20 years.

467
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,020
It's not for you to lecture me.

468
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,940
I only wanted to help.

469
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,060
No need.

470
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,460
Miss Hanyan, please leave.

471
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,200
Mother, have you ever drowned?

472
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,270
I have.

473
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,420
When I was young,

474
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,380
on the beach of Danzhou,

475
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,820
the mischievous village kids bullied me,

476
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,060
forcing me under the waves.

477
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,580
The sea was salty and smelly,

478
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,540
filling my nostrils.

479
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,180
To this day,

480
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,900
I still remember that feeling
of despair and fear.

481
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,860
At that moment,

482
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,540
I wished for Mother to be by my side

483
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,340
to pull me out and hold me close.

484
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,820
But you weren't there.

485
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,700
I had to rely on myself.

486
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,180
You crippled my legs,

487
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,340
and I abandoned you in Danzhou.

488
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,220
Our mother-daughter bond

489
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,820
was severed 17 years ago.

490
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,660
No one owes anyone anything.

491
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,580
No need to tell me this.

492
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,820
No.

493
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,540
What I said yesterday was all in anger.

494
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,140
I've never resented you.

495
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,340
If my birth mother
had been a noble lady,

496
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,380
sacrificing her daughter

497
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
to preserve her wealth and status,

498
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,220
I would've left her with dignity.

499
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,820
But that's not the case.

500
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
I can see

501
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,220
that even if you're the madam,

502
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,260
you've not had a happy life.

503
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,380
It's as if you're struggling

504
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,460
in deep water,

505
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,900
just as I once did.

506
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,700
So,

507
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,340
how can I hate you?

508
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,580
Mother,

509
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm your only blood relative
in this world.

510
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,910
We should have been

511
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,340
the closest and most trusted,

512
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,260
not enemies.

513
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,140
If you and I

514
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,380
continue to fight,

515
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
others will take advantage of us.

516
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,620
Please tell me.

517
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,740
Why did you have

518
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,700
to send me away?

519
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,820
I wasn't forced to do that.

520
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,140
I sent you away

521
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,900
because I loathed you.

522
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,660
Then why did you say last night

523
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,260
that you pity me?

524
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,060
You said I've suffered
too much in my life

525
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,370
and that you wish me
a smooth life ahead.

526
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,340
I told you

527
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,300
my life has nothing

528
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,360
to do with you.

529
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,420
Now that I've lost my power,

530
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,420
I can no longer do anything to you.

531
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,700
If you insist on staying here,

532
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,500
do as you wish.

533
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,660
But don't come to me again.

534
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,980
Mother,

535
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,860
tell me.

536
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,460
Was it Zhou Ruyin who harmed you?

537
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,100
She harmed me as well, right?

538
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,940
If you're unwilling to tell me,

539
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,300
I'll investigate the truth myself.

540
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,660
I'll make you understand

541
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,580
that I'm not just your daughter

542
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,100
but also your support.

543
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,740
You lost your legs because of me,

544
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,740
and from now on,

545
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,820
I'll be your legs.

546
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,540
In this life,

547
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,710
no matter how many storms await us,

548
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,900
I'll lead you out of danger,

549
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,540
and I'll never let those
who hurt you succeed.

550
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,340
Zhou Ruyin's end

551
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,260
is my token of loyalty to you.

552
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,980
What do you want to do?

553
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,700
I told you last night

554
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,460
to leave this quagmire

555
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,500
and stop fighting with them.

556
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,380
It's too late.

557
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,860
She worked hard to seize the power
of the household,

558
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,500
but power is not only
glory and benefits.

559
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,140
It can also be a weakness and a crime.

560
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,340
Mother,

561
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,380
wait and see.

562
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,940
I will help you take back

563
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,140
the power of the household.

564
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,700
Stop!

565
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,020
What exactly are you going to do?

566
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,380
Mother, don't you understand yet?

567
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,780
I have never

568
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,820
had any ulterior motives,

569
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,020
I just want what other girls have:

570
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,620
a mother

571
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,220
and a home.

572
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,340
Everywhere can be your home.

573
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,060
You don't need to be fixated
on staying here.

574
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,060
No.

575
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,580
You spent months

576
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,460
to bring me to this world.

577
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,300
In this world,

578
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,020
only you are the one

579
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,980
truly connected to me by blood.

580
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,540
Only where you are

581
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,020
is my true home.

582
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:14,230
♪But truly, you are my heart♪

583
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,940
♪You are my very being♪

584
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,500
♪Do not call me cold and cruel♪

585
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,140
♪Snow falls in silence♪

586
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,660
(That was the first time I saw her cry.)

587
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,260
(On that aged, weary face,)

588
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,900
(I could faintly see)

589
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,300
(the once pretty face of a noble lady
in the Capital,)

590
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,900
(and)

591
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
(the compassion and tenderness)

592
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,940
(of a mother, deeply hidden within her.)

593
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,980
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

594
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,860
Miss Hanyan, you lost.

595
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,820
I only lost to you by one piece.

596
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,180
To win a piece in a match

597
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,380
with you is enough.

598
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,060
Miss Hanyan, you wanted me

599
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,620
to make my last move here,

600
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,820
but I did not.

601
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,780
When did you realize that?

602
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,500
From the very beginning of your scheme.

603
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,460
The chessboard
can be turned upside down,

604
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,860
and so can people.

605
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,140
If everyone criticizes someone
as cruel and oppressive

606
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,500
and unites to isolate them,

607
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,240
that person is likely a good person,

608
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,020
perhaps even a good person
forced into a corner.

609
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,540
So, what should this good person do?

610
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,940
To escape the isolation,

611
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,460
they have to make
the onlookers understand.

612
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,860
What did you hear last night?

613
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,980
Still unwilling to tell me the truth?

614
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,100
Last time, I lied to you.

615
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,660
During Mother
and Yuwen Chang'an's secret talk,

616
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,020
they mentioned Pei Dafu's adopted son.

617
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,800
During their secret meeting last night,

618
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,880
they also mentioned
the Danzhou Chamber of Commerce.

619
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,260
Mother also said...

620
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,100
What?

621
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,860
She said that she had evidence.

622
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,300
With the Head of the DCC's testimony,

623
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,620
she could bring someone to justice.

624
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,100
But I don't know
who she was referring to.

625
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,100
Then?

626
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,980
Then it was interrupted by Ms. Zhou.

627
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,900
The rest of the news is useless to you.

628
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,780
What news?

629
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,060
Perhaps my mother

630
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,780
does love me,

631
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,300
and in this world,

632
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,980
I finally have someone I can care about.

633
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,140
Miss Hanyan, why don't you

634
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,860
stay at Jianjia Chamber
for a few more days?

635
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,100
Why?

636
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
What evidence does Ms. Ruan hold?

637
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,620
What exactly is she scheming?

638
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,580
Miss Hanyan, you haven't found out.

639
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,980
Mr. Fu, what are you scheming?

640
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,220
Can you tell me the truth?

641
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,190
No.

642
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,140
Just follow my instructions.

643
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,380
What if I refuse?

644
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,200
Are you afraid I will harm her?

645
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,540
If you don't tell me your plan,

646
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,940
I won't help you anymore.

647
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,380
I'm afraid that's not up to you.

648
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,740
I killed them.

649
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,140
What?

650
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,420
The murder case in Danzhou.

651
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,460
It was me who killed my father's friend,

652
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,660
Zhang Youchang, and his wife.

653
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,180
Mr. Fu, do you want to arrest me?

654
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,140
So, you admit it.

655
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
You and I were never on the same path.

656
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,340
I have no interest in uncovering

657
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,660
whatever schemes you're plotting.

658
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,420
But from now on,

659
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,900
you will no longer threaten me,

660
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,940
and I will no longer obey your orders.

661
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,420
If you wish to take me in,

662
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,010
then make it quick.

663
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,380
I'd also like to see

664
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,780
what you plan to convict me with.

665
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,700
I fear that once you're
at the Judicial Review,

666
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,220
you'll change your story
and slander my name.

667
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,980
Does your name
even need me to tarnish it?

668
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,820
You think the Danzhou case
has no solid evidence,

669
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,740
so even if I capture you,

670
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,620
I won't be able to do anything to you

671
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,980
if you deny it.

672
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,260
In that case,

673
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,940
I won't disturb you any further.

674
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,620
By the way,

675
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,460
the Judicial Review has found some clues

676
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,140
about your assassination
at Yongshou Chamber

677
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,780
and the fire at my house.

678
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,740
It seems that it was done
by a female bandit.

679
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,940
My men are investigating this.

680
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,380
Miss Hanyan, wait for my good news.

681
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,620
Goodbye.

682
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,420
You...

683
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,900
Fu Yunxi has his eyes on you.

684
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,140
Don't stay hidden at home anymore.

685
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,420
Find a place to stay outside for now.

686
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,860
He wants to capture me?

687
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,540
It seems that right now,

688
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,500
he is just using this to coerce me,

689
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,020
but still, be cautious.

690
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,020
What are your plans next?

691
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,700
The Yinan Guild Hall's Annual Sacrifice

692
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,780
is organized by the officials
of Yinan in the Capital.

693
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,420
This year, it happens
to be the Zhuangs' turn.

694
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,940
It'll inevitably fall
into Ms. Zhou's hands.

695
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,860
This is her first time taking charge
after so many years.

696
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,220
If she succeeds,
Mother will be in even more danger.

697
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,220
With you around,

698
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,940
how could she succeed?

699
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Be careful.

700
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,460
If you need me,

701
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,180
change the lantern
in front of the door to red.

702
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,620
Got it.

703
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,420
I've started preparing

704
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,420
for the guild hall's sacrifice,

705
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,780
but I didn't expect that by noon today,

706
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,900
I'd have to prepare
a welcoming banquet.

707
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,180
A welcoming banquet?

708
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
For whom?

709
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,320
The guest rooms
at the guild hall are full

710
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,620
of scholars and their families

711
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,660
coming from Yinan

712
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,500
for the Imperial Exams in the Capital.

713
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,860
Yes.

714
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,380
The Spring Exam
will be in February next year,

715
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,300
so we must entertain them well.

716
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,860
There are many talented young men
among them,

717
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,820
waiting for their bright future.

718
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,180
Don't worry, Master.

719
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,220
But with so many things to manage,

720
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,620
I'm afraid we don't have enough help.

721
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,380
Why not let Yushan join
and help with the preparations?

722
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,960
It will be a good experience for her

723
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,580
and beneficial when she gets married.

724
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,460
Sure, handle it as you see fit.

725
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:17,140
(Unfulfilled Talent)

726
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,260
(Yinan Guild Hall)

727
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,980
(Everlasting Glory)
May I ask

728
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,340
what this sentence means?

729
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,260
Sir.

730
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,220
Mr. Wang.

731
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,380
(He Wenshen, an examinee from Yinan)

732
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,780
You really found it.

733
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,900
Mr. Liu, your handwriting is quite good.

734
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,180
Let me see the fire.

735
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,900
- Add more firewood.
- Yes.

736
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,180
Ms. Zhou.

737
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,420
How's it going?

738
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,980
I've bribed the steward

739
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,300
for info about all the examinees.

740
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,420
Thank you, Nanny Tao.

741
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,340
I dare not accept this.

742
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,500
Ms. Zhou, to select a husband
for Miss Yushan,

743
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,580
you refuse sickly men,

744
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,940
bookworms,

745
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,380
and those with prominent families.

746
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,860
You've really put in a lot of effort.

747
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,580
Ignore her.

748
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,980
Have you found anyone suitable?

749
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,220
Of course.

750
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,140
Among these dozen or so scholars,

751
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,700
there's one particularly
talented young man.

752
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,340
It's said he topped
the provincial exams,

753
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,820
a true scholar of the literary star.

754
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
He's bound to succeed.

755
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,860
But his family is poor,

756
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,140
his temperament is a bit reserved,

757
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,440
and he's not good at socializing.

758
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,100
What's his name?

759
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,900
He's Mr. He, He Wenshen.

760
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
He Wenshen.

761
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,340
Alright, let's wait and see.

762
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,340
This can't be rushed.

763
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,320
Yes.

764
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,860
By the way, has a young man

765
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,980
named Yang Ping arrived?

766
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,740
He's not an examinee
but a family member.

767
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,420
I'm not sure about him.

768
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,820
Let me go check.

769
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,980
No, no, no.

770
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,660
Let's first get through today's banquet.

771
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,340
There must be no mistakes today.

772
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
Yes, yes.

773
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,980
(Scholarly Glory)
Mr. Zhuang, please sit.

774
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,460
I'm not worthy of this.

775
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,940
Today, Mr. Zhuang is hosting,

776
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,000
and it's a reunion of fellow villagers,

777
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,900
so it's most fitting
for you to sit here.

778
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,980
In previous years,

779
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,020
when Yinan scholars came to the Capital,

780
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,740
everyone would prepare a test for them.

781
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,860
(Yan Rendu from Judicial Review)
I wonder if this year will be the same.

782
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,340
We've discussed it.

783
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,620
Tomorrow, there will be a test.

784
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,740
Yes, we're already drafting questions.

785
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,540
Mr. Yan, do you plan

786
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,740
to participate this year?

787
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,700
Forget it.
The Judicial Review is too busy

788
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,260
for me to trouble you.

789
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,300
Father, I'll skip the test this time.

790
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm leading the event,

791
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,820
so you must participate.

792
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,620
Next year, you'll be taking
the Spring Exam,

793
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,980
so it's a good chance to test you.

794
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,890
Master,

795
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,340
it's already noon.
Shall we begin the meal now?

796
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,540
Thank you, Ruyin.

797
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,740
Everyone here is a talent from Yinan.

798
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,900
Today, I've prepared
some wine and dishes

799
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,820
to welcome you all.

800
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,300
Let's raise a glass together.

801
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,940
I wish you all success
in the coming year's Imperial Exams.

802
00:43:59,130 --> 00:43:59,970
Cheers.

803
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,820
Thank you, Mr. Zhuang.

804
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,300
Why are there six hot dishes?

805
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,660
It really is six dishes.

806
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,340
- Six dishes.
- Six dishes.

807
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It really is six dishes.

808
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,920
If it were any other time,
it wouldn't matter,

809
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,300
but with the New Year coming,
this is rather off-putting.

810
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,300
So what if there are six hot dishes?

811
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,460
These people are really hard to please.

812
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,340
According to Yinan customs,

813
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,840
it's considered bad luck
to serve six or four dishes.

814
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,580
Why?

815
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,020
Because it's the number of dishes

816
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,200
for the last meal of a criminal
before execution.

817
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,420
Ruyin,

818
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,980
do you know in Yinan,

819
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,780
you mustn't serve six or four dishes?

820
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,500
It's considered a meal
for someone about to die.

821
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,960
Please calm down, Master.

822
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,980
I had originally prepared 12 dishes,

823
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,140
but it turns out that many of the plates

824
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,940
in the guild hall's kitchen
were damaged,

825
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,140
so only these dishes could be served.

826
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,700
I've sent someone
back home to bring more.

827
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,940
Then why did you start the meal now?

828
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,700
I was hoping for a good omen
by starting at noon.

829
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,540
Besides, I was raised in the north

830
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,380
and didn't know about this taboo.

831
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,780
Please let me serve the 7th dish.

832
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,620
I knew this would lead to trouble.

833
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,700
Is this the 7th dish?

834
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,380
We have one dish for the first place

835
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,020
and one dish for the second place.

836
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,620
How could we forget the third?

837
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,740
(Scholarly Glory)

838
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,340
On behalf of my father,

839
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,140
I'd like to congratulate you in advance,

840
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,320
wishing you to be the top three
in the Imperial Exams.

841
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,620
How elegant. Truly elegant.

842
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,470
Yes.

843
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,310
Great.

844
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,260
Who's this young lady?

845
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,500
She's Zhuang Hanyan,

846
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,820
the daughter of Mrs. Zhuang.

847
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,140
Mr. Zhuang,
you have a wonderful daughter.

848
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,940
Gentle, virtuous, a model for all women.

849
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,820
Hanyan,

850
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,700
where did you find
this white porcelain plate?

851
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,340
It's a plate used
for offerings to the gods.

852
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,340
Father, please don't tell others.

853
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,980
Clever girl.

854
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,340
Let's go.

855
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,940
Come here.

856
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,260
Come on. Come here.

857
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,820
Sit here beside me.

858
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,260
Father, I think this isn't proper.

859
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,220
What's improper
about sitting next to me?

860
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,540
Father, this is my seat.

861
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,380
Yuchi,

862
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,980
all the gentlemen here
are talented scholars from Yinan.

863
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,640
You should go to that table

864
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,700
and discuss your study with them.

865
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,460
Come on.

866
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,510
- Come on.
- Come on.

867
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,620
I'll return to the women's table.

868
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,740
But Father has a point.

869
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,740
One can be influenced
by the company they keep.

870
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,380
Lately, Yuchi has fallen behind
in his studies.

871
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,220
It'd be a good chance for him
to learn from the scholars here,

872
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,140
which will definitely help
with tomorrow's test.

873
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,300
Who said I've fallen behind?

874
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,420
It's just a test.
Why would I need to learn?

875
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,140
Looks like Young Master Zhuang
is determined to win this time.

876
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,300
We'll just have to wait and see.

877
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,340
Hanyan, come here. Sit next to me.

878
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,740
Sit.

879
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,180
- Everyone, let's start.
- Go.

880
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,100
Go sit over there.

881
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,580
One more glass.

882
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,470
Come on. Cheers.

883
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,520
Mr. Wang, Mr. Li, let's drink together.

884
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,220
Miss Hanyan, you're quite a planner.

885
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,180
You stole the spotlight today.

886
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,060
Which young master has caught your eye?

887
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,100
Mom, it's her causing trouble again.

888
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,300
Sit down and enjoy your meal.

889
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,540
Someone will deal with her.

890
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,020
Hanyan,

891
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,620
you grew up in Danzhou,

892
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,580
so you're most familiar
with Yinan's customs.

893
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,500
How about helping Ms. Zhou

894
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:54,500
in organizing the upcoming sacrifice?

895
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,060
You flatter me.

896
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,820
I'm too young

897
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,300
to handle such an important task.

898
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,120
Though you're young,

899
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,250
you're quite capable.

900
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,910
All the uncles here have seen it today.

901
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,970
There's no need to refuse.

902
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,500
Well,

903
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,780
I won't disappoint you, Father.

904
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,500
Zhuang Hanyan.

905
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,220
It's only been a few days,

906
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,380
