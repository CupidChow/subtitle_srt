1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
Let's find out the equations that朝��도록 had!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a little bit of a

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a little bit of a

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
bit of a little bit of a little

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
bit of a little bit of a little

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of a little bit of a little bit

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of a little bit of a little bit

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
of a little bit of a little bit

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of a little bit of a little bit

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of a little bit of a little

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
bit of a little bit of a little

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
bit of a little bit of a little

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bit of a little bit of a little

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,480
bit of astorm

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,000
and a cold

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
wind

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The End

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll hold it.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hurry up, don't block the way.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
God wants to bring Yang Qian here.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know where to go from behind.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No problem.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's too high.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Move down a little bit.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't block it.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's the difference?

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I just brushed it.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's too bright.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you two are fine,

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
help me get out of here.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The leaves of the moon are also poisonous.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The grandson of the Qin family last year

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
was killed because of this flower.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Please leave.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What?

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There's no one to save him.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look,

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the Qin family

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
is so good at teaching these two daughters.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's really a shame.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Qin family is not in the mood.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm afraid that

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the flower price of the household

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
can't be reached.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The Qin family is in the mood.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tomorrow is the wedding day.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Today,

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
why don't we

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
drink a cup of wine in advance?

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come, everyone, please.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How about

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
we wait for the aunt?

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Her house in the yard is busy.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She must be there

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
at some point.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't bother her.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's eat.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Come, come, come.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wait, wait, wait.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't move.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry, everyone.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Today, the kitchen is chaotic.

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I forgot about the big deal.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hurry, hurry.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's funny.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's not a big deal.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Han Yan,

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
this is my cousin.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can call her aunt.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm weak since I was a child.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All the people in the family

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
are all because of her.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Han Yan,

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Han Yan first time

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
to visit you.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think this is

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Miss Zhuang San.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sit, sit, sit.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Eat more later.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You really made me feel guilty.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm just

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a rude and rude person.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've been around

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
for so many years.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I'm in this house

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and I'm so happy.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm already a blessing.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I just hit you.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Everyone,

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
wait.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
30 days.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Your Majesty said

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the case was delayed for too long.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If there's no more

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the evidence of the unlawful party's will

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll be questioned.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yun Xi,

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
you should

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
leave this house as soon as possible.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mother.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your family

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
was in a war.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your father and I

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
raised you well.

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
These years,

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
you've never been in a grudge

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
with your parents.

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Even if you married

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
the eldest daughter of Zhuang family

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and got married with her,

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you agreed.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But now

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
your father is in a bad situation.

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Everyone in the family

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
is trying to raise you.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't want you to be

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
rich and rich.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I just hope you and A-Zhi

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
can live a peaceful life.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But the Court

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
has brought you

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
too many troubles.

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The wife and son

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
are in a bad situation.

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And you don't have to say

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
the crimes you committed.

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now,

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
if you make trouble again,

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm afraid...

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Mother.

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You don't have to

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
make trouble again

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
if you make trouble again.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've already made my decision.

153
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you take A-Zhi and A-Zhi

154
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and come back to Yinan

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with this marriage,

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you can talk to them.

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yunxi,

158
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is there something

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that needs to happen?

160
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Mother, you make trouble again.

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I just want to talk to you.

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Be careful.

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's gone.

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's gone.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Be careful.

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's gone.

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
A-Zhi.

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Aunt.

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why did A-Zhi come

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to Tianhan?

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Father said

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A-Zhi came to ask for money.

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I haven't got married yet.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't give A-Zhi money.

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But A-Zhi

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
prepared a gift for me.

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's a silver.

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But why did you

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ask A-Zhi for this?

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
A-Zhi.

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Aunt Han Yan,

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I hope that

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A-Zhi will grow up

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and have

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the courage and ability to be self-sufficient.

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Aunt Han Yan,

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
this is the gift

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
from father.

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
A-Zhi,

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the grandfather

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
gave you money to pay for the money.

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I only give you the seal

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
but not the silk thread.

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What does this mean?

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What do you think?

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No matter how high the seal is,

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
it will be

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
taken by the one who holds the thread.

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What does brother-in-law

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
want me to do?

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You misunderstood.

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I still have to go to my mother.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Brother-in-law, please take your leave.

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm afraid that

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the day of the He family reunion

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
will be different

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
because of the family you want to see.

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why?

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Can you take me out of the city?

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Of course.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I have to go back quickly.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Thank you.

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Think of a way.

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go to the city.

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Look at the jewelry.

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Brother Yanxi.

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Beautiful jewelry.

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Look at this.

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is for your mother.

222
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
As a new year's gift.

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You decide for yourself.

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This lady has good eyes.

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is a top-class jewelry.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I take this young lady with me.

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Come on, I'll put it on for you.

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Brother Yanxi.

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This sister said

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
this is suitable for young ladies.

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Otherwise, you can take it all.

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll take the other one.

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I really take it.

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll take you with me.

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll take care of you.

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You take care of me.

237
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you, brother Yanxi.

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Thank you, brother Yanxi.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Brother Yanxi.

240
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Brother Yanxi.

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay.

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He won't come after me.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We'll go to the city.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You want to climb this high wall?

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's go here.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You want to go out?

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If you don't want to go out,

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you can climb the wall yourself.

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wei Yunxi.

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Come and see.

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on.

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Chaiqing.

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
How are you?

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Can I have some medicine?

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How is that woman who cooked for you?

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's all good.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can go down the stairs.

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll go down the stairs.

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll go down the stairs.

261
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll go down the stairs.

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll go down the stairs.

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll go down the stairs.

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll go down the stairs.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm so glad that you can go down the stairs.

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't worry.

267
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's the first night.

268
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You've already sent me to the city.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why did you come here?

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The gate is closed at night.

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I thought I couldn't come to see you.

272
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Fortunately, Lord Fu is a good person.

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And Xiao Lu can come out.

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Xiao Lu?

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Gou Dong.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
When we were in Danzhou,

277
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
we used to eat bread every year.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I brought some ingredients today

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
to make you some hot rice.

280
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, I'll help you.

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Your hands can't be dirty.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I brought some helpers here.

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I can only kill people with my hands.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I can't cook.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you remember?

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I wanted to spend a lot of money

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
in the food market for a year.

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But we don't have any money left.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You told me that

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
the master of the eight-pack is the same.

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I believed you.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But I ate the stone.

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I had blood in my teeth.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You thought I was poisoned.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Of course.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You don't want to pack anything

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
in the west this year.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Tonight is the west.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll get some wine.

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You can't drink.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll do it.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll get some wine.

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Fu Yixi.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What?

305
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let me ask you.

306
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What's the most important thing

307
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
for you?

308
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Family.

309
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
For me,

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
the most important thing

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
is him.

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What do you want to say?

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What do you think he looks like?

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I've been alone.

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
When all the big smoke

316
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
was in the east,

317
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and flew to the south,

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
he flew to the north.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He worked hard to get the food.

320
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He only had one plan.

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Do you know

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
what he really wanted?

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Dad.

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No need to say.

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Since he came to the capital,

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
he said that he only had one plan.

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I asked him what he wanted.

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He said that he only had

329
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
sincerity and bitterness.

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He said

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
he only wanted one family.

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Now,

333
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the only thing I don't understand is

334
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
what is the purpose

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
of you returning from Danzhou.

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I've been thinking about it since I was little.

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm going back this time.

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I really want to have a family.

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you for tonight.

340
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's just for tonight.

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Thank you for saving the capital.

342
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I will remember this peace in my heart.

343
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If I have a chance to repay you,

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I will not give up.

345
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There will be a chance

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
to repay you in the future.

347
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I will not give up.

348
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There will be a chance

349
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to repay you in the future.

350
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Sit down.

351
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Come on, Mother.

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Come on.

353
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Sit down.

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Sit down.

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The dishes are all ready.

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
When they are ready,

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
we will have dinner.

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Have you ever been to the western door?

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've been there three times.

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Aunt Chen said that

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
we should have dinner first.

362
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I will go to the western door again.

363
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
After all,

364
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
this is the first time I've been home.

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Why isn't Han Yan here?

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Father and father went to the western door.

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What is this child talking about?

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Han Yan.

369
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Grandmother, father.

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I've been in the capital for the first time.

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I've been watching the play.

372
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry, father.

373
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's okay.

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Sit down.

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Sit down.

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, right.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why didn't you see mother?

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Aunt Sun has been to the capital.

379
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Come on, sit down.

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Try this.

381
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
In the early years,

382
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was in the same school as you.

383
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I knew that you loved green beans the most.

384
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I found a secret recipe.

385
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
When I was in the kitchen,

386
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I sent someone to the Danzhou Jisong.

387
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's been so many years.

388
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I can't wait to ask you.

389
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How is father's cooking?

390
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So,

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
these years,

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
the green beans I got in Danzhou

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
were all made by my father.

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The pulse is not good.

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The taste should be good.

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's a pity that I can't eat this food.

397
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
At that time,

398
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
to adjust the taste,

399
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I ate it for two or three days.

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I was so tired.

401
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Try it.

402
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Thank you, father.

403
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The day of the first night,

404
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
suddenly,

405
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
my life was in a mess.

406
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It was like a beautiful dream.

407
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is the first time in my life

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that I feel the warmth of my home.

409
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Only mother is missing.

410
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This is the first year after I went home.

411
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I wish

412
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
mother could be with me.

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
She is finally here.

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But...

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Eat it all.

416
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Eat it all.

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This year,

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
it's rare for us to have a group in the Manor.

419
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Han Yan is back.

420
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Xiven is with us.

421
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Xiven,

422
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
isn't it good for appetite?

423
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What do you want to say to me?

424
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I will go to the kitchen

425
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and give you some food.

426
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I will go to the kitchen

427
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and give you some food.

428
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Master,

429
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
try this.

430
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Aunt Chen,

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
send me the new year gifts

432
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
that I have prepared.

433
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Xiven,

434
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
you are so thoughtful.

435
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Master,

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you have broken the law.

437
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You are free.

438
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I have no merit.

439
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I am free.

440
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You think I am a rich man

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
who is a rich wife?

442
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What else do you want?

443
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Mother, you should take care of it.

444
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I am not a group.

445
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Why not?

446
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You can only take care of your appearance.

447
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I am very kind.

448
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yun Nisu?

449
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Xiven,

450
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I remember you and I

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
got married two years ago.

452
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You have done this for me.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What happened today?

454
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Try it.

455
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Xiven,

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
you should try it too.

457
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't worry.

458
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I will take care of it.

459
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Xiven, you are joking.

460
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I...

461
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Why is it bitter?

462
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
There is a cause for everything.

463
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's good to be bitter.

464
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I am the one who is responsible for it.

465
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I have never been given

466
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
the new year gifts

467
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
even if I don't come to eat the New Year's dinner.

468
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I am hungry today.

469
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I will send it to you.

470
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's all.

471
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Chen Meng,

472
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
return to the palace.

473
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yes.

474
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Xiven,

475
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
you are a good girl.

476
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I am not a bad girl.

477
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I am a good girl.

478
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I am a good girl.

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I am a good girl.

480
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I am a good girl.

481
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I am a good girl.

482
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I am a good girl.

483
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I am a good girl.

484
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I am a good girl.

485
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I am a good girl.

486
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I am a good girl.

487
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I am a good girl.

488
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I am a good girl.

489
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I am a good girl.

490
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I will accept anya

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This is the New Year's dinner

492
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
that I use to eat the varicose yourself.

493
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The same you tres

494
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They will sound a big meeting.

495
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,120
What is this?

496
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,160
It's a dead body.

497
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,040
The dead body is in the palace now.

498
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,120
It's a dead body.

499
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,200
It's a dead body.

500
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,160
It's a dead body.

501
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
It's a dead body.

502
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
It's a dead body.

503
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
It's a dead body.

504
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,800
Aunt.

505
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,960
Aunt.

506
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,160
Aunt.

507
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Master is back.

508
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,960
Master.

509
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
He is being lured into the palace.

510
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,000
Who lured him into the palace?

511
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,840
How can I know?

512
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,000
It seems like

513
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,640
there are still several officials

514
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,960
who can't come out.

515
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
They just said

516
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,840
they were in trouble.

517
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,320
Go back to the house first.

518
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,680
After all, he is the enemy of the Jin City officials.

519
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,360
We can find out what he is.

520
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,440
Yes.

521
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,760
Go.

522
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,360
Yes.

523
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,000
What's wrong?

524
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,760
Go ahead.

525
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,560
When I came here, I heard

526
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,040
that all the maid and servant's body

527
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,120
were taken away.

528
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,240
They said they would take all the trouble out of the house.

529
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
But,

530
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,440
what devil are they going to do?

531
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,000
Do us nice thanks

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,760
and get out once you get the cooperation.

533
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,800
Thank you, master.

534
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Get up.

535
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
My son is in the palace, holding on to it.

536
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
You don't want to save him.

537
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
You're trying to get him out of here?

538
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Old Madam is joking.

539
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
The master and the wife are both in the same family.

540
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
They're both in the same family.

541
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
If they're in the same family,

542
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
they won't be able to get into the palace.

543
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
But the body is bought from Hua Jin Jin.

544
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Why did you take them all away?

545
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
It's not clear.

546
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Now that the master is in trouble,

547
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
the master is trying to get the maid out of here.

548
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
He just wants to stay in the mansion

549
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
and keep the innocent life.

550
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
The mansion is his own house.

551
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
He can't even tolerate your old mother talking to me.

552
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Old Madam is always acting like a fool.

553
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
She's always been against the house.

554
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,800
How come she's so arrogant today?

555
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
She's so arrogant.

556
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
I'm sure she's just taking advantage of my money.

557
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Let's start over.

558
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
You...

559
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
The master is in Mrs. Zhou's house.

560
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
I'll go and talk to her.

561
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Ru Yan, what are you doing?

562
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
The master is in trouble.

563
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
He's so incompetent.

564
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Please take care of him.

565
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
You're far away.

566
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Thank you, Madam.

567
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Mrs. Zhou,

568
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
send Mrs. Zhou to the Palace of the Princess.

569
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
I have no choice but to go out of the palace.

570
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Madam,

571
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm a mother of three.

572
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
I'm a helpless maid.

573
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I always fly out of the mansion and go nowhere.

574
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Why do you have to take us in?

575
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,800
You kneel and beg for my help.

576
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
But you dare to defy my order.

577
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
It's true.

578
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I those who should be punished...

579
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,800
pay the price.

580
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
If it's right that the Mrs. Zhou wants...

581
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
to marry me,

582
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I only got you an image.

583
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Leave.

584
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Go inside.

585
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Are we going in or out?

586
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,800
We으면서 should that no wonder that...

587
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
you're already atting me up.

588
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,500
Look this move by

589
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,800
Actually...

590
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I will kill him if he comes back.

591
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
What do you mean?

592
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I will...

593
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
I will kill him if he comes back.

594
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,800
If your father can't come back,

595
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
what do you think?

596
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
He can't come back?

597
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Where is my father?

598
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Remember what I said.

599
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,800
If your father is the god of the Zhuang family,

600
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
if he is the god,

601
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
we will be in trouble.

602
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Why are you looking for me?

603
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Mother is in a big trouble today.

604
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Where did you come from?

605
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Mother, can you say something?

606
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Today Zhuang family is in trouble.

607
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
It has nothing to do with you.

608
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
It's good that it's good.

609
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
It's a matter of time.

610
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
What's the use of saying that?

611
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Of course it's useful.

612
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
If it has nothing to do with mother,

613
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
she is my daughter.

614
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
I will kill her.

615
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I will kill her.

616
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
I will kill her.

617
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I will kill her.

618
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
I will kill her.

619
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Mother is the god of the Zhuang family.

620
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
She is the god of the Zhuang family.

621
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Why do you want to kill her?

622
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
I have a secret case with uncle Yuwen.

623
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
We will discuss it together.

624
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I asked Uncle Yuen for a secret plan.

625
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I asked him for it.

626
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,300
But he refused to talk.

627
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,000
So he wants to make Zhuang's family

628
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,300
and his family suffer together?

629
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Zhuang Han Yan.

630
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,300
What should I do with Ruan Xun Wen?

631
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
You can't ask him.

632
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
Then please tell me.

633
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,800
When did father turn into a monk?

634
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,300
Why was he imprisoned?

635
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Zhu Mu.

636
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
The soldiers have come in.

637
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
I see.

638
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
The King of Qin.

639
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Master.

640
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
What have you done?

641
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Master.

642
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Can you explain it clearly?

643
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Where is my master?

644
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
I don't know.

645
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Master.

646
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
What is it?

647
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
I don't know.

648
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I don't know.

649
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
It's a big deal.

650
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Are you all right?

651
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
I am fine.

652
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
I'm fine.

653
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm fine.

654
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm fine.

655
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm fine.

656
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
I'm fine.

657
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm fine.

658
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
It's all right.

659
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm fine.

660
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm fine.

661
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
I'm fine.

662
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I'm fine.

663
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm fine.

664
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,600
and are detained in the palace.

665
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,120
They only need to find out the evidence

666
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,400
and arrest the party's suspect immediately.

667
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,720
If you don't mind,

668
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,840
you can let us off without any responsibility.

669
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,320
But before that,

670
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,480
I would like to ask you to take a step back.

671
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,040
I will investigate it.

672
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,520
How can I do that?

673
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,160
My father is a clear-minded person.

674
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,240
He will never leave the house with the corrupt officials.

675
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,360
I dare to ask you,

676
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,400
if I find out the word of the party,

677
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,920
how can I ask for forgiveness?

678
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,080
Your Majesty,

679
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,720
if you find out the word of the party,

680
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,480
you will be executed.

681
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,560
Cheng Ruo's father.

682
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,520
Prince Han seems to be here doing nothing.

683
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,080
Aтерu cò xùngsangba다.

684
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,520
That means that

685
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,080
his father was didn't send for the troops.

686
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,840
How?

687
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,040
That's nonsense.

688
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,240
He found out everything with��

689
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:58,540
on the picture in the

690
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,260
truth.

691
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,100
You wrote a letter.

692
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Why?

693
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Master Yuwen, why are you here?

694
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
You are the talents of this court.

695
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,100
You have been here for a year.

696
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
You are not paid.

697
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,100
I am here to prepare the jade for you.

698
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,100
I have been here for a year.

699
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Please.

700
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Jade?

701
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Jade?

702
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
This is what His Majesty meant.

703
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
His Majesty ordered me to come here.

704
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
I am here to see you.

705
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
I am here to see you from the capital.

706
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,100
This is my arrangement.

707
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Master Yuwen,

708
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,100
I don't know what you are doing here.

709
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
I just want to say that

710
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
the high-ranking of the Pei Party

711
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
who has been arrested

712
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
and the corruption of Pei's father

713
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,100
have been severely punished.

714
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Master Yuwen,

715
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,100
do you want to prove that we are the ones who are guilty?

716
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Master Yuwen, you are suspecting us.

717
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
I have proof.

718
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
The Pei Party's son, Wei Luo,

719
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,100
is hiding in the middle of all of you.

720
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
What is this?

721
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,100
How could the Pei Party be like this?

722
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
It's just a joke.

723
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Good boy.

724
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
We are the Pei Party's son, Wei Luo,

725
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,100
but my father is the one who is guilty.

726
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
Last year,

727
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
the King of the Eagle Valley

728
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
was caught and arrested.

729
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
He is lucky.

730
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Yes.

731
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,100
He is also the Pei Party's son.

732
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Master Yuwen.

733
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,100
I will investigate the situation of the Pei Party's son.

734
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,100
If you want to leave the palace early,

735
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
and go back to a good old age,

736
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,100
please cooperate quickly.

737
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Master Zhu Wei, please.

738
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Master Yuwen.

739
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Yes.

740
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
How is he?

741
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
He is guilty.

742
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,100
You are all innocent.

743
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
The Pei Party's son,

744
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,100
the former Pei Party's son,

745
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
is the one who is guilty.

746
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
I am sorry.

747
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
I am sorry.

748
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
I am sorry.

749
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,100
I want the time.

750
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
Order to put the surrender up.

751
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
I am sorry.

752
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,100
I don't mean toisso the past.

753
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
In the future,

754
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,100
If he may be the one who can't be heard,

755
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,100
we don't want to be separated.

756
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
So,

757
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,440
it is a chance for me

758
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,020
to have a good time.

759
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,060
Come.

760
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,960
The second wife fromonerang,

761
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,480
This matter must be with our Zhuang family

762
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
When this matter is resolved

763
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,480
We can go back

764
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Why are you alone?

765
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
This morning, I've been at home

766
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
I've been to the south to talk about my family

767
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
You're in charge of the Piedontic case

768
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Why did you come here?

769
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Do you know anything?

770
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
You shameless people

771
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
You have more than ten rooms

772
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Even if you want to spread our culture

773
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Why do you have to keep us locked up here?

774
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
You're right

775
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Don't be so formal

776
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
We have nothing to do with us

777
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Look

778
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
If you find out

779
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
There's no way to get along with me

780
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
I have to find the old thief from Yuwen Chang'an

781
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
To find out the truth

782
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Please

783
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Go to the main hall

784
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
The Piedontic case

785
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:20,960
The Piedontic case

786
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:48,960
The Piedontic case

787
00:40:50,960 --> 00:41:18,960
The Piedontic case

788
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:48,960
The Piedontic case

789
00:41:48,960 --> 00:42:08,960
The Piedontic case
