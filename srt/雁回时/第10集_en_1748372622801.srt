I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Only about the clothes.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mostly about the clothes.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No....

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Only about the clothes.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I have pride at youth.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I can't be a مر n Ela!!

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
lost

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,260
was

46
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,060
not

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,520
改

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,380
really

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Even if I become a murderer,

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will also become the most powerful knife in the master's hand.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hahaha!

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The End

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you looking at?

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's wrong?

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Where are you?

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ah!

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ah!

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm called Chai Qing.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What's your name?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My name is Zhuang Han Yan.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They all call me

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
a fag.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Do you have food?

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not a fag.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm a fag.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm a fag.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm a fag.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm a fag.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm a fag.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ah!

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Slow down.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's in your hand?

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm a fag.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm a fag.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm going to lock myself up.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't be afraid.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Come.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Give me your hand.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've been floating in the sea for many years.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I thought

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I would be able to live with the world.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But I didn't know

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
how to deal with it.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I just want to

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
take on such a love and a role.

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's been half an hour.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We're in the capital.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're free now.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why do you want to go back to Zhuang Fu?

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's where I dreamed of.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've been living in the capital.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've been living in the capital.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I've been living in the capital.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've been living in the capital.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
At least

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to see

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
what my family looks like.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You really don't want to go to the sea with me?

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Chai Jing,

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I know you're not used to living on the road.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can leave.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You don't have to be tied by me.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can take care of myself.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He saved my life,

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
helped me get hurt,

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
gave me food and water.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He told me

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that my life

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
was not a mess.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
In those years,

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
he was as good as my sister.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I knew

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
he was my new master.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If he wanted to kill me,

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I would have killed him.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If someone wanted to kill him,

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I would be the most stubborn fool he had ever had.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No matter what he wanted to do,

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I would do my best to help and protect him.

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I would die.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Speak!

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Where is your secret passage?

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Look!

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How hard it is!

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do you regret it?

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't regret it.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Miss, you're awake.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll go to inform Master now.

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Han Yan!

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're awake.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're awake.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm so sorry.

135
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
After Miss San's death,

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you can escape under the sea.

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The Dali Temple is a place of glory.

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We're not afraid of it.

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look, I'm happy.

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I forgot to ask.

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why did the Dali Temple suddenly release you?

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The observation is clear.

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The innocent girl is not worth it.

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is she going to do it for you?

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What's wrong with your face?

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's just a minor injury.

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Han Yan is not filial.

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let the grandmother and father bear the pain.

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Miss San, you have to rest well.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You just came back from the Ghost Gate.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You can't be tired anymore.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How about it?

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Father,

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Han Yan is tired today.

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
She wants to rest early.

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's okay.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll leave the painting to the play tomorrow.

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mother,

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you should go back and rest.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Rest well.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Master,

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
my aunt is here too.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't want to talk about the truth.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Actually, the case of the Danzhou Sea Ferry

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
has been settled long ago.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Only because this case will be related to another secret drug case,

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I was able to avoid it.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In the case, the real brother is locked up in the place.

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We will interrogate him in detail.

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This matter is now a big deal.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I and Miss San's reputation

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
are in a bad shape.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I also have to deal with this person

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
with a big deal of suspicion.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I will not let you go.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I will not let you go.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will deal with the case of the Danzhou Sea Ferry.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The secret drug case that you mentioned is...

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's not necessary to tell you.

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have been talking too much.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Forgive me. Forgive me.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Thanks to your brotherhood,

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
you have a long life and a great revenge.

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My daughter, Han Yan,

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
has also been able to get rid of the suspicion.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know how to repay her.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Lord Yue Fu is serious.

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If she is not here,

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will leave first.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Then I will send you off.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Lord Yue Fu,

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
what does the real brother look like?

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He really is a woman.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
As Miss San said,

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it is a matter of time before the other three ladies are released.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have been back to the capital since I was young.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But the brotherhood has always been in my heart.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The other day,

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
when the Bodhisattva's name was heard,

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I was the murderer who was shot by the wild rain.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was in a dilemma.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I was in a dilemma.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was in a dilemma.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I was the only one who was shot by the wild rain.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I was in a dilemma.

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I was in a dilemma.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Han Yan is right.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's not necessary.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The case of the Bodhisattva's case is a rule.

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If Miss San needs it,

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I will come back.

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Lord Yue Fu, I will send you off.

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Aunt,

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the girl in the wolf's den...

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
When she was sent out of the manor,

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I asked her to go to the Danzhou for a visit.

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
She can also take care of the sheep's clothing.

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You should prepare some more dishes for her.

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let her go out of the capital quietly.

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Doctor Jin, don't come back.

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mrs. Tao,

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
do you think

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
that Zhang You Chang Fu Fu

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
was really killed by the Northern Sea Pavilion?

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't think so.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Miss San is absolutely innocent.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But she said that the real brother has fallen into the trap.

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Did she just find someone

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
who was accused of being arrested by Zhuang An Yan?

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But the Court of Judicial Review always says that

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
he would never be deceived.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And this case has something to do with the other secret.

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't know what they are saying.

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Aunt Zhou, you are so nice.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I know that I was caught by Zhuang An Yan.

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was so angry that I didn't want to take the bridge.

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mr. Yang, you are suspicious again.

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I cried that day when you were taking the wine.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You are so reckless.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You even asked Zhuang An Yan to run away.

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Anyway, I gave you the Yan Shi Wen Shu.

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The silver we received today has been brought here.

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is not enough.

246
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You only did half of the work.

247
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Of course, there is only half of the price.

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The same-sex bureau said that there are 300 taels of gold in the door of the auction hall.

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But this is really a shame.

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Why should I be the one to do this?

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If Aunt Zhou can't take this silver away,

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I can't guarantee that I will say anything.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This Yilan Society is so noisy that Zhuang An Yan is embarrassed.

254
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But someone is behind it.

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You dare?

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I dare not.

257
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is the big scheme of the Yilan Society.

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's been half a year since Feng Chun Jie was arrested.

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The account has been in and out.

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
How could there be 200 taels of silver?

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Aunt has been in the house for many years.

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now that she is in the middle of the auction,

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
there will be a way.

264
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So I sent the silver to this Yilan Society.

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I know that you are a very good person.

266
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You should have said that earlier.

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If you dare to harm me in the dark,

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
this matter will be spread to the whole of Yangyang.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll take my leave.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You...

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can leave.

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I need to take a rest.

273
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll be back.

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Stop!

278
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who are you?

279
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm the third Miss Zhuang Han Yan.

280
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm here to see you.

281
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Is Mr. Fu busy?

282
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He's not here today.

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please tell him.

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He's not here today.

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Please go back.

286
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The sea powder you caught yesterday was a good sign.

297
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a secret drug.

298
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's hard to find it.

299
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Have you seen the police?

300
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Who's the police?

301
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't know him.

302
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Mr. Fu,

303
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
you're talking about Zhuang Jia today.

304
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You're lying.

305
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's not true.

306
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You know the police is innocent.

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But you're not the one who killed him.

308
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're the one who killed the police.

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're the one who committed the crime.

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You're not the one who killed him.

311
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But I'm the one who killed Zhuang Jia.

312
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm the one who killed Zhuang You Chang.

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm here to be the one who killed him.

314
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Please forgive me, Mr. Fu.

315
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll do anything for you.

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Mr. Fu, let me go.

317
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He's a free and loyal man.

318
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not a man of my word.

319
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If you keep doing this,

320
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
you'll be killed.

321
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Is there a way to save him?

322
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The imperial doctor has confessed his crime.

323
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's impossible.

324
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Is there no other way?

325
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Until now,

326
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
we don't need to lie.

327
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We've been through a lot.

328
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What's the inside?

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Tell me everything.

330
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I heard about you.

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He was born in Pingkun.

332
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He's been suffering since then.

333
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He's been studying in the capital.

334
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He's a good lawyer.

335
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He's always been looking at my father.

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He's a rich man.

337
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He's never been so good to me.

338
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He's been a good man.

339
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He's been a good man.

340
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He's been a good man.

341
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He's been unwell for the past few years.

342
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He's in a bad mood.

343
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He's been suffering from a stroke.

344
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
He's been suffering from a stroke.

345
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And this auntie is angry with me.

346
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
She's angry with me.

347
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Since I was a kid,

348
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I've been suffering from a stroke.

349
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I've been in a low life.

350
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I've been suffering from a stroke.

351
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But I've been suffering from a stroke.

352
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Where did you get the money?

353
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What?

354
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You've been robbed of your money.

355
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I took it.

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You've lost it.

357
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Qianqian lost it to you.

358
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What else?

359
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You could have sold it to me.

360
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Who wants to kill you?

361
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You bought it.

362
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
He bought it for 17 years.

363
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You're not going to sell it to me.

364
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You'll be sold to me.

365
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
At that moment,

366
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Zhang Youzhang looked at me.

367
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He made me angry.

368
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hurry up.

369
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Let him go.

370
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Let him go.

371
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Let him go.

372
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You want to run?

373
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Where are you going?

374
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Come here.

375
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Listen to me.

376
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Come here.

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Why do you say that now?

378
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The killing will be long-term.

379
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The Court of Justice will be in my hands.

380
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I have no evidence.

381
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I have no witnesses.

382
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If I just leave the court,

383
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
who will be responsible for the crime?

384
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What's your purpose

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
between you and Chaixing?

386
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The first day I'm talking to you

387
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
is the truth.

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I just want to live.

389
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I want a family.

390
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Do you want to be a man?

391
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm talking to you.

392
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What is a family?

393
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
There's a blood-sucking person

394
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
by your side.

395
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's a family.

396
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
If there's no blood-sucking person,

397
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
it's not a family.

398
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I've had a family like that before.

399
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In Danzhou,

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
in Nanjing,

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
it's not a family I want.

402
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I've told you everything you want.

403
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Now, you're going to put me in the prison

404
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and put me in the prison?

405
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Are you really willing to save Chaixing

406
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
by killing one person?

407
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm willing to.

408
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I forgot.

409
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What do you mean?

410
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Chaixing and his accomplices

411
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
were close to Master Pei

412
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
when they were on the same boat.

413
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They were on the boat

414
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and were on the boat to the sea.

415
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So I found Master Pei's whereabouts

416
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
after I arrested them.

417
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I found the whereabouts

418
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
of Master Pei's son.

419
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And the remains of those dirty things.

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

421
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
If we don't

422
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
kill Master Pei and Danzhou,

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Master Yan won't believe me.

424
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But it's because of that

425
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
that Chaixing is in a difficult situation

426
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and she's going to die.

427
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Master Yan is here.

428
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Miss San, please go back.

429
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You've been in the capital for years.

430
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You've been in the capital for years.

431
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You've been in the capital for years.

432
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You've been in the capital for years.

433
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Tell me the truth.

434
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You really can't save Chaixing

435
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
without a chance.

436
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
My past is all out to you.

437
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But you

438
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
have many secrets.

439
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The day we met,

440
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
you've already seen all my lies and tricks.

441
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Even Danzhou got the hairpin.

442
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But you didn't catch me and help me.

443
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I was caught in the sea by the mountain.

444
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You asked me

445
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
how to deal with it.

446
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I was forced into a family.

447
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I was threatened by my family.

448
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You took me to the capital in time.

449
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Even I was in a daze.

450
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You were in the dark

451
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and you were fighting for me.

452
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And Duan Tian Shi

453
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
was in the house and was in a mess.

454
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I found a note in the candle.

455
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You did it, too, right?

456
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yes.

457
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I've seen it all.

458
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I should have a reason.

459
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
What do you think

460
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
is the reason?

461
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm not sure.

462
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm not sure.

463
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm not sure.

464
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm not sure.

465
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm not sure.

466
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm not sure.

467
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm not sure.

468
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm not sure.

469
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm not sure.

470
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm not sure.

471
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm not sure.

472
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm not sure.

473
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm not sure.

474
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm not sure.

475
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm not sure.

476
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm not sure.

477
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I know.

478
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm not qualified to ask for your help.

479
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If you don't mind,

480
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
you can let me do anything.

481
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This is your last way.

482
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Except for this painful and tiring body,

483
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I can't help you.

484
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Except for this painful and tiring body,

485
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't have any enemies.

486
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Lord Fu has been helping me several times.

487
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I can't think of any other reason.

488
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm not qualified to ask for your help.

489
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Except for this painful and tiring body,

490
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
These are all left by Danzhou.

491
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes.

492
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Do you remember

493
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
the first day you came home, I told you

494
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that this is the capital city.

495
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I hope you won't regret it.

496
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Now?

497
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I regret it.

498
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I regret it.

499
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I can't save him.

500
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm never a decent person.

501
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm willing to do anything for you.

502
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm willing to do anything for you.

503
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You know I won't.

504
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You're forcing me.

505
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Then I'm successful?

506
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm willing to do anything for you.

507
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll try my best.

508
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But you have to do the worst.

509
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Miss,

511
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
you haven't eaten anything for the whole day.

512
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm not hungry.

513
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You can leave.

514
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
He's dead.

516
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Go get him.

517
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Okay.

518
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Master,

519
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
the day after tomorrow is the day of the wedding.

520
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You know,

521
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
the days of the He family,

522
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
the family is always so cold and quiet.

523
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's not good, right?

524
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Fortunately, the ancestors are well-preserved.

525
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The disaster is finally over.

526
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The ancestors are well-preserved.

531
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
The disaster is finally over.

532
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Tomorrow,

533
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you can take Chier and Yushan back.

534
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Thank you, master.

535
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
In the future,

536
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
you must take good care of these two children.

537
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Aunt, aunt.

538
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Master, aunt.

539
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
There was a rumor outside just now.

540
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It was said that the sea ghost

541
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
was dead last night in the Dali Temple.

542
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Dead?

543
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Then he's clear about the plan.

544
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The case is over.

545
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Don't keep him in the dark again.

546
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Then I'm not sure about this.

547
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'll go out and find out.

548
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Master,

549
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
congratulations to Miss San.

550
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The case of Danzhou is over.

551
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You're clear about it.

552
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Over?

553
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Miss San, I don't know.

554
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The female sea ghost

555
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
has been told.

556
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
She was dead last night in the Dali Temple.

557
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Where did you get these paintings?

558
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's all over the place.

559
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
How could it be a painting?

560
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Father.

561
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You and that sea ghost are the same.

562
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You killed Zhang Yuchang and her husband

563
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
with your own hands.

564
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You're kidding me.

565
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's not true.

566
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But he's dead.

567
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I heard that the woman

568
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
was tortured by a whole night

569
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
in the prison in Dali Temple last night.

570
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
His hands, feet, and fists were broken.

571
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
His scalp was all torn off.

572
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
He was completely gone.

573
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Miss San,

574
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
how did you know that sea ghost?

575
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
He was willing to die for you.

576
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Li San.

577
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Zhang Yuchang, you...

578
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You're hurting me.

579
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Why did you know that?

580
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Why did you do that?

581
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Are you okay, mother?

582
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Where is the body?

583
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I sent it out of the capital in secret.

584
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
He's still alive?

585
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yes.

586
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm going to see him.

587
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Calm down.

588
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Don't mess with the town.

589
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But if you're not around,

590
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I won't come to pick you up.

591
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'll go.

592
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Chaizhang.

593
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Why did you do this to him?

594
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
If it weren't for the wound,

595
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
he wouldn't have been in a coma.

596
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Save him.

597
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yuel.

598
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yuel.

599
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yuel.

600
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yuel.

601
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yuel.

602
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yuel.

603
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yuel.

604
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Don't move.

605
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Just wait.

606
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm talking about

607
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
the lung.

608
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I can't take it anymore.

609
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I can't hold you back.

610
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm sorry.

611
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

612
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm sorry.

613
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I shouldn't have let you come to the capital with me.

614
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I was wrong.

615
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yuel.

616
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yuel.

617
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You and me.

618
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
All of us.

619
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
All of us.

620
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Take care.

621
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
In the future,

622
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'll protect you.

623
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But

624
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
the day we meet,

625
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'll ask you

626
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
what's your name?

627
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You say

628
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
you're a beggar.

629
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I almost got you in the blood.

630
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We were together

631
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
in the sea.

632
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We were just friends.

633
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We made a wish.

634
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Do you still remember?

635
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Of course.

636
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Now,

637
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
you have a family.

638
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Don't be stubborn anymore.

639
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Don't be selfish.

640
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Don't be stubborn.

641
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I've already

642
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
treated you as my family.

643
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I've been a beggar for 20 years.

644
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I've never

645
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
thought of you as my family.

646
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I only know

647
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
that you're

648
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
a beggar.

649
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I've never

650
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
thought of you as my family.

651
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I've never

652
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
regretted

653
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
my life.

654
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm not a beggar.

655
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
This is a high place.

656
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Go to the hospital.

657
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
This is a higher place.

658
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Right.

659
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay.

660
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Zhuang Hanyan.

661
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
His wound

662
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
needs to be healed.

663
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'll send someone to take care of him.

664
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But from now on,

665
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
he can't be in the capital anymore.

666
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Thank you, brother-in-law.

667
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Zi'er.

668
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'll remember.

669
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You finally believe me.

670
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You don't have to worry about me.

671
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Now, you've known

672
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
all my secrets.

673
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
But if you don't want to be with me,

674
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'll listen to my mother.

675
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I can't agree.

676
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
This is my bottom line.

677
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
If you beg me to help you,

678
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'll mention it again.

679
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'll dress up and dress up.

680
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'll regret it later.

681
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You're being honest.

682
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Go back.

683
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Wait.

684
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
What else?

685
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Feng Yunxi.

686
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Can I really

687
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
believe you?

688
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
No.

689
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
No?

690
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Just kidding,

691
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I don't know nothing of superstition.

692
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
But I don't know what to do about it.

693
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't have the strength to decorate

694
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
either.

695
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Put these on my going why.

696
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
How should I do with it?

697
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Okay.

698
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Go back.

699
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,600
However

700
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,600
a few years later

701
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,860
I have heard that these Huge Full

702
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,920
you are here

703
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,660
needed my help

704
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,660
I can keep myself safe.

705
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,220
That's why you helped me.

706
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,300
You've gone through this.

707
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,380
You won't leave the capital.

708
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,260
Since the day I came back home,

709
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,300
I've always wanted to kick me out of the house.

710
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,700
Even if I choose to live a life,

711
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,780
I'm willing to do it.

712
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,060
Now,

713
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,740
I understand a few things.

714
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,060
What do you understand?

715
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,820
There was a man who struggled Personally

716
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,620
in such a cities where people made trouble.

717
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,340
Someone was octopus호 dead

718
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,980
and someone had been unconscious suddenly.

719
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,060
If you were involved, you'd become denied Wine.

720
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,660
Yes, only some days

721
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,900
you still stand firm.

722
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,140
This isense for fear.

723
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Just like Mrs. and Mrs. grapes,

724
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,300
there is more to gain from conflict inside.

725
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,060
I lost my will to make a comeback.

726
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,060
I'm ten years old.

727
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,060
I'm getting older and older.

728
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,060
This is human nature.

729
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,060
I can't live without it.

730
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,060
You don't have to suffer this.

731
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,060
As a woman,

732
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
this is my destiny.

733
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,060
You think you're a big car.

734
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,060
Actually,

735
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
you only see the most shallow side.

736
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,060
You once

737
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,060
asked me to explain.

738
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,060
Do you think this world is full of light?

739
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,060
I dare not say it.

740
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,060
What do you want to say?

741
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,060
This time I lost my friend.

742
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,060
What do you want to lose next time?

743
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,060
What else can you lose?

744
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,060
Even if you're hurt,

745
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,060
you'll be hurt.

746
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,060
What's the point of being so timid?

747
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,060
When you're in the palace,

748
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,060
you'll suffer.

749
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,060
And you'll suffer the same.

750
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,060
This is the nature of the palace.

751
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,060
How long will it take?

752
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,060
You'll have a good life.

753
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,060
You'll understand soon.

754
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,060
Go back.

755
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,060
The day after tomorrow,

756
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,060
I'll change my mind.

757
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,060
The new year is coming.

758
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,060
Everything has a new beginning.

759
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,060
This is the first time

760
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,060
I've ever seen you like this.

761
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,060
If you understand,

762
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,060
I did

763
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,060
something wrong.

764
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
Maybe from now on,

765
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,060
I can really let go of the past hatred.

766
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,060
But I feel

767
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,060
it's also because of the darkness.

768
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,060
I feel it.

769
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,060
This new year,

770
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,060
is not as good as the one on the surface.

771
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,060
The new year

772
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,060
The new year

773
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,060
The new year

774
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,060
The new year

775
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,060
The new year

776
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,060
The new year

777
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,060
The new year

778
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,060
The new year

779
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,060
The new year

780
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,060
The new year

781
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,060
The new year

782
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,060
The new year

783
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,060
The new year

784
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,060
The new year

785
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,060
The new year

786
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,060
The new year

787
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,060
The new year

788
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,060
The new year

789
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,060
The new year

790
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,060
The new year

791
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,180
Our 그런

792
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,060
But it's not a busy day.

793
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,060
In my hands

794
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,060
I hurt

795
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,060
it audience

796
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,200
I shed

797
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,420
hidden

798
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,020
because of

799
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,080
that

800
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,060
