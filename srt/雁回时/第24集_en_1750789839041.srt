00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 1

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

9
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Today is the wedding day

10
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When the gate is opened

11
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All the stars will rise

12
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's your name?

15
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Your Highness

16
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My name is Pei Ying Yue

17
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Sit

18
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You should call me Zhu Lang

19
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes, Zhu Lang

20
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Young Mistress

21
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Zhuang Yushan

22
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He married Prince Qi

23
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Absolutely

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is the wedding invitation

25
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
from the House of Zhuang

26
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Such a hasty marriage

27
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How could he be so stupid

28
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to marry Prince Qi?

29
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It must be Zhuang Shiyang

30
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
who wants to kill himself

31
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and to keep the secret from Prince Qi

32
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why don't we go and have a look?

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm surprised

34
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What's the use of going?

35
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If I tell the whole family

36
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Zhuang Yushan will think

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm afraid he will marry into the Gao family

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Young Mistress

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry

41
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Do you know Zhuang Yushan

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is going to marry Prince Qi?

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I just know

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Zhuang Shiyang is going to marry

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
in ten days

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What has he done in the family recently?

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I have been following the order

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to investigate the case of the female groom

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have no time to investigate

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
whether Zhuang Shiyang is a maid

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and I can't decide who to marry

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Uncle Yuwen, have you made any progress?

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to know the details

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
When Yuwen Chang'an was suspended

57
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
the documents in the capital's investigation office

58
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
were all sealed in the library

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I have investigated

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
with Mu Feng and Mu Yan several times

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but I haven't found any progress

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What about the other government offices?

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have also investigated

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
but it never worked

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And now

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
someone has already started to doubt

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Have you finished asking?

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Have you finished asking?

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Zhuang Hanyan

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you have promised to let Ah Zhi change her mind

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I hope you can be a good mother

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What is a good mother?

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't ask you to love her or protect her

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I just ask you not to harm her

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Today, you are so kind

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and brought Yushan back with you

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm afraid you can't be kind enough

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Father-in-law, why are you still here?

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll eat it later

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please forgive me

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Father-in-law, why do you look so sad?

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Did you meet any trouble at home?

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have some family matters

85
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't want to trouble you

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Father

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Zhuang Hanyan did this to you again, right?

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't talk nonsense

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He used Fu Yunxi to take over

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and you have been in the house for days

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why are you still covering for him?

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yushan

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm just trying to help you

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yushan

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just know that Zhuang Hanyan is your daughter

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why did she do this?

97
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Since we got married, we are a family

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think I've said it all

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Zhuang Hanyan was sent to Danzhou

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
because of her childhood

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
She hates Zhuang family

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Since she came back to the family

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
she has been bothering us every day

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Even my brother Yuchi

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is related to Zhuang Hanyan

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yuchi is the only hope in our family

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You really have a deep grudge

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry for your family

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now Zhuang family is lucky to be in the mansion

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If I see you again

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will call you uncle

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please don't make things difficult for me

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't interfere in Miao Wei's matter

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Father

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why are you still talking for him?

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Zhuang Hanyan

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Enough

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You are so noisy

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now it's too late

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Master

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Where is Zhuang Hanyan?

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Young Mistress just ordered her to prepare a carriage

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to go to see the Imperial Concubine

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Master, please wait

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What?

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I have something

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I've been hesitating these days

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I want to give it to you now

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Where did you get this divorce letter?

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The night Young Mistress married you

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
she called me to the room

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and gave me this divorce letter

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
She said she would risk her life

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and may hurt many people

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But she remembered

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
she was accused of being in a difficult position

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
She used to be a guard to get rid of the danger

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
so she prepared this divorce letter in advance

139
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If she commits a crime that she can't get back

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
she won't be able to clean up the family

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Master

142
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You have been against Young Mistress recently

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can see it and feel it

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But Young Mistress is so stubborn

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that she won't explain her feelings to you

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and she even told me not to talk too much

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She is just angry with you

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You lied to her before

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and she must take revenge

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But she never thought about

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
hurting Old Mistress and Miss Zhi

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I only hope you and Young Mistress

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
can be together

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and achieve great things together

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Thank you, Shu Hong

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll go to her now

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Stop

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Stop

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Stop

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Stop

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Stop

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Stop

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What's the matter?

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You are going to the palace

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's late now

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and the time is full

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I want to discuss with Noble Consort Miao

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Today, Prince Qi is going to the family's gate

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:02,180
I have sent the

170
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Who taught you to sing this kind of song?

171
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,180
The jade-like jade

172
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,180
is like four branches

173
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Four branches are missing one

174
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
Three branches

175
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Remove the ten-strand shadow

176
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
The night is long

177
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180
and the moon is long

178
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
The moon is long

179
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
and the moon is long

180
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,180
The moon is long

181
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
and the moon is long

182
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
The moon is long

183
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
and the moon is long

184
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
and the moon is long

185
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,180
One of the branches is missing

186
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
One of the branches is missing

187
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,180
So you mean

188
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
the female emperor, Wu Zhao

189
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,180
was coming for Noble Consort Miao

190
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,180
and wanted to take over the throne

191
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
and present her with a bright future

192
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
not only by listening to the government

193
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
but also to the throne

194
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,180
Sir

195
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Yes

196
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
I just got the news

197
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
that the private witness

198
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
came to the palace last night

199
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
to see His Majesty

200
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,780
Yes.

201
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,980
Your Highness.

202
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,300
How is it?

203
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,020
Your Highness.

204
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,380
I saw the Minister of War

205
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,740
and His Majesty at night.

206
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I heard from the Minister of War...

207
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,020
Say it.

208
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,140
What did he say?

209
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
The Minister of War said

210
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,540
the current situation is still in the spring.

211
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,940
The dragon is in the wild, but the wolf is in the wild.

212
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,620
The night is full of evil spirits.

213
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,380
This is the state's bad omen.

214
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,780
If we don't stop the evil spirits,

215
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,860
I'm afraid...

216
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,580
How?

217
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,740
The light of the night is like a jade pot.

218
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,340
The shadow of the night is like a diadem.

219
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,420
The morning is back.

220
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,060
The fox...

221
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,580
We're daemons now.

222
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,740
The fox is doing witchcraft?

223
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,660
Who was it

224
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,380
that tortured the people in the fire?

225
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,700
Tell me.

226
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,020
Wait.

227
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
Just say it.

228
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
outside theilenry suffers the damage of the sword,

229
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,900
Shoukun...

230
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm here.

231
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,340
If the children of the Beggar Clan

232
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,060
and the Four Prefectures of the Qingtian Sword are in the palace,

233
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,140
then Prince Qi is not good at the diamond ring.

234
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,740
Such a vicious method

235
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,140
must be secretly pushed by Zhuang Shiyang.

236
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,260
Prince Qi and the Four Prefectures of the Qingtian Sword

237
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,140
have known each other since childhood

238
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,260
and have been friends for a long time.

239
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,700
According to your speculation,

240
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,140
the four prefectures of the Qingtian Sword

241
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
are not related to each other.

242
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,620
But the four prefectures of the Qingtian Sword

243
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,900
are not related to each other.

244
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,260
According to your speculation,

245
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,540
will His Majesty do it?

246
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,180
Just like how you were attacked by the Chijiao Ghosts and the Wuming Battalion,

247
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,060
the female dead in the harem is even more dangerous.

248
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,500
Once the Qingtian Sword is in the palace,

249
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,420
I'm afraid it will be more dangerous.

250
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,620
Moreover,

251
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,460
it involves our country's long-standing strategy.

252
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,020
I'm afraid that the rain and the rain are coming from the palace.

253
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,100
With such a situation,

254
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,940
are you really going to the palace?

255
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,020
I'm going, too.

256
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,500
I'll accompany you.

257
00:15:48,620 --> 00:16:01,020
The

258
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,020
I can't save her life.

259
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
It's too hard to reach the Heaven Hall.

260
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
It's Noble Consort Miao's birthday.

261
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Second Master,

262
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,020
did you get the call from Noble Consort?

263
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,920
The

264
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,020
The

265
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Miao family is a noble family.

266
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,020
They are young and gentle,

267
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
and their elders are virtuous.

268
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,020
So they chose Hua Ying to be the harem.

269
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,020
There are no martial arts in the walls.

270
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,020
They are not comfortable in the palace.

271
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
They don't follow the etiquette

272
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,020
and they don't follow the etiquette.

273
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,020
They're not engaged in the imperial court.

274
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,020
They're not engaged in the imperial court.

275
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:17,020
They're not engaged in the imperial court.

276
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,020
They're not engaged in the imperial court.

277
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:27,020
I'm thankful to them for the great gift of the white mausoleum.

278
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,980
Please allow the exchange of assets.

279
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,580
She is a dead woman.

280
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,800
Under the roof of heaven lay the guide girl of Passians.

281
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,240
Yet the 73-year-old woman's milk-we answering edges

282
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Even if it's a man,

283
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,240
it's a blow to the head,

284
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,240
and a defeat.

285
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,640
Behind this world of wealth and glory,

286
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,760
there are too many disasters and murders.

287
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,680
Perhaps,

288
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,560
from the day I stepped into the palace,

289
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
I was destined

290
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,920
to die under the name of this noble lady.

291
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,680
I only hate myself for seeing this.

292
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,120
It's too late.

293
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
You're going to stop me again?

294
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,200
This is the divorce letter you wrote.

295
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Since you've married into my family,

296
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,560
you're my wife and my family.

297
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,800
I won't do it again.

298
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,320
This isn't my home.

299
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,200
I've already done what I can.

300
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
This is your choice.

301
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,800
Whether it's the old lady,

302
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,560
or the young lady,

303
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,800
I'm not going to let you go.

304
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm going to make you pay for it.

305
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm going to make you pay for it.

306
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
Whether it's the old lady,

307
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,000
or the young lady,

308
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,800
the Fu family is either dead or alive.

309
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,800
They have nothing to do with me.

310
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Get out of my way!

311
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
Who do you want to kill?

312
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,560
Zhuang Shiyang,

313
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,320
Prince Qi,

314
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
or His Majesty?

315
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,880
Let go.

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,920
Let go!

317
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,520
Don't push me.

318
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,120
Do you know

319
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,720
why you lost?

320
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,080
I was wrong.

321
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,960
There's a higher power above power.

322
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,600
I shouldn't have gone to see Noble Consort Miao.

323
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,040
I shouldn't have listened to your nonsense.

324
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,600
I should have killed Zhuang Shiyang from the start.

325
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,360
Even if you withdraw the troops today,

326
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,840
you broke into the manor like this,

327
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,120
can you come out alive?

328
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
I never thought I would come out alive.

329
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,600
The day my mother died,

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,920
this world is the hell for me.

331
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,000
Let go of me.

332
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm going to pay for it this time.

333
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,480
You should be grateful at this moment.

334
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,720
There's no time to die in the imperial decree.

335
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,320
Otherwise,

336
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,320
you have already made a mistake.

337
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,640
Who's hiding there?

338
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,600
Come out!

339
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,520
Who's there?

340
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,960
Come out!

341
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,480
Mother.

342
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,840
Mother, don't let me.

343
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,400
I only played hide-and-seek with you.

344
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,840
I was wrong.

345
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,320
Ah Zhen.

346
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,280
It's okay.

347
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,320
Don't cry.

348
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,440
I'm here.

349
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
I'm here.

350
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,560
I was just kidding.

351
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,200
Ah Zhen.

352
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,000
Mother.

353
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,880
Mother, don't go.

354
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,760
Mother, don't go.

355
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,840
Ah Zhi, please.

356
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,520
Mother, don't go.

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,840
Ah Zhi.

358
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
I've never raised you.

359
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,480
I'm not your mother.

360
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,720
I don't deserve you to call me mother.

361
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,160
All of this is fake.

362
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
It's not fake.

363
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,000
Mother promised me.

364
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,040
You don't understand.

365
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,560
Today,

366
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,120
I want to avenge my mother.

367
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,240
I don't want you to die.

368
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,720
I'll avenge you when I grow up.

369
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,440
Okay?

370
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,920
I just want to be like other children.

371
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,640
I want to have a complete home with you.

372
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,000
I just want to be like other children.

373
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,320
I just want to have a home with you.

374
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,920
I just want to have a home with you.

375
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,200
I'll let you know

376
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
that I'm not only your daughter,

377
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,200
but also your doctor.

378
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,000
I've been suffering for years

379
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,080
in this endless place.

380
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,280
I've been suffering for years in this endless place.

381
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,960
Why do you come back to revenge?

382
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,920
Why?

383
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,640
Mother.

384
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,040
Mother.

385
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,800
I don't want you to let go of your hatred.

386
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,120
But if you live for hatred,

387
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
live for the bad guys,

388
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,480
you'll be a fool.

389
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,280
Give me a chance

390
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
to help you find the one or two

391
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,240
who's worth missing in this world.

392
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,680
Okay?

393
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,200
I'll wait for you

394
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
to come back.

395
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,280
That's all.

396
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
My regret in this life

397
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
is that I couldn't grow up with my daughter.

398
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,680
I seem to be in a dream.

399
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,960
I've forgotten today

400
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,840
because it's the first day

401
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
I met the first person.

402
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,760
I'm a fool.

403
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I'm a fool.

404
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
I'm a fool.

405
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm a fool.

406
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm a fool.

407
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm a fool.

408
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm a fool.

409
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
I'm a fool.

410
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm a fool.

411
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,480
Actually, since that day,

412
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,000
I've found my mother.

413
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,560
I don't want to lose my mother again.

414
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,280
Although my mother

415
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,400
never raised me,

416
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
we still have a lot of future.

417
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,560
Mother can be raised by me.

418
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,960
And we've made a deal.

419
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,320
We both

420
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,920
have no mother.

421
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,480
When we miss our mother,

422
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,160
I can hug you.

423
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,560
You can hug me too.

424
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,560
If you miss your grandmother,

425
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,160
you can hug me.

426
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Okay?

427
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,360
I've finally found you.

428
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,560
This is the gift I want to give you.

429
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,160
Last year, on my birthday,

430
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I accidentally found my grandmother's house.

431
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,960
She gave this to me.

432
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,160
It has my mother's name on it.

433
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I'm sorry.

434
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm sorry.

435
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm sorry.

436
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm sorry.

441
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
I'm sorry.

446
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm sorry.

451
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
I'm sorry.

452
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm sorry.

456
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,760
You are by my side.

460
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
I'm sorry.

461
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,960
Young Mistress.

462
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
I've fallen asleep.

463
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Yes.

464
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I want to apologize to you.

465
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,560
What's up?

466
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Not long ago, the time at the southern clinic,

467
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,560
I did see you.

468
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,360
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

469
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
But my lord didn't see you.

470
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,360
What she said was all nonsense.

471
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,800
It's all my fault.

472
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
I was the one who made a mistake.

473
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,280
She really didn't know?

474
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,400
Didn't she explain to you?

475
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,280
She was punished

476
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,200
because of you.

477
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,680
Zhuang Shiyang told me

478
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Fu Yunxi was under her control.

479
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,400
You also believe Zhuang Shiyang?

480
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,160
I saw it clearly that day.

481
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,680
After you fainted,

482
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
the minister took you to the room.

483
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,840
He sat by the bedside for a long time.

484
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
So he decided to

485
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,640
overturn his previous plan for you.

486
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,280
Until that night,

487
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,040
Zhuang Shiyang took this matter to threaten him.

488
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,200
He told me that

489
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,120
but I didn't believe it.

490
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
I swear to God.

491
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,040
Although the man is a little

492
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,440
cruel and ruthless,

493
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,280
he is not evil to his purpose.

494
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,760
But he is definitely sincere to you.

495
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,240
If there is a lie,

496
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,040
I will never marry a wife

497
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,440
and will never get married.

498
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,560
As for other subscribe Therefore Closed

499
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,200
Well, what kind of service

500
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,920
Do you want to pay for Yiming?

501
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,880
In fact, I have known

502
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,560
what I used before

503
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,840
is his sincere love.

504
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,360
How are you feeling now?

505
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,800
Does it hurt?

506
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Try it on.

507
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm leaving now.

508
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,000
Please drink.

509
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
I swear

510
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,560
I won't let go ofawn.

511
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,880
I will never let him go.

512
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
He deserves to be killed.

513
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,600
But no matter how he dies,

514
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't want you to break into the mansion

515
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,240
and commit an assassination

516
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,600
in the dark.

517
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,520
Why?

518
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,760
Don't forget.

519
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,640
Our marriage is a deal.

520
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,200
I have the conditions to help you.

521
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,160
You promised me

522
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,200
to take care of the Fu family.

523
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,120
I don't understand.

524
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Why are you so obsessed with it?

525
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,760
You have the ability to protect yourself.

526
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,040
You just need to remember

527
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,200
that since it's a deal,

528
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,840
we should all be lucky.

529
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,200
Okay.

530
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,320
I promise you.

531
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,760
You lied to me.

532
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,040
I lied to you, too.

533
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,440
But this time, I promise you

534
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,000
I mean it.

535
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
You always say

536
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,440
you want a family.

537
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,520
What do you think is a family?

538
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,400
At least,

539
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,280
a family with blood ties

540
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,040
can be considered a family.

541
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
Just like you and Madam

542
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,200
and Uncle Kou.

543
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
You don't know

544
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
I have no blood ties with the Fu family.

545
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,880
I'm just the adopted son of the Fu family.

546
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,400
My parents died in the war.

547
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,960
I'm just an orphan.

548
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,840
But as long as there's love and love,

549
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,760
this is my home.

550
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,480
It's okay.

551
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,040
It's your home.

552
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,320
Yunxi.

553
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,720
Han Yan.

554
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,360
Mother.

555
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,760
Yunxi.

556
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,440
Mother.

557
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,080
Have you heard that

558
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,560
Noble Consort Miao in the palace was assassinated?

559
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,200
Our family has been close to her recently.

560
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,120
Will she confess to it?

561
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,520
I don't know.

562
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,280
I don't know.

563
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,040
I don't know.

564
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,680
I don't know.

565
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,400
I don't know.

566
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,080
I don't know.

567
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,880
I don't know.

568
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,120
Will she make any trouble?

569
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,320
Mother, don't worry.

570
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,960
Noble Consort Miao and I have been friends.

571
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
But we're not involved yet.

572
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,320
And His Majesty has ordered

573
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,720
to stop investigating this matter

574
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,880
and end it here.

575
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,360
That's good.

576
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,480
That's good.

577
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,120
I'm worried about you.

578
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,720
Yunxi.

579
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Han Yan.

580
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,280
It's a fate that

581
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,440
our family can be together.

582
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm afraid.

583
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm afraid that if something happens to you,

584
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,440
I...

585
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,360
Don't worry.

586
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,960
We'll be fine.

587
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,920
But

588
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,760
you and Second Aunt

589
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,920
should stay at home.

590
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,520
Don't go out.

591
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,600
I understand.

592
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,720
Everyone was after us before.

593
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,720
Now, I'm afraid everyone hates us.

594
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,240
You're afraid that we'll go out.

595
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,280
Everyone will be shocked.

596
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,840
I know.

597
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,000
It's getting late.

598
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,440
I'll take you back to rest.

599
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,560
Okay.

600
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,920
Mother.

601
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,520
Let's go.

602
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,400
You're still hurt.

603
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
Go back to rest.

604
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,480
It's okay.

605
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,920
In the capital, there were two types of people.

606
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,200
One married into the family of Guanhuan Qingliu.

607
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,720
The other married into Wei E's family.

608
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,320
In the end, they all fell into the same trap.

609
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm afraid that in this history,

610
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
there will be another woman

611
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,960
who has been in trouble for thousands of years.

612
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
This life

613
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,800
is so light

614
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,560
that it's gone.

615
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,320
The so-called noble woman

616
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,120
is really ridiculous.

617
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,640
Just now, Mu Feng told me

618
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,200
that the wooden box in Yuwen Chang'an

619
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,880
has been discovered by Mu Yan.

620
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,320
What progress?

621
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,320
The sudden death of Noble Consort Miao was too sudden.

622
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,400
I haven't met Mu Yan yet.

623
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,360
I'll go back to Dali Temple tomorrow.

624
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,040
Wait for me at home.

625
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,880
I hope Uncle Yuwen

626
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,960
won't let us down.

627
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,560
Congratulations, Your Highness.

628
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,720
In our Hanlin Court,

629
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,920
we've finally made a good start

630
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,320
over the years.

631
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,440
Yes.

632
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,920
Lord Zhuang has been

633
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,640
so famous for many years.

634
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,160
Now, he has made such a big achievement.

635
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,440
His

636
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,860
skill is Buddha's Jiu

637
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,280
the Lotus Flower

638
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,880
that has gathered thousand of Sque Az-Z Aus.

639
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,720
He has just been promoted

640
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,960
to a he either in a small country

641
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,520
or a small prefecture

642
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,760
under the Dist summation of the sewing mill.

643
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
Now, he has loved

644
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:34,780
the Northeast rested

645
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,980
I'm sure that the ancestors will have it.

646
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,340
I dare not compare with the masters

647
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,660
who are good at martial arts.

648
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,620
Mr. Zhuang, you're too modest.

649
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
You're too modest.

650
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,100
You're too modest.

651
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,900
Although he defeated Noble Consort Miao,

652
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,020
Fu Yunxi and Zhuang Hanyan

653
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,500
escaped from the trap.

654
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,100
That's too kind.

655
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,260
Your Highness,

656
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,180
I have an idea.

657
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,560
A proper family should location themselves well-off.

658
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,180
I'll let you decide.

659
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,100
to talk to me.

660
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,340
I never

661
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,540
ignore the big issues.

662
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,060
Your Highness, you are right.

663
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,260
I will remember it.

664
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,220
My grandmother's 60th birthday is coming.

665
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Can you come back

666
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,100
with me to celebrate it?

667
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,740
I have no time.

668
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,260
You can go back by yourself.

669
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,020
It will only take two hours.

670
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,260
I will wait for you.

671
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,820
Mu Feng said there is progress here.

672
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,900
Yes.

673
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,420
And we are in the Imperial Censorate.

674
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,780
Imperial Censorate?

675
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,420
We have been there twice before.

676
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,860
We didn't find anything.

677
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,900
The last time we went there,

678
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,340
we only spent time in the Imperial Library

679
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,820
and the library.

680
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,020
We forgot to find out

681
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,660
the relationship with Lord Wen.

682
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,260
Where is the clue?

683
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,140
In the autopsy room.

684
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,340
We are old people

685
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,740
who are full of bad luck.

686
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,380
We are not treated well.

687
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,380
In the Imperial Censorate,

688
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,980
only Lord Wen is good to me.

689
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,820
We are in the same boat.

690
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,060
We have never been married before.

691
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,180
We have become more close.

692
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,260
Five or six years ago,

693
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,940
he handed me the wooden box.

694
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,140
He said I was quiet here.

695
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,940
There were many dead people and few living people.

696
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,100
It was safer.

697
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,900
Sometimes,

698
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,460
he would take it away for a few days.

699
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,940
He returned it back in a few days.

700
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,540
He never told me

701
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,100
what it was.

702
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,700
But every time I touched it,

703
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,820
I felt a little bit calm.

704
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,620
When Lord Yuwen left the capital,

705
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,380
why didn't you take him away?

706
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,020
He left in a hurry.

707
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,140
He only sent people to send me letters.

708
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,540
He even said that

709
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,020
it was a box of heart-wrenching tears

710
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,740
that were inconvenient to bring to the Jile Emperor.

711
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,220
He only asked me to keep it.

712
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,300
Lord Fu, you...

713
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,780
This is Brother Yuwen's manuscript?

714
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,660
According to Lord Yuwen's collection,

715
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,100
he was still in the Jile Emperor's mansion

716
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,340
three years ago.

717
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,020
He was still in the Jile Emperor's mansion.

718
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,220
He was still in the Jile Emperor's mansion.

719
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,380
He even gave you

720
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,140
something very important.

721
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,460
Lord Fu,

722
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,340
did Brother Yuwen really send you to take it away?

723
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,140
Lord Yuwen is dead.

724
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,380
Maybe these things

725
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,220
can help him to get back on his feet.

726
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,220
But...

727
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,060
Brother Yuwen, he...

728
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,700
Madam.

729
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,980
He found it.

730
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
His Lordship's location is clear.

731
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,780
He only asked you to go to the Imperial Censorate in person.

732
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,260
Okay, we'll go right now.

733
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,460
It must be armed with poison.

734
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,940
All right,iong?

735
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,540
Write it down.

736
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,100
Be careful, it was poisoned.

737
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,620
Who was…

738
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,580
who was it?

739
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,180
Your grandfather,

740
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,220
Zhuang Haliang.

741
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,220
You're here.

742
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,220
I'm here.

743
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,220
I'm here.

744
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,220
I'm here.

745
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
I'm here.

746
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,220
I'm here.

747
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,220
I'm here.

748
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,220
I'm here.

749
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
I'm here.

750
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,220
I'm here.

751
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
I'm here.

752
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,220
I'm here.

753
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,220
I'm here.

754
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
I'm here.

755
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,220
I'm here.

756
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
I'm here.

757
