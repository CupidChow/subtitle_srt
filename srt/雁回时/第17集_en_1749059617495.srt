1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
then

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are you looking at me?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm so sorry.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm ok.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Pei Qing.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to say something,

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I want to say something,

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
why are you looking at me?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You should drink by yourself.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,800
I'm the speaker for this games

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,400
I think you are busy with the construction work these days.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,800
You must be busy with the three-layered.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Look, you are all thin.

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
I am worried about you.

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,400
If you don't want us to worry,

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
you should find someone who is cold and hot

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
and wait for him by your side.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know that you have been working in the construction work

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
and have no feelings for each other.

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,200
But it is a good thing that you can be married and have a family.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
You should be righteous.

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Besides, the marriage between us and Zhuang family has already been settled.

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
If you don't want to get married,

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm afraid that people will think that we are pushing each other.

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,000
We are not good enough.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Although Zhuang family has a lot of love,

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
they have been by my side since childhood.

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,000
That character is really gentle and gentle.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
You two are both very good-looking.

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
You are not the only good-looking one.

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
You are right, Second Aunt.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
Yunxi.

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,600
I'm not saying that you should really understand your parents.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Back then, they raised you in the name of

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,600
being kind and caring.

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,200
It's also because of the little things that we have,

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
that we want to live a good life for our family.

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, they are old and old.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
You said that you didn't expect them.

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
Who else would expect them?

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm ashamed. I didn't think about it.

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Don't listen to your second aunt.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,000
Back then, we had this kind of love.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
But we only had two.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
The rest of the eight cities hope that you can live a peaceful life,

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
be happy and have someone to accompany you.

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
And have a daughter to take care of you.

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,800
Otherwise, after all these years,

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,600
I would have left you alone in this world.

80
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,200
How could I be so clear-headed?

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm afraid that I'll forget Zhuang family.

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
Don't worry.

83
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
Yuqing will be here soon.

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,800
I'll wait for you to give up.

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,500
Water.

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Who's that?

87
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,400
Yuqing!

88
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,900
After the ongoing war...

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,460
I simply told you money!

90
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,160
I told you youONEGWE!

91
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,920
Do...踢...

92
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,880
What's his name?

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
The one who killed Yu Qin

94
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
was actually me.

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
That poisonous wine

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
was prepared by the thief.

97
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Yu Xin.

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Yu Qin is pure and pure.

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
He's a noble man.

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
And I, the one who made the decision

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
to kill Yu Yin

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
was the one who killed Yu Yin.

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Every day,

104
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
he's a devil.

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
He's a man of the past.

106
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I should have known that today.

107
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
I was a man of the past.

108
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I was a man of the past.

109
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
But I came here

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
to live a life

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
that's not even a family.

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I can't live without it.

113
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
How can I live without it?

114
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
You're my wife.

115
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm your model.

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Within a year,

117
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I wish you to be the first daughter of the capital.

118
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Are you willing to do that?

119
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Why?

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
It's me.

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
The first day you sold your city to the capital,

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
we met for the first time.

123
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I can smell something special

124
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
on you.

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
It's not a secret.

126
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
It's a secret.

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
No matter how weak and pure you are,

128
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
no matter how many people you've cheated,

129
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
you can't fool me.

130
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
It's just a word.

131
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I can tell.

132
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Maybe you're the one I'm looking for.

133
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
The Chen Nian Engyuan family is a mess.

134
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
The family relationship in the backyard is even more subtle.

135
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
You can pretend to be a man,

136
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
but you can be as good as a man.

137
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
I ordered you to hide the note.

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
It's not like you're a man.

139
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
You're so sensitive.

140
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
You know what you're doing.

141
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
You're a smart man.

142
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I've tried to get you

143
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
to find out the truth

144
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
about the case

145
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
from your mouth.

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
But you never told me.

147
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
It's hard to tell.

148
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I was so drunk that

149
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I checked it out.

150
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
You're a man who's very passionate

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
and affectionate.

152
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
When the Zhuang family was in trouble,

153
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
you didn't go to Liyuan,

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Huanglan,

155
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
and had a family.

156
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
You didn't get the target.

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
You wanted to kill me.

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
You've been acting

159
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
and pretending to be a man.

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
You're really a man.

161
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm asking for the right time.

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm not asking for the right time.

163
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm asking for my life.

164
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm asking for your success.

165
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm really sorry.

166
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
I'm not doing this

167
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,200
for my right time.

168
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm just trying to get a partner.

169
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Thank you, Mayor.

170
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
But you're the head of Fusha.

171
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Why are you acting so rashly?

172
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm asking for your partner

173
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
as a weak woman.

174
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
During these years,

175
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I've offended many people

176
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
because of the Dali Temple.

177
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,000
It's even more difficult to count the people who want to marry me.

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,640
The days when this dangerous murder case was written down by the murderers,

179
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
I can't sleep all night.

180
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,120
I wonder if I can see Zhao Yang tomorrow.

181
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,720
But...

182
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
As the widow's mother,

183
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
I can't do anything for them.

184
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,640
I can't do anything for them.

185
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,760
You want to sacrifice a girl's life

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,360
to protect your family?

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,560
I'm not asking for this.

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a deal.

189
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,480
I've been planning this for a long time.

190
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,480
But you made me decide

191
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,960
to give you a chance to do it.

192
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm warning you.

193
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
If you have a family,

194
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,680
you can marry or have a son.

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,280
But you can't make a promise.

196
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,880
From now on,

197
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
I won't make you suffer.

198
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,160
We'll never be together.

199
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,240
But if you want to marry me,

200
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
you can be my husband.

201
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,520
I won't ask for your innocence.

202
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,400
But I can do your job

203
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,840
to use my power and ability

204
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
to get what you want

205
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,840
and make you proud.

206
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,960
Mr. Zhao,

207
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,520
this is a deal.

208
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,440
We need it.

209
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
But I won't make a promise

210
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
to you.

211
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
If you don't say it,

212
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I'll say no.

213
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,680
So you did all this

214
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,600
to make it clear.

215
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,160
Right.

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,080
That's how you and your father

217
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,360
did it.

218
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
It's late.

219
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,640
I'll go back now.

220
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,920
My daughter is still very Gallery gallery.

221
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,520
But she needs me

222
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,000
dom a lot,

223
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,200
pleasure and pride.

224
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
Nothing on today's table

225
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,440
is as good as any diary.

226
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,000
I know I'm older.

227
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,080
More than anything

228
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,800
It's so colorful now

229
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,660
Buy a plate of the dessert

230
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:28,020
Girl Gl здесь.

231
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,640
Girl Gl到底 ли silith25izedz à ça.

232
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:41,000
Girl GlMel.,

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Miss.

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Miss.

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What are you thinking?

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Nothing.

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Miss.

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Mr. Tan, let me give you a ride.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Miss.

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I saw that Mrs. Zhuang was full of injuries.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
She almost got down on her knees.

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think she must have been busy with her training.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Please take care of her.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She will be too embarrassed to do it.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Thank you for your reminder.

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I should have opened some salt lakes

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to help with the blood circulation.

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's painful.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But this medicine is in the gold.

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Please ask the doctors

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
if there is any remaining.

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, I know.

253
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you can't find it,

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
go and find Mr. Fu.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He was taken away

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
by her when he was in the hospital.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mrs. Yunxi?

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What did she say?

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's just a matter of balance.

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mr. Fu killed his wife

261
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
by accident.

262
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He was not only sent to the hospital,

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
but also taken to the hospital by the Yongdingmen.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If he hadn't been taken to the hospital

265
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
when he was dead,

266
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I wouldn't have had time to care about that.

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When did this happen?

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Probably...

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
on the day of the funeral.

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Are you...

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
hurt?

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm fine.

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What's wrong?

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you know where she is?

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Nanshan Medical Hall.

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This wound is deep.

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If you don't take care of it,

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
you might have a heart attack.

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Dr. Wu,

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
please advise Mr. Wen.

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He was taken away by the Yongdingmen.

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He didn't take it seriously.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mr. Fu,

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
if you love him more,

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
My parents have a daughter.

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But for them,

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
you should take care of your health.

289
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you, Dr. Wu.

290
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You're welcome.

291
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll get the medicine.

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Please, Dr. Fu.

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay.

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Sir,

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
there's a dressing room here.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Don't take it.

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Come.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Sit here.

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Come.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why is it so serious?

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Come.

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
In your eyes,

303
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the world is very important.

304
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Only A-Zhi and auntie.

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But now,

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
for the sake of the family,

307
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
we have to take care of the family.

308
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Now,

309
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
for the sake of the family,

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you have to take care of yourself.

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm a true lover.

312
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can only understand his feelings.

313
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Then tell him.

314
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He's from the family.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You should help him.

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't talk nonsense.

317
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He did it.

318
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm late.

319
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's the difference?

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Anyway,

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
you never thought about hurting him.

322
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You even thought about the consequences.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
By the way,

324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you also know that

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the missing person you know

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
is found.

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Besides being taken away,

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
you still have to suffer so much.

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But you're still hiding in the bamboo forest.

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're looking at Miss San

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and taking her away to the capital.

332
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
taking all the blame.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Sir,

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
you're a true lover.

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're talking nonsense.

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Be careful that I cut your tongue.

338
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What are you talking about?

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You've done so much,

340
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
but you're still not talking.

341
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't want Miss San to know.

342
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You even said

343
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you're going to propose to the Bao family.

344
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Of course, she's going to refuse you.

345
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Maybe she thinks you're

346
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
a devil.

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I didn't know that before.

348
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I did hurt her.

349
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
She hates me

350
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and I'm all for her.

351
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If I tell her this,

352
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
she'll be so happy

353
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that she'll tell me back.

354
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't want to do this.

355
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
She should

356
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
follow her heart

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
even if she's not married.

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Besides,

359
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I did have a plan

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
to propose to her.

361
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't believe you.

362
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're so born and raised,

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you're so blind.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Is it really because of the plan

365
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that you're not

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
at all true?

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think you've recognized me.

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You've married a wife.

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What's the problem?

370
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Get out of here.

371
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Enough.

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm getting a heavy one.

373
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But first,

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll go back to the Li Si.

375
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
LING

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,940
Heroes' Nut

377
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,000
Episode 2

378
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can stand up.

379
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can leave.

380
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can do it.

381
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can do it.

382
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can do it.

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can do it.

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I can do it.

385
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can do it.

386
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mother.

387
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Mother.

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Why couldn't she go up?

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why did she die?

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Why couldn't she go up?

391
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Mother.

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why did she die?

393
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Mother.

394
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Mother.

395
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Mother.

396
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Mother.

397
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't be angry.

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You lost your bet.

399
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You can still stand up.

400
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You can do it.

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You can do it.

402
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You have to give yourself more time.

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Han Yan.

404
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I can't do it.

405
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What if...

406
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What if...

407
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Nothing will happen.

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Lord Tan said that

409
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the illness is a disease.

410
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Have you ever thought that

411
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
your legs are heavy and hard to wake up?

412
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Other than the pain of the illness,

413
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
is it because

414
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
they are so angry and hateful?

415
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The stronger you are,

416
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
the more effort you put in,

417
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
the more it is hard to wake up.

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
My heart

419
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
is covered with tears.

420
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Mother.

421
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I will go back with you.

422
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Blood is like tears.

423
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
My heart is so lonely.

424
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Why did I have to go back with you?

425
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I am so lonely.

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Actually,

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
you are my heart.

428
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's blood again.

429
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You have also fallen asleep.

430
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You have forgotten.

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I couldn't stay with you at that time.

432
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Now you have to go back with me.

433
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We missed too many mothers.

434
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But in the future,

435
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
we still have a lot of time and opportunities.

436
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's make up for the past slowly.

437
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The world is a little bit different.

438
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The world is too different.

439
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I wish you would never be in this world.

440
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I wish you would always be like me.

441
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I wish you would never be in this world.

442
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You have left me with regret.

443
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The world is too different.

444
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I wish I could be with you.

445
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I think I saw you in my dream.

446
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You are my heart.

447
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,460
NC

448
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You listened to the wind drive.

449
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You caught my heart.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Moved if you know.

451
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I loved you before I knew everything.

452
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But the tears below

453
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
oed the heat

454
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm sorry for the pain

455
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm sorry for the pain

456
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm sorry for the pain

457
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm sorry for the pain

458
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm sorry for the pain

459
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm sorry for the pain

460
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm sorry for the pain

461
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm sorry for the pain

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm sorry for the pain

463
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm sorry for the pain

464
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm sorry for the pain

465
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm sorry for the pain

466
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm sorry for the pain

467
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm sorry for the pain

468
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm sorry for the pain

469
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,900
I'm sorry for the pain

470
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,000
It's the past

471
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,000
Listen to me

472
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,620
Zhongmo

473
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,720
Zhongmo

474
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,480
You can do that

475
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Congratulations, Mistress.

476
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,480
You've been a slave for 17 years.

477
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,480
You're going to be a slave.

478
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Chen Meng,

479
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,480
you've been suffering these years.

480
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,480
If I can really be a slave,

481
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,480
I'll have to drink some water for you.

482
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
I'm sorry, Mistress.

483
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
I've been a slave for the rest of your life.

484
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I think I've seen you in my dreams.

485
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
I'm in the dream.

486
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Now you're by my side.

487
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,480
I see the moon.

488
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,480
I've never seen you so happy.

489
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I know you're a great artist,

490
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
but I'm also a slave to you.

491
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480
I really miss you today.

492
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480
What do you plan to do next?

493
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Han Yan,

494
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,480
if I can let go of that heavy burden,

495
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
I'll be a slave to you.

496
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I'll be a slave to you.

497
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,480
I'll be a slave to you.

498
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Can you do that?

499
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Noble Consort Miao said I was blessed with a new life.

500
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Lord Pan ordered me to thank you for your help.

501
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,480
Mr. Yuwen asked me to leave the capital.

502
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:50,480
You said I could live without a life.

503
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,480
And that young man's feelings.

504
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Twenty years ago,

505
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I missed him because of Zhuang Shiyang.

506
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,480
If I missed him again today,

507
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,480
that would be the reason why he ruined my life.

508
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Maybe those former servants

509
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,480
shouldn't have been chasing after him.

510
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,480
I'm sure I'll leave.

511
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Twenty years ago,

512
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,480
I was a big family member from Zhuang's gate.

513
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Now that I'm leaving,

514
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,480
I don't want to leave my parents and run away.

515
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I also want to leave my family.

516
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I want to be with him.

517
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
I'm afraid that my father

518
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,480
won't let me down easily.

519
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
If I can't get the divorce,

520
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
even if I leave Zhuang's manor,

521
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,480
I'll still be Zhuang Shiyang's wife.

522
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
I hate this disgusting name.

523
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I want to be with him

524
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,480
and leave him alone.

525
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Mother,

526
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I'll handle this matter.

527
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
I'll talk to him.

528
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
You don't have to leave.

529
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
I'll let you live.

530
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
You can only rest and rest now.

531
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,480
You'll be fine.

532
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,480
What's your idea?

533
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
The enemy is attacking the sea.

534
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Did you forget what your father is most afraid of?

535
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,480
It's just a matter of time.

536
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
You don't have to worry.

537
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,480
I won't be rash.

538
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
After the deal with Fu Yunxi,

539
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,480
I'll take the plan.

540
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,480
I've been asking you the same thing.

541
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Since Fu Yunxi has made up his mind,

542
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,480
what's your plan?

543
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,480
If I say,

544
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
I want to stay.

545
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,480
You have a family.

546
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
To me,

547
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,480
he's at least a good friend.

548
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Haiyan,

549
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,480
what's the most precious relationship between people?

550
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Love.

551
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Love?

552
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
No.

553
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
It's trust.

554
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Life is hard.

555
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
It's hard to live.

556
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Before marriage, your life is a friend.

557
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
After marriage,

558
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,480
your life is a husband.

559
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Fu Yunxi,

560
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,480
is that person enough for you to trust?

561
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I'd like to trust him.

562
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Haiyan,

563
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,480
I encouraged you to pursue love.

564
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,480
But today, I want to remind you.

565
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
In the eyes of the dead,

566
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,480
the mother of the dead is the greatest reward for our daughter.

567
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
But you have to love yourself.

568
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Choose to be yourself.

569
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Be a good wife and a good mother.

570
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I've tried my best to keep my legs up.

571
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Just to pursue my own life.

572
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
No matter who you are in the future,

573
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
I hope you won't live for others.

574
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
Live for others.

575
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,480
I'll only teach you a lesson.

576
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Why did Third Miss change her mind in two days?

577
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Fu Yunxi,

578
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
can I trust you?

579
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
I just want to tell you

580
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
that I've been mean to you.

581
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,480
But you still have a secret.

582
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Everyone has a secret.

583
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Even if it's a long journey,

584
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,480
it's a little bit of a burden.

585
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
If I promise you,

586
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
can you promise me two conditions?

587
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Please say it.

588
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
The first condition.

589
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
From now on,

590
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,480
I don't want you to take the initiative to take the lead.

591
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
If I have a doubt in my mind,

592
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
you can't lie to me

593
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
no matter what.

594
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
You have to do it.

595
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Can you do it?

596
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
I promise you.

597
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
The second condition.

598
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
I want a divorce.

599
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,480
My mother has decided to let go of the old grudge.

600
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,480
She has left the capital.

601
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
But before that,

602
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
I must let Zhuang Shiyang sign the divorce.

603
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
What do you want me to do?

604
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
You've been saying this for a long time.

605
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Zhuang Shiyang is a member of the party.

606
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,480
I must get the evidence as soon as possible.

607
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
Your father is a clever man.

608
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
He has a good heart.

609
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
If I can get the evidence so easily,

610
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I'll have to take the blame.

611
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
I know it's hard.

612
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,480
So I need you, Fu Shaoqing,

613
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
to make up for this.

614
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
It's hard to make up for it.

615
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
But if I can let her do it,

616
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
maybe I can be her partner

617
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
and let her sign the divorce.

618
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
You have a way.

619
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Do you know why I decided to let Zhuang Shiyang

620
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
sign the divorce?

621
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I asked you before.

622
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
You didn't tell me the truth.

623
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
The board of directors of the party

624
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
said that last June,

625
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,480
there was a meeting in Danzhou.

626
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
After I returned,

627
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,480
I checked the 12 officials who were missing last year.

628
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Including my father.

629
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Among them, there were only 11 people who were not out of the capital.

630
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Only Zhuang Shiyang was in the time.

631
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
He was not sick.

632
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
He was missing.

633
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
He was missing?

634
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
That means

635
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
there was no lack of evidence.

636
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
There's one more thing.

637
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Many years ago,

638
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
I was invited by Pei Dafu

639
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
to visit his house.

640
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,480
There was a famous dish in the western part of the country.

641
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
It was called Fu Shaoquan.

642
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
It was the true truth of the sea.

643
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
It was more powerful than the kung fu.

644
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,480
The taste was also unique.

645
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Last year,

646
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I tasted the taste of Zhuang Hu Jia Yan.

647
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
I was able to tell the difference

648
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,480
between the taste of the taste of the taste of the taste of the taste of Pei Dafu.

649
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
It was the same.

650
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
I was just a newbie at that time.

651
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Is it because of Zhuang Shiyang who has always been in the same position

652
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
with the world?

653
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
It's also because of Pei Dafu's secret.

654
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
And the fact that the Danzhou is more and more certain

655
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,480
is the reason why the Pei Dafu

656
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,480
is the one who is hiding among the things.

657
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
So it is.

658
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Fu Shaoquan was a common man.

659
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
He was not the one who was the most vulnerable.

660
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I was also worried that there would be no good people.

661
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
We often went to the brothel.

662
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,480
But even if someone could make the same dish,

663
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
the taste was different.

664
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Have you ever had Jin Hua wine?

665
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Of course.

666
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Then is there a taste of Jin Hua wine in Fu Shaoquan?

667
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
It's said that, but it has this taste.

668
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
How do you know?

669
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,480
I heard that the taste of Fu Shaoquan

670
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
is more than just a taste of wine.

671
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
After entering the family,

672
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,480
I discovered that father made the dish with Jin Hua wine.

673
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
I thought that it was because of that.

674
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,480
The taste is unique.

675
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,480
And I also found the clue.

676
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
It seems that it is true.

677
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,480
So you want to use this dish to get rid of it?

678
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
It's not difficult.

679
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
But we have different reasons.

680
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I can't think of anything.

681
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Master.

682
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Ruoyin,

683
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
where did this dish come from?

684
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Master, isn't this your work?

685
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I didn't cook today.

686
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Father.

687
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
You can all go out.

688
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Master.

689
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Go out.

690
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Yes.

691
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Master.

692
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Why did you get up?

693
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
I'll give you clothes.

694
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
It's okay.

695
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
You can rest first.

696
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Master.

697
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
What's wrong?

698
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
This...

699
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Where did this dish come from?

700
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Master, I'm sorry.

701
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
I don't know.

702
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
This...

703
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,480
I'm back from the old town tonight.

704
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
I'm sorry for being late.

705
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Master, what do you mean?

706
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
What are you talking about?

707
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Master, I'm sorry.

708
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I was just sharing the dishes.

709
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
But I didn't expect...

710
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Go out.

711
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Yes.

712
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Yes.

713
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
This big piece of meat

714
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,480
is not for my wife.

715
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
It's more precious than human.

716
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Eat it.

717
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Eat it.

718
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Who's there?

719
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Come here.

720
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
You're a thief.

721
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Master, please spare me.

722
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm just a thief.

723
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
I'm not the master.

724
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Go to the top of the mountain.

725
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
I'm begging you.

726
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
I'm begging you.

727
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
I'm begging you.

728
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
This is a secret.

729
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Don't get involved.

730
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Go.

731
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Master,

732
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I haven't seen you for a long time.

733
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm afraid I'm late.

734
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Huang Caiying?

735
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Huang Caiying?

736
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Don't be afraid, Master Zhuang.

737
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,480
I'm not a bad person.

738
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Didn't you kill me?

739
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Many people saw me.

740
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,480
You're not a bad person.

741
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
What's going on?

742
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,480
I just learned that

743
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
the god of the god of the god

744
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,480
is the one who is the god of the god.

745
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,480
You're the god of the god?

746
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
You're a good person.

747
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,480
You're a good person.

748
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
What are you talking about?

749
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Master Zhuang,

750
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
don't mind.

751
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,480
I've been given the order of the god of the god

752
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,480
to go to the old man.

753
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
What old man?

754
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
What new man?

755
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Are you a human or a ghost?

756
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
What kind of a ghost are you talking about?

757
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
It seems that

758
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Master Zhuang is still a little bit of a god of the god.

759
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,480
He's been in the imperial palace for the longest time.

760
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
He's been in the imperial palace for the longest time.

761
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
He's a good person.

762
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Master Zhuang is a good person.

763
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Moreover,

764
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Pei Changyin is a thousand-year-old man.

765
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,480
I'm afraid that you and I are all in the same boat.

766
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,480
He can still live on.

767
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
You stupid fish.

768
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
I'm talking nonsense.

769
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
After three days,

770
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Pei Changyin will go to the southern border.

771
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Tonight, he ordered you to save the land and rebuild it.

772
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
It's for the money you brought to the head office.

773
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
I brought it.

774
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
If you still don't believe me,

775
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,480
then only Pei Changyin will come to the capital personally.

776
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Master Zhuang, you're a good person.

777
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Goodbye.

778
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
It's three o'clock.

779
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Peace and safety.

780
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,480
The wind is dry and the plants are small.

781
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,480
The wind is dry and the plants are small.

782
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Be careful.

783
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Master Zhuang.

784
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Gu Yan.

785
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Han Yan.

786
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
The case of the young man from the capital tonight

787
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
is not about blood and blood.

788
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,480
It's about the good and bad.

789
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Father,

790
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
the letter that my mother gave you

791
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
is about the blood and blood of the young man.

792
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I'm sorry.

793
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm sorry.

794
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
I'm sorry.

795
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
I'm sorry.

796
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm sorry.

797
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I've been responsible for your mother.

798
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,480
I've always been responsible for you.

799
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
If I didn't make this appointment tonight,

800
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,480
you would have been fooled by me.

801
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
You're so good at pretending to be a mother.

802
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,480
It's a pity that you don't go to the opera.

803
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Come home with me.

804
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
I have something important to tell you.

805
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
What else can you say?

806
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Master Zhuang,

807
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
you're acting now.

808
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
You know what you're talking about.

809
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Then Zhuang Jia will be in trouble.

810
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Don't you think about your mother?

811
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I'm thinking about my mother.

812
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
That's why I'm thinking about this.

813
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Father has sent a lot of messages.

814
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Then hurry up and call her.

815
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Then the party will be yours.

816
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Is it you?

817
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
The yellow food always says that

818
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
we'll meet again tonight.

819
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,480
You can find this piece of shit in the temple.

820
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,480
You're not a son.

821
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Who else can it be?

822
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,480
I did find this piece of shit.

823
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
It's a piece of shit.

824
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,480
And you two have been waiting for this.

825
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,480
You invited the yellow food, right?

826
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
He said to himself,

827
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Pei Zhang Yin,

828
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
we're going to Nanyang in three days.

829
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Pei Zhang Yin,

830
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
we have to find the food.

831
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
He said,

832
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
he's lying.

833
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
Pei Zhang Yin,

834
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
he's dead.

835
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
Why do you think so?

836
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
Pei is dead.

837
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
No matter how deep the situation is,

838
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Pei is so arrogant and selfish.

839
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
He's taking care of the crime.

840
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
He's just talking to the outside world.

841
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,480
He died because he was a common man.

842
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,480
He was killed by the body.

843
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
It's a secret.

844
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
There are few people in it.

845
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Is this poison

846
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,480
also made by you?

847
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
Since you know

848
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
that Pei is impossible to survive,

849
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
why did you come tonight?

850
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
Han Yan,

851
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,480
I came back with you

852
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,480
for you.

853
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
I can tell you everything.

854
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,480
Don't help the man who's greedy.

855
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
This time, you've ruined us,

856
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
your mother,

857
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
and the whole family.

858
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Go back with me.

859
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
Mr. Fu,

860
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,480
you're not going to avoid it.

861
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
What's the point of it?

862
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
I'm temporarily dismissed,

863
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,480
but I'm finally a young man.

864
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,480
I've been involved in the Pei case.

865
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
You're doing this for Pei Zhang Yin.

866
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
In that case,

867
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,480
you finally admit that you're Pei's son.

868
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
I'm a rich man.

869
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480
What if I do?

870
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Mr. Fu,

871
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,480
why did you force me to do this?

872
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,480
You let Han Yan go.

873
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Why did you let him go?

874
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,480
I came here with a risk.

875
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,480
I came to save my daughter.

876
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Please don't try to understand

877
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
the situation between us.

878
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,480
Mr. Zhuang,

879
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
you're so kind.

880
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Don't worry.

881
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
It's really a good thing.

882
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Mr. Fu,

883
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,480
don't be so obsessed with it.

884
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Pei Zhang Yin is dead.

885
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
We were both in a hurry.

886
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,480
Why are we so hard on each other now?

887
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,480
I came here tonight to ask you for a favor.

888
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
As long as you're willing to take the Western Valley,

889
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,480
we'll be fine.

890
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,480
We don't need to get to the point of the death.

891
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,480
The death?

892
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,480
What does that mean?

893
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Fei Yu Xin,

894
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,480
what else do you have to hide from me?

895
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,480
Silly girl,

896
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
she's been hiding too many things from you.

897
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
She's been through a lot.

898
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
Mr. Fu is a rich man.

899
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
She's been working hard.

900
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
She's never been so hard on you.

901
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
She used you to

902
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
get close to Zhuang Jia and investigate me.

903
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,480
Her purpose is to kill the property.

904
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,480
When the Empress Dowager left the Hangcheng,

905
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,480
Her Majesty came to investigate and accompany you.

906
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
I'm sure you're also worried about her.

907
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,480
You're afraid that you can't kill her.

908
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,480
You're still trying to save her.

909
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,480
You're actually trying to save your life.

910
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Could it be that

911
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,480
you're also involved in something with Mr. Pei?

912
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
I'm not just involved in something.

913
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,480
The chaos in the capital is

914
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,480
the mastermind of the rich.

915
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,480
I've made it clear.

916
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,480
I'm really Mr. Pei's son.

917
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
I've helped him to keep the property,

918
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,480
but I've never harmed anyone.

919
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,480
If you weren't this close,

920
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,480
I wouldn't have guessed who you are.

921
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Which law is the rule?

922
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Mr. Pei

923
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,480
can only have one son.

924
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,480
So,

925
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,480
you're also the father of the rich

926
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,480
who has been with you for a long time.

927
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
You promised me

928
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,480
that as long as I ask you,

929
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,480
you'll tell me the truth.

930
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Then tell me,

931
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,480
are you the one who's been with Mr. Pei?

932
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,480
It's me.

933
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,480
He's been walking in this battlefield

934
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,480
and he's not easy to break up with.

935
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,480
Love and hate

936
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,480
don't have to be so harsh.

937
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,480
Who's the one who's trying to save her?

938
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,480
Or do you need someone else?

939
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,480
The fear is in the middle of the earth.

940
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,480
The heart is broken.

941
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,480
The tears are all over the place.

942
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,480
Who can get rid of them?

943
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,480
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

944
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
I'm not going to give up.

945
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,480
I'm going to be alone.

946
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,480
Even if I'm going down the road,

947
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,480
I'll still have a long way to go.

948
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,480
The heart is broken.

949
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,480
The tears are all over the place.

950
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,480
Who can get rid of them?

951
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:37,480
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

952
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,480
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

953
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,480
He's willing to sacrifice his life for others.

954
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,480
He's willing to sacrifice his life for others.

955
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,480
He's willing to sacrifice his life for others.

956
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,480
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

957
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,480
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

958
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,480
I'll save the life for others.

959
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,480
He's willing to sacrifice his life for others.

960
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,480
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

961
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,480
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.
