00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,140
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,560
Selling buns.

4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,280
Candied hawthorns.

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,590
Selling buns.

6
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,430
You weren't looking
where you were going.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,860
You can't leave until you explain it.

8
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,030
Stop arguing.

9
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,150
What's going on here?

10
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,170
You owe me for my things.

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,390
Don't push me.

12
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,380
Mr. Fu, the vegetable cart ahead
has overturned,

13
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,120
blocking the road.

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,870
Change the route.

15
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,180
- Yes.
- Look at my goods.

16
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,670
Stop the carriage.

17
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,080
It's sulfur powder.

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,480
Retreat.

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,760
Fu Yunxi, come out and face death.

20
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,520
If you surrender now,

21
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,710
I'll spare your life.

22
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,070
Go.

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,440
Catch them alive.

24
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,680
Get up.

25
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,600
Mr. Fu,

26
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,110
you really do have foresight.

27
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
On the way to the Palace,

28
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,710
someone indeed tried to kill you.

29
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,480
You work for Duke Qi?

30
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,710
Mr. Fu, you're Pei Dafu's adopted son.

31
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,640
Everyone wants you dead.

32
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,950
We are merely removing a menace
to the people.

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,760
What's that got to do with others?

34
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,110
Dukes' guards are registered.

35
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,710
Your defense is useless.
We can easily verify it.

36
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,950
You...

37
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,560
Duke Qi is loyal to the Emperor.

38
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,610
The Emperor will make a wise judgment.

39
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,280
The Emperor...

40
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,070
Even if I go to the Palace
and accuse Zhuang Shiyang

41
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,280
of being Pei's adopted son,

42
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,150
there's still no solid evidence.

43
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,200
When the time comes,
the Emperor will summon him,

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,950
and we'll confront each other.

45
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,350
This man is eloquent and persuasive.

46
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
One wrong move

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,920
could cost us everything.

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,390
I'm gambling with my life today,

49
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,320
so I must make thorough preparations.

50
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,660
I can't give him any chance
to turn things around.

51
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,350
Duke Qi has tried
to harm Hanyan several times.

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,470
He is also the last supporter
of Zhuang Shiyang.

53
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,120
We should take this chance
to capture them both.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,520
My Lord,

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,910
what about this secret letter?

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,560
I've written the whole story

57
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,470
in the secret letter

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,200
and made an agreement with the Emperor

59
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,120
that we would startle the snake

60
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,350
before luring it out.

61
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,640
At that time, the imperial guards
will be witnesses.

62
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,790
Take them away.

63
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,330
Throw them into the imperial prison,

64
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,510
and interrogate them severely.

65
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,430
Yes.

66
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,200
My Lord, the Emperor invites you
to the Palace for a report.

67
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,750
Yes.

68
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,110
Mr. Fu,

69
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,690
even if you've planned for everything,

70
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,070
your wife may not have.

71
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,990
Let's go.

72
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,350
Mother, are we going to find Father?

73
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,710
Yes. Don't be afraid, Lingzhi.

74
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,670
Madam.

75
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,160
Lingzhi, stay inside the carriage.

76
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,590
Don't go out. Got it?

77
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,390
Protect Lingzhi.

78
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,310
Yes.

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,320
How dare you rob
under the Emperor's watch?

80
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,070
Who gave you the courage?

81
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,990
Shoot the arrows.

82
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,070
Mother.

83
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,240
Mother, get in the carriage.

84
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,090
Lingzhi, go back.

85
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,310
Mother, get in.

86
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,350
Mother.

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,150
Uncle Feng.

88
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,440
You're just a few bandits.

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,030
Hurry to disarm and surrender.

90
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,950
You're outnumbering us.

91
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,760
Assassinating the Vice Minister's wife

92
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,320
with so few soldiers?

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,420
It seems Duke Qi has underestimated us.

94
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,830
Don't get too proud.

95
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,150
There's more to come.

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,400
Mother.

97
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,480
Protect Lingzhi and send her back home.

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,590
Madam, where are you going?

99
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,240
Fu Yunxi's life hangs by a thread.

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
I'll return to the Capital first.

101
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,290
What should we do?

102
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,410
There may still be an ambush.

103
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,160
Leave this to me.

104
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,050
You go escort her.

105
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,540
(No animals were harmed or mistreated
during the filming process.)

106
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,430
Yushan.

107
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,670
Get on.

108
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,470
- Hold on tight.
- Okay.

109
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,310
Chase.

110
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,590
Hurry!

111
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,120
Chase.

112
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,140
(Peace and Prosperity)

113
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,990
Why are you here?

114
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,440
I came because I wanted to.
What's it to you?

115
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,870
Go to the side gate of the Palace.
Hurry.

116
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,520
Stop right there.

117
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,820
Sir,

118
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,910
did Fu Yunxi, Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review,

119
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,080
enter the Palace today?

120
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,930
Who are you?

121
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,950
I'm his wife.

122
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,710
Yushan.

123
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,790
Why are you also here?

124
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,830
Fu Yunxi...

125
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
Hanyan, it's all over now.

126
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Mr. Fu has received the edict
and left the Palace.

127
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,840
He knew you would come,

128
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,230
so he asked me to wait for you here,

129
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,380
telling you to go home
and wait for the result.

130
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,870
What edict did he receive?

131
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,190
He's confessed everything to the Emperor

132
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,580
about the case of the Ruan family,

133
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,750
the case of the adopted son,

134
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,040
the case of Zhuang Hanliang,

135
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,520
the case of Noble Consort Miao,

136
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,240
and the lives of Madam,
Yuwen Chang'an, and others.

137
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,400
He asked me to go to the Palace
with him as a witness

138
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,320
to report Zhuang Shiyang's

139
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,470
past crimes.

140
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,520
Where is he now?

141
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,590
He should be back
deploying at the Judicial Review.

142
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,270
Yushan, may I borrow your horse?

143
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,190
Sure.

144
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,710
Yushan.

145
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,710
You've suffered, my daughter.

146
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,680
Don't you blame me

147
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,030
for what I did in the courtroom?

148
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,440
How could I blame you?

149
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,230
It's my fault.

150
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,280
Your face...

151
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,040
What did Zhuang Shiyang do to you?

152
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,400
It's all over now.

153
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,160
It doesn't matter anymore.

154
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Old grievances and new ones

155
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,470
will come to an end today.

156
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,400
But between us,

157
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,110
from the very beginning,

158
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,080
it was my fault.

159
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,710
It's just because

160
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,230
I was raised in this way.

161
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,550
Yushan,

162
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,160
it was me

163
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,470
who ruined your happiness.

164
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,950
Now,

165
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,560
it's too late to regret it.

166
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,350
I don't dare to ask
for your forgiveness,

167
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,350
but no matter the cost,

168
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,470
even if I have to give my life,

169
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,710
I will save you from Duke Qi's hands.

170
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,110
Mother...

171
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,560
Good girl.

172
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,680
It's not too late.

173
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,590
It's not too late.

174
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,040
Everything can still be fixed.

175
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,750
I'm sorry, my child.

176
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,100
(Zhuang Residence)

177
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,020
(Fine and Leisure)

178
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,950
Master.

179
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,240
How is it? Has Duke Qi replied?

180
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,200
Not yet.

181
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,240
I just noticed

182
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,270
a few suspicious people

183
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,600
were outside.

184
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,320
They don't seem like good people.

185
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,350
When did they arrive?

186
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,790
It seems

187
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,240
they came after you returned

188
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,280
at the Wu hour.

189
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,040
Oh, no.

190
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,520
This is not good.

191
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,620
(Court of Judicial Review)

192
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,330
Mrs. Fu,

193
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,010
you can't barge
into the Judicial Review.

194
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,040
I need to see Fu Yunxi.

195
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,680
Mr. Fu has been ordered by the Emperor

196
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,790
to capture a criminal.

197
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,750
Which criminal?

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,400
Zhuang Shiyang or Duke Qi?

199
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
I'm not at liberty to say.

200
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,870
Let go of me.

201
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,450
I need to enter the Palace
to see my brother.

202
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,350
Who dares to demote me to a commoner?

203
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,400
Who dares to sentence me to death?

204
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,040
Zhuang Hanyan.

205
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,280
Where is Fu Yunxi?

206
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,200
He forged an imperial edict
and deceived the Emperor.

207
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,950
Let him come out and face me.

208
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,920
Your Highness, aren't you happy

209
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,720
that you can finally meet
the former Duchess?

210
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,640
Zhuang Hanyan,

211
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,350
don't rejoice too soon.

212
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,870
I will kill you sooner or later.

213
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,320
Zhuang Hanyan.

214
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,520
- Go.
- I'll kill you.

215
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,670
(Court of Judicial Review)

216
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,830
Let go of me.

217
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,300
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,420
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

219
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,630
My Lord, Lingzhi has been sent home.

220
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,280
Did you see Mrs. Fu?

221
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,320
It's Zhuang Shiyang. Capture him.

222
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,590
Zhuang Shiyang.

223
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,110
Track his footsteps in the new snow,

224
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,920
and ask the Five City Wardens Offices

225
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,840
to close the city gates.
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

226
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,070
Yes.

227
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,870
Mr. Zhuang,

228
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,590
where are you going?

229
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,240
Yunxi, are you

230
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,910
truly not leaving me any way out?

231
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,670
Tonight, I'm not your son-in-law;
I'm the Vice Minister.

232
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,800
We chose our ways.

233
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,240
When you took the first step back then,

234
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,320
you should've known it was a dead end.

235
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,560
I really can't go any further.

236
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,910
Get up.

237
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,480
Mr. Fu, I'm old.

238
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,590
My legs are not good.

239
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,670
I truly can't walk anymore.

240
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,720
How about I give you my horse?

241
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,960
That would be great.

242
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,550
You can ride this swift horse

243
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,190
and break through the encirclement.

244
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,720
Is that your plan?

245
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,080
Mr. Fu, you're overthinking.

246
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,830
How could I dare?

247
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,660
Mr. Zhuang,
you've been sharp all your life,

248
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,000
yet now you come up
with such a clumsy plan.

249
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,960
You must be scared out of your wits.

250
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,990
Help him then.

251
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,680
Let me go, Mr. Fu.

252
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,400
Even if I die today,

253
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,080
how many more days will you live?

254
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,510
Let me go.
I have something to say to Mr. Fu.

255
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,200
- Fu Yunxi.
- Gag him.

256
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,120
Fu...

257
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,080
It's freezing cold;
you should go back and rest soon.

258
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,670
You lied to me again.

259
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,800
This is the last time.

260
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,190
Since you insist on going your own way,

261
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,550
treating your life like a joke,

262
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,430
why should I keep searching for you?

263
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,480
From now on,

264
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,390
whether you live or die,

265
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,720
it has nothing to do with me.

266
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,430
Let's go.

267
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,580
(Yongtai Tavern)

268
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,260
(Court of Judicial Review)

269
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,280
Now, we just need this statement.

270
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,870
You should confess your collusion

271
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,390
with Eunuch Pei.

272
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,480
I'm innocent.

273
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,200
All the evidence has been presented
to the Emperor.

274
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,430
Why keep arguing?

275
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,480
So what if it's presented
to the Emperor?

276
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,560
Even the Emperor must follow the law.

277
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,000
I declare my innocence;
I refuse to admit my guilt.

278
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,560
So, you must interrogate me repeatedly,

279
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,190
day after day, year after year.

280
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,960
I'll wait and see

281
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,150
how long you can last,

282
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,480
and which of us meets
the Yama King first.

283
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,870
I'm innocent.

284
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm innocent.

285
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,670
I'm innocent.

286
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,800
Since you're not afraid
of physical pain,

287
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,150
we in the Judicial Review
have plenty of strength.

288
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm innocent.

289
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,280
May the Emperor see through this.

290
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:39,060
(Court of Judicial Review)

00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,060
(Vice Minister)

292
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,080
Mrs. Fu.

293
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,720
You've done a great service today.

294
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,040
Mr. Fu has prepared food and drink
to reward you.

295
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,080
You should go and join
in the celebration.

296
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,190
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,320
Hanyan, Hanyan.

298
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,320
Zhuang Shiyang,

299
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,160
I've sent the guards away.

300
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,560
Write the poison formula for me,

301
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,560
and I'll help you escape.

302
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,960
Hanyan, are you deceiving me?

303
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,070
(Vice Minister)
This is Fu Yunxi's badge.

304
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,480
I just risked stealing it.

305
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,670
I can't let him act so foolishly.

306
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,960
I only want you to save his life.

307
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,720
If you can get me out, I will trust you.

308
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,560
Follow me. Don't make a sound.

309
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,080
My badge has been stolen.

310
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,480
Did Zhuang Hanyan just come here?

311
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,670
Mrs. Fu just entered.

312
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,400
Let's go to the prison and check.

313
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,320
Take that way.

314
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,600
Over there.

315
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,020
(Court of Judicial Review)

316
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,590
- Here.
- Hanyan, they're chasing after us.

317
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,510
Hurry.

318
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
Zhuang Shiyang is severely tortured;
he won't run far.

319
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,830
Everyone,

320
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,830
find him for me.

321
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,750
Yes.

322
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,710
My Lord.

323
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,630
My Lord,
there's no sign of that old man.

324
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,150
He's probably run far away.

325
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,360
Let's go.

326
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,640
Fu Yunxi has deployed forces everywhere.

327
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,670
Hanyan, where are you going to hide me?

328
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,830
Why come to Pei Dafu's house?

329
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,910
This place isn't safe.

330
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,870
I've made plans for you.

331
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,760
If you want to escape the city,

332
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,560
you'll have to hide
in the Capital for a while

333
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,720
until they think you've already escaped.

334
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,830
Then the guards will relax,

335
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,350
and it won't be so hard

336
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,870
to leave the city.

337
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,280
You want me to hide here?

338
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,910
I'm afraid Fu Yunxi will search here.

339
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,000
Have you forgotten this?

340
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,280
You want me to return
to Zhuang Residence?

341
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,760
The most dangerous place
is the safest place.

342
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,240
However clever Fu Yunxi is,

343
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,720
he won't search one place,

344
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,040
and that is

345
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,430
Zhuang Residence.

346
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,040
Now, I have no choice

347
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,520
but to take a gamble.

348
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,160
Let's go.

349
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,430
No need to test it.

350
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,160
Hanyan,

351
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,560
what do you mean?

352
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,630
If you write the poison formula tonight,

353
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,350
I'll need to find a physician
to prepare the antidote.

354
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,870
It'll take days or even half a year

355
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,150
to collect the medicine,
brew it, and test it.

356
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,040
I'll need a lot of time.

357
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,630
Before Fu Yunxi's health improves,

358
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,630
you'll have to stay

359
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,760
in this secret tunnel

360
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,960
for a while.

361
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,910
I knew you wouldn't help me.

362
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,960
I knew it.

363
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,150
Both ends of the secret tunnel
are locked.

364
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,350
Without my order,
no one will open the door for you.

365
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,910
Since you've promised me

366
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,560
you'd hand over the poison formula,

367
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,430
why are you angry now?

368
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,630
You've always valued your life.

369
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,830
As you've been tortured today,

370
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,520
you should take care of your health.

371
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,520
If I hand over the formula,

372
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,280
and you don't let me go

373
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,870
and send me back to Judicial Review,

374
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,190
what should I do then?

375
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,190
Don't you understand your situation?

376
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,910
You're in a desperate situation

377
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,520
with only two choices.

378
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,830
You can either choose to trust me

379
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,000
or

380
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,830
choose to die.

381
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,560
Write it down.

382
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,480
Write the formula clearly.

383
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,190
I know

384
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,040
you care deeply for Fu Yunxi.

385
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,350
If you dare to bet his life
and swear an oath,

386
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,080
I'll trust you once more.

387
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,590
If you hand over the formula today,

388
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,760
I'll set you free.

389
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,830
Otherwise,

390
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,520
Fu Yunxi will go

391
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,960
to hell with endless suffering,

392
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
his soul will never rest,

393
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,630
and he'll never be reborn.

394
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,520
Are you satisfied?

395
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,560
Fine.

396
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,880
I'll write it.

397
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,520
I've followed your instructions.

398
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,430
Why aren't you writing yet?

399
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,960
If I don't write,

400
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,320
will you

401
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,870
be stuck here with me?

402
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,870
I'll leave first.

403
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,080
Hanyan,

404
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,520
it's not that I don't trust you,

405
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,630
but it concerns my life.

406
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,640
This tunnel is cold and desolate.

407
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,150
You should go out first.

408
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,160
Give me one more day

409
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,590
to think it through.

410
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,670
Is that okay?

411
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,870
I'll give you time to think.

412
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,830
I'll come back tomorrow.

413
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
Shuhong.

414
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,840
Madam.

415
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,560
Open the door.

416
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,710
Yes.

417
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,320
Madam!

418
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,640
Hanyan,

00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,870
where did you get this thing?

420
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,600

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,720

I'll kill you now.

439
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
When I left the Palace,

440
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,400
Zhou Ruyin told me

441
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,880
that you once said

442
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,040
that love wasn't important to you

443
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,440
until you met me.

444
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,200
Actually,

445
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,030
I feel the same way.

446
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,840
I had grown accustomed to walking
on the edge of a blade

447
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,560
and had long come to terms with death.

448
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,710
But meeting you

449
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,520
has made me realize

450
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,520
how precious life truly is.

451
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,000
It was also you

452
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,920
who made me realize

453
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,590
that I'm also someone
who fears death and clings to life.

454
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,670
Then why

455
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,040
are you so stubborn?

456
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,520
After I told the Emperor everything,

457
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,560
I remembered what you asked of me,

458
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,790
so I requested a special edict.

459
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,360
What edict?

460
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,960
The Emperor knew I was poisoned,

461
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,960
so he not only entrusted this case to me

462
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,400
but allowed me to torture Zhuang Shiyang

463
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,520
for the antidote

464
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,400
before executing him.

465
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,880
But...

466
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
But what?

467
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,360
Has he said anything?

468
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,190
Though I wish to survive,

469
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,590
Zhuang Shiyang

470
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,520
still refuses to confess

471
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,150
even with irrefutable evidence.

472
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,110
Not to mention

473
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,670
getting him to hand over the formula.

474
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,840
I fear that in the end,

475
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,630
I will still fail you.

476
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,400
Are you willing to try one last time?

477
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,400
What do you plan to do?

478
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,080
Before taking action,

479
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,270
you must obtain something for me.

480
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,040
