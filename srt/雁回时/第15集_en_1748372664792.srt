1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
At this stage we jump onto the kannstard Menac constellations and over kindergartens.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,600
Otherwise you'd have been taken by payment hedge meeting and the foreign climate.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,040
Onoma is a region tried by oriented people serving local friends through various fields of knowledge.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,560
Manip health can be risky, but it is highly лучic.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,380
As such, the game system is the way it works at times.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,700
Don't look down on your future.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,600
Just therapeutic games to make a game possible.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,800
Do you really know what feedback there will be, and what scrolling spe Venom logging will benefit you?

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,800
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
What do you think?

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:00,200
Mother, I think It's harder for them to over-ask your��s

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,280
They think Taking your purpose is inferior to giving your husband dowry

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,820
To patient your hate, they left their homes

43
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
This gave you an opportunity to stop packing

44
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,240
опisu, don't trust thesepas

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,240
How do you know the pain of the disabled?

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,240
These years, I've been a ferocious ghost.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I may not have experienced the ups and downs that mother has experienced.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Mother, no matter what happens in the future,

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
you will finally leave this house.

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
If someone bullies you,

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
let's talk about it and get back.

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
If someone dares to let you go,

53
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,240
we will let those people who dare not do this.

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
You will no longer be alone

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
with a girl by your side.

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Okay. I promise you.

57
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Get up.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Then you must promise me one thing.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
What?

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Tell that peach to get out of here.

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
You will be punished.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
You are a ferocious ghost.

63
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Mother has been around for days.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
I put her in the prison

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
to try to get into the prison.

66
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,240
And I left a fish.

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Then I should throw it in the pond.

68
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I have told aunt Chen

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
to pay attention to her movements.

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
If the court doesn't allow her to do this,

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
and she wants to get into trouble,

72
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,240
she will surely come to the court to settle the case.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
I will not let you go.

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I will not let you go.

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I will not let you go.

76
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I will not let you go.

77
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
I will not let you go.

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
I will not let you go.

79
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I will not let you go.

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
I will not let you go.

81
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I will not let you go.

82
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
I will not let you go.

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
I will not let you go.

84
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
I will not let you go.

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
I will not let you go.

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
I will not let you go.

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
I will not let you go.

88
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I will not let you go.

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
I will not let you go.

90
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
I will not let you go.

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I have already met with the judge.

92
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
She has never participated in the banquet.

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I am afraid she would like to see the lady of the house as well.

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Looks like new domain is better for him.

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,660
Mrs, be careful.

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,580
Who is this?

97
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,080
Is she from that little girl

98
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,060
who the housekeeper's daughter use to have their own ladies?

99
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,860
terrible.

100
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,780
Her husband Sir told me that

101
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,000
she is her wife.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It seems that the whole family is in danger.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How dare you come out and show yourself?

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If I were you, I would be dead.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We were trapped in a hotel room.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The situation was very dangerous.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My mother was very upset.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She was looking at the innocent person and sending her life.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's why she risked her life to take her own blame.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
She only wanted to delay the time and bring others to life.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is a big deal.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What can we do to make her feel guilty?

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Haiyan.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't fight with them.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, mother.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Madam Zhuang, please.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How many times have you been sure about the business last night?

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I only used ten times.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Five times?

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've been used for a long time.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How can I be sure?

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Miss San is still not satisfied.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you can't invite that lady over,

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
tonight,

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we'll be in a hurry.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll go and find out what's going on.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You go first.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mrs. Chen,

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
let me do it.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Greetings, Madam Zhuang.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Your behavior is not so good.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're in a hurry.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're so shy tonight.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're so considerate of me.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're really a mother.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're a good daughter.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're so humble.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you were someone else,

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
you wouldn't be able to marry a girl

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
who's not married yet.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're so close to your husband.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Madame,

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
as long as you're a good man,

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
although you were left with no choice,

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
you can be a woman

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
that is worth having together.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry to say

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,840
but I have treated this lady

159
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,280
so맛fully.

160
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,520
After the throne demanded successfully,

161
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Mother,

162
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,120
my daughter is now a family member of the old family.

163
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,720
It's just a small matter.

164
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,080
Don't over-exaggerate her.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,120
I heard that the Zhuang family's sister,

166
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,240
Wencai Feiren,

167
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,520
is a male and female Pearl Pavilion.

168
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,600
I wonder if it's a good thing.

169
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,840
Let's have a good time today

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,520
to guess what's going on.

171
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,880
I'll take it as a gift.

172
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,280
Don't make fun of me.

173
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,160
gosto il!

174
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,440
K'ingheng wu.

175
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,800
Tang Chaoyou.

176
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,800
Songchaowu.

177
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,920
Shen DaHiji.

178
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
Me di vei kepouzi.

179
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,960
cunning Desfu.

180
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,400
The sky is dark and the stars are in the south.

181
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,840
Han Lei Huishou sent the army to

182
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,280
defeat the birds.

183
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Give me the paper.

184
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,280
Sister Zhang.

185
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,400
You are the bird.

186
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
I'm afraid you can't

187
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,360
deal with the four words.

188
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,800
The bottom of the rice is Lu Qin, right?

189
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
What are you talking about?

190
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
You are trying to guess it.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please show me the writing of the rice.

192
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,520
If I guess it wrong,

193
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,160
when you were reading the question,

194
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm afraid you missed the answer.

195
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
The ancient people guessed the rice

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
and the left and right are the records.

197
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,600
The people are the winners.

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,720
The rice has the bottom of the rice

199
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,960
and the bottom of the rice.

200
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
The rice is the same as the name of the rice.

201
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,160
Different rice has different rules.

202
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,040
The Caoer Pavilion is 18th grade.

203
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
It's the oldest rice pavilion.

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,880
The Caoer Pavilion has the bottom of the rice

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,880
and the bottom of the rice is the second or fourth.

206
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,840
Each word has to be written in two words

207
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,080
and the top and the bottom of the rice

208
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,760
can be written in two words.

209
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,240
So,

210
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,840
the word Lu is Lu Qin.

211
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,200
Read the writing of the rice.

212
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,080
It's true.

213
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,280
Thank you.

214
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,280
Miss Li, are you still guessing?

215
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,080
Of course.

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
Uhm, we'll have a date

217
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,960
here on the streets.

218
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,640
It's nice.

219
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,240
I'd like to make my eyes open for our sake.

220
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
Please.

221
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,320
I saw it wrong.

222
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,640
�� pimple has just lost their eyes tonight.

223
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,960
You mean, Ruan Xiwen?

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,160
Isn't he?

225
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
What does he look like?

226
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,040
I'm afraid he's a bit old.

227
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,080
He has no wrinkles on his face.

228
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,120
Does he have white hair?

229
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,680
Or can't he walk?

230
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,600
Go and have a look.

231
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,440
Who brought the rouge?

232
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,760
Let's shoot.

233
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,040
Are you a full age woman?

234
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,400
Nice.

235
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,320
Yes.

236
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,760
Mother.

237
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,560
It's a simple act.

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,840
I'm afraid I can't do anything for you.

239
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,800
Not considering what she said…

240
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,720
Why isn't she fully making up words?

241
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,240
It's the right time to think about it.

242
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,520
It all seems like she thinks at like.

243
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
With her written into your mind,

244
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,260
she loses her last word.

245
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,200
I'll be sure to let her know.

246
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:26,720
information.

247
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,620
All

248
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,640
of you don't know?

249
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,460
I don't know.

250
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,920
Zhong Yushan?

251
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,260
You just don't know?

252
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,960
I've never heard this kind of reasoning.

253
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,760
Ren chair position,

254
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
potentiallow1

255
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,120
that is the first one.

256
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,820
that I've never heard of.

257
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,960
...

258
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,520
Like I am不多 the past years Hsu Land is nothing else.

259
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,960
But the reason I separated skills are because

260
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,920
the like hospitality was not actually me.

261
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,400
I have only one good master.

262
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
What am I to look like that?

263
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,560
What I feel attracted to is the two of us.

264
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,960
Don't be superstitious

265
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,640
Spitting a human skin

266
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
is tricky

267
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,000
for the dog

268
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
so it can't hide

269
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,760
or put después offin the dog

270
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Are you

271
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,280
going to lie to me?

272
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,000
I didn't eth bathing

273
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,200
without your knowledge

274
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,160
I'm at least

275
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,560
grateful to you

276
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Don't touch me

277
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,000
I only suggest

278
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
that the girl

279
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,660
International farming.

280
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
No matter howは one wishes one does,

281
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,320
If one got killed at dinner,

282
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
it's only when one hurdles and styles love life.

283
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,820
It can only stop him from

284
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,440
falling for it.

285
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,520
What a bullshit!

286
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,260
Don't make the wrong decision!

287
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,360
When sister aproximated the night,

288
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,820
she came to send us gifts.

289
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,940
She is here today to have her wedding ceremony.

290
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,660
I think it's also the letter from my sister.

291
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,660
We don't have any grudges.

292
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,540
Why bother to look back today?

293
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,700
Why don't we take this opportunity to make a friend?

294
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,820
If there's anything useful,

295
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,020
you can just say it.

296
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,140
I don't dare to praise myself for being smart.

297
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,700
But it's not just a person who hides behind people

298
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,020
and makes a fool of himself.

299
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,980
But it's also a stupid thing to push my sister out of the crime.

300
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,540
Besides, the manor is big.

301
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,060
You have to be careful.

302
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,180
Don't ruin the use of those scoundrels.

303
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,460
He's the only one who can make you a good man.

304
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,100
You're right.

305
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,420
There are a few reasons.

306
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,540
The Yuan family is a family of two.

307
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,940
Han Yan is the most important place for the blind.

308
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,260
She doesn't know the rules.

309
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,220
If you have any problem with her,

310
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,300
please let me know.

311
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,260
If you don't mind,

312
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,500
I can just give you a second.

313
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,260
You're welcome, Han Yan.

314
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,700
We're not close.

315
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,500
I was fooled by the scoundrel.

316
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,940
That's why I'm confused.

317
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,060
Don't be so heartless.

318
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,580
Of course not.

319
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,060
Sister Jiaqi.

320
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,500
What else do you want?

321
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,180
Isn't she the sister of Brother Liang?

322
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,180
I haven't seen her for a long time.

323
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,820
We're not the same age.

324
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,780
What other older sisters do you still have?

325
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,100
Tabicie?

326
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,420
Why are you still so lost in thought?

327
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,180
What're you talking about?

328
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,820
Just wanted to stay away from a group of minsans.

329
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,860
People living in this country

330
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,020
Our pudding is on an apartment DUIJUAN.

331
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,300
Just refuse

332
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,300
She is pregnant with L Small xiu

333
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,900
marry the prince

334
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,740
Sh PU mañana

335
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,440
turtle

336
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,620
Jia Mu looks so small

337
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,340
ok. I will run off

338
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,440
Good fool

339
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,340
This is great

340
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,340
You don't go to see your husband tonight?

341
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,340
Are you going to have tea with us?

342
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
Go ahead.

343
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,340
I'll stay with you.

344
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
It's good.

345
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,340
Let's go.

346
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Let's go.

347
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,340
You should have a good time tonight.

348
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,340
You were a great guest in the capital

349
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,340
when you were still in the royal family.

350
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,340
You were so kind and kind.

351
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,340
You even got a good tea.

352
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,340
Do you have any idea

353
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
if Mrs. Zhuang's tea is going to be published?

354
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,340
Could you show us one more time?

355
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Let's see the beauty of your daughter.

356
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,340
I found out that it's 6.7 kg.

357
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
6.1 kg is the right amount.

358
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,340
The tea is the tenderest one you can choose.

359
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
This is the female tea.

360
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
It's old.

361
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,340
It's 2.5 kg.

362
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,340
It's in the water.

363
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,340
It's in the water.

364
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,340
If you use this water to make tea,

365
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
it will be a great gift.

366
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,340
This tea is made of pure white purple and blue.

367
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,340
It's made of purple and purple.

368
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,340
These are the purple and purple.

369
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
It's a big deal.

370
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,340
It seems that it's not my memory.

371
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,340
I found out about it.

372
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Mrs. Zhuang found out about it.

373
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Mrs. Zhuang is really good at making tea.

374
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,340
But I'm not good at making tea.

375
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

376
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Why don't you ask this lady

377
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
to go to the tea shop with my maid

378
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,340
and order some tea?

379
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,340
I'm so jealous.

380
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
How can I know about it?

381
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
I dare not be a lady and order.

382
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
You old man.

383
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
It's your face that can be ordered by the lady

384
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
of the university.

385
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Don't you think that this whole factory

386
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,340
of servants can't serve your mother?

387
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
How dare you say that?

388
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
Mrs. Zhuang, go.

389
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,340
Go teach them.

390
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
Go.

391
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,340
Mrs. Zhuang, please.

392
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Please.

393
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
Aunt, please go to the tea shop.

394
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,340
What are you doing?

395
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Open the door.

396
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Open the door.

397
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Open the door.

398
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,340
Open the door.

399
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Open the door.

400
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,340
Mrs. Zhuang, please use the tea.

401
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,340
Mrs. Zhuang, please use the tea.

402
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Please, Mrs. Zhuang.

403
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
Mrs. Zhuang, please have a drink.

404
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Here.

405
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,340
Mrs. Zhuang, please use the tea.

406
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,340
Please, Mrs. Zhuang.

407
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,340
Please.

408
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340
The plum garden is not for drinking.

409
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,340
Can you make a full-time investment

410
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,340
in your life?

411
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,340
It's written on the iron head.

412
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,340
If you can make a full-time investment

413
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
in your life,

414
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,340
you can have a drink.

415
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
Please.

416
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,340
Please.

417
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Please.

418
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Please.

419
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Please.

420
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Please.

421
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
The sky is clear.

422
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,340
The North is not clear.

423
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Clouds are cloudy.

424
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,340
The sky is clear.

425
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,340
The sky is clear.

426
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,340
The road is clear.

427
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
The road is clear.

428
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,340
The night is clear.

429
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Clouds are cloudy.

430
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,340
Why are you so angry?

431
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,340
It's none of your business.

432
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,340
Mr. Zhang, who hung up?

433
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
I don't know.

434
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
I just hung up the paper.

435
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
You're so selfish.

436
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,340
Since ancient times,

437
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Wenren has been a poet.

438
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,340
He's been so selfish.

439
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
He's been so selfish.

440
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Wenren.

441
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,340
Wenren.

442
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,340
I just want to ask you a question.

443
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,340
Are you an idea person?

444
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,340
If you don't have anything.

445
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,340
Don't you have to tell Miss A?

446
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Is this your writing?

447
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,340
How is it?

448
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,140
I have already told you that I can't make this decision.

449
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,740
What do you like about Han Yan?

450
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,940
You can tell me, I can learn.

451
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,540
Just don't like her anymore.

452
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
I'm afraid Second Miss is drunk.

453
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,140
It's better to go back and rest.

454
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,940
I'm not drunk.

455
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,740
I'm telling the truth.

456
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,940
I'm not drunk.

457
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,740
I'm telling the truth.

458
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,140
I'm not drunk.

459
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,540
I'm not drunk.

460
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,940
I'm not drunk.

461
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,140
I'm telling the truth.

462
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,140
I don't care if you're my sister.

463
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,540
I don't care if others say I'm a delusional.

464
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,740
As long as you can understand,

465
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,540
I won't regret it.

466
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,540
I'll let Second Miss think it over.

467
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
We're not going to be together.

468
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,940
I'll leave now.

469
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,540
No!

470
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,340
You'll regret it one day!

471
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,740
Madam Zhuang, please have some tea.

472
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,340
Here. I'll go in.

473
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,940
Here.

474
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
Come.

475
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,540
I've been drinking tea.

476
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,740
I'll make sure you're well and have a good time.

477
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,540
I'll practice again.

478
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,140
Dr. Ye, don't drink too much.

479
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,740
I'm so worried.

480
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,340
Madam Zhuang has had so many other tea.

481
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,940
She doesn't want to have my tea.

482
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,340
She's not asking people to think

483
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,740
we're a couple.

484
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,740
It's hard for you to ask me to bring my clothes back.

485
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,740
Please have some tea.

486
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,340
It's good to have a good time.

487
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,940
It's not easy for us to be together.

488
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,340
If you leave,

489
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,340
the scene will be cold.

490
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,940
It's better to stay.

491
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,140
Yes.

492
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,540
Why don't you ask Madam Zhuang to come back

493
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,740
and have some tea?

494
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,540
Here, Madam Zhuang.

495
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,540
Please.

496
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,740
Madam Zhuang, please.

497
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Please.

498
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,740
Miss.

499
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
I've asked you to come back.

500
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,540
I've been keeping an eye on Miss.

501
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,540
She's been dragging people around

502
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,340
and she's been going to the horse house.

503
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
Horse house?

504
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Yes.

505
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,340
But I don't think it's the same.

506
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,740
Keep an eye on her.

507
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,140
It's a big night.

508
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,740
Don't let her get into trouble again.

509
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,940
Yes.

510
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,140
It's okay.

511
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,540
It's okay.

512
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,340
It's okay.

513
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
It's okay.

514
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
It's okay.

515
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,540
It's okay.

516
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,740
Mother, what's the matter?

517
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
It's okay.

518
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Bring me the change.

519
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,340
Okay.

520
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,940
It's not a rule.

521
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,740
It's not easy to ask the elders.

522
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
This is the daughter of Zhuang.

523
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Do I have to apologize to you?

524
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,940
You little girl.

525
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,540
How can you talk to the elders like that?

526
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,740
If you respect my mother,

527
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
I'll respect you as an elder.

528
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,740
If you don't respect my mother,

529
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
why would I respect you

530
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,340
for hiding things that are dangerous and poisonous?

531
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
You...

532
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
You...

533
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,740
You're so good at writing.

534
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,340
I heard that this Miss

535
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,940
grew up in the middle of the world.

536
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,740
She's a good girl.

537
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,940
This year, she has a rumor in her son's mind.

538
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,540
Her childhood friend

539
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,940
even bit her ears.

540
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,740
I'm a good girl.

541
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
If you dare to talk to me,

542
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,340
I'll bite your ears

543
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,940
and bite your mouth.

544
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
Look at you.

545
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,340
How dare a girl

546
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,340
ask for a marriage?

547
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,340
I can't even talk to you.

548
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
You're so funny.

549
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,940
My mother-in-law is very good at raising people.

550
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,140
My three sisters are very good at making things up.

551
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,740
I'm not that good at making things up.

552
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,340
If you don't respect me,

553
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,940
I have nothing to worry about.

554
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
You're the ones who are so good at making things up.

555
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,340
20 years ago,

556
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
you couldn't compare to the housekeeper.

557
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
20 years later,

558
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,140
you couldn't compare to the housewife.

559
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,740
You've done so much evil in your life.

560
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,340
You've made a living out of it.

561
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,140
You're all our subordinates.

562
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Ruan Xiwen,

563
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,140
how dare you insult me

564
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,940
and insult my master like this?

565
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,140
You're the one who's scolding me!

566
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,140
If Tan Daquan knew she had a wife like this,

567
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,940
he would have written the letter to your mother

568
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,540
and beat you up.

569
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,140
It's all right.

570
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,340
What right do you have to teach me?

571
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,940
You're the one who's yelling at me.

572
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,540
You're the one who's making me cry.

573
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,340
You're so capable.

574
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,740
Then stand up!

575
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,340
Stand up and hit me!

576
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,740
Stand up and scold me!

577
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
You should stand up!

578
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,340
You...

579
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,740
You dare to hit me?

580
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,140
You're the evil mother!

581
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,540
I'll fight you all out today!

582
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Go home!

583
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
Go home!

584
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,340
Uh...

585
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,840
Let me welcome His Majesty

586
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,040
and then I'll...

587
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:11,080
You let me

588
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,540
w

589
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,540
Oh we

590
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,120
Don't say up

591
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,940
Thank you.

592
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:39,760
I'm sorry to give you your

593
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Go and get the waking soup.

594
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Please drink it.

595
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

596
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Madam Tan, you should go and get the medical report.

597
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Yes.

598
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Madam Zhuang.

599
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
I'm here.

600
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Mother's behavior is not so good.

601
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,760
I'll take her to Her Highness's wedding.

602
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
You're Zhuang Hanye?

603
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
I am.

604
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Madam Zhuang, you're not strict with your daughter.

605
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
I asked her to kneel down and punish you.

606
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Is that meaningful?

607
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm not strict with you.

608
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Thank you for your understanding.

609
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,760
I thought that Noble Consort Miao would protect her.

610
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Back then, they were both ill and had double-dead fever.

611
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
They were only in the first place.

612
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
It's hard for them to make a comparison.

613
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
At that time, they were soft-hearted.

614
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
They kept on pushing Noble Consort Miao.

615
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Now, how can we let her go?

616
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,760
I wonder how you want to make a contribution to me.

617
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
I heard that every spring festival,

618
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,760
Noble Consort Miao will be out of the palace to visit.

619
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,760
She was also in the capital for the banquet.

620
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Tomorrow, she will be at the Lijiang Pavilion.

621
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I hope to see her again.

622
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Do you have a way?

623
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Why?

624
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,760
I want to persuade Mother to agree.

625
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Mother is very considerate.

626
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
She is also close to the Zhuang family.

627
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
She is always with her enemies.

628
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,760
I don't want her to live such a tough life.

629
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,760
And if there is a real evidence,

630
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Zhuang Shiyang will be the one to be with her.

631
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
You promised that you wouldn't hurt your family,

632
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
but it's not a full-fledged plan.

633
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
If you can let Mother and Zhuang family

634
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
completely break the relationship,

635
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
I will have no choice but to fight with you

636
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
to make a contribution to the family.

637
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
But even if you invite Noble Consort Miao,

638
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
what will you do?

639
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
The day before, Noble Consort Miao

640
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
gave her a gift of the jade pendant.

641
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,760
I heard from Mother that she and Noble Consort Miao

642
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
are friends for a long time.

643
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
I thought about it before,

644
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,760
if I can ask Mother to be my friend,

645
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
maybe I can.

646
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,760
It seems that even if I can't do anything about it,

647
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
I will have to do it for a lifetime.

648
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Is it possible that the enemy is not friends?

649
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
The years are changing.

650
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,760
You are different from before.

651
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Your Highness, you have been crazy about me since before.

652
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
You are still the same as before.

653
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Everyone says that the softest daughter is virtuous and virtuous.

654
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
But I know that

655
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,760
you are only a niece of the same kind.

656
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
I am a niece of the same kind.

657
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Even if you are a virtuous daughter,

658
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,760
you have never been a good person to anyone.

659
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Your Highness, you are not here.

660
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
I dare not.

661
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
You dare not?

662
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
I dare not.

663
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
I dare not.

664
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
But after I heard it,

665
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
you never gave up.

666
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Your Highness

667
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Your Highness

668
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Missobao

669
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,640
It must be very dull.

670
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,120
This is the discouraged

671
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,480
Woah !

672
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,220
Hey !

673
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,240
Hey !

674
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
You have almost disappeared.

675
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,480
Well,

676
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,320
Why so muchcraft work did you do?

677
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,360
You are so political.

678
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,520
Sorry, I reallywelt well.

679
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
I'm afraid to put it in my eyes.

680
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
You even smoked the incense?

681
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Why don't you think of it as a scent of herbs?

682
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,960
What strange tricks did you do?

683
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,320
Miss San.

684
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,800
How is it?

685
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Didn't you hear what they said?

686
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,800
Miss San, you should give me a little bit of fear.

687
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm afraid.

688
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I'm afraid.

689
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Stop.

690
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Give me the stick.

691
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Give me the stick.

692
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Give me the stick.

693
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Haiyan! Haiyan!

694
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I'm afraid.

695
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Haiyan!

696
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Haiyan!

697
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Haiyan!

698
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Why did you hit me?

699
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
I'm afraid.

700
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Haiyan!

701
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Haiyan!

702
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Give me the stick!

703
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Did you hit me?

704
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
No.

705
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Why don't you get up first?

706
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,800
You...

707
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
You're hurt on the back.

708
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
It's okay, Xiao Shang.

709
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
I didn't mean to hurt you.

710
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
It's okay.

711
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
What's this?

712
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,800
A handkerchief that has infected the grass.

713
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
The one just now?

714
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,800
It's Zhuang Yushan who put the handkerchief into the Linjiang Pavilion.

715
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,800
He once used the handkerchief as a bait to hurt my mother.

716
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,800
He was so young and he was so generous.

717
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
He really lost his mind.

718
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
My lord, Miss San.

719
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Noble Consort, you're ordered to return to the Linjiang Pavilion.

720
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,800
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
I'm sorry.
