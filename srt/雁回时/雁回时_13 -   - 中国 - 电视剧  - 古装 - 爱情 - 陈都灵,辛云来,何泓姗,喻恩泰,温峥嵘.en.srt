Mr. Fu, how quick of you
to confiscate my home.

58

It's the duty of the Judicial Review.

59
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,600
Please forgive me, Miss Hanyan.

60
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,630
My family is ruined.

61
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,240
I'm no longer a noble lady.

62
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,510
What are your plans next?

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
Fu Yunxi,

64
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't believe you knew nothing

65
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,680
about the recent changes.

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,800
You know something, right?

67
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,950
Things have come to this.

68
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,600
Does that still matter?

69
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,190
They have only been imprisoned.

70
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,570
They won't be executed
until the Wu hour tomorrow.

71
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,070
I have one more day.

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,630
What do you want to do?

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
I can't just stand idly by.

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
No matter what,

75
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,680
I must save my mother and the family.

76
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,680
I must go to the imperial prison
to see her.

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Even for a death-row prisoner,

78
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,720
family members are allowed to visit
before the execution.

79
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Don't forget.

80
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,430
Your name has been erased.

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,480
You are no longer their family member.

82
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
My Lord.

83
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,270
My Lord.

84
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,830
The Supervision is urging us.

85
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,350
Let's go.

86
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,600
- Where are you going?
- To the imperial prison.

87
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,750
Even if I let you in,

88
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,000
she won't see you again.

89
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,030
It'll only put you in danger again.

90
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,750
If I lost my family,

91
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,970
what else is there to hold on to
in this world?

92
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,430
If I can't save my mother,

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,040
I'll have no face to live alone.

94
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,950
If you have nowhere to go,

95
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,430
my family is willing
to offer you shelter.

96
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,190
Thank you for your kindness,

97
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,560
but you don't understand

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,000
how it feels to live under others' roof.

99
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,920
I never want

100
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,160
to live that way again.

101
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,070
My Lord.

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,070
When Zhuang Shiyang
was signing his confession,

103
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,910
he changed his mind

104
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,440
and requested to see someone.

105
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Who?

106
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,270
Zhuang Hanyan.

107
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,620
(Imperial Prison)
Officers.

108
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,240
Officers, please show mercy.

109
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,630
Please show mercy.

110
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,360
My family is in ruin.

111
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,070
I have only one daughter outside
who was adopted by others.

112
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
Please let me meet her

113
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,040
so I can tell her

114
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,420
my funeral arrangements
after the execution.

115
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,800
Hanyan...

116
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
Hanyan, Hanyan.

117
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,000
- Father.
- You're finally here.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,190
- Father.
- If you have anything to say,

119
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,510
say it now.

120
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,480
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

121
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,630
Could you let us talk privately

122
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,680
for a moment?

123
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,000
This is against the rules.

124
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,200
Please forgive me.

125
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,750
Father, why is there a secret passage?

126
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,510
Are you involved with the Pei faction?

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,430
Is that adopted son really you?

128
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
You can't say that.

129
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
I had no choice.

130
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,000
Pei Dafu was powerful back then.

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Even the Yama King trembles at his name.

132
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,100
I'm just a Junior Compiler
at the Hanlin Academy,

133
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,190
with no power or influence.

134
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,600
To protect our family,

135
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
sometimes I had no choice.

136
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
So,

137
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,790
that secret passage...

138
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,320
In short,

139
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,960
we are hanging by a thread.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,240
Only you can save

141
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
our entire family.

142
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,080
Even in the direst straits,
there is hope.

143
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,510
Even when all seems lost,
a path may yet appear.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,960
I believe in you. You will find a way.

145
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
This is...

146
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,100
Now that the decree of guilt
has been issued,

147
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,000
and someone is eager
to destroy our family,

148
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,200
even if we have proof of our innocence,

149
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,600
we cannot reveal it easily.

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,870
I fear they will ruin it in the shadows.

151
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,320
Then what should I do?

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
Remember:

153
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,720
A grudge is done by its perpetrator.

154
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,320
The sins of the future
should not implicate the past,

155
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,820
just as the mistakes of the past

156
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,270
should not implicate the future.

157
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,360
Our entire family's lives

158
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,030
are in your hands now.

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
Mr. Zhuang,

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,510
you begged to see your daughter,

161
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,750
saying you wished
to arrange your funeral.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,780
(Imperial Prison)

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
(House agent...)

166
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,750
(The residence?)

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,630
(A house agent?)

168
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,510
The Zhuangs' residence

169
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,360
was indeed purchased through me,

170
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,030
but that was two or three years ago.

171
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,840
Not every transaction

172
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,030
is recorded in my ledger.

173
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,240
So,

174
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,920
the residence was not newly built

175
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,600
but bought from someone else?

176
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
That's correct.

177
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Miss,

178
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,100
who are you?

179
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,520
Why do you ask about this?

180
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,580
Have you found the records?

181
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,270
My business is legitimate.

182
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,530
I can't afford to offend any noble.

183
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,720
You should leave. Leave now.

184
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,130
You...

185
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,550
What are you doing?

186
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,630
Ma'am, these are for you.

187
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,350
I just want a truthful answer from you.

188
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,080
The previous owner

189
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,360
of the residence was a Duke.

190
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,640
Why are you asking about him?

191
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,510
A Duke?

192
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,120
Duke Shunping, Wu Youzhi.

193
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,080
The sins of the future
should not implicate the past,

194
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,550
just as the mistakes of the past
should not implicate the future.

195
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,190
(Is Father implying)

196
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,540
(that the secret passage was dug
by the previous owner,)

197
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,640
(Wu Youzhi?)

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Ma'am,

199
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,480
do you know the origin of Duke Shunping?

200
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,820
He seems to be

201
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,790
from Yinan.

202
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,270
This man's identity is mysterious.

203
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,840
He is over 40

204
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,720
and is an official
from Yinan in the Capital.

205
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,150
(He's over 40 from Yinan.)

206
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,120
(He matches the description
of Pei's adopted son.)

207
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,730
(Whether he is the adopted son or not,)

208
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,150
(if I can find him,)

209
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,420
(maybe everything can be turned around.)

210
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,200
Miss, I advise you

211
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,670
not to get involved with Duke Shunping.

212
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Why?

213
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,590
As a Duke, he doesn't carry
the imperial surname

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,750
and has no real power,

215
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,080
but he is still
an imperial family member.

216
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,720
Besides, he's notorious

217
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,390
for being a villain.

218
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,560
It's said that after he
left a while ago,

219
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,150
he disappeared.

220
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,240
He's missing?

221
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,870
That's right.

222
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,790
I suspect

223
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,270
he must have

224
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,550
encountered an enemy

225
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,120
and was captured.

226
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,200
Now, his mansion is left

227
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,700
with only the Duchess in charge.

228
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,990
Ma'am,

229
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,630
you just mentioned

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,520
you are in the servant business, right?

231
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,570
Do you want to buy servants

232
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,510
or sell servants?

233
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
I want to sell.

234
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,390
Who?

235
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,590
Me.

236
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,540
(Ms. Pan, Duchess Shunping)

237
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,350
Duchess, be careful.

238
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,750
Clumsy girl.

239
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,180
Don't touch me.

240
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,710
Duchess, please forgive me.

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,510
Is this the first time I met you?

242
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,000
You look so unfamiliar.

243
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,390
I'm Yan,

244
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,840
a new maid in the mansion today.

245
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,720
It's your first day,

246
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,870
yet you're assigned
to the inner chambers?

247
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,320
Who arranged this?

248
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,670
It was arranged by the Duke.

249
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,870
The Duke?

250
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,470
Where is the Duke?

251
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,330
What nonsense are you saying?

252
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,650
Who said the Duke has returned?

253
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,360
Why are you so frightened, Duchess?

254
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,960
What are you afraid of?

255
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,790
Who are you?

256
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,510
You are our Duchess,

257
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,320
but you have

258
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,510
many old injuries on your body.

259
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,080
Did the Duke treat you badly?

260
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,510
Why are you so shocked?

261
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,470
You seem to be sure
that the Duke won't return.

262
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you secretly kill him

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,240
and lie about his disappearance?

264
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
What nonsense

265
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,960
are you talking about here?

266
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,150
My uncle has been missing for days,

267
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,480
yet you're at home playing the qin.

268
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,550
How elegant of you.

269
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Uncle?

270
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,510
Our family has long suspected you
of scheming against us.

271
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,840
Aunt, it's time to tell the truth,

272
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,270
or we'll go to the Palace
and ask for justice.

273
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,870
Let's go then.

274
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,000
I have nothing to fear.

275
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,600
After I married the Duke,

276
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,440
there was some warmth
for the first two years,

277
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,000
but in the third year,

278
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,910
he turned into a monster,

279
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,200
trapping me in this remote chamber,

280
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,630
and making me live a life of widowhood.

281
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,510
I wish he were dead.

282
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,240
If he died,

283
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,480
no one would beat or humiliate me.

284
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,320
I could even go to the village

285
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,030
and marry a peasant,

286
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,510
which would be better
than enduring this suffering.

287
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,080
So,

288
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
you truly don't know where he is?

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,720
I wanted to save him some dignity

290
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,600
and keep this secret,

291
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,270
but you've bothered me again and again.

292
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,480
Why not go to Hongliu House?

293
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,030
Go ask that courtesan.

294
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,870
That woman

295
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,000
is Wu Youzhi's wife.

296
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,240
She's the daughter-in-law

297
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,080
of your family.

298
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,150
Hongliu House.

299
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,860
(Deed for Courtesan)

300
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,030
I spent a lot of money

301
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,340
to buy this deed from the bawd.

302
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,180
(Man'er)

303
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,200
Answer my question first.

304
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,550
The Duke was
one of my regular customers.

305
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,590
That night, he stayed in Hongliu House

306
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,120
but left early the next morning,

307
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,120
and then I heard he disappeared.

308
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,550
I really don't know where he is now.

309
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,120
That night, when he met with you,

310
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,840
did he mention anything?

311
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,600
Is there anything unusual?

312
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,720
If you don't tell me,

313
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,720
I'll tear up this deed,

314
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,480
and you'll become a nameless,

315
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,840
homeless wanderer.

316
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,680
No, no, no.

317
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,920
Alright.

318
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,200
Since you've paid for my freedom,

319
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,480
I don't have to work
in this business anymore.

320
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,310
I'll tell you everything.

321
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,350
The Duke

322
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,030
was indeed strange.

323
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,510
How so?

324
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,110
When I first met him,

325
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,240
he was drunk.

326
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,620
When I went to undress him,

327
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,210
he scolded me angrily.

328
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,830
Later, though he often visited me,

329
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,510
he only drank and slept,

330
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,400
never sleeping with me.

331
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,480
He told me not to mention this
to anyone.

332
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,160
I guessed long ago.

333
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,690
I heard he didn't get along
with the Duchess.

334
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,680
It must be because he suffers

335
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,880
from kidney problems and impotence.

336
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,590
There was some warmth
for the first two years,

337
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,510
but in the third year,

338
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,880
he turned into a monster,

339
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,920
trapping me in this remote chamber,

340
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,270
and making me live a life of widowhood.

341
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,560
(It's said that the Pei faction members
who were captured)

342
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,260
(were all forced to undergo castration.)

343
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,480
(Could it be...)

344
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,240
(Three years ago, the residence
was the Duke's villa.)

345
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,350
(If he is a Pei faction member
who has been castrated,)

346
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
(and if I can find him)

347
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,390
(and confirm his identity,)

348
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,770
(I can prove that the secret passage
was dug by him)

349
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,640
(and save the entire family.)

350
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,270
You're more considerate

351
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,720
than those officials
in the Judicial Review.

352
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,590
The Judicial Review?

353
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,960
Yes.

354
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,450
The day before the Duke went missing,

355
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,920
an official from the Judicial Review

356
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,230
questioned me in Hongliu House.

357
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,980
He was quite handsome

358
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,160
but had a cold, unapproachable face.

359
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,790
Do you know his name?

360
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,440
I remember his surname was...

361
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,320
Fu.

362
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,910
Mr Lord,

363
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,310
after Miss Hanyan
left the Imperial Prison,

364
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,070
she first went to find a house agent,

365
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,770
then disguised herself as a maid,

366
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,190
and went to Duke Shunping's Mansion.

367
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,920
She even bought Man'er's freedom

368
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,760
from Hongliu House.

369
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,310
In just a few hours,

370
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,200
she was able to follow
the trail so quickly.

371
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,480
Based on Zhuang Shiyang's words,

372
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,610
does he want to use Duke Shunping
to upend the case?

373
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,700
A grudge is done by its perpetrator.

374
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,310
The sins of the future
should not implicate the past,

375
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,880
just as the mistakes of the past
should not implicate the future.

376
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,480
It seems that Zhuang Shiyang is implying

377
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,830
that Zhuang Hanyan should find
the house's previous owner

378
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,960
and place the blame
for the secret passage on him.

379
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,510
If Zhuang Hanyan
can really pull this off,

380
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,440
whether it's true or not,

381
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,030
it will clear
the Zhuang family of guilt.

382
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,080
But, My Lord,

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,510
Wu Youzhi, Duke Shunping...

384
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,960
Let's wait.

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,550
After visiting Hongliu House,

386
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,090
I fear she'll come here

387
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,830
to accuse me.

388
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,880
My Lord, Miss Hanyan has come to visit.

389
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,920
She arrived quite quickly.

390
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,510
This plum blossom is so beautiful.

391
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,440
I want this one.

392
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,880
It's a pity that the seals in the shop

393
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,030
are all floral designs.

394
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,680
There aren't any better designs.

395
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,000
What other designs are there?

396
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,960
For example,

397
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,590
the kylin divine beast carved

398
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,960
on your father's badge.

399
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,350
It would look even better as a seal.

400
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,800
Lingzhi.

401
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,920
Father.

402
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,750
Father, look at my huadian
from Aunt Hanyan.

403
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,680
Is it beautiful?

404
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,520
Yes.

405
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,200
(Vice Minister)

406
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,590
Aunt Hanyan,

407
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,480
there's a kylin on my father's badge.

408
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,590
Father,

409
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,880
can I borrow your badge for a while?

410
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,070
Father.

411
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,670
Sure.

412
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,280
Here you go.

413
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,750
What brings you to see me today?

414
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,720
Mr. Fu, you said today

415
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,310
that if I couldn't find a place to stay,

416
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,400
I could always stay here.

417
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
Have you gone back on your word?

418
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,510
Are you serious?

419
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,000
It seems you were

420
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,550
just being polite.

421
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,480
Why give up now?

422
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,070
I've just come to terms with reality.

423
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,400
If I'm not the lineal daughter
of my father,

424
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,640
I won't even have a meal today,

425
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,920
let alone save my family.

426
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,920
Mr. Fu, if you were just teasing me,

427
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,750
sorry for the offense.

428
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,110
I will take my leave now.

429
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,800
Wait.

430
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,830
My Lord, what do you need?

431
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,920
If you need a place to stay,

432
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,510
I will arrange it for you.

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,030
Won't you ask
your mother's opinion first?

434
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,590
I can decide this.

435
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,920
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

436
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,240
Can you prepare some food for me?

437
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,510
I haven't eaten all day.

438
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm so hungry that my legs feel weak.

439
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,280
Alright.

440
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,160
Please wait in the dining hall
for a moment.

441
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,110
Stop her.

442
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,160
Miss Hanyan, forgive me.

443
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,130
Sorry for being clumsy.

444
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,550
Mr. Fu, what do you need?

445
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,720
Are you going to see Lingzhi

446
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,960
to play with her new seal?

447
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,680
Mr. Fu, sorry about this.

448
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,960
This is my second time here,

449
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,540
so I'm not familiar with the direction.

450
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,910
It's okay.

451
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,320
This way, please.

452
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
My Lord,

453
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,840
do you trust her?

454
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,150
No.

455
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,790
With her current actions,

456
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,030
is she trying to steal your badge?

457
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,040
Go check.

458
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,060
(Vice Minister)

459
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,270
My Lord, is there any problem?

460
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,520
No.

461
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,830
I'm familiar with my badge.

462
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,840
Nanny.

463
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,110
Miss Hanyan has come to ask to stay.

464
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,310
Go prepare some food for her.

465
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,440
Prepare a room as well.

466
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,070
Remember: Don't treat her poorly.

467
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,680
I saw Miss Hanyan

468
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,830
leave through the backyard in a rush.

469
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,480
She left?

470
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,830
Mu Yan, did you bring the badge?

471
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,800
Of course.

472
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,440
My Lord, I...

473
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,110
Stop her.

474
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,820
How clever of her
to distract us this way.

475
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
We've both been tricked.

476
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,860
(Court of Judicial Review)

477
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,910
Mu Feng.

478
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,870
Miss Hanyan.

479
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,140
Fu Yunxi is in trouble.

480
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,250
Mu Yan has gone to save him.

481
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,720
He asked me to come here to find you.

482
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,510
What? What happened?

483
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,720
It's the Zuohang Gang.

484
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,400
They seemed

485
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,310
to have mentioned
someone named Wu Youzhi,

486
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,610
but it was too urgent for me
to catch all the details.

487
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,790
Anyway, they're searching for Wu Youzhi,

488
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,780
pressuring Fu Yunxi
to take them to find him.

489
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,750
How did you end up together?

490
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,550
Mu Yan gave me this and told me

491
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,200
(Reviewer)
to give it to you

492
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,310
so you would believe me.

493
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,190
Wait.

494
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,510
I'll go with you.

495
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,320
Get on the horse.

496
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:20,740
(Court of Judicial Review)

497
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,750
Did Miss Hanyan come here?

498
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,600
My Lord,

499
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,270
I don't recognize who Miss Hanyan is,

500
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,920
but a woman came earlier.

501
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,830
She told Mr. Mu Feng something,

502
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,270
and they rode north in a panic.

503
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,840
- Let's go.
- Yes.

504
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,350
Where are we going?

505
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,790
To find Wu Youzhi.

506
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,750
Who is he? Also a Pei remnant?

507
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,870
Yes.

508
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,880
Why would he be with Fu Yunxi?

509
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,920
This is complicated.

510
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,640
Mr. Fu can tell you himself.

511
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Mr. Fu?

512
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,560
Yan?

513
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
Mr. Fu?

514
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
Is Wu Youzhi being held here?

515
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,910
Where's Mr. Fu?

516
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,040
Where's my brother?

517
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,640
Where are they?

518
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,890
Did they trick
the Zuohang Gang's remnants

519
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,750
into another place?

520
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,920
Miss Hanyan,

521
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,830
what does this mean?

522
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,210
Please give me an explanation.

523
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,750
Where is Wu Youzhi? I want to see him.

524
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,160
Put down the saber.

525
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,680
Zhuang Hanyan,

526
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,720
I underestimated you after all.

527
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,830
Fu Yunxi, it's I who underestimated you.

528
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,550
You say I lie through my teeth,

529
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,120
but how many truthful words
have you said to me?

530
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,870
Where is Wu Youzhi?

531
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,070
Why are you hiding him here?

532
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,480
You two stay outside the room.

533
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

534
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,080
Stop searching.

535
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,720
Wu Youzhi is not in the room,

536
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,510
and there's no weapon here
for you to use.

537
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
Sit.

538
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,830
What did Zhuang Shiyang

539
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,270
tell you in the imperial prison?

540
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,400
Weren't you there as well?

541
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,480
You can hear all the news
across the nation,

542
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,550
but you can't understand
a prisoner's last words?

543
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,590
A house agent, a Duke's house,
and a brothel.

544
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,310
How dare you steal
the Judicial Review's badge?

545
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,030
You risked your life
to find Duke Shunping

546
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,720
just because of your father's words?

547
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,110
You followed me?

548
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,200
A goose always leaves traces.

549
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,560
Yes.

550
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,960
So, the things you do

551
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,590
are not without traces either.

552
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,720
They say businessmen avoid politics.

553
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,920
Why did the head of the DCC
travel from afar

554
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,640
to the Capital to testify?

555
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,370
He's long been oppressed by Pei Dafu.

556
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,840
Now that the Pei faction has fallen,

557
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
he wants to clear his ties.

558
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,360
What a coincidence.

559
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,030
The Pei faction has long fallen,

560
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,920
but he hasn't made a move.

561
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,250
After you visited Danzhou,

562
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,130
he suddenly volunteered to testify
against Pei's adopted son.

563
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,070
Can you say you've never seen him
in Danzhou?

564
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,500
What if I have?

565
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,160
Then you must've instructed him

566
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,400
to come to the Capital.

567
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,510
That's only a possibility.

568
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,070
When you lived in Yuzhu Manor
of Zhuang Residence,

569
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,310
I had already guessed

570
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,000
that you went to Danzhou

571
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,350
to investigate
whether Pei Dafu's adopted son's wealth

572
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,510
was connected to Danzhou merchants.

573
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,590
Now it seems

574
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,070
that you found the head of the DCC

575
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,030
got his testimony,

576
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,070
and knew the adopted son
appeared two years ago.

577
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,920
Is that right?

578
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,510
Knowing the head of the DCC's testimony
wasn't enough,

579
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,440
you decided to hold off.

580
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,780
Later, you forced me to eavesdrop
at Jianjia Chamber

581
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,440
and learned that my mother
held crucial evidence

582
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,610
that could prove my father
was Pei Dafu's adopted son.

583
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,470
That's when you ordered the head
to come to the Capital,

584
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,830
asking him to seek out Yuwen Chang'an
for testimony

585
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,680
to lure my mother into making a move.

586
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,110
So, when we were trapped
in the guild hall,

587
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,720
you weren't anxious at all.

588
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,280
So,

589
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,300
you could predict that something serious

590
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,480
was about to happen

591
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,440
and send your family out of the Capital
in advance for safety.

592
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,260
Have I said anything wrong?

593
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,920
The crisis befalling the Zhuang family

594
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,480
seems to be a plot by my mother
and Yuwen Chang'an,

595
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,000
but in reality,

596
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,510
you manipulated everything.

597
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,240
You are

598
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,440
the real mastermind behind this.

599
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,880
Why would I do that?

600
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,160
I heard on New Year's Eve

601
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,750
that the Emperor summoned you

602
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,200
and ordered you to find the adopted son
within 30 days.

603
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,310
This case stirred up a great uproar.

604
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
If there is no progress after 30 days,

605
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,240
the Emperor would lose face,

606
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,000
and you

607
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,160
would lose your life.

608
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,160
Miss Hanyan, you're indeed clever.

609
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,310
You've figured out the truth

610
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,510
based on a little trace.

611
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,920
If you trace back from the result,

612
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,400
though it's quite twisted,

613
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,590
it's not hard to figure out.

614
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,310
So what if you've guessed the truth?

615
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,200
Though Zhuang Shiyang was vague,

616
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,680
claiming he had many hardships,

617
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,200
he admitted that he was

618
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,720
Pei Dafu's adopted son.

619
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,160
Now, the real culprit is in custody.

620
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,920
No matter what means I used,

621
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,680
I did not wrong him in the least.

622
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,240
Even if he is Pei Dafu's adopted son

623
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,200
and committed heinous crimes,

624
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,240
why should my mother
have to die with him?

625
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,590
She is innocent.

626
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,920
But isn't this

627
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,440
what she wanted?

628
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,440
If I tell you where Wu Youzhi is,

629
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,400
will you truly save Zhuang Shiyang

630
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,550
and let all her years
of plotting go to waste?

631
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,720
I want to save her.

632
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,000
Of course, I want to save her.

633
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,510
I've lived for 17 years,

634
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,440
but I only know today

635
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,920
what it feels like
to be protected by my mother.

636
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,230
In this lifetime,

637
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,920
I've finally found my mother,

638
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,480
but tomorrow I will lose everything.

639
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,000
No matter whether she has a grudge,

640
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,100
no matter what kind
of grudge it is,

641
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,500
and no matter why this grudge started,

642
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I will help her get revenge
in the future.

643
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,780
But she absolutely
can't be executed unjustly

644
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,180
with the entire family.

645
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,500
So,

646
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,700
where is Wu Youzhi?

647
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,100
He's already dead.

648
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,460
His body is buried

649
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,640
in the clearing at the center
of the bamboo forest outside.

650
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,540
It doesn't matter.

651
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,500
It doesn't matter if he is dead or not.

652
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,700
In this cold weather,

653
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,180
as long as the body hasn't decayed,

654
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,220
it's enough to prove he was castrated.

655
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,780
It's a sleeping drug.

656
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,580
Sleep tight.

657
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,100
Don't make any more trouble.

658
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,340
Fu Yunxi,

659
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,820
I beg you

660
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,620
to spare me.

661
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,860
Zhuang Hanyan,

662
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,340
I should be the one begging you

663
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,380
to spare me.

664
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,020
There's something

665
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,700
you guessed wrong.

666
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,820
I didn't intentionally hide Wu Youzhi.

667
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,980
He was a Pei faction member,

668
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,580
and he was a hard bone to crack.

669
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,100
A month ago,

670
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,740
I brought him to the Judicial Review
for torture,

671
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,180
but he couldn't even survive
the first round of interrogation

672
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,340
and died on the spot.

673
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,580
Even if his death was well deserved,

674
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
I couldn't explain

675
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,740
whether it was because of his frailty

676
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,980
or my torture.

677
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,860
Though he was just a Duke

678
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,620
without an imperial surname,

679
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,340
he was still an imperial relative.

680
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,220
If you take his body to upend the case,

681
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,640
I'll bear the blame for it.

682
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,220
Zhuang Hanyan,

683
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,020
since you entered the Capital,

684
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,220
I've treated you kindly.

685
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,500
Have you made up your mind

686
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,460
about exchanging my life

687
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,700
for the survival of the Zhuang family?

688
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,460
Fu Yunxi,

689
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,300
you don't need to use sweet words.

690
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,540
When you decided to set a trap

691
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,260
and use my mother

692
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,660
against my entire family,

693
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,540
did you ever think about me?

694
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,780
In the end,

695
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,700
we are both selfish.

696
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,060
Don't worry.

697
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,580
If you die because of this case,

698
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,840
I will make offerings to you

699
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,820

Am I wrong about this?

748
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,980
For public duties,

749
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,200
if Zhuang Shiyang was
Pei Dafu's adopted son,

750
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,980
you just used indirect methods

751
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,700
to bring the true culprit to justice.

752
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,900
What about personal matters?

753
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,280
Miss Hanyan is protecting
her mother and family,

754
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,620
but you also have
your family to protect.

755
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,420
Besides, Wu Youzhi's ancestors

756
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,140
once supported an Emperor.

757
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,700
Are you going to let Miss Hanyan

758
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,780
take the body away?

759
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,260
When Judicial Review

760
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,580
investigates his cause of death,

761
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,620
you'll bear the responsibility for it.

762
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,420
It won't be a capital offense.

763
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,940
I can still investigate the case,

764
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,860
but her mother

765
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,580
may be the last warmth

766
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,020
she has in this world.

767
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,060
Let her go.

768
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,820
(Law of Heaven, Fair and Impartial)

769
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,720
They'll be beheaded
right after the arrest yesterday?

770
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,980
The Judicial Review

771
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,060
has never been so hasty.

772
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,900
Indeed.

773
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,140
I heard an official from the Supervision

774
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,420
used the Imperial Sword

775
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,540
to execute before report.

776
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,140
Is this a dead man?

777
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,180
Isn't this Miss Zhuang Hanyan?

778
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,940
I heard the Zhuangs
would be executed today.

779
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,460
The Wu hour is near. Let's go and see.

780
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,300
Let's go.

781
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,180
The Wu hour has arrived.

782
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,980
Prepare for the execution.

783
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,260
I have a grievance to report.

784
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,900
What grievance do you have?

785
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,220
(Law of Heaven, Fair and Impartial)
My family's execution today

786
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,020
is because there's a secret passage
in our house

787
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,580
leading to Pei Dafu's residence.

788
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,300
I purchased this house three years ago

789
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,420
from Duke Shunping.

790
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,660
He dug the secret passage.

791
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,940
It has nothing to do with my family.

792
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,300
Today, if the innocent are killed,

793
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,540
the heavens won't tolerate it.

794
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,380
- The heavens can't tolerate it.
- It's too unfair.

795
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,660
Let's see how it'll be handled.

796
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,500
Yes.

797
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,220
Zhuang Shiyang,

798
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,180
there's solid evidence for this case.

799
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,020
Besides, Duke Shunping
has been missing for days.

800
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,420
The so-called grievance you speak of

801
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,780
can't be verified.

802
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,180
You should

803
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,300
accept your fate.

804
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,660
Executioners, get ready.

805
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,820
(Order)

806
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,380
Execute immediately.

807
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,580
