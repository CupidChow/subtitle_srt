I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I SWEAR

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,960
Why are you so millisecondic?

46
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,480
We're waiting.

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,220
We're waiting.

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,720
We just need another 50.

49
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,560
50.

50
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,640
Prevails.

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,860
Prevails.

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,760
Prevails.

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,440
Don't meot.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,040
Sheerererii,ヂ-.

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,860
What's wrong with you?

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,260
It's great, okay.

57
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,600
Young master.

58
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,660
The wet room.

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,540
воспisit엌

60
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,000
It's sooo cry,

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's sad.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,080
It's great.

63
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
It's great.

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,360
It's so great.

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
Go on the ride,

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,960
Let's cycle.

67
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,460
Let's.

68
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,980
Let's.

69
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,060
Let's go back.

70
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,940
It's so bad here.

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,380
We here today

72
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,380
I will have to make a big deal of fun.

73
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Pusa blesses you.

74
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,380
You have saved my life.

75
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,380
If you can't get into the world again,

76
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
then we won't be able to.

77
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,380
As long as you can live well,

78
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,380
that's a blessing.

79
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,380
If he can't get into this kind of trouble,

80
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,380
not only will he try to get back to his original state,

81
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,380
I will also be suspicious.

82
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,380
If he can't get into this kind of situation,

83
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,380
then I will be in the capital city for a long time.

84
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,380
How can I be so humble?

85
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,380
You are so mean.

86
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
Mother.

87
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,380
Shi'er.

88
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,380
I am here.

89
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,380
I have suffered a lot.

90
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,380
Everything is over.

91
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,380
Father and I have already taken you home.

92
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,380
Where is Second Sister?

93
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,380
Second Sister is in the Hall of the Four Seasons.

94
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Don't worry about her.

95
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,380
Father.

96
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
I am the second master.

97
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
It's Zhuang Hanye.

98
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
Hanye?

99
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,380
Sister Qian.

100
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,380
I was kidnapped in the Dalai Lama.

101
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,380
I was killed for a long time.

102
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
It's Zhuang Hanye.

103
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,380
He framed me.

104
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,380
He secretly switched He Wenshen's Wenzhang.

105
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,380
Why did you take such a deep breath and framed me?

106
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,380
You still dare to come?

107
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
I am heartless.

108
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
Why don't you dare to come?

109
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,380
Shi'er.

110
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,380
Why are you so heartless?

111
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,380
How dare you take away your Third Sister?

112
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,380
I took Second Sister and Wenzhang with me that day.

113
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,380
I didn't want to go back to the capital city.

114
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,380
That night,

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,380
you came to my room.

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Hanye.

117
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,380
You really went there.

118
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,380
Young Master.

119
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,380
Third Sister wants to see you.

120
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,380
What are you doing here?

121
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,380
Fourth Brother is the only man in the Manor.

122
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,380
He comes here every day to warm up his body.

123
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Don't tire yourself out.

124
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
This is the cake I made myself.

125
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,380
It's very tasty when you are busy with your work.

126
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,380
Hurry up.

127
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Don't make me worry.

128
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,380
I did come to the Manor that night.

129
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,380
I also gave you cakes and a secret door.

130
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,380
You even let me step in the door.

131
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,380
I have a magic tool to replace you.

132
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,380
If not, I will be punished.

133
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,380
You liar.

134
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
If you don't believe me,

135
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,380
you can ask the Young Master of the Manor to come and ask.

136
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
Father.

137
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
Father.

138
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
Don't believe his lies.

139
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,380
That day, at the tea house,

140
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,380
I was drunk and was confused.

141
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,380
I took out the wine from the wine bottle.

142
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,380
You were also drunk at the time.

143
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
You must have been the one who set this up.

144
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
Father.

145
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,380
That day, I went to the tea house.

146
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,380
My husband asked me to have tea.

147
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
He can testify this.

148
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,380
The boss of the bar can testify more.

149
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,380
Nonsense.

150
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,380
Since Fourth Brother mentioned this,

151
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,380
I don't need to cover it up for you.

152
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,380
That day, the wine was so bitter.

153
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,380
You were so loud that you were shouting at me.

154
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,380
You were shouting at me in the middle of the night.

155
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,380
You were so loud that you were shouting at me.

156
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,380
Even...

157
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,380
Even you said that you would marry me and have me married to you.

158
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
You told us to go to the Yuan House at night.

159
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,380
You made a big fuss.

160
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,380
Do you still remember this?

161
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,380
I wanted to report it to Father.

162
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,380
But I was afraid that I would disturb him.

163
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,380
I was afraid that Fourth Brother would go home and be punished.

164
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,380
You still want to use this to make a mess with me?

165
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Are you really going to do this?

166
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Father.

167
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
His father can do it.

168
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,380
But he will do it for me.

169
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,380
He will do it for my father.

170
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,380
You must believe me.

171
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,380
Yes, I know.

172
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,380
Because I went back to my home and married Fourth Brother.

173
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
You loved me and hated me.

174
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,380
I have recognized you.

175
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,380
You have always been a great man.

176
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,380
But you shouldn't have done it in the scientific field.

177
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,380
This is not my father's idea.

178
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,380
This is not my father's idea.

179
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Fourth Brother is so generous.

180
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,380
He didn't just go back to his home.

181
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
He even made a mess with the Zhuang family.

182
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
You still don't know how to change it.

183
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,380
You even want to push this crime against others.

184
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,380
You are really ashamed of your father.

185
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,380
You are even ashamed of your family.

186
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,380
You want to kill me?

187
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
Father.

188
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,380
Stop it.

189
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
Father.

190
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,380
Tell me the truth.

191
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,380
Tell me the truth.

192
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,380
How did you come out of this?

193
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
Don't touch me.

194
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
Father.

195
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
I am confused.

196
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,380
I dare to say that I am confused.

197
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,380
How did I make you marry me?

198
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,380
You are so stubborn.

199
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
Father.

200
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Father.

201
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
You don't wait for me.

202
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
Because I always live for you.

203
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
I am your son.

204
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
I am the only purple angel in the world.

205
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
You are so stubborn.

206
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380
Since you don't want me,

207
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,380
I will leave.

208
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
I will leave.

209
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
Go.

210
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,380
Chi'er.

211
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,380
Chi'er.

212
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,380
Chi'er.

213
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Call the doctor.

214
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Call the doctor.

215
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
It's over.

216
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
We are so stubborn.

217
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Chi'er.

218
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
Wake up.

219
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
You guys are so stubborn.

220
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
You are so stubborn.

221
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
You are so stubborn.

222
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,380
Ye Shiyang.

223
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
Don't get angry.

224
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
You are so stubborn.

225
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Why are you so careless?

226
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,380
I am just a little bit hurt.

227
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,380
I never thought that I would harm her.

228
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,380
I never thought that I would make a fuss about the princess.

229
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
But you didn't see her face.

230
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,380
You knew that you were against me

231
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
and you came to force me.

232
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,380
You said that if you come to the world to take care of Zhuang Fu,

233
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,380
the first thing is to kick me out of Zhuang Fu.

234
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Since then,

235
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
you and this aunt

236
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
have been so stubborn.

237
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,380
I never thought that

238
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,380
I would make a fuss about the princess.

239
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,380
But it's time.

240
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Miss Xiang,

241
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,380
finally you are here.

242
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
You are here.

243
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
Do you have any feelings for me?

244
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,380
You are so stubborn.

245
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,380
Since you are so stubborn,

246
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,380
I will take it as a gift.

247
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
Please.

248
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,380
Why did you come to the Yuzhu Palace without my permission?

249
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,380
Master ordered that

250
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
he would send your second sister

251
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,380
and your fourth brother to the outside of the city.

252
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,380
He also said that

253
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,380
he would not come back next year.

254
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
The outside of the city is quiet.

255
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,380
Fourth brother is really good at keeping his health.

256
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Miss Xiang,

257
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,380
I have come to the world

258
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
to take care of you.

259
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
You must hate me.

260
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,380
I was wrong.

261
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,380
How could I dare to say that?

262
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,380
Besides, since you are the eldest,

263
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
we have been living in the palace

264
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,380
and we are in a good mood.

265
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,380
Everyone in the capital is talking about it.

266
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,380
This is all because of you.

267
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,380
Why do you have to say these beautiful things now?

268
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
I am afraid that

269
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,380
you will be in the hands of the third lady

270
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,380
after the ceremony.

271
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Aunt Zhou,

272
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,380
I hate you

273
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
not because you are wrong.

274
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
I was in the palace for the first time.

275
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,380
You were trying to trick me.

276
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
In order to drive me out of the house,

277
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,380
you secretly came to the Heaven Realm

278
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
to avoid the danger.

279
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Even when I went to the Qiu Meiyuan,

280
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,380
you were trying to make me

281
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,380
pay for my money.

282
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,380
You forgot everything

283
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
in one go.

284
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
But, Miss Xiang,

285
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
you are so stubborn.

286
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,380
You always can win in the game.

287
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,380
I didn't have any advantage.

288
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
But there is one more thing.

289
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,380
I have no advantage.

290
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
What?

291
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
17 years ago,

292
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
I was just a child of the stronghold

293
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,380
but I was taken by the evil spirit.

294
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
Even the death of my grandfather

295
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
was to be saved by me.

296
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,380
I was sent to Danzhou

297
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,380
and separated from my mother for many years.

298
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,380
It was all because of you.

299
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,380
I only went back to the capital.

300
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,380
First,

301
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
I wanted to find a family.

302
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
Second,

303
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
I wanted to avenge my father.

304
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380
Miss Xiang,

305
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,380
I was so sorry for you

306
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
when I came back.

307
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,380
You never hated him.

308
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
Never.

309
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,380
I don't believe you.

310
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Of course you don't.

311
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,380
Otherwise,

312
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
you wouldn't have raised

313
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,380
the second brother

314
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
and the fourth brother.

315
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,380
You're such a lucky teller.

316
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,380
God.

317
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,380
Jiu Yi,

318
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,380
you're smart,

319
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
but you did something to make troubles.

320
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
To protect your kid,

321
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,900
you put all the evening troubles

322
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,380
on your own.

323
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,380
You have to wait after yourself.

324
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,380
But could you

325
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,380
protect them forever and for the rest of their life?

326
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,020
and the son of the crown prince.

327
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,260
If you

328
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,660
turn the child into a fool

329
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,420
who doesn't watch the chicken,

330
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,420
how should they

331
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,420
beg for life?

332
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,100
Miss San,

333
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,780
the master treats you so harshly.

334
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,660
Then you should thank him.

335
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,380
I'm not that kind of person.

336
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,340
If I thank him,

337
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,980
I'll be a useless person.

338
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,780
But I won't hate him.

339
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,340
Because I understand

340
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,460
that I've been through

341
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,180
so many hardships.

342
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,820
That's why I can

343
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,540
become a winner today.

344
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,980
Miss San,

345
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,740
Qian Kun is not certain

346
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,180
that it's too early to lose to him.

347
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,460
Zhou Yingniang,

348
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,020
I won again.

349
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,980
If you lose, you'll have another round.

350
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,140
In this world,

351
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,740
there's no common으로inda.

352
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,300
Why shall I look for

353
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,540
such a brilliantaphquet?

354
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,880
It's over.

355
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,460
I will make peace then.

356
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,700
ADMIRATHY

357
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Miss San, you won this game beautifully.

358
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
You didn't have to worry about it.

359
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Zhou Ruying has been

360
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,140
the only child in the family

361
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
who is in charge of Zhuang Yuchi.

362
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
This is the only place

363
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
that is not defeated.

364
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,140
But now,

365
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
this young master is trying to ruin it.

366
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,140
He has lost one more battle.

367
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
I didn't expect

368
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,140
that he could turn out

369
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
such a powerful child.

370
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
Mistress.

371
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Are you worried about

372
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Miss San's safety?

373
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,140
I have been fighting with

374
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
someone for a long time.

375
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,140
I am also very worried about you.

376
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,140
I am the best example.

377
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Mistress, you are serious.

378
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,140
This child is a stubborn child.

379
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,140
But she is so scared of me.

380
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,140
I am afraid that she will be too involved.

381
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
She will not be able to get along with me in the future.

382
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,140
Mistress,

383
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Mr. Yuwen

384
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,140
has returned from Danzhou.

385
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,140
This is the secret letter he gave you.

386
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
Madam.

387
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
If Zhang Hanye can take this game,

388
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
someone will definitely

389
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,140
take it.

390
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
You mean

391
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
the one in the Jianjia Pavilion?

392
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
I have been watching the Jianjia Pavilion

393
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
for a long time.

394
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
I have never seen them before.

395
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
Then, who do you mean?

396
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
The one in the Jinzhong

397
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
is the closest to him.

398
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140
He is the orphan of

399
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
the Dalisi family.

400
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
He is the one in the Jinzhong

401
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
and the one in the Jinzhong.

402
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
The orphan.

403
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,140
Yes, yes, yes.

404
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,140
It is good.

405
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
How many times have you

406
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,140
eaten this?

407
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,140
The one who came from Danzhou

408
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,140
is about to meet you.

409
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Mrs. Tang.

410
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
You should go to the Yinen Pavilion

411
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
and ask someone to come for you.

412
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
Yes.

413
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Who is it?

414
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Mr. Tang Ping.

415
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
You are the one who sent me the letter.

416
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
It is you.

417
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,140
I am sorry for the inconvenience.

418
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,140
I finally got the chance to meet you.

419
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,140
I really have to keep it from Mr. Yang.

420
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,140
Please forgive me.

421
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,140
Please.

422
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
If you don't show up,

423
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,140
I will go back to Danzhou.

424
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
Mr. Yang,

425
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,140
you have already let go

426
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,140
of the grudge between Sun'er and Po Xiang.

427
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
Since ancient times,

428
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
there have been many people who have

429
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
been responsible for the death of the four.

430
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
Because of my son,

431
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,140
I have not even met him.

432
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,140
I am so grumpy.

433
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,140
How can I let him go?

434
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
What are you doing?

435
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Mr. Yang, please don't be angry.

436
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,140
Before,

437
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
there was a relative who was working in the mansion.

438
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,140
He had a letter of Yan Shi

439
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,140
that was written by Zhang Lingyou Chang.

440
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
I don't know if he brought it.

441
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Of course he did.

442
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,140
Then...

443
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,140
I am curious.

444
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
How did you decide

445
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,140
to pretend to be Yan Xinchong's murderer?

446
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,140
I also think it is not possible.

447
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,140
After all, he is a 16-year-old girl.

448
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
How can he be so bold?

449
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,140
He was so bold

450
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
that he was so angry.

451
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
But,

452
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,140
you are now looking at our three ladies.

453
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
You are killing people,

454
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
killing people, killing people,

455
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,140
and killing people.

456
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
This is the crime of killing the head.

457
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Do you really want me to expose him?

458
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,140
If I don't kill him,

459
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
I am afraid that

460
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,140
he is now thinking

461
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,140
how to kill me.

462
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,140
Mr. Yang will think of going to the mansion

463
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
to read Yan Shi's book.

464
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
I think he has a doubt.

465
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,140
It is said that this case is a crime of the sea bandits.

466
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
I will not believe it.

467
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
The whole story is not as good as

468
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,140
the one of the southern state.

469
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
What are they thinking?

470
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
The royal family's mischievousness

471
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,140
is still a bad thing.

472
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
The southern state has never been in trouble.

473
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
There are things that have happened,

474
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,140
but it has been missing for ten years.

475
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
How can they be so bold?

476
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
In that case,

477
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
the three ladies are the only ones

478
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
who have no evidence.

479
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
Then,

480
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,140
what is the point

481
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
of the book of Fuya?

482
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Madam,

483
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,140
tell me about the price first.

484
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
How about 100 taels?

485
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,140
I spent a lot of money on this trip.

486
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
Then 150 taels.

487
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
I really can't get it.

488
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
200 taels?

489
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Okay.

490
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,140
Then I will go and sell some gold jewelry.

491
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
I will try my best to give you enough.

492
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Okay?

493
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Please wait, three ladies.

494
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
What are you doing here again?

495
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
Why are you so nervous?

496
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Is it possible that

497
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
the jade scroll is hidden by the bandits?

498
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Do you want to search for it?

499
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,140
Then take out the search warrant and tell me.

500
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Three ladies,

501
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
don't be angry.

502
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
I was just kidding.

503
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
This time,

504
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,140
Yin Zhuang and Chi were punished.

505
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,140
It seems that the minister of justice is responsible for this.

506
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
My lord, this is why I bought some medicines

507
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
to treat the plague.

508
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Then you are on the wrong way.

509
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,140
You should go to the palace.

510
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
After today,

511
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,140
I saw someone at the tea house in the palace.

512
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
Why did you know this?

513
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,140
You know who he is.

514
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
He killed Cheng Yaojin on the way.

515
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,140
I have to do a loan.

516
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Three ladies,

517
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
I have nothing to do with it.

518
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
I have to go now.

519
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Bye.

520
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
Wait.

521
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,140
I know that they are both thinking about it,

522
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,140
but I don't know what they are planning.

523
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Have you found out?

524
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,140
There are many people in the tea house in the capital.

525
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Not every family has my personal opinion.

526
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,140
You know the reason why I dare not enter the palace.

527
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Now you are in Zhou Ruying's heart,

528
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,140
and you are in a state of pain.

529
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
He won't spare you.

530
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
Think about it first.

531
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
You have no way to win.

532
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
Minister Fu,

533
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
why did you help me?

534
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,140
But I have a secret plan.

535
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
I don't want to be implicated by you.

536
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
You can do it.

537
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
I will do it.

538
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Have you thought it through?

539
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
Yes.

540
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Or not?

541
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
Chai Jing,

542
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,140
do you remember?

543
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
Yang Ping was a father in the early years.

544
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
His mother was born in the late days.

545
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,140
Those eyes were made of pure gold.

546
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,140
When the sea wind blew, it would be a thunder.

547
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
So what?

548
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,140
Yang Ping's mother has been suffering for many years.

549
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
She finally has a son.

550
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
This time, she has been in the capital.

551
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,140
She is a mother in the family.

552
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,140
She must be very worried.

553
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,140
She is looking forward to her return.

554
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
If she is sent back,

555
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
she will lose her hand.

556
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
You are a woman.

557
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
A woman?

558
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
In my opinion,

559
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,140
she is the most beautiful woman in the world.

560
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,140
What do you mean?

561
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,140
How many grandfathers are there in the ancient times?

562
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,140
For the so-called red soil,

563
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,140
to fight for power,

564
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,140
we should take our lives as grasslands.

565
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,140
During this time,

566
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,140
we should fight for countless wars.

567
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,140
But we should be able to live a life full of life.

568
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,140
That is the most ridiculous thing.

569
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,140
If they can have a woman,

570
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,140
they can have a life

571
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,140
without any worries and worries.

572
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Tomorrow is the day of the Yinan meeting.

573
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Aren't you afraid that they will be in trouble?

574
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,140
Take a step back.

575
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,140
Tie her up tonight.

576
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
Keep her in your place.

577
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,140
After the ceremony is over,

578
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,140
I will meet her.

579
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,140
She is very greedy.

580
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,140
If she can get the favor,

581
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,140
if she can't,

582
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,140
we will look for her.

583
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Okay.

584
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,140
The order of the heaven and earth is given.

585
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,140
The gods are all born.

586
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,140
They are all the gods.

587
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,140
The gods are the members of the wisdom.

588
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
They are the ancestors of love.

589
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
They are all born with a golden age.

590
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,140
They are all the gods.

591
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,140
They are not ready to be reborn.

592
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
They are all the nine gifts of the flower.

593
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,140
They are all sent to the gods.

594
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,140
They are willing to be born.

595
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,140
They are all born with a golden age.

596
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,140
They are all the gods.

597
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,140
They are all the gods.

598
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
They are all the gods.

599
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,140
The gods are all the gods.

600
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140
They are all the gods.

601
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,140
They are all the gods.

602
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
They are all the gods.

603
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,140
They are all the gods.

604
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
They are all the gods.

605
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,140
They are all the gods.

606
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,140
They are all the gods.

607
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,140
They are all the gods.

608
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140
They are all the gods.

609
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
They are all the gods.

610
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
They are all the gods.

611
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,140
They are all the gods.

612
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,140
They are all the gods.

613
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
They are all the gods.

614
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,580
From now on,

615
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,140
you must置 a legendary taped wave

616
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140

617
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,180
背 with the pedestal,

618
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,760
as your foundation

619
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,260
for the 중국,

620
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,600
playing the drone game,

621
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,600
and in the sci-factions.

622
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,100
Come.

623
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,140
Li Ji Cheng Qi,

624
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,380
God Qi Xing Xi,

625
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,500
Jujia Jing Xi,

626
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,500
Sheng Yu Jing Xi,

627
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,500
Yao Xiang Zhen Xi,

628
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,100
Yong He Ping Xi.

629
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,940
What's wrong?

630
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,620
with

631
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,980
Master,

632
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,180
you have worked hard.

633
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,220
What should I have done?

634
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,460
What's this?

635
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,580
How come I didn't get the legal edict?

636
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,420
Master.

637
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,700
father and fatherger in the right side are worse in society.

638
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,660
They have Dark Priest and his Mistress

639
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,180
to teach them their work,

640
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,180
Now, they've gone around the same place

641
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,420
He's probably all sorts of reckless people here

642
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,800
This is how I am going to time

643
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,580
I'm also going to make the two of you

644
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,680

649
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,780
So we are all proud

650
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,680

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,040
So are you

652
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,140

653
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,340
Only Xiao Chenghuan were everNice

654
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,460
Althoughpak ο Court got the innocent

655
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,200
completely

656
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,820
whose all the matters

657
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,660
are gasket

658
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,660
How about we invite Miss San to the hall?

659
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,660
Yes.

660
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,660
I am really grateful to you.

661
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,660
You should be the one to take care of me.

662
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Yes.

663
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,660
I will take Han Yan to the wedding.

664
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,660
I should be the one to take care of their funeral.

665
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,660
You...

666
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,660
You really are in the wedding hall.

667
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
But...

668
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
I am the one who killed the murderer.

669
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
You dare not?

670
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
I don't know if I am suspicious.

671
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,660
I feel that someone is monitoring me in the dark.

672
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,660
I am afraid that the whole wedding hall will be in danger.

673
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,660
Don't worry.

674
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
The King of the capital is the Prime Minister.

675
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,660
I am afraid that he might kidnap you.

676
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Why don't you leave Yan Shiwen's letter to me?

677
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,660
I will return it to you tomorrow.

678
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,660
I will return it to you tomorrow.

679
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,660
Zhuang Han Yan, stop!

680
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,660
Lang Er, you are doing this.

681
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
Let go of me!

682
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
Mother, this person is disturbing the whole capital.

683
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
Take him away.

684
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,660
You two are really a couple.

685
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,660
Zhuang Han Yan, you killed the General and the Secondary Minister.

686
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
You killed them.

687
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,660
My lord, my lord.

688
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
I have the wrongdoings to take over.

689
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Let him go!

690
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Let go of me!

691
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,660
Stop!

692
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Let him go!

693
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,660
My lord, my lord.

694
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Zhang Youchang and the Secondary Minister are not the same.

695
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Zhuang Han Yan killed them.

696
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
You are a girl.

697
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
What are you talking about?

698
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Yes.

699
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,660
If I am right, I can't talk nonsense.

700
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
Of course I have evidence.

701
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Zhuang Han Yan, are you confessing your crime or am I here to tell you?

702
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
I am innocent.

703
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,660
But you are so cunning.

704
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
You can't tell me what happened.

705
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I am afraid I will ask you a wrongdoings.

706
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Lang Er, you are the one who was kicked out of the Zhuang family because of me.

707
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Even if you hate me, you shouldn't have done this to me.

708
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,660
This is a fact.

709
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
What is a fact?

710
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Since you came back to the capital,

711
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,660
you have been saying that Zhang Youchang and the Secondary Minister are close to each other.

712
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
They are close to each other.

713
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,660
They treat you like they treat a girl.

714
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Right?

715
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
So what?

716
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,660
You are still not telling the truth.

717
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,660
After I was kicked out of the Zhuang family,

718
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
I went to Nanzhang Town in Danzhou.

719
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
I visited the city and asked around.

720
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Then I found out that you have been hated by the evil spirit and evil spirit.

721
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
You have hated them.

722
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,660
You have been hurt and you are a thief.

723
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,660
What are you doing in Hongzhou?

724
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,660
Many years ago,

725
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Zhuang Hanye went out of the house and stole the snow-covered forest from the Lin family.

726
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
But Zhang Youchang chased him out.

727
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,660
He took a fish net and put it in the net and dragged it back home.

728
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,660
He made many people come to see the fun.

729
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Shut up!

730
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
You are the one who is so stubborn.

731
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,660
I want all of you to know that Zhuang Hanye is not a good person.

732
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Last year,

733
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Zhuang Hanye was attacked and he took the knife.

734
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
He was in a mess.

735
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Luckily, Zhang Youchang was killed in time.

736
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,660
In time, he was killed by a half-legged woodcutter.

737
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Otherwise, he would have killed himself.

738
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
But it was a big trouble.

739
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
The county government came to ask about it.

740
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
There must be a record.

741
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Hanye,

742
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,660
what he said is true.

743
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,660
It's not true.

744
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,660
The uncle brought me all the trouble.

745
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
I hate them for their own fault.

746
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,660
I will hide these from the net.

747
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,660
First, the new uncle has been hired.

748
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
The past is gone.

749
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,660
No need to hurt the people who hired him.

750
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Second, the parents will send me to Danzhou.

751
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,660
If I tell them the truth,

752
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,660
they will only hurt the family.

753
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Now that we are back,

754
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
we have family to help.

755
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
The past is a grudge.

756
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
We should let it go.

757
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Otherwise, we will be in trouble.

758
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Since you don't admit your crime,

759
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,660
please ask the minister to tell us.

760
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,660
You investigated this case in Danzhou.

761
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,660
You said there was a mess.

762
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
But the county government is so strict.

763
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Why do you have to make trouble?

764
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
You are so heartless.

765
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,660
This is not the court.

766
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
It's not the official order.

767
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
I have nothing to say to you.

768
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
I am a minister.

769
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
How can you be so rude?

770
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,660
You are trying to report to others.

771
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,660
Is there any evidence?

772
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,660
I have evidence.

773
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
Yes.

774
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,660
It's the record of the letter of the letter

775
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,660
of the county governor of Danzhou, Nanzhang Town.

776
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,660
The record of the letter is clear.

777
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Zhang Youqiang's wife, Qi Errong,

778
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
although she has a wound,

779
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,660
she is a strong woman.

780
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
I am a woman with no shame

781
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,660
because of her injury.

782
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,660
And this weapon is a hairpin.

783
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
You still don't admit your crime.

784
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Han Yan, what she said...

785
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,660
You have decided to kill her.

786
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
I will kill her.

787
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
I will kill her.

788
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
I will kill her.

789
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,660
I am the only woman in Danzhou.

790
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,660
I am the only one in Danzhou with hairpin.

791
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,660
Then don't ask me, young man.

792
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
This case is a little bit heavy.

793
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Do you have the right to report to the prime minister?

794
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,660
If every case in the world is reported to the prime minister,

795
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,660
do you have the right to do it?

796
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
Today is the day of the meeting.

797
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
It's not necessary to argue here.

798
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
Since there are many doubts about this case,

799
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,660
I will immediately put the daughter of Zhuang to the court

800
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,660
and put her in the prime minister's place.

801
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,660
Lord Zhuang, please punish me.

802
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Lord Yan, you can't do this.

803
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Lord Yan, this case...

804
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,660
This case today will be handled by me personally.

805
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,660
The prime minister will find out the truth.

806
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,660
Wait here.

807
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,300
To prove right to the things I'm saying,

808
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,820
it will bring a perfect good life to the people.

809
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,760
financial peace

810
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,000
and respect

811
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,040
to the family

812
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,680
will bring this good life

813
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,180
percent of people like me

814
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,140
don't go against

815
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,460
that

816
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,140
edningen

817
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,160
very short

818
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,040
this is

819
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,420
a professional

820
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,660
ordinary

821
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,140
South

822
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,020
A😢

823
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,400
strika

824
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,440
Daughter,

825
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,040
Miss,

826
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,160
you'd better stop working.

827
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,760
At least you'll ease the pain you feel.

828
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,680
According to the釀んだ理士's order,

829
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,840
the people and Christians involved in thefting of practicing the holy findings

830
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,200
are to start planning the process first.

831
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
If not for the time of the Absolute Destruction,

832
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,900
if it was true,

833
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,800
who knows?

834
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,280
For what you will do it?

835
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
It's not that simple.

836
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,280
You know Dali Temple hot springs.

837
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,880
Just assume what you're doing.

838
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Stop!

839
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
You're so selfish.

840
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
What's your point?

841
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
What you mean, Mr. Fu?

842
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Please understand.

843
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm here to take part in this case.

844
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
But this case is now under Mr. Yan's personal jurisdiction.

845
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
I can't delay the investigation.

846
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Tomorrow?

847
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Okay.

848
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Tonight, midnight, midnight.

849
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Otherwise, I can't be involved.

850
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Okay.

851
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Then, I'll do it myself.

852
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Don't be so rash.

853
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Of course, you have to find a way.

854
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Sir.

855
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
The old man's confession has been signed.

856
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Now, he's gone.

857
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Is that how you let him go?

858
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Someone behind him is in charge.

859
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
He won't let go of the case.

860
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
He won't have to pay for it.

861
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Then, Miss Zhuang and Miss San,

862
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
should we still save him?

863
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
The Zhuang family is in a difficult situation.

864
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I'll protect Han Yan from the fire.

865
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I'll keep the case in the right place

866
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
and make it out of the water.

867
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Sir.

868
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Miss San is a good girl.

869
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
She won't be in trouble.

870
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
The Dali Temple is in danger.

871
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Even Prince Yan is going in.

872
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
He's going to die.

873
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
I shouldn't have

874
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
sent Han Yan to Danzhou earlier.

875
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
These days,

876
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
he's been in trouble.

877
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
There's a husband and a wife.

878
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,400
I think they won't be too hard on Miss San.

879
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Where's the girl?

880
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
I don't know.

881
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
I didn't expect

882
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,400
that because Miss San drove him out of the house,

883
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
he was such a stubborn man.

884
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
He even went to Danzhou.

885
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
He's a good girl.

886
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
He's in Danzhou.

887
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
He's a good man.

888
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
I don't think he'll see us again.

889
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Sir.

890
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Why don't you go out and walk around

891
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
and see if you can get through it?

892
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Yes.

893
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
I'll go now.

894
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
I'll go now.

895
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Miss San is in trouble.

896
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I can't finish it.

897
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I'll go and see Miss San.

898
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Please punish me.

899
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Get up.

900
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I know.

901
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Please save Miss San.

902
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Dali Temple is in danger.

903
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Even if it's a wrong plan,

904
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
it's still going to happen.

905
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Since he's in trouble,

906
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I've arranged for you to stay with him.

907
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Tell me.

908
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Did he really get wronged?

909
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Well...

910
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
I dare not say anything.

911
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I'll take this as a no.

912
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Master.

913
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
It's not the time to talk about the real thing.

914
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Please save Miss San.

915
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
I don't plan to save her.

916
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Master.

917
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I want to set up a plan

918
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
to let her leave this place.

919
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
But she can't get in.

920
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
I'm just like the other year.

921
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
A person like us

922
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,400
has to go to the south wall.

923
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
To break through the snow,

924
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
to be brave and strong,

925
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
to be strong and strong,

926
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
to be strong and strong,

927
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
to be strong and strong,

928
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
to know what's wrong with her,

929
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
to fail this time.

930
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Even if I save her today,

931
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
I'll still be dead.

932
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
But...

933
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Even if I remember her well,

934
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
I'll still be alive.

935
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Shu Hong,

936
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
you don't have to worry about it.

937
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Just now,

938
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I heard that you'll be in charge of the meeting today.

939
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I'm not sure.

940
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I'll go to Yuzhuxuan

941
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
to find Miss San's trace.

942
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
But Miss San is in the prison in Dali Temple.

943
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
She's not in Yuzhuxuan.

944
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
I know

945
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,400
that she'll save her life.

946
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Maybe she'll pay a price.

947
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
The person in the room?

948
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Who is it?

949
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Stop.

950
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
I have something to ask you.

951
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
What's going on

952
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
in the meeting today?

953
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,400
The case of Danzhou is exposed.

954
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Miss San has personally investigated

955
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
the case in Dali Temple.

956
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
I have to take care of it.

957
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
I'll go to Yuzhuxuan

958
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
to find the suspect.

959
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
So I came to you.

960
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Why?

961
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Why did you kill the two of them?

962
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
I didn't kill them.

963
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Tell me the cause of the death.

964
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
I want to know if there's any change in the story.

965
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
I don't know.

966
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
That day,

967
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
I went to look for her.

968
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
She was in the prison.

969
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
She was buried on the ground.

970
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
You've never asked her?

971
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
If she has any instructions,

972
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
I'll do it.

973
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
But I've never asked her

974
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
what she didn't say.

975
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
We love each other.

976
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Where is she now?

977
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Dali Temple is in prison.

978
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
At this time of night,

979
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
she'll be held in the 12th place.

980
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,400
If she confesses,

981
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
what will happen?

982
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
She was killed by a person.

983
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
She was seriously injured.

984
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
She was killed by a person.

985
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
She was dead.

986
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
So the two of them

987
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
are just family members?

988
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
They're not blood relatives?

989
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
If it wasn't for the night,

990
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
she'd be sent to the Hall

991
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
to take care of the two of them.

992
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Maybe we can still separate.

993
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
But now,

994
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
where are you going?

995
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
I'll go and take care of it.

996
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
I killed the person.

997
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Do you know

998
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
what the 12th place

999
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
of Dali Temple is?

1000
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
We only have family members.

1001
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
We're all in the same team.

1002
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,400
We're all in the same team.

1003
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Aren't you afraid?

1004
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
I'm not afraid of death.

1005
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Is it worth your sacrifice?

1006
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
It's not worth it.

1007
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
It's good to save her.

1008
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
I'm sorry

1009
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,400
for your loyalty.

1010
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
But you're going to take care of yourself.

1011
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
It's too fake.

1012
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
What can I do?

1013
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
There's no way back.

1014
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
You can do it.

1015
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Yes.

1016
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
There's a public record of the Hall.

1017
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
There are seven or eight people in the Haifei Palace.

1018
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
There's no other way to see them.

1019
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
Each of them is wearing dirty clothes.

1020
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
There are weird four-leafed clothes on them.

1021
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
I still have something to ask you.

1022
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Please say it.

1023
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Don't tell her.

1024
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
It's me.

1025
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
But I need to know

1026
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
who you're with

1027
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
who you're with Zhuang Hanye.

1028
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
I want to know

1029
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
who you're with

1030
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
and what you're doing with Zhuang Hanye.

1031
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
He's my wife.

1032
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,800
What does it have to do with me?

1033
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,640
Hurry up.

1034
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,840
The last one is enough.

1035
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,680
Miss Chongjiao San,

1036
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,080
it's time to say goodbye.

1037
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Into our别人病.

1038
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,480
Police revealed all the Kelp's

1039
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,320
was records.

1040
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry

1041
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
