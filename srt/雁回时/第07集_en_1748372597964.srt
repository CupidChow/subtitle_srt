See you in the next one!

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,520
Not look at you for the rest of your day.

35
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Thanks, lady, for the Staffs.

How could we be so Kazakh!?

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,720
I'm here to rescue you, Master.

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,160
Master.

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
Open the door.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
Mrs. Zhou,

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
what are you doing?

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm in trouble.

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm sorry, Master.

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Even if you're a thief,

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,320
you can leave me to do it.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,440
You're a knife, too.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,200
Master, you've worked hard.

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,160
You should have taken a break.

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,160
Don't be so impulsive.

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,000
It's okay.

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,720
It's about the safety of the people.

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,320
It's a great responsibility.

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Under these circumstances,

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,160
we would be un șiqin

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,200
to protect our own people.

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,720
Pleasedon't bother to start up your late at night.

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,680
That was all.

60
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm just afraid we'd be laughed at

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
by thieves.

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,880
We'llARA

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,960
probably roll out the raddish.

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
But has Mrs. Zhou forgotten

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,560
how的時候 I was burnt around?

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Or, how many wives

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,200
would reflect on

68
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,880
you byṛṣṇa to save me?

69
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
Of course not!

70
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,780
I'll attack you once again!

71
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Anyone can attack first!

72
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,560
Yes sir!

73
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
The night is cold and cold.

74
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
It's hard for the mother of Zhou Yi to worry about me.

75
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
The mother of Zhou Yi is gravely ill.

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Master is in a deep state of anxiety.

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
He ordered me to come and check on the thief.

78
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
I, the family of Jian, have no thief.

79
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,960
But there is a slave who doesn't follow the rules of the world.

80
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,960
It's true that I was wrong.

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
But the case of He Fu An Wei

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
is also very serious.

83
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
But the case of He Fu An Wei

85
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
is also very serious.

86
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Even if the master and mother are punished later,

87
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I will also admit it.

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Search it now!

89
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Who dares to?

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Uncle Yong,

91
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
don't be impulsive.

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,960
If you go out now, you will be a criminal.

93
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I will never be able to tell you again.

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Who dares to do this without my order?

95
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
What are you waiting for?

96
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
If you take the thief back to the government,

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
you will be rewarded for nothing.

98
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Search it now!

99
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Don't make a fool of yourself!

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Don't make a fool of yourself!

101
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
In the house of the master and mother,

102
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
you want to do something, right?

103
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Xi Wen,

104
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm not surprised at you, right?

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Xi Wen,

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
I know that you have been

107
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,960
disturbed and quiet for years.

108
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,960
But today, you lost your seal.

109
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
There are thieves in the house.

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
The situation is serious.

111
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
I'm afraid that you will be in trouble.

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,960
We have searched the Yong Shou Hall and the Gong Tong Courtyard

113
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
carefully.

114
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
We have no trace of the thief.

115
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Xi Wen,

116
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
can you please understand?

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Of course.

118
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
I know you are very thoughtful.

119
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
The master and mother are in the same boat.

120
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
You should go now.

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
As long as you write a letter,

122
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,960
you can search the house with me.

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Xi Wen,

124
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,960
don't make such a joke.

125
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I never joke.

126
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I'm not good at you.

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I was only a fool

128
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
when I was in the middle of the road.

129
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Now, you are in this situation.

130
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
We are not as good as each other.

131
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
In recent years,

132
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
you have been in the family of the Jin family

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
with no one else.

134
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
As the master of the family,

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
I have been in charge of all of you.

136
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,960
But today, you are in the house with a thief.

137
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
You lost your seal.

138
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Why do you have so much trouble?

139
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Do you really want to know why?

140
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Why?

141
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
I have a guest in my house.

142
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm afraid you will be upset.

143
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Guest? Who?

144
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Zhuang Zhiyang,

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,960
let's not talk about this.

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Otherwise,

147
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
tomorrow morning,

148
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,960
we will be the biggest joke in the whole city.

149
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,540
One

150
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,840
suitable

151
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Vice Commander JUST HIT.

152
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,240
Master Guoing isn't here.

153
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,360
The

154
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,720
Monk Guan Yi

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,240
is none other than

156
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,420
the culprit who tried to save

157
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,540
Majestic stresses.

158
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,040
Thank you, Master!!

159
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,240
Green Fl掰掰 is a good idea.

160
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,800
So 않ile,

161
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,720
I have referred to dragon after star,

162
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,840
only with this cool seal position.

163
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,440
So Mo Gua found this well all the time.

164
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
She's just a concubine.

165
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,680
She doesn't steal or take money alone.

166
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,680
And she doesn't take dirty items.

167
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,840
It's as if she wanted to effect See Shuang ...

168
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,280
In terms ofattitude seal

169
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,440
she's being a woman.

170
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,200
Really?

171
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,680
Why would she answer that?

172
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
I fund it back.

173
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,520
All that way,

174
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,280
just stop him now.

175
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,040
ering with the cold of Lanyue

176
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
the ancestors kidnapped me.

177
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
People are afraid of their rights

178
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,920
and will not be able to put up with the practice.

179
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,440
And their wishes will never come true.

180
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,040
I can't afford to be responsible for it.

181
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
From now on,

182
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
I will be at the Jian family's house to take care of my illness.

183
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,320
Don't worry about the key in the mansion.

184
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
Han Yan is already ill.

185
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,720
Tonight,

186
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,960
you can move to Yongshou Hall to live.

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,740
We系

188
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
s

189
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,160
illegal

190
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:35,280
clothes,

191
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
You should ask me if you believe him.

192
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
If you don't believe him,

193
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
why should I explain?

194
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
It's been twenty years.

195
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
You still don't know how to let go?

196
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Back then,

197
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I made a engagement with Xiven.

198
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I was not a good friend.

199
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I was a good friend.

200
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Xiven and I made a engagement.

201
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
But when we got married,

202
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
he was married to a man.

203
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
If fate had stopped us,

204
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I would have let go.

205
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
But if people had won,

206
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
how would I let go?

207
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
No matter how,

208
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
if you care about Xiven's reputation,

209
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,160
don't let him enter the manor again.

210
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
I will not let you go.

211
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
You owe me.

212
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
I will return it sooner or later.

213
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Master.

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Master.

215
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Ruoyan.

216
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Is there anything in this world

217
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,160
that you can ask for?

218
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
But you never get it.

219
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
No matter how hard you try,

220
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
even if you try hard,

221
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,160
even if everyone thinks that you are heartless,

222
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,160
you only know that you are the one who is the one who is the one.

223
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
God will make you understand that

224
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
it is not yours.

225
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
It is not yours after all.

226
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
It is a joke.

227
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
It is all my fault.

228
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
I shouldn't have angered you

229
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
and hurt you.

230
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Why do you have to be so heartless?

231
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I have been blaming you for nothing.

232
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I can't bear to see you do that.

233
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Master, don't be sad.

234
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Otherwise,

235
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I will only be in a long-term.

236
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Fortunately,

237
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
you are with me in this family.

238
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Master,

239
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Why do you look sotersweet Look like a little catcessor.

240
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Do I have softer feelings?

241
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,440
I'm fine.

242
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,280
I'm glad you're here.

243
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,240
You're sick for me.

244
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I'll be at Yongshu Hall in the future.

245
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,160
I have good body and medicine.

246
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,760
I'll make sure you're well.

247
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,800
Thank you, aunt.

248
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,080
It's late for the good night.

249
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,400
Have a good rest.

250
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Goodbye, aunt.

251
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,360
Bye.

252
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,260
Why don't you let me stay here her clothes?

253
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,640
If I'm around,

254
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,440
you won't suffer.

255
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't know either.

256
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,300
Maybe I'm she.

257
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,740
I love the others more.

258
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,100
What I want is that she пок fit I heart.

259
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,100
I'm even more afraid that he might think I'm someone else's friend.

260
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Then, does he really have a heart for you?

261
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,100
At least now, I believe he has a pain in his heart.

262
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,100
I just don't know what kind of secret he's hiding

263
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,100
outside of this pain.

264
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Wu Yu has established a position to claim the Qu won't.

265
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,160
I havehis eilean

266
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,100
to bribe you.

267
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,100
If he comes back soon enough to devour me,

268
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,100
it will Furong and the remaining ingredients cannot live.

269
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
It's useless.

270
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Duan Zi.

271
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,660
Zhu Mu.

272
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,660
Let's try again.

273
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,180
Duan Zi, I said Duan Zi!

274
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,620
His legs are gone!

275
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,220
They're gone!

276
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,220
Even if it's a fake,

277
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,340
there's no way!

278
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,740
Duan Zi, go away!

279
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,900
I won't win!

280
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
I won't win!

281
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
All right.

282
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
All right.

283
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
All right.

284
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,580
I'll leave.

285
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
You can't stay in the house for a day.

289
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
Ru Yan.

290
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
You're going to be in charge of the house today.

291
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,820
Master, don't go to the house.

292
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
What?

293
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Are you not angry with me?

294
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,100
How can I be in charge of the house?

295
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,980
Besides,

296
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
I'm the one who's responsible for Zhu Mu.

297
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
Don't mention it.

298
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
You're a good girl.

299
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
You're the one who's responsible for Zhu Mu.

300
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,540
You're the one who's responsible for Zhu Mu.

301
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,540
You're the one who's responsible for Zhu Mu.

302
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,540
You're the one who's responsible for Zhu Mu.

303
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,540
What's the rule?

304
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
It's been a long time since I went out.

305
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I haven't seen such a big person.

306
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
Besides, I can't compare to my aunt.

307
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I'm too old to be a good girl.

308
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
Don't push me.

309
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
That's right.

310
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
You've been in the house for a long time.

311
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
You've seen it.

312
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Well...

313
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
Since you've been in the house for a long time,

314
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,540
I'll be fine.

315
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Mr. Yue.

316
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,540
Yes?

317
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
I've been resting for half a day.

318
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
I've been working on my day.

319
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,540
I should move back.

320
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Brother Yunxi,

321
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,540
why are you in such a hurry?

322
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Yes.

323
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,540
The new year is coming.

324
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
I'll stay for a few more days.

325
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
I've put a lot of trouble on the house.

326
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
I shouldn't bother you.

327
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
But I'll take you to the house

328
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,540
and wait for the door to open.

329
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
That's good.

330
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,540
You can make your own decision.

331
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
Father.

332
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
After you leave the house,

333
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,540
can you help me with the jade scroll?

334
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Are you in Yongshou Hall?

335
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
Is there anything wrong with it?

336
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
My grandmother loves the jade scroll.

337
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,540
But she's old.

338
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,540
She doesn't want to take care of it.

339
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,540
Fine.

340
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
You should have your own place

341
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,540
when you're back.

342
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,540
Thank you, father.

343
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I heard that the master has been angry with you.

344
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
It's a bit of a shame.

345
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
You can't do that.

346
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
The master is very considerate to the master.

347
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
He even has a red face.

348
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Tell me.

349
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
Why is he being taken out of the house?

350
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
Well...

351
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
Mrs. Tang.

352
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,540
You're the old man in the house.

353
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
What do you think?

354
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
He's the wife of the cook in the kitchen.

355
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,540
How could he know that?

356
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
I think...

357
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
the kitchen will be changed

358
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
in the future.

359
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Mother.

360
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,540
What's wrong with you?

361
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Are you afraid of me?

362
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
I'm just kidding.

363
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,540
You're the master of the house.

364
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,540
We're servants.

365
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Of course, we must be careful.

366
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,540
I'm just pretending to be a maid.

367
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,540
It's a slave to me.

368
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
But we're late for the funeral.

369
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,540
Since we're in the house,

370
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,540
we're all family.

371
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
In the future,

372
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
we don't need to be so serious.

373
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,540
Don't make any trouble.

374
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,540
The thieves were in the house a few days ago.

375
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,540
They were in the prison.

376
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
The master was taken to the prison.

377
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,540
He had to be taken to the prison.

378
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Now, the new year is coming.

379
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,540
The house is in chaos.

380
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,540
Everyone, don't make trouble.

381
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Let's work together.

382
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,540
We'll get through this.

383
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
Okay?

384
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Aunt.

385
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,540
You're kind to our servants.

386
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,540
You're more filial than the wife.

387
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Don't be so impulsive.

388
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
Don't make trouble.

389
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,540
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
Okay, everyone, go back to your work.

391
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Go back to your work.

392
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Go back to your work.

393
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
Aunt.

394
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,540
You're the kitchen maid.

395
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,540
Yes, I've known it long ago.

396
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Aunt, you've been here a long time ago.

397
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
I'll never look at you wrong.

398
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Aunt, you're born with a motherly temperament.

399
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
Unlike the one in the prison,

400
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
she's a born sick.

401
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
You can't be so impulsive.

402
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,540
You're not afraid of punishment.

403
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Aunt, forgive me.

404
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,540
I'm born with a straight face.

405
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
I'm not so mischievous.

406
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,540
I'm just a new person.

407
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,540
I just know how to listen to my master.

408
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,540
I'm called the old man.

409
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Mom,

410
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Yes.

411
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,540
You're in the kitchen.

412
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
You're a bit of a nuisance.

413
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,540
If you have any other instructions,

414
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,540
I'll make sure you're not in trouble.

415
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
From now on,

416
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,540
you can go to the prison.

417
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,540
Now that you're here,

418
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
take care of me.

419
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
Yes.

420
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
I'll go.

421
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
Your Highness,

422
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,540
I'll listen to your mother.

423
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Come here.

424
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
You two,

425
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
go get the key and the tent.

426
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
Yes.

427
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
You two,

428
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,540
go and see the room.

429
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
There's a valuable set of things.

430
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Yes.

431
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
You two,

432
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
go and take that little kitchen out of here.

433
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
Yes.

434
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,540
The people in this yard are still in the kitchen.

435
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
It's really a waste.

436
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
The house is so clean.

437
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
How dare you break into the bed?

438
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Who are you?

439
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Who asked you to come?

440
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm the one.

441
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
I didn't know you before.

442
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
I'm not a big sister.

443
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,540
I'll know you in the future.

444
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,540
I'm the new master of the house,

445
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
the new master of the house,

446
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
the mother-in-law.

447
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,540
She's called me the mother-in-law.

448
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
I'm here to see you.

449
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,540
I'm here to see you.

450
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,540
I've never seen you here before.

451
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,540
I'm here to see you.

452
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,540
I'm sorry I can't get out of here.

453
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
I'm sorry I can't get out of here.

454
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
I'm sorry I can't get out of here.

455
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Now,

456
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
the master has given

457
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,540
all the housekeeper's house to

458
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Mrs. Zhou.

459
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,540
She's very loyal to her.

460
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
But Mrs. Zhou

461
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
is the only one who takes care of

462
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,540
the housekeeper's house.

463
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
She's so carefree.

464
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
That's why I

465
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
asked my servant to get the key

466
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
and the account book

467
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
and make a deal.

468
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Deal?

469
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
I'll deal with it.

470
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
I'll be in the master's house

471
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
and you'll be in trouble.

472
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
You're so bold.

473
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,540
You don't know that.

474
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
It's not a matter of time.

475
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Mrs. Zhou has brought everyone

476
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,540
to the housekeeper's house.

477
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,540
I hope you can take care of the master.

478
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
Alright.

479
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
You parents,

480
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,540
I need this flower glue from you.

481
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,540
Theard is wise and frank.

482
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
我有需要对不起

483
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
You parents,

484
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,220
please help me

485
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:49,080
bring back the undying

486
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
neighbor for up to blue light.

487
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,980
You little bitch, you're so arrogant.

488
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,900
You want to come and take the master

489
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,980
and take the master's position?

490
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,540
Dream on!

491
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,620
You old bitch!

492
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,140
What's wrong?

493
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,540
Give her the sword.

494
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,460
Take it!

495
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,500
You're so stupid.

496
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,700
Don't you know what to do!

497
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
Get out!

498
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,140
You old bitch!

499
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,260
Listen to me.

500
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,700
Let's go to the bridge

501
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,500
and get your account book.

502
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Get out!

503
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,660
You old bitch!

504
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,820
You old bitch!

505
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,100
Get out!

506
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,060
Wait!

507
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,260
Get out!

508
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,420
Get out!

509
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,940
Zhu Mu.

510
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,380
Where are you?

511
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,020
If they don't know today,

512
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,780
we'll be in trouble.

513
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,780
I'm afraid we'll have to work harder.

514
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,860
I'm sure they'll know.

515
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
Let them go.

516
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
A-Cong, let's go.

517
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Sister.

518
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Brother.

519
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Sister.

520
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Did you hear that?

521
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Jinzha Pavilion is so lively today.

522
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Really?

523
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
It's a big party.

524
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
A-Cong, let's go to the hot place.

525
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Let's go.

526
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Let's go.

527
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Let's go, A-Cong.

528
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
A-Cong.

529
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:22,840
This is the place of the

530
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,500
Little Mermaid.

531
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
It's so crowded.

532
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
It's not a food or a dog.

533
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
It's a dog.

534
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Don't come here again.

535
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
You're so unlucky.

536
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Who's there?

537
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Why are you standing there?

538
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
It's me.

539
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
What?

540
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
It's you.

541
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
What do you mean?

542
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm riding my own horse.

543
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Why are you...

544
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
You're scolding me!

545
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
I'm not.

546
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
You're a pervert.

547
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
You're a pervert.

548
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
You're a pervert.

549
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
You're a pervert.

550
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
You're a pervert.

551
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
I'm a pervert.

552
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Please call me sister.

553
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
We're blood-sucking.

554
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
If I'm a pervert,

555
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
what are you?

556
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
You...

557
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
If you can't reach a pervert,

558
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
please call me father.

559
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I...

560
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Wait for me.

561
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Go.

562
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Go.

563
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Go.

564
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
You're here to see my little boy.

565
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Mother is now defeated.

566
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Do you have any other plans?

567
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I've been in the Zheng family for 20 years.

568
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
It's not your turn to remind me.

569
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
I just want to help you.

570
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
No need.

571
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Please go back, Miss San.

572
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Have you ever been tired?

573
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
No.

574
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I've been tired.

575
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Have you ever been tired?

576
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
I've been through it.

577
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
And then,

578
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
on the beach in the Danzhou,

579
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
the whole village caught me,

580
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
and put me in the sea.

581
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
The water was fresh and salty,

582
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
and it was filled with the cold.

583
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
I still remember the despair and fear.

584
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
At that moment,

585
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I hoped that mother would be by my side,

586
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
and let me go.

587
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I was pregnant,

588
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
but I didn't have mother.

589
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I could only rely on myself.

590
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
You caused me to be so worried.

591
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I taught you to be patient.

592
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
The mother and daughter's love

593
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
was broken 17 years ago.

594
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
No one is guilty.

595
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Don't tell me that.

596
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
No.

597
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I was so angry yesterday.

598
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I never hated you.

599
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,500
If my mother is a noble girl,

600
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
and sacrificed her daughter

601
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
to protect her wealth,

602
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I would have left you very eagerly.

603
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
But it's not like that.

604
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
I can see that

605
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
you have a mother.

606
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
It's not easy to live these years.

607
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
It's even like what I did.

608
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,500
You struggled in the water.

609
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
So,

610
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
how can I hate you?

611
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Mother,

612
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
I'm the only bloodline in this world.

613
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
We are close to each other,

614
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
not enemies.

615
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
If you and my mother

616
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
fight with each other,

617
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
you will only make others regret.

618
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Please tell me,

619
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
why did you have to

620
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
send me away?

621
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I didn't have to.

622
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
I was the one who sent you away.

623
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I was the one who was wronged.

624
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Then why did you

625
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
contact me last night?

626
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
You said that I've been through

627
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
a lot of hardships in this life.

628
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
You said that you hope that

629
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
I'll live a good life.

630
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
I said that

631
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
I was bad,

632
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
and that I was wronged.

633
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
It has nothing to do with you.

634
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
I'm now a big dog.

635
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I can't help you.

636
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
If you insist on staying in California,

637
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
just follow your own path.

638
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Don't come to the Jian family again.

639
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Mother,

640
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
tell me.

641
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Zhou Ruyan hurt you

642
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
and me, right?

643
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
If you don't want to say anything,

644
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I'll go and find out the truth myself.

645
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
I'll let you know

646
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
that I'm not only your daughter,

647
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
but also your doctor.

648
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Your legs are all because of me.

649
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Then from now on,

650
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
I'll be your legs.

651
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
I'll be your legs.

652
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
In this life,

653
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
no matter how many gold-tongued robbers

654
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
are waiting for us,

655
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I'll take you out of the trap.

656
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I won't let the one who hurt you get hurt.

657
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Zhou Ruyan's death

658
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
is the capital punishment I gave you.

659
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
What are you going to do?

660
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I told you last night

661
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
not to keep fighting

662
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
with them

663
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
in this mudflat.

664
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
It's too late.

665
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
He's been trying to get the power of the master.

666
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
But the power is the glory and the benefit.

667
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
It will also be the punishment and the punishment.

668
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Mother,

669
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
wait for me to show you.

670
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I'll definitely

671
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
get the power of the master back for you.

672
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Stop!

673
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
What are you going to do?

674
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Mother, don't you understand?

675
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Han Yan

676
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
has never been so ambitious.

677
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
I just want to be like other girls.

678
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I have a mother

679
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
and a family.

680
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
This is not the end.

681
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
You don't have to stay here.

682
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
No.

683
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I was willing to stay here

684
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
for a few months

685
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
to have the time.

686
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
In this world,

687
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
only mother

688
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
is the only one

689
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
who can really make me fall in love with her.

690
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
The only place where I can be with my mother

691
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
is the only home I can make Han Yan.

692
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
That was the first time I saw her cry.

693
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
That tearful face

694
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
can still be seen in the film.

695
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
The pride of the daughter of the capital.

696
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
The tears

697
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
were shed on her.

698
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
It's the compassion and tenderness

699
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
of mother.

700
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Miss San has lost.

701
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
I only lost to Mr. Fu.

702
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
It's enough to win

703
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
against Miss San.

704
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Miss San

705
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
is the last time

706
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I'm here.

707
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
But I don't have any.

708
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
When did you find out?

709
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
I was in the department

710
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
long ago.

711
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
I was so anxious

712
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
to see her cry.

713
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
If everyone

714
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
only had a person

715
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
who was fierce and evil

716
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
and united to encourage her,

717
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
then this person

718
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
would probably be a good person.

719
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Maybe

720
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
he's still a good person

721
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
who's forced to do something.

722
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Then what should this good person do?

723
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
To be alone

724
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
is to make the other person clear.

725
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
What did you hear last night?

726
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
You still don't want to tell me?

727
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
I lied to you last time.

728
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
When I was in the meeting

729
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
with Yuwen Chang'an,

730
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
I mentioned the son of Pei Dafu.

731
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
When we were in the meeting yesterday,

732
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
I mentioned the meeting of Danzhou.

733
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I also said...

734
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
What?

735
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
He said he had evidence.

736
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
If he was given the position of

737
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
the chairman of Danzhou Chamber of Commerce,

738
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
he could have punished someone.

739
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
But I don't know

740
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
what you said.

741
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Then?

742
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Then I was caught by Zhou Yingniang.

743
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
You don't need the other information.

744
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
What information?

745
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Maybe my mother

746
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
loves me.

747
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
In this world,

748
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
I finally have someone

749
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
who can hang on to me.

750
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Why don't you

751
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
go back to the Qianjia Pavilion

752
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
and find out a few more days?

753
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Why?

754
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
What evidence do you have?

755
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
What is the secret plan?

756
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
You didn't ask me

757
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
to find out.

758
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Then what is the secret plan?

759
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Would you like to tell me the truth?

760
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
No.

761
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Just follow my instructions.

762
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
What if I don't want to?

763
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Are you afraid of me?

764
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
If you don't want to,

765
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
I will kill you.

766
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
If you don't want to fight,

767
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
I won't help you anymore.

768
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm afraid I won't be able to wait for you.

769
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
I killed him.

770
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
What?

771
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
But Zhou Xiong'an,

772
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
my father, Tong Chuan,

773
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Zhang Youchang and his wife

774
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
were all killed by me.

775
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Do you want to arrest me?

776
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
You admit it?

777
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
We are not the same people.

778
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
I don't want to

779
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
find out

780
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
what kind of trick you have.

781
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
But from now on,

782
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
you don't have to threaten me anymore.

783
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
I won't take your order.

784
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
If you really want to arrest me,

785
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
you can give me a break.

786
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
I also want to see

787
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
what you are going to do

788
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
to punish me.

789
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm afraid you have

790
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
changed your mind

791
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
after you arrived at the Dali Temple.

792
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
I have a life.

793
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I will take your life.

794
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
You think

795
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
the case in Danzhou is not real?

796
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Even if I arrest you,

797
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
if you don't admit it,

798
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I can't help you.

799
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Since that,

800
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
I won't bother you anymore.

801
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
By the way,

802
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Miss San and Yong Shoutang

803
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
were killed in the morning.

804
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
And my husband's house was also burned.

805
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
The Dali Temple

806
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
has found some clues.

807
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
It seems that they are all

808
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
the same as the female Han Fei.

809
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I have sent my best to investigate.

810
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Miss San,

811
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
wait for my good news.

812
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
I'll take my leave.

813
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
You...

814
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
You...

815
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
You...

816
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Fuyun Xi has asked you

817
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
to stay at my house

818
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
and find a place for your life first.

819
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
He wants to arrest me?

820
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Now it seems

821
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
that he just wants to

822
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
take advantage of me

823
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
with this.

824
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
What are your plans?

825
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,540
Yinan Guanyuan's annual ceremony

826
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,500
will be held by the Yinan Guanyuan

827
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,620
in the capital.

828
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,020
This year, the good person will be in the Zhuang family.

829
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,180
This will be

830
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,740
in the hands of Zhou Yi's mother.

831
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,140
She has been in charge of this for many years.

832
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,580
She is the first to grow up.

833
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,340
Once she becomes a city,

834
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
her mother will be more dangerous.

835
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,980
If you are here,

836
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,820
how can she become a city?

837
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,900
Be careful.

838
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,300
If there is anything wrong,

839
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,020
switch the lights on the front door

840
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,100
and switch to red.

841
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,540
Okay.

842
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,460
Yinan Guanyuan's annual ceremony

843
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,540
is ready.

844
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,940
I didn't expect that

845
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,860
this afternoon

846
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,020
she will prepare a wedding banquet first.

847
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,140
Wedding banquet?

848
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,180
For whom?

849
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,500
The two rooms of the Guanyuan are all full.

850
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,420
They are all the children of the school

851
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,620
who came to the capital from Yinan.

852
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,460
And some of their family members.

853
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,540
That's right.

854
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,460
It will be the spring festival in February next year.

855
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,140
It will be a good day.

856
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,220
Among these youth talents,

857
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,660
there are many good people.

858
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,700
They are waiting for the rain to come.

859
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,060
Don't worry, master.

860
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,180
It's just that there are many people.

861
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,460
I'm afraid that the people in the house won't be enough.

862
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,460
Why don't you let Yushan

863
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,380
help with the preparation of the ceremony?

864
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,420
Be strong.

865
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
There will be a good chance

866
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
for her to get married in the future.

867
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,340
Okay.

868
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,460
You can do it.

869
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,460
Yes, your share.

870
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,500
This bag of.

871
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,980
This bag.

872
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,580
Wang Xiong.

873
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
I'm going to take a look at this pot.

874
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
I'm still going to add some tea.

875
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Here.

876
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,620
Aunt, how is it?

877
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
The servant gave me some tea.

878
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,620
I'm going to take a look at this pot.

879
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,620
I'm going to take a look at this pot.

880
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,620
I'm going to take a look at this pot.

881
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,620
I gave the servant some silver.

882
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
I'm going to take a look at this pot.

883
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,620
Aunt, you're so lucky.

884
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,620
I'm not going to be like this.

885
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
I'm going to give Miss Er a choice.

886
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,620
But I don't want it.

887
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,620
I don't want it.

888
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,620
I don't want it either.

889
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,620
You're so hard-working.

890
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
Don't bother her.

891
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
Do you have a look at it?

892
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
Of course I do.

893
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,620
There's a good girl in the top eight in the top ten.

894
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
It's said that she's a good girl.

895
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
She's a good girl.

896
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
That's right.

897
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,620
She's a little bit more average.

898
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,620
She's a little bit more average.

899
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,620
What's her name?

900
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,620
Her name is He Wenshen.

901
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
He Wenshen?

902
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Let's take a look.

903
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,620
Yes.

904
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620
By the way,

905
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,620
did a man named Yang Ping come?

906
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,620
He's not a student.

907
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,620
He's a family member.

908
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,620
I don't know that.

909
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,620
I'll go and talk to him.

910
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,620
No.

911
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
Let's take this Yanxi's residence first.

912
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,620
There's nothing wrong with it.

913
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Yes.

914
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
Mr. Zhuang, please sit down.

915
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,620
It's not appropriate.

916
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,620
Mr. Zhuang is in the East today.

917
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,620
It's the same gathering.

918
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,620
What's the best place to sit here?

919
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,620
The New Year is hard to get into the capital.

920
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,620
Everyone is always preparing for the exam.

921
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,620
They're preparing for the school reunion.

922
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
I wonder if there's still this kind of meeting this year.

923
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,620
I've discussed it.

924
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
Tomorrow, we'll have a school reunion.

925
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620
Yes.

926
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
We'll have a school reunion.

927
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,620
Yes.

928
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,620
You've already started to mention it.

929
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,620
Do you want to participate in this event?

930
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,620
Forget it.

931
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
I won't follow the chaos.

932
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620
I won't participate in the school reunion.

933
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,620
I'll do everything.

934
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,620
You must participate.

935
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,620
You must take the exam.

936
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,620
You're on your end.

937
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
Master, it's already noon.

938
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,620
Why don't you start the ceremony?

939
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,620
Thank you for your help.

940
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Yes.

941
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,620
Everyone,

942
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,620
we're here to see the chef.

943
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,620
Today, I'm going to prepare a bowl of wine and a dish.

944
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,620
I'll serve you with a meal.

945
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,620
I'll end it here.

946
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,620
Everyone, please come in.

947
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,620
I wish you a happy New Year.

948
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,620
Please stand up.

949
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
Thank you.

950
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,620
How did we get to the sixth dish?

951
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,620
What?

952
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,620
Six dishes?

953
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,620
Six dishes?

954
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,620
What kind of rules?

955
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620
Six dishes?

956
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
If we had been in the past,

957
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,620
we'd have been so sad to celebrate New Year.

958
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,620
How can we get six dishes?

959
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
These people are so hard to serve.

960
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,620
According to Yinan's customs,

961
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,620
there are four or six dishes.

962
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Why?

963
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,620
This is the last dish

964
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,620
before the death of the deceased.

965
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,620
Dpless.

966
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,620
Break it.

967
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,620
So?

968
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,620
Didn't you hear my help?

969
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,620
δ cited by Elder Cup

970
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,620
Ruyi

971
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,620
you were so hard to serve,

972
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,620
and you can't serve more than six dishes.

973
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:15,480
they'd rather be dull than Leonardo's سพĳ為

975
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
What?

976
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,480
Come on.

977
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
I knew you would make a joke.

978
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
This is the seventh round.

979
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
You have a unique head,

980
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
and you have a blind eye.

981
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Of course, you can't miss the flower.

982
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
I will help you

983
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
to make a fake one

984
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,480
in front of all the young masters.

985
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
You are so stubborn.

986
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
Yes.

987
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,480
Go.

988
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,480
This girl

989
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,480
is the daughter of the Zhuang family's mother.

990
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
She is the daughter of the three ladies.

991
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
Brother Long,

992
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,480
you have a good daughter.

993
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
She is rich and virtuous.

994
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
She is a good girl.

995
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Come on.

996
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
Come on.

997
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Come on.

998
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
Come on.

999
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Come on.

1000
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
Come on.

1001
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Han Yan.

1002
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,480
Where did you get the whiteboard?

1003
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,480
It's a common board in the temple.

1004
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,480
Father wants to win.

1005
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
You are so smart.

1006
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
Go.

1007
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Come on.

1008
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,480
Come on.

1009
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Sit here.

1010
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
Sit next to me.

1011
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,480
Father, I don't think this is a good rule.

1012
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
Sit next to me.

1013
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,480
Why don't you follow the rules?

1014
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
Father,

1015
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
this is my position.

1016
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Yuchi,

1017
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,480
you are all so filial.

1018
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,480
You are so talented.

1019
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
You go inside.

1020
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,480
You can talk to everyone.

1021
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
Come on.

1022
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,480
I still have a good feeling about this.

1023
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,480
But father is right.

1024
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480
I have no teacher.

1025
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
I am a teacher.

1026
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,480
I have learned a lot from you.

1027
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,480
I should teach you all.

1028
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I will be sure to have a good lesson tomorrow.

1029
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Who said I have a good lesson?

1030
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,480
I just need to teach you.

1031
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
Why do you need to teach me?

1032
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,480
It seems that you are really talented this time.

1033
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,480
I can only be a teacher.

1034
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
Han Yan, come on.

1035
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,480
Sit next to me.

1036
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480
Sit.

1037
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Everyone, it's time to start.

1038
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
You go first.

1039
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
One more cup.

1040
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,480
Come on.

1041
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,480
Come on.

1042
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,480
Miss San is so lucky.

1043
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,480
She is in the air today.

1044
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,480
But who is the master?

1045
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
Xiao Niang,

1046
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,480
you are so funny.

1047
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,480
Sit down.

1048
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
Yes.

1049
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,480
Eat well.

1050
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,480
Of course, someone will punish her.

1051
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,480
Han Yan,

1052
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,480
since you were little,

1053
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,480
you have been very clear about the Yidamism.

1054
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,480
You will be in charge of the Great Jin Dynasty.

1055
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,480
You can help me to make a good family.

1056
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,480
I am afraid that I am young.

1057
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1058
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,480
Han Yan, although you are young,

1059
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,480
you are talented.

1060
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Everyone is watching you today.

1061
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Don't say that again.

1062
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,480
Then,

1063
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,480
I will not let father down.

1064
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,480
I will not let father down.

1065
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,480
Zhuang Han Yan.

1066
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,480
You haven't seen him for days.

1067
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
You can also call him

1068
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480
the virtuous man.

1069
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1070
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1071
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1072
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1073
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1074
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1075
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1076
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1077
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1078
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1079
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1080
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1081
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1082
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1083
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1084
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
But I can't be just a good person.

1085
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,480
I am afraid that I can't be a good person.

1086
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,480
For some people,

1087
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,480
I feel sorry,

1088
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,140
to enjoy it.

1089
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,480
But others also have their own problems.

1090
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,280
I am afraid that for some people,

1091
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,460
I am not to be killed in resistance,

1092
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,740
I will keep my promise.

1093
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,040
Although we know that we will go together,

1094
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
we will dream together.
