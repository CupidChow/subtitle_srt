1
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280
It's rare for Yunxi
to have a meal at home.

3
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
Yunxi, try this.

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,280
Your aunt specially made these

5
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,770
(Six years ago)
for you.

6
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,760
Eat more.

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,350
You must've been too busy with work

8
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,560
to have regular meals.

9
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,050
Look at you. You've lost weight.

10
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,790
Sorry for worrying you, Mother.

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,110
If you don't want us to worry,

12
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,840
you should find someone

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,150
who cares for you.

14
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,230
I know that your mind

15
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,950
is set on your work,

16
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,410
and you have no interest in romance.

17
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,910
But a man must marry.

18
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,230
You should start a family
and then work on your career.

19
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,430
Besides, your marriage
with a Zhuang girl

20
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,550
was arranged long ago.

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,950
If you continue to delay the wedding,

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,880
others may think

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,390
we are intentionally rejecting them,

24
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,080
which would be improper.

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,030
Exactly.

26
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,790
Yuqin, their eldest daughter,

27
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,950
though born of a concubine,

28
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,420
was raised by her grandmother

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,200
from a young age.

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,360
She is truly gentle

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,040
and refined.

32
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,360
You two look perfect together.

33
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
You would make a fine match.

34
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,390
Your aunt is right.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,880
Yunxi,

36
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,670
I don't mean to lecture you,

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
but you should consider

38
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,670
your parents' feelings.

39
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,870
Back then, your parents

40
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,320
took you in as their own,

41
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,300
not only because of their kindness

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,550
and compassion

43
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,990
but also because they had no children

44
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,790
and hoped you'd continue
the family line.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,640
Now that they are growing old,

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,320
if not you,

47
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,360
then who can they rely on?

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080
I am ashamed.

49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,860
I did not think things through.

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,480
Don't listen to your aunt's nonsense.

51
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,440
Your father and I did have
such thoughts back then,

52
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,790
but at most, that accounted for 20%.

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,760
As for the other 80%,

54
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,550
we only wished for you

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,390
to live a life of peace and joy,

56
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,360
to find someone who understands you,

57
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,950
and to have children to care for you.

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,960
Otherwise, when your father
and I are gone,

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,670
how could I rest in peace
knowing you'd be

60
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,480
left alone in this world?

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,230
I only fear

62
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,320
that I will wrong Miss Zhuang Yuqin.

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,390
Don't worry.

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,080
Yuqin has already agreed.

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,830
We're only waiting for you to say yes.

66
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,300
(Happiness)

67
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,900
(A year later)

68
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,240
Don't drink it, Yuqin.

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,470
Someone!

70
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,560
(Spirit Table of Zhuang Yuqin)
Yuqin, if your spirit lingers,

71
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,640
please bless Yunxi

72
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,640
so he can find the one who poisoned you.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,910
The one who killed Yuqin

74
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,270
was me.

75
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,440
That poisoned wine

76
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,000
was meant for me.

77
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,990
Yunxi...

78
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,510
Yuqin was pure and kind

79
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,350
and grew up at her home.

80
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,680
But I served in the Judicial Review,

81
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,150
judging cases of the damned,

82
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,200
stained by the blood of demons,

83
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,030
and surrounded by conspiracies

84
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,150
and deceit.

85
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,200
I should've foreseen this day.

86
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,590
You've spent your life
hunting criminals,

87
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,120
enduring hardship and danger,

88
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,310
yet in the end,

89
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,470
can't you even have the simple happiness

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,470
of a peaceful family life?

91
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,760
A peaceful family life...

92
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,740
=Episode 17=

93
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,030
You become my wife,

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,320
and I will be your strategist.

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,510
Within one year,

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,680
I will make you the noblest lady
in the Capital.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,920
What do you think?

98
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,270
Why did you

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,760
choose me?

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,390
On the first day
you entered the Capital,

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,000
the moment we met,

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,360
I could sense a special scent

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,800
in you.

104
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,240
It did not belong
to a delicate young lady

105
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,590
or a sheltered noblewoman.

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,440
However fragile and innocent
you pretend to be,

107
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,390
and however many people you deceive,

108
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,240
you can't fool me.

109
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,280
With just one glance,

110
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,880
I knew

111
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,830
that perhaps

112
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,450
you were the one I had been looking for.

113
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,040
Your family's old grievances
are tangled,

114
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,800
and the relationships
in the inner chambers

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,840
are even more intricate.

116
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,000
Yet you move within them
like a fish in water,

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,590
handling everything with ease.

118
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,910
That note was instructed by me
to be hidden in a candle.

119
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,320
Vague as it was,

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,070
(Arms tattooed with "Thief")
you still knew

121
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,310
what it meant immediately.

122
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,910
You are truly sharp.

123
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,590
Again and again, I approached you,

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,920
tempted you,

125
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,830
hoping to extract the truth

126
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,880
about the Danzhou case from you.

127
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,000
Yet you never trusted me.

128
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,800
Your caution

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,200
is indeed rare.

130
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,150
When Chai Jing took the blame
and was arrested,

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,830
I observed you once more.

132
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,640
You are ruthless when you need to be,

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,320
but you also value loyalty
above all else.

134
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,350
When your family fell into peril,

135
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,230
you remained calm and turned the tide

136
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,990
by carrying the corpse
to save your family.

137
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
To achieve your goals,

138
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,390
you even tried to kill me.

139
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,440
Each and every one of these moments

140
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,360
can prove that you're capable

141
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,150
of protecting your family.

142
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,200
Mr. Fu, you don't need

143
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,350
a gentle and virtuous wife.

144
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,910
Instead, you want
someone presumptuous like me

145
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,510
who has blood on their hands?

146
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,830
What a rare choice.

147
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,080
What I am doing

148
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,150
is not to seek a wife

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,290
but to find an ally.

150
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,860
Mr. Fu, thank you for your recognition.

151
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,950
But you have far-reaching power.

152
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,830
Why go to such lengths

153
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,390
to seek a weak woman
like me as your ally?

154
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,000
Over the years,

155
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,780
due to my duties in the Judicial Review,

156
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,680
I've made many enemies in the Capital.

157
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,630
Countless people want to take my life.

158
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,030
In such a perilous environment

159
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,520
where dangers lurk,

160
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,440
when I fall asleep every night,

161
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,950
I don't know if I'll see
the morning sun again.

162
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,710
However,

163
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,280
my mother is old, and Lingzhi is young.

164
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,400
I can't neglect their future.

165
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,560
You want to sacrifice a woman's life

166
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,160
to protect your family?

167
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,990
What I have just told you

168
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,520
is not a request

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,080
but a deal.

170
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,500
I've been planning this for a long time,

171
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,440
but it was your words
at the Lantern Festival

172
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
that made me decide

173
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,870
to bring this matter up to you.

174
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,030
If you want to marry someone else,

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,830
support your husband,
and raise children,

176
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,400
the marriage contract
will no longer matter.

177
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,120
From now on,

178
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,510
I will not make things hard for you.

179
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,200
You and I will have no further ties.

180
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,320
But if you are willing to marry me

181
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,840
and become my wife,

182
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,470
I will not take your chastity,

183
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,110
but I can be your stepping stone

184
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,350
and your ladder to the clouds.

185
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,710
With my power and ability,

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,480
I'll help you get everything you want

187
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,710
and elevate you to a high position.

188
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,060
Zhuang Hanyan,

189
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,500
this is a deal.

190
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,220
We'll both take what we need.

191
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,660
Whether you agree or not
is entirely up to you.

192
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,540
I will never force you.

193
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,020
If you remain silent,

194
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,340
I will take it as a refusal.

195
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,820
So, you have a clear purpose

196
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,460
for everything you've done.

197
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,180
Indeed.

198
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,340
This is in line with your usual style.

199
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,540
It's getting late.

200
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,740
Mr. Fu, you should go back.

201
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,100
(I can feel his sincerity.)

202
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,300
(But this sincerity)

203
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,700
(contradicts my expectations.)

204
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,460
(Are all his schemes)

205
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,180
(solely because of my abilities?)

206
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,500
(Hasn't he had any feelings for me?)

207
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,100
(If we were to become allies,)

208
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,980
(could I truly)

209
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,180
(trust you?)

210
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
(Flying Swan on Snow)

211
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,420
Miss.

212
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,860
Miss?

213
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,340
What's on your mind?

214
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,540
It's nothing.

215
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,620
Ms. Tan, let me walk you out.

216
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,300
Miss Hanyan,

217
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,100
I just noticed Mrs. Zhuang's bruises
all over her body.

218
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,980
There's almost no place
to apply acupuncture.

219
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,420
It must be due to her daily practice
of walking.

220
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,780
Miss Hanyan, please take extra care,

221
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,260
and don't let her push herself too hard.

222
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,980
Thank you for the reminder, Ms. Tan.

223
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,660
I should've prescribed some corydalis

224
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,520
to help invigorate the blood,
dispel the bruises, and relieve pain,

225
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,140
but the medicine has been out of stock
in the Capital recently.

226
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,740
Miss Hanyan, please check the pharmacies

227
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,090
to see if there are any left.

228
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,100
Yes, I will look into it.

229
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,020
If you can't find any,

230
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,460
go to Mr. Fu and ask for some.

231
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,550
He took all of it

232
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,380
from the Imperial Hospital.

233
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Fu Yunxi?

234
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,540
Was he injured?

235
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,700
It was due to the case of Duke Shunping.

236
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,200
Mr. Fu failed to conduct
the interrogation properly

237
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,700
and mistakenly killed a Duke.

238
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,400
Not only was he dismissed from his post,

239
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
but he was also canned at Yongding Gate.

240
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,020
If he hadn't fainted on the spot

241
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,720
and been carried
to the Imperial Hospital,

242
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,420
I wouldn't have had the time
to notice that.

243
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,300
When did this happen?

244
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,780
It was probably

245
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,660
around the Lantern Festival.

246
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,780
You...

247
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,660
Did you get hurt on your back?

248
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,300
It's a small wound. It's nothing.

249
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,060
What's wrong?

250
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,540
Do you know where he's being treated?

251
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,500
Nanshan Clinic.

252
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,180
(Nanshan Clinic)

253
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,860
This wound is deep to the bone.

254
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,940
If it's not treated properly,

255
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,620
it could turn into an ulcer.

256
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,660
Physician Wu,

257
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,820
please advise him to take care of this.

258
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,000
He's been running around all day

259
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,920
and not treating the injury seriously.

260
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,260
Mr. Fu,

261
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,220
if you receive more canes,

262
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,540
your life could be in danger.

263
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,900
You have a mother and a daughter.

264
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,540
For their sake,

265
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,180
you should

266
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,100
take better care of yourself.

267
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,740
Thank you for your kindness,
Physician Wu.

268
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,980
My pleasure.

269
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,580
The gauze is running out.

270
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,140
I'll go fetch some more.

271
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,900
Please wait, Mr. Fu.

272
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,820
Sure.

273
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,820
My Lord,

274
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,380
there's a draught here.

275
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,960
Be careful not to catch a cold.

276
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,660
Please, sit here.

277
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,260
Come on.

278
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,820
This is too serious.

279
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,380
Here.

280
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,620
In the past, the most important things

281
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,300
in your eyes

282
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,160
were only Lingzhi and your mother.

283
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,660
But now,

284
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,020
to save Miss Hanyan
who values her mother,

285
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,860
you've left your own family behind.

286
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,580
It's a matter of priorities.

287
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,460
Because I cherish my loved ones,

288
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,420
I can understand how she must've felt.

289
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,820
Why don't you tell her?

290
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,900
You secretly helped her

291
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,900
remove her name
from her family register, right?

292
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,500
Stop talking nonsense.

293
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,220
Her mother did that.

294
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,540
I was a step too late.

295
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,680
What difference does it make?

296
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,980
Anyway,

297
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,700
you never intended to harm her.

298
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,060
You even left her a way out.

299
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,540
What's more,

300
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,740
you knew that once Wu Youzhi's body
was discovered,

301
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,700
you'd be dismissed

302
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,980
and canned,

303
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,140
yet you still hid in the bamboo forest,

304
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,940
watching Miss Hanyan take the body

305
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,020
and bring it to the Capital,

306
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,700
while you

307
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,020
silently took all the blame.

308
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,460
My Lord,

309
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,180
how affectionate of you.

310
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,740
If you keep spouting nonsense,

311
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll cut out your tongue.

312
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,600
What nonsense have I said?

313
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,740
You've done so much for her,

314
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,760
yet you've never

315
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,220
let Miss Hanyan know.

316
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,020
You even said you proposed to her

317
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,140
because you wanted her
to protect your family.

318
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,980
Of course, she'd reject you.

319
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,220
She probably even thought

320
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,800
you had ulterior motives.

321
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,040
To investigate the case
of the adopted son,

322
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,060
I nearly harmed her family before.

323
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,860
She has every right
to hate and suspect me.

324
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,980
If I had told her about it,

325
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,220
it would have felt

326
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,940
like I was forcing her to repay me.

327
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,060
That's not what I wanted.

328
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,860
She should follow her heart

329
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,500
to decide whether to marry me.

330
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,340
Moreover,

331
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,300
I do want something from her.

332
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,100
That's the reason why I proposed.

333
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,020
I don't believe it.

334
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,860
You've risked your life and tried
every possible way to protect her.

335
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,840
Is that really just part of your plan?

336
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,100
Is there no real feeling involved?

337
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,420
I'll assume you have feelings for her.

338
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,200
You were married before.

339
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,660
What's there to be embarrassed about?

340
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,580
Get out.

341
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,120
You're flustered because I hit the mark.

342
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,400
My Lord, don't be upset.

343
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,140
I'll head back to the Judicial Review.

I can stand up now.

- Mother.

Why does it feel like it's dead?

371
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,420
Mother.

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,380
Mother.

375
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Don't be angry.

376
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,060
You were able to stand for a moment
after losing your cane,

377
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,900
which is already a great improvement.

378
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,660
With such a chronic illness,

379
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,660
you must give yourself more time.

380
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,460
Hanyan,

381
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,260
if my legs

382
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
can't be cured...

Mother, have you thought about this?

387
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,140
Maybe your disease is not

388
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,180
the only reason
that your legs can't move.

389
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,420
It may partly be because your legs

390
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,700
carry too much anger and hatred.

391
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,680

Ms. Tan ordered me

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,140
to let go of my anger.

477
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,220
Mr. Yuwen invited me to leave
and live in seclusion.

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,300
if my legs heal,

480
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,580
it would be like living a second life.

481
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,780

485
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,020
If I miss the second one today,

486
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,980
it would be like he's ruined my life.

487
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,940
Perhaps it's time to let go

488
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,940
of those old grievances from the past.

489
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,800
Mother, have you decided to leave?

490
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,620
20 years ago,

491
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,060
I married Zhuang Shiyang openly

492
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,860
through the main gate.

493
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,620
Now, if I want to leave,

494
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,900
I don't want to sneak away unnoticed.

495
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,700
I want to leave openly too.

496
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,780
I want to divorce him.

497
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,940
I don't think Father

498
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,860
will sign the divorce letter.

499
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,500
If I can't get the divorce letter,

500
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,820
even if I leave the residence,

501
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
I'll still be Zhuang Shiyang's wife
for this life.

502
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,580
I despise this disgusting title.

503
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,300
I want to sever all ties with him

504
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,340
completely and thoroughly.

505
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,380
Mother,

506
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,140
leave this to me.

507
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,780
I'll talk to him.

508
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,080
You don't have to intervene.

509
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,660
Let me try.

510
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,620
For now, just focus
on recovering your health.

511
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,660
That's your top priority.

512
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,900
Do you have a way?

513
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,360
One should strike the enemy
on their weakness.

514
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,780
Mother, have you forgotten

515
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,260
what Father is most afraid of?

516
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,140
Only the matter of the adopted son.

517
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,060
- You...
- Mother, don't worry.

518
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,940
I won't act rashly.

519
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,460
After discussing with Fu Yunxi,

520
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,860
I'll plan accordingly.

521
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,860
Actually, I've been meaning to ask you.

522
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,620
Since Fu Yunxi
has made his feelings clear,

523
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,660
what are your plans?

524
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,300
What if I say

525
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,180
I want to stay?

526
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,460
Do you intend to marry him?

527
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,580
For me,

528
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,980
he's at least a good ally.

529
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,060
Hanyan,

530
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,100
what do you think is
the most precious feeling

531
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,900
between people?

532
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,460
Love?

533
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,380
Cherishing?

534
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,580
No.

535
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,700
It's trust.

536
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,220
Life is full of hardships and setbacks.

537
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,860
Before marriage,

538
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,260
your life ally is your parents.

539
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,820
After marriage,

540
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,500
your life ally becomes your husband.

541
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,740
Is Fu Yunxi

542
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,500
someone you can truly trust?

543
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,260
I am willing

544
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,380
to trust him once.

545
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,900
Hanyan,

546
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,220
before, I encouraged you to pursue love,

547
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,060
but today, I must remind you

548
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,900
that in the eyes of the world,

549
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,660
a virtuous wife and good mother

550
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,900
are the highest praises for women.

551
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,900
But you must love yourself

552
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,940
and choose to be yourself

553
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,220
before becoming a good wife

554
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,620
and a good mother.

555
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,980
I have worked tirelessly to heal my legs

556
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,500
in order to pursue my own life.

557
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,540
Whoever you marry in the future,

558
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,940
I hope you will not rely
on others to live

559
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,700
or live for others.

560
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,500
I shall remember your teachings.

561
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,860
(Chaling Tavern)

562
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,020
Miss Hanyan,

563
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,420
why did you change your mind so quickly?

564
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,340
Fu Yunxi,

565
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,180
can I trust you?

566
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,460
I just want to tell you

567
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,660
I've never wanted to harm you.

568
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,940
But you

569
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,620
still have secrets.

570
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,860
Everyone has secrets.

571
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,940
Even ordinary couples

572
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,220
rarely have complete honesty.

573
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,340
If I agree to marry you,

574
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,340
can you agree to two conditions?

575
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,020
What are they?

576
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,180
The first condition is

577
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,580
that from now on,

578
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,420
I won't ask you to be completely open,

579
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,540
but no matter when I have doubts

580
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,940
and ask you,

581
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,980
you can't hide anything from me,

582
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,860
and you must answer truthfully.

583
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,860
Can you do that?

584
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,140
I promise you.

585
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,660
The second condition is

586
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,500
a divorce letter.

587
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,420
My mother has decided
to let go of old grudges

588
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,460
and will leave here
to live in seclusion,

589
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,060
but before that,

590
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,660
I must get Zhuang Shiyang

591
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,140
to sign the divorce letter.

592
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,940
What do you want me to do?

593
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,860
You were so certain before

594
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,060
that Zhuang Shiyang
is Pei's adopted son.

595
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,700
I need the evidence of this asap.

596
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,820
Your father hides his cleverness
in simplicity.

597
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,540
If it were so easy to get evidence,

598
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,060
I would've already imprisoned him.

599
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,740
I know this won't be easy,

600
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
so I need you

601
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,860
to work with me on this.

602
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,020
Though it's hard to obtain evidence,

603
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,460
if we can make him admit it in person,

604
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,460
perhaps that could be
leverage to force him

605
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,060
to sign the divorce letter.

606
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,340
Do you have a way?

607
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,500
Do you know why I was so sure

608
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,580
that Zhuang Shiyang is likely
Pei's adopted son?

609
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,180
I asked you before,

610
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,980
but you didn't tell me the truth.

611
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,420
The head of the Danzhou
Chamber of Commerce

612
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,420
testified that in June two years ago,

613
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,340
he met Pei's adopted son in Danzhou.

614
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,380
When I returned to the Capital,

615
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,980
I investigated the whereabouts

616
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,860
of the 12 officials
from Yinan two years ago,

617
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,660
including my late father.

618
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,260
11 of them never left the Capital.

619
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,460
Only Zhuang Shiyang
claimed to be ill at home,

620
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,540
so his whereabouts were uncertain.

621
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,500
Since it was uncertain,

622
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,540
it means

623
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,500
there is no definitive proof.

624
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,020
There's one more thing.

625
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,940
Years ago,

626
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,500
Pei Dafu once invited me

627
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,620
to a banquet at his house.

628
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,820
At the banquet,

629
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,660
there was a famous dish from Yinan

630
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,180
called Blessings and Longevity.

631
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,180
(Pei Dafu, Seal-holding Director)
It combines all sorts of delicacies,

632
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,980
and its preparation is very complex.

633
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,700
The taste is naturally
delicious and unique.

634
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,020
In early autumn of last year,

635
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,960
at a family banquet at your home,

636
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,980
I was surprised to taste the same thing.

637
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,940
Based on my vague memory,

638
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,140
I felt

639
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,740
that it tasted exactly like the one

640
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,740
at Pei Dafu's longevity banquet.

641
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,140
At that time, I was just suspicious.

642
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,440
I thought maybe Zhuang Shiyang
who seemed to long for peace

643
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,500
had secret ties with Pei Dafu.

644
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,220
But my trip to Danzhou made me certain

645
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,820
that Pei's adopted son
hiding in the mist

646
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,420
was Zhuang Shiyang.

647
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,300
I see.

648
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,820
That dish is very complicated
to prepare.

649
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,120
Only those deeply interested
in cooking can handle it.

650
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,440
I also worried about wrongly accusing
someone innocent,

651
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,040
so I later tasted dishes
at various restaurants in the Capital,

652
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,640
but even if someone
could replicate the dish,

653
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,500
the taste was different each time.

654
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,020
Have you ever

655
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,580
drunk Jinhua wine?

656
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Of course, I have.

657
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,220
Did that dish

658
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,900
have a hint of Jinhua wine flavor?

659
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,260
Since you mentioned it,
it did taste like that.

660
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
How do you know?

661
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,380
When I was in Danzhou, I heard

662
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,820
that the key to that dish

663
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,660
lies in using aged wine for flavoring.

664
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,820
Since I returned home,

665
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,860
I noticed that my father used
homemade Jinhua wine in his cooking.

666
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,580
I suppose that's why

667
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,700
the taste was so unique,

668
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,300
and that's how you noticed the clue.

669
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,100
It seems indeed so.

670
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,340
So, you want to use this dish

671
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,500
to lure him out?

672
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,780
It won't be easy,

673
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,220
but if you and I work together,

674
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
we may succeed.

675
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,940
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

676
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,420
Master.

677
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,180
Ruyin,

678
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,740
where did this dish come from?

679
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,940
Master, isn't this your signature dish?

680
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,300
But I

681
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,580
didn't cook today.

682
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,100
Father.

683
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,460
Everyone, leave.

684
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,660
Master?

685
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,580
Leave.

686
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,860
Yes.

687
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,340
(Visit the old place to meet
with the Director at the Zi hour.)

688
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Master,

689
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,540
how come you got up by yourself?

690
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,940
Let me help you dress.

691
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
No need.

692
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,300
You rest for now.

693
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,660
Master, this...

694
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,580
What's wrong?

695
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,860
This...

696
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,280
Where did these eunuch clothes
come from?

697
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,220
Master, forgive me.

698
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,820
I don't know either.

699
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,060
This...

700
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,380
Visit the old place

701
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,660
to meet with the Director

702
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,620
at the Zi hour.

703
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,140
Master, what does this mean?

704
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,340
Don't touch it.

705
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,540
Master, forgive me.

706
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,780
I was just dividing the dishes,

707
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,540
but I didn't expect...

708
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,820
Leave. Leave.

709
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,740
Yes, yes.

710
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,540
On such a cold night,

711
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,620
I have to feed this beast.

712
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,580
It's really more precious than humans.

713
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,540
Eat, eat.

714
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,620
Who's there?

715
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,420
Help! There's an assassin!

716
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,260
- Shut up.
- Please spare me.

717
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,180
I'm just a servant,

718
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,460
not the master.

719
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,940
Go tell Zhuang Shiyang

720
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,780
that an old friend wants to meet him.

721
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,620
An old friend?

722
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,860
This is a secret. Don't let anyone know.

723
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,140
Go now.

724
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,260
Mr. Zhuang,

725
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,060
long time no see.

726
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,580
May I ask who you are?

727
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Consultant Huang?

728
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,220
Don't be afraid.

729
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,780
I'm not a ghost.

730
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,060
Weren't you killed by Fu Yunxi?

731
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,580
Many people saw it.

732
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,020
Seeing isn't necessarily believing.

733
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,580
What's going on?

734
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,660
I only found out today

735
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,060
that Director Pei's secret, elusive,

736
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,740
and mysterious adopted son

737
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,260
was actually you, Mr. Zhuang.

738
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,300
You old fox.

739
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,740
You've hidden yourself well.

740
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,220
What are you talking about?

741
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,340
There's no need for the act anymore.

742
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,940
I'm here tonight

743
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,260
on Mr. Pei's orders

744
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,060
to ask you to meet him at the old place.

745
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,940
What old place?

746
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,340
Are you human or a ghost?

747
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,580
Stop spouting nonsense.

748
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,590
It seems

749
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,220
you've underestimated Mr. Pei.

750
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,940
He didn't commit suicide out
of guilt in prison.

751
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,420
It's a trick to fool others

752
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,260
so he could escape.

753
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,420
Moreover,

754
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,940
Mr. Pei is destined to live long.

755
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,060
Even if both of us are buried,

756
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,940
he can still live on.

757
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,620
You're a remnant of the Pei faction.

758
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,740
Don't speak nonsense here.

759
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,780
In three days,

760
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,740
Mr. Pei will head to the South Seas
to retreat from the world.

761
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,460
Tonight's meeting is to collect

762
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,860
the wealth you manage on his behalf.

763
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,100
I've delivered the message.

764
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,940
If you don't believe it,

765
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,180
Mr. Pei himself will come to see you.

766
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,180
Mr. Zhuang,

767
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,780
take care of yourself.

768
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,340
Goodbye.

769
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,180
Three quarters past the Zi hour,

770
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,060
there should be no trouble.

771
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,980
The weather is dry.

772
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,820
Be careful with the fire.

773
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,940
(Temple of Guan Yu)

774
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,500
Mr. Zhuang.

775
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,780
Yunxi.

776
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,700
Hanyan.

777
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,600
I'm here on a case as the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review.

778
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,060
It is not about blood ties

779
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,620
but about right and wrong.

780
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,700
Father,

781
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,100
I've never fully believed

782
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,980
Mother and Mr. Fu's accusations

783
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,580
against you.

784
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,660
If you hadn't shown up tonight,

785
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
you'd have fooled me completely.

786
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,300
With your acting skills,

787
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,220
you could have made a great career

788
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,700
in the theater.

789
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,900
Come home with me.

790
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,700
I have something important to tell you.

791
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,420
What huge lie

792
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,500
can't you tell me here?

793
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,220
Mr. Zhuang,

794
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,260
at this point,

795
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,780
you should stop acting.

796
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,220
Don't let him manipulate you,

797
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,540
or our family will truly be
in great danger.

798
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,420
Don't you care about your mother?

799
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,020
It's precisely for my mother's sake

800
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,620
that I've carefully set this trap.

801
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,900
Father, you've fallen into the trap.

802
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,060
It's time to confess.

803
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,780
Is Pei's adopted son

804
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,380
really you?

805
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,860
Mr. Huang only said

806
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,620
you should go to the old place tonight,

807
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,460
yet you managed to find
this remote, broken temple.

808
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,220
If you're not the adopted son,

809
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,620
who else could be?

810
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,380
I did find this temple,

811
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,100
but you were also waiting here.

812
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,780
It was you who invited Mr. Huang, right?

813
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,740
He said with confidence

814
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,620
that Mr. Pei would go to the South Seas
in three days

815
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,860
and that Mr. Pei would come
to take the money.

816
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,580
He lied.

817
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,220
Mr. Pei is already dead.

818
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
Why are you so sure

819
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,220
that Pei Dafu is certainly dead

820
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,700
and could never return?

821
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,520
Pei Dafu was arrogant
and valued his life greatly.

822
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,420
His suicide out of guilt
in the imperial prison

823
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,060
was just the story for the public.

824
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,660
The real cause of death

825
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,540
was the long-term ingestion
of chronic poison,

826
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,460
which had corroded his body,

827
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,000
leading to his sudden death in prison.

828
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,420
This is highly secret,

829
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,740
and few know of it.

830
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,420
Mr. Zhuang, did you

831
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,260
also poison him yourself?

832
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,460
Since you know

833
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,140
that Pei Dafu could never be alive,

834
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,900
why are you here tonight?

835
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,940
Hanyan,

836
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,420
I came for you.

837
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,980
Come back with me.

838
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,140
I can tell you everything.

839
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,620
Don't help this man
with ulterior motives.

840
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,380
It will harm us,

841
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,340
your mother,

842
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,380
and the entire family.

843
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,300
Come back with me.

844
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,180
Mr. Fu, you keep pressuring me.

845
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,660
What good does it to you?

846
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,300
Though I am temporarily suspended,

847
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,500
I am still the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review,

848
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,820
responsible for arresting

849
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,260
the remnants of the Pei faction.

850
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,260
You are trying
to seize Mr. Pei's wealth.

851
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,580
So, you admit at last

852
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,540
that you're Pei Dafu's adopted son.

853
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,140
Seizing his wealth?

854
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,460
What else?

855
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,380
Mr. Fu,

856
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,260
why do you have to harm me?

857
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,940
Please spare Hanyan.

858
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,260
Why make her take such risks?

859
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,860
I've come tonight, taking the bait
and risking everything,

860
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,900
just to save my daughter.

861
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,580
Please stop turning
my daughter against me.

862
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,060
Mr. Zhuang, you're truly a master

863
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,780
at manipulating people's minds.

864
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,660
Mr. Fu, don't be so stubborn.

865
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,460
Mr. Pei is dead.

866
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,580
Both of us used to be helpless.

867
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,860
Why make things hard for me?

868
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,060
Tonight, I'm here

869
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,980
to seek peace.

870
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,300
As long as you agree to stop,

871
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,860
we can live in peace.

872
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,940
We don't have
to fight each other to death.

873
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,740
Fight each other to death?

874
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,740
What does that mean?

875
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,340
Fu Yunxi,

876
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,380
is there something
you're hiding from me?

877
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,820
Silly girl,

878
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,660
he's hiding many things from you.

879
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,180
There's a rumor in the Capital

880
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,860
that Mr. Fu is full of schemes.

881
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,860
He's lived up to his reputation.

882
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,540
He's using you

883
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,900
to get close to our family
and investigate me in secret.

884
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,020
His goal

885
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,200
is to seize the wealth.

886
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,660
After the fall of the Zuohang Gang,

887
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,080
the Emperor ordered to clear
the remnants of the Pei faction.

888
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,880
I'm sure you've been living in fear

889
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,020
and unable to sleep at night.

890
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,180
You keep saying

891
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,740
you want to root out the adopted son,

892
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,620
but you're actually trying
to protect your own life.

893
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,500
Could it be

894
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,940
you're also involved with Pei Dafu?

895
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,620
Not just that.

896
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,540
This mess in the Capital

897
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,340
is Mr. Fu's way of covering for himself.

898
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,580
I've made it clear.

899
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,060
I am indeed Pei Dafu's adopted son.

900
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,500
Though I've helped him
manage his wealth,

901
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,380
I have never harmed anyone.

902
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,660
You...

903
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,980
If you hadn't pushed me so hard,

904
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,900
I wouldn't have guessed who you are.

905
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,820
Is there any law

906
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,220
that says Pei Dafu

907
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,420
can only have one adopted son?

908
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,380
So,

909
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,140
you, Fu Yunxi,

910
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,840
are also a remnant of the Zuohang Gang

911
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,820
and an adopted son of Pei?

912
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,100
You promised me

913
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,900
that whenever I asked you,
you'd tell me the truth.

914
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,660
So, tell me.

915
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,380
Is Pei's adopted son

916
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,420
really you?

917
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,780
Yes.
