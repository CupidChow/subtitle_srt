00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,250
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

4
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,740
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

5
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,100
(Scholarly Glory)

6
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Come on.

7
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,520
Mr. Yuwen, any news from the Palace?

8
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,280
Have you got any results?

9
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Mr. Yuwen,

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
we should be brought to the Supervision.

11
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,590
Why have we been locked here?

12
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,430
- Yes.
- Exactly.

13
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,030
This case is of great importance.

14
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,630
The details can't be disclosed.

15
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
I've said before

16
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,280
that tonight, there are 12 households

17
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,030
in the guild hall,

18
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,910
and Pei Dafu's adopted son

19
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,470
is one of the heads of these households.

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,030
If you have any clues,

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,360
please report them at once.

22
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,030
Otherwise...

23
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Otherwise, what?

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,560
Do you plan to kill us?

25
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Young Master Zaiye,

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,030
you don't understand.

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,470
Tonight, all the people here

28
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
are already halfway

29
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,430
in the gates of hell.

30
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,070
The Emperor has granted me
the Imperial Sword,

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,870
which gives me the right
to execute before report.

32
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,750
After the Zi hour tonight,

33
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,310
I will execute one person

34
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,840
every two hours

35
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,720
until you reveal the identity

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,680
of Pei Dafu's adopted son.

37
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,470
- Mother!
- Mother...

38
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,710
Mom,

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,360
Father is innocent.

40
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,590
Right?

41
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Mom.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,240
Speak up, Mom.

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
It's over.

44
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Completely over.

45
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,030
Don't be afraid.

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,400
What should we do, Yushan?

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
What are you going to do?

48
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,070
This must be related to you.

49
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,360
Tell me the truth.

50
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,830
What makes you think it's related to me?

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,240
You and Mr. Yuwen
have met twice at night,

52
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,360
mentioning a major plan.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A few days ago,

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,430
you vaguely told me

55
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,070
that I'd soon understand everything.

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
Since returning to the Capital,

57
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,080
I've sensed that you hold
some hidden resentment toward Father.

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
But where does this hatred come from?

59
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,510
Do you want

60
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,390
to take this opportunity

61
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,120
to frame Father
as Pei Dafu's adopted son

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,240
as the madam of the family?

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
Nanny Chen,

64
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,870
Miss Hanyan has gone mad with fear.

65
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,830
Make her stay away from me.

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Miss Hanyan,

67
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,480
please don't make it hard for me.

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,750
It's not me who is mad; it's you.

69
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,680
The whole family
might be executed for this.

70
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,950
Shut your mouth.

71
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,070
Fu Yunxi,

72
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,560
you've been in charge

73
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,240
of the Zuohang Gang case all along.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,050
After investigating for so long,

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
haven't you found any clues?

76
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,600
If I had found any clues,

77
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,040
how could I end up like this?

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,240
I think you're covering things up

79
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
and too scared to go deeper.

80
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,560
Even the eunuchs are gossiping,

81
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,610
saying that your father
likely died last year

82
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,830
by suicide due to guilt.

83
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,360
Pei's adopted son

84
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,630
is clearly your father, Fu Pingsheng.

85
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,750
Didn't his father die
of illness last year?

86
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,760
Because of the Zuohang Gang case,

87
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,270
there has been turmoil in the Capital,

88
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,750
and many remnants of the Pei faction,

89
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,950
unable to bear the pressure,

90
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,040
have committed suicide.

91
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,710
Now,

92
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,820
they're using us as scapegoats.

93
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,020
It's only right that the son pays
for his father's crimes.

94
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,740
Fu Yunxi, don't you admit it?

95
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,740
If that's true,

96
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,840
(Zheng Ziyan, Mr. Zheng's eldest son)
stop protecting your father.

97
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,260
Yes.

98
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,260
I'm indeed protecting someone.

99
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,100
Who?

100
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,780
Pei Dafu has a residence in the Capital.

101
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,160
A month ago, the Judicial Review
received a report

102
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,020
saying that someone had seen

103
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,580
Mr. Deng's carriage

104
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,420
in front of Pei Residence.

105
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,380
Zaiye...

106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,440
(Deng Chan, Mr. Deng's granddaughter)
Grandfather...

107
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,220
Mr. Fu, Pei Dafu has been
influential for years,

108
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,940
and he likes to invite guests
to his residence.

109
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,800
All the officials in the court
have been invited to his banquets.

110
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,140
If we judge based on this,

111
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,020
it might not be convincing.

112
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,940
Miss Deng's words make sense.

113
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,780
Because of this,

114
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,220
I instructed to suppress this first.

115
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,460
Who is slandering my family?

116
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,540
I knew it.

117
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,340
I knew it'd be you, You Yong.

118
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,420
As I know you used
your grandfather's name

119
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,660
to sell official positions,

120
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,120
you want to slander my entire family.

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,060
Don't talk nonsense.

122
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,860
I saw it. How could I be slandering?

123
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,700
Go to hell.

124
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,340
Let go.

125
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,850
Who are you?

126
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,800
Why have you kidnapped us here?

127
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,220
- Let go.
- Behave yourself.

128
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,700
Who are you?

129
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,140
Why are you treating us like this?

130
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,420
Lingzhi, don't be afraid.

131
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,780
What crimes have we committed?

132
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,700
Why have we been arrested?

133
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,660
Lingzhi.

134
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,860
Father.

135
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,060
- What are you doing?
- Yunxi.

136
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,740
- Go back.
- Yunxi.

137
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,060
Step aside.

138
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,140
- Yunxi.
- Mom.

139
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,130
Don't go.

140
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,860
Yunxi, don't come over.

141
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,100
We're fine.

142
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,100
It's okay.

143
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,940
Mr. Fu,

144
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,340
we're only following orders tonight.

145
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,420
Are you going to defy
the imperial edict?

146
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,560
This is punishable by death.

147
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,620
Mr. Fu, don't make things hard for us.

148
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,860
Father.

149
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,980
Lingzhi. Lingzhi.

150
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,820
Lingzhi.

151
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,900
Are you okay, Lingzhi?

152
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,300
Lingzhi.

153
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,140
Don't go.

154
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,140
It's dangerous.

155
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,660
Thank you.

156
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,940
Fu Yunxi, stop.

157
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,020
Give me the saber.

158
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,780
Are you trying to ruin your family?

159
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,900
Stop right there.

160
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,460
Anyone who steps out of the hall tonight

161
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,460
is defying the imperial edict.

162
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,460
What is the imperial edict?

163
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,300
Has anyone read it out loud?

164
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,380
This is entirely under the control
of Mr. Yuwen.

165
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,260
Where is the imperial edict?

166
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,180
Since there's no imperial edict,

167
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,120
how can anyone be accused of defying it?

168
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,080
Those locked in the hall tonight

169
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,060
are all family members
of high-ranking officials.

170
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,180
Even if we are to be executed
after the Zi hour,

171
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,940
there is still time.

172
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,900
Why point swords at us?

173
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,180
Who is the one

174
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,700
defying the edict and causing chaos?

175
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,700
Yunxi.

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,140
Come here.

177
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,740
Lingzhi, don't be afraid. I'm here.

178
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,420
Are you hurt?

179
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,260
No.

180
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,220
- Father.
- Are you okay?

181
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,260
Mother, take Lingzhi to the hall.

182
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,620
Hurry, your aunt...

183
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,260
- Behave.
- Let go.

184
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,660
Aunt Kou.

185
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,980
A bunch of blind fools.

186
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,700
Don't even know to help me up.

187
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,800
Save your strength
for your father's funeral.

188
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,220
I want to see Mr. Yuwen.

189
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,080
Where is he?

190
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,420
Mr. Yuwen is too busy

191
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,660
to see you now.

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,780
Everyone, go back to the hall,

193
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,500
or I won't be so polite.

194
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,860
I have info about Pei Dafu's
adopted son.

195
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,180
Miss, just tell me your info.

196
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,100
I'll pass on the message.

197
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,060
This is too serious

198
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,980
for you to hear.

199
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,620
Stop pretending to be mysterious.

200
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,620
Go.

201
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,540
(Yinan Guild Hall)

202
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,980
Are you alright?

203
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,260
Don't worry.

204
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,460
Thank you for just now.

205
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,660
I don't want your thanks.

206
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,500
I want to know the truth.

207
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,420
What truth?

208
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,980
Since you sent your family
out of the Capital,

209
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,180
you must've known
that this would happen today.

210
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,980
If I really knew the truth,

211
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,740
why would I wait until today?

212
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,580
The Zi hour is near. Aren't you afraid?

213
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,260
Torture and devilish tricks...

214
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,980
These psychological tactics
have been used countless times

215
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,580
in the Judicial Review.

216
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,380
Haven't you

217
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,820
seen through it?

218
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,140
Of course, I have doubts.

219
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,180
Even if the Pei faction is heinous

220
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,980
and the Emperor is
presiding over the case,

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,340
how could they dare
to execute the innocent,

222
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,740
let alone the family members
of officials?

223
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,660
But I'm more curious

224
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,540
about how much secret wealth

225
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,980
that adopted son has

226
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,100
to warrant such a major effort.

227
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,930
The less you know about this case,
the safer you are.

228
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,980
This isn't like you.

229
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,660
So, what should I do?

230
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,380
I've already told you about my mother

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,500
conspiring with Yuwen Chang'an.

232
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,300
Can't you guess

233
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,540
that they're behind this crisis

234
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,260
that has befallen us?

235
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,860
Of course, I guessed it.

236
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,980
Then why haven't you done anything?

237
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,700
Have you got any info

238
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,500
from your mother?

239
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,860
No.

240
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,340
You're helpless as her daughter,

241
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,580
so what can I do?

242
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,780
Are we

243
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,500
just going to wait?

244
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,700
This case is under the control
of Mr. Yuwen.

245
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,300
We can only wait.

246
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,220
Besides,

247
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,380
I also want to see what backup plan

248
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,500
Ms. Ruan has prepared.

249
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,100
Young Master Ziyan
has drawn the first lot.

250
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,420
Sorry. Take him away.

251
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,380
- No!
- No!

252
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,500
- Mother, no.
- Please...

253
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,260
Ziyan, Ziyan.

254
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,300
Let Father save me.

255
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,780
- Mother...
- Ziyan.

256
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,180
Hurry, save Ziyan.

257
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,940
No!

258
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,380
Ziyan!

259
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,540
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

260
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,580
Did they

261
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,620
really kill him?

262
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,780
Unless

263
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,220
everyone has gone mad.

264
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,500
No.

265
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,860
I can't wait anymore.

266
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,900
Whoever that adopted son is,

267
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,220
whether it's to save my mother's life

268
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,540
or for my own sake,

269
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,580
I can't wait any longer.

270
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,640
What do you want to do?

271
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,900
No, no.

272
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,300
Move.

273
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,020
I'm innocent, sir.

274
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,340
Sir...

275
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,460
- Hurry.
- No.

276
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,860
What are you doing?

277
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,340
Let go of me.

278
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,250
Go.

279
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,120
Hurry up.

280
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,660
- Let go of me.
- Hurry.

281
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,060
Let go of me.

282
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
Behave yourself.

283
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,880
Where is Zhuang Yuchi?

284
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,700
Yuchi.

285
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
It's your turn now.

286
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,660
No, no.

287
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,820
Sir, let me do it.

288
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Let me do it first.

289
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,280
Don't take my son.

290
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,500
The drawing makes the decision.

291
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,820
The rules can't be changed.

292
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,700
Take him away.

293
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,260
No, no, no.

294
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,600
- Don't.
- Mom.

295
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,120
- Don't take my son away.
- Mom.

296
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,220
Don't take my son.

297
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,060
Mom.

298
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,460
Yuchi.

299
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,380
No!

300
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,100
I know who the adopted son is.

301
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,140
Who is it?

302
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,060
There are too many people here.

303
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,440
Take me outside, and I'll tell you.

304
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,000
Take him away.

305
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,180
- Go.
- Behave yourself.

306
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,420
- Yuchi.
- Mom.

307
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,020
- Yuchi.
- Yuchi.

308
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,060
Miss Hanyan, Madam,

309
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,140
I beg you.

310
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,340
Please save my son.

311
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,860
I'll do anything for you

312
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,220
without any complaints.

313
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,440
Does Yuchi really know
the adopted son's identity?

314
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,660
How would he know about this?

315
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,380
I just taught him.

316
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,460
It was only to buy him some time.

317
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,180
Mom, they can't even protect themselves.

318
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,220
What can they do for you?

319
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,060
Hurry up.

320
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,180
I just heard it.

321
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,140
I heard Miss Hanyan and the madam

322
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,580
arguing behind the curtain.

323
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,980
So...

324
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,540
So this disaster today

325
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,340
must be related to you.

326
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,140
Right?

327
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,020
It's related to you, isn't it?

328
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,220
What did she say?

329
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,000
Who is responsible
for this disaster today?

330
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,340
Who is the adopted son?

331
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,380
You know, don't you?

332
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,940
It's your family's master, right?

333
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,300
Young Master Zaiye, stop slandering us.

334
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,500
Then tell me.

335
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,580
Who is the adopted son?

336
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,900
Everyone, please listen to me.

337
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,300
What we've encountered today

338
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,500
is because of Yuwen Chang'an.

339
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,380
According to the law

340
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,540
and societal customs,
this is without precedent.

341
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,580
Even in the Palace,

342
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,940
even before the Emperor,

343
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,060
things must be reasonable.

344
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,140
Why must we be slaughtered like this?

345
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,380
Miss Hanyan,

346
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,020
what do you think we should do?

347
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,740
Yes, what should we do?

348
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,420
I just went out.

349
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,500
There are only
about 10 officers in the yard.

350
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,220
Right now, there are more of us

351
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,060
in the hall than them.

352
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,420
Tables, chairs, candlesticks,

353
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,580
and dishes can all be used as weapons.

354
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,100
Are you willing to charge out with me?

355
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,340
Yuwen Chang'an holds the Imperial Sword.

356
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,420
If we forced our way out,
we'd defy the edict.

357
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,980
How cunning and cruel of you.

358
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,100
We'll have to die
whether we obey or not.

359
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
If you want to be a coward, go ahead.

360
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,300
I would rather die

361
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,060
than die unjustly.

362
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,300
If anyone in this hall

363
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,580
is innocent and unwilling
to die in vain,

364
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,580
take up weapons with me.

365
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,100
If this interrogation is a trap,

366
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,340
we'll break through the door
and expose it.

367
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,900
If Yuwen Chang'an
truly kills the innocent,

368
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,780
then even if we die,

369
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,940
we'll make sure
the world knows about it.

370
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,260
Miss Hanyan,

371
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,140
I'll charge out with you.

372
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,900
If we must die today,

373
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,380
let's die together with them.

374
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,980
I'll go with you.

375
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,020
Let's fight.

376
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,940
- Let's fight.
- Fight.

377
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,700
Fight.

378
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,190
- Fight.
- Fight.

379
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,260
Let's go and fight.

380
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,700
Let's fight.

381
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,940
Mother.

382
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,620
No matter what,

383
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,900
you must not die today.

384
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,060
I can't

385
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,340
die in vain either.

386
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,540
Are you really going to defy the edict?

387
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,020
Where is Yuwen Chang'an?

388
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,740
- We want to see him.
- Let him come out.

389
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,100
- We are all innocent.
- Yes.

390
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,510
Let him come out.

391
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,860
We are innocent.

392
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,990
Let him come out.

393
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,540
Yes. Who dares to slaughter us?

394
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,250
- Go back now.
- Let him come out.

395
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,180
- Who dares to kill us?
- You'll get hurt.

396
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,660
Mr. Yuwen,

397
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,380
the Emperor is not above the law.

398
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,980
Even with the Imperial Sword,

399
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,220
you must still obey the law.

400
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,540
You have locked us here

401
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,460
and wantonly killed us.

402
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,060
What's your basis?
What evidence do you have?

403
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,860
Mr. Chen.

404
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,320
Mr. Yuwen invites Miss Hanyan
to the study for a discussion.

405
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,420
Lead the way.

406
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,700
(Virtue and Vice)

407
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,660
Miss Hanyan,

408
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,540
I truly underestimated you.

409
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,340
Mr. Yuwen,

410
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,260
as things have come to this,
tell me honestly.

411
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,300
Was that blood outside

412
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,900
human blood,

413
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,100
or animal blood?

414
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,140
Don't worry. They're all alive.

415
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,420
It was just a play.

416
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,460
What play? Who is it for?

417
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,700
Everyone.

418
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,340
From the Emperor

419
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,180
down to the people in the guild hall.

420
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,300
They are not criminals

421
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,180
but witnesses.

422
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,180
What were you

423
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,500
and my mother doing?

424
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,540
Mr. Yuwen,

425
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,780
you still haven't married.

426
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,660
Is there someone you can't let go of?

427
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,420
Since you already know,

428
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,860
why bother asking me?

429
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,700
Now, in the hall,
the families of officials

430
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,140
have been so humiliated.

431
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,060
Everyone is filled with anger.

432
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,980
If they find out

433
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,780
that this was orchestrated by my mother,

434
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,620
I'm afraid they will

435
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,580
tear her apart in a fit of rage.

436
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,460
What do you mean?

437
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,260
If you refuse to tell me the truth,

438
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,700
I'll return to the hall

439
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,740
and make everything I know public.

440
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,580
You...

441
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,100
She's your mother.

442
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,540
How can you bear to do this?

443
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,900
Then how can you bear it?

444
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,020
If you still have feelings for her,

445
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,660
why would you want to harm her?

446
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,740
Mr. Yuwen,

447
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,460
I think I can guess

448
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,100
why you've acted this way today.

449
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,380
Mother must've coerced you
with your feelings.

450
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,940
I'm sure you don't want to watch her

451
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,020
do something so foolish.

452
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,580
While there's still some leeway,

453
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,220
tell me the truth,

454
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,380
and let's find a way out, okay?

455
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,980
A few days ago,

456
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,100
the Head of the Yinan Chamber
of Commerce

457
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,900
sent a message for a meeting,

458
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,220
but he was vague in his words,

459
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,500
and there was no news for a long time.

460
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,100
So, I went alone to Danzhou.

461
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,540
I made some inquiries after I met him,

462
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,260
and he finally confessed

463
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,780
that over the past ten years,

464
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,660
an official from the Pei faction

465
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,420
had been using them to launder money,

466
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,020
involving a huge sum.

467
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,220
But this man's identity is mysterious,

468
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,260
and he only showed up two years ago.

469
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,540
However, it was very dark,

470
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,180
and he couldn't see the man's face.

471
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,980
He only knows that this man is over 40

472
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,260
and is an official

473
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,660
from Yinan in the Capital.

474
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,900
So,

475
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,900
the 11 people detained in the Palace

476
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,860
match these two conditions.

477
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,420
And the 12th person

478
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,060
is Fu Yunxi's Father, Fu Pingsheng.

479
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,980
He passed away last year,

480
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,660
but he also matches

481
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,860
the head's description.

482
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,820
So, on New Year's Eve,

483
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,660
I brought the head into the Palace
to meet the Emperor.

484
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,900
He confessed this to the Emperor,

485
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,660
so the Emperor assigned me to this case.

486
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
So, you sneaked into my home
multiple times

487
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
to discuss this with my mother?

488
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,660
She asked me

489
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,580
to report this to the Emperor

490
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,460
and have

491
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,780
Zhuang Shiyang arrested

492
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,140
for her sake

493
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,220
and for the sake of justice

494
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,300
and the well-being of the people.

495
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,860
Even so,

496
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,500
you have 12 suspects.

497
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,060
How can you frame my father

498
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,540
as that adopted son?

499
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,620
Miss Hanyan...

500
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,340
Sir, a female relative claims

501
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,700
to have confidential info for you.

502
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,980
Let her in.

503
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,460
Mother.

504
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,540
You told her everything?

505
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,100
Xiwen,

506
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,260
just listen to me.

507
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,420
Let's drop this.

508
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,780
Don't be so stubborn.

509
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,660
You know me.

510
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Mother,

511
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,740
even if you want to uphold justice,

512
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,060
do you not care

513
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,780
for my life at all?

514
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,580
Ever since your return,

515
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,540
I've tried every way to drive you out,

516
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,020
but you insisted on getting involved

517
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,660
in this mess.

518
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,820
It's not my fault.

519
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,700
Even if you want to frame Father
as the adopted son,

520
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,660
that would never work.

521
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,460
Frame?

522
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,260
Then today, I'll tell you

523
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,620
what the evidence is.

524
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,940
Xiwen, what are you doing?

525
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,660
- What are you doing?
- Go away! Go!

526
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,620
Xiwen.

527
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,980
Open the door.

528
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,700
Miss Hanyan,

529
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,420
your mother isn't doing this

530
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,780
just for herself.

531
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,380
Just let her.

532
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,100
I'm Ruan Xiwen, madam of the Zhuangs.

533
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,900
Unable to withstand the torture
of the Supervision,

534
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,740
I voluntarily confess today.

535
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,460
My husband, Zhuang Shiyang,
is Pei Dafu's adopted son.

536
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,980
In our backyard kitchen,

537
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,980
there's a secret passage
directly to Pei Dafu's residence.

538
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
Something's wrong.

539
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,820
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

540
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,100
(Two years ago)

541
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,100
(Rear garden, Pei Dafu's residence)

542
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,940
I'm innocent, Eunuch Feng.

543
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,360
The Emperor is wise. I'm innocent.

544
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,140
(Dutiful and Blessed)
Someone is framing me.

545
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,980
How could there be a secret passage
in my house?

546
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,220
The evidence is right in front of you,

547
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,260
and your wife has confessed.

548
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,860
You can't deny this.

549
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
(Scholarly Glory)

550
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,300
Bring the Zhuangs to the backyard.

551
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,500
Keep an eye on them.

552
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,500
Father,

553
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,020
is Aunt Hanyan not leaving?

554
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,420
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

555
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,740
My Lord,

556
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,140
are you okay?

557
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,100
It's fine. What's going on?

558
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,800
The Emperor has ordered us to work
with the Supervision on this.

559
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,060
Mr. Yan needs you.

560
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,330
- Let's go.
- Yes.

561
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,860
May the Bodhisattva bless us

562
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,540
and protect our family

563
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,420
through this calamity.

564
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,220
- Mom.
- May the Bodhisattva bless.

565
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,540
Father has been deceiving us.

566
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,500
Even you didn't know about this, right?

567
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,840
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

568
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,380
I don't believe it.

569
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,140
How could Father be an evil man?

570
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,160
When Yunxi returns
to the Judicial Review,

571
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,580
he'll investigate this thoroughly.

572
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,300
Someone must be framing us.

573
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,120
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

574
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,160
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

575
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,120
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

576
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,500
Nanny Chen,

577
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,780
you should leave.

578
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,500
Why stay?

579
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,100
Madam,

580
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,140
allow me to speak

581
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,780
out of turn

582
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,540
and call you Xiwen.

583
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,820
Back then,
the Ruan family was prominent,

584
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,340
but now,

585
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,580
only you and I are here.

586
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,900
After all these years,

587
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,660
I know that you don't just see me

588
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,700
as a servant.

589
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,020
If you don't mind,

590
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,300
let me accompany you
on your last journey.

591
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,780
Mr. Yuwen,

592
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
where is my master?

593
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,100
What does he say?

594
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,980
Zhuang Shiyang refuses to admit it,

595
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,540
but the evidence is irrefutable,

596
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,620
so he can't deny it.

597
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,140
Take account of all the Zhuangs

598
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,400
and bring them to prison.

599
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,960
There's no need to wait until autumn.

600
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,820
Execute them at the Wu hour tomorrow.

601
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,300
Zhuang Shiyang, the master,

602
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,140
Ms. Wei, the grandmother,

603
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,060
Ruan Xiwen, the wife,

604
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,460
Zhou Ruyin, the concubine,

605
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,340
Zhuang Yushan, Zhou's daughter,

606
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,340
Zhuang Yuchi, Zhou's son.

607
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,060
There are six people

608
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,260
in Zhuang Shiyang's family.
Take them away.

609
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,340
What's going on?

610
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,940
Why isn't Zhuang Hanyan listed?

611
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,540
According to the family register,

612
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,140
Zhuang Hanyan, the lineal daughter,

613
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,100
was removed from the family register
two years ago

614
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,860
and adopted by Zhang Youchang
from Nanzhang, Danzhou.

615
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,940
She is not a Zhuang family member.

616
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,580
Take them away.

617
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,100
Yuchi, Yushan.

618
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,440

619
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,740
