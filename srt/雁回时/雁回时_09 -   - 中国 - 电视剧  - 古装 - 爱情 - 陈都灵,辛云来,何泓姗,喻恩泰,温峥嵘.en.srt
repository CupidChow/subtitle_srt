00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:00,660
(Judicial Review)

4
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,120
It's not yet the right time.

5
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,870
It'll be soon.

6
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,190
Just wait a little longer.

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,710
It's nearly the Wu hour.

8
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,560
It's the Wu hour.

9
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
Untie him.

10
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,470
- Untie him.
- Don't rush.

11
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,870
Yuchi, it's alright now.

12
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,610
Young Master.

13
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,910
- Yuchi, Yuchi.
- Young Master.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
- Help him up.
- Come on.

15
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,920
Help him up.

16
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,310
- Brush it off.
- Brush it off.

17
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,800
Alright, alright.

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,880
- Mom.
- It's fine.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,150
- Help him.
- Help him back.

20
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,430
Come on, get in the carriage.

21
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,870
- Get in the carriage.
- Come on.

22
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,810
Come on. Let's go.

23
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,750
Hurry, hurry.

24
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,800
Yuchi, let's go home.

25
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,870
- Let's go.
- Get in.

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,520
I'm afraid something big

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,910
is about to happen
at Zhuang Residence today.

28
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,540
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,280
Thanks to the Buddha

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,960
for saving Yuchi's life.

31
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,660
If he can't pass the Imperial Exams,

32
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,300
then we won't force it.

33
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,940
It's already a blessing
that he can live.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,660
He's brought this trouble upon himself,

35
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,940
ruining his own future,

36
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,820
and now I'm also suspected
of revealing the test.

37
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,180
How humiliating!

38
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,260
How can I ever show my face

39
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,380
in the Capital's court again?

40
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,940
What a sin. Truly a sin.

41
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,900
Mom.

42
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,020
Yuchi.

43
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,020
I'm here.

44
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,300
Yuchi, you've suffered.

45
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,860
Everything's over now.

46
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,380
Your father and I have brought you home.

47
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
Where is Yushan?

48
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,460
She's kneeling in the ancestral hall.

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,100
Don't worry about her now.

50
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,220
Father...

51
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,420
Father, please help me.

52
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,420
It was Zhuang Hanyan.

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,380
Hanyan?

54
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,980
These days,

55
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,220
when I was tied
in front of the Judicial Review,

56
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,620
I thought about it.

57
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,380
It was Zhuang Hanyan.

58
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,980
She framed me.

59
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,020
She secretly swapped He Wenshen's essay.

60
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,240
Yuchi, why would you make

61
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,820
such a baseless accusation against me?

62
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,300
How dare you come?

63
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,180
I've done nothing wrong.

64
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,640
Why should I be afraid to come?

65
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,620
Yuchi,

66
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,340
what is your explanation?

67
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,740
How can you accuse Miss Hanyan

68
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,500
without reason?

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,820
That day, Yushan and I
received the essay

70
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,020
and went back home.

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,740
That evening,

72
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,220
only you came to my room.

73
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,340
Hanyan, did you go to his room?

74
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,580
Young Master, Miss Hanyan
requests to see you.

75
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,460
What do you want?

76
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,980
You're the only son in the family.

77
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,020
You've been studying late every night.

78
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,500
I don't want you to tire yourself out.

79
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,460
These are cakes I made myself.

80
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,260
When you're studying late,

81
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,460
you can try them.

82
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,860
Go away.

83
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,020
Don't bother me.

84
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,700
That night,

85
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,660
I did go to Gongtong Chamber

86
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,380
and gave Yuchi the cakes,

87
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,060
but he didn't let me in.

88
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,700
He didn't even let me
step into his room.

89
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,780
How could I have swapped your essay?

90
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,260
Do you think I have magical powers?

91
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,140
You're lying.

92
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,240
Father, if you don't believe me,

93
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,660
you can call Huan,
a maid from Gongtong Chamber.

94
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,740
She'll testify.

95
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,900
Father.

96
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,380
Father.

97
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,500
Don't believe her lies.

98
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,940
That day, in Chaling Tavern,

99
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,020
someone got me drunk.

100
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,540
It was a momentary lapse

101
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,740
that I bragged about ranking first

102
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,580
in the test.

103
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,380
Why were you in the tavern too?

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,140
This must be your scheme.

105
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,580
Father,

106
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,500
I went to Chaling Tavern

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,620
because Mr. Fu invited me for tea.

108
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,260
He can testify.

109
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,460
The tavern owner can testify as well.

110
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,420
Nonsense!

111
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,260
Since Yuchi has mentioned it,

112
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,260
there's no need to hide it anymore.

113
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,140
That day, at the tavern,

114
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,100
in front of everyone,

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,620
you tried to drag me around,

116
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,140
spewing filthy words.

117
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,980
You even...

118
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,580
You even said

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,060
you'd marry me off to Mr. You.

120
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,940
You asked us to go to bed that night,

121
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,340
which caused everyone to laugh.

122
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,380
Do you remember that?

123
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,540
I wanted to report this to Father,

124
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,700
but I was afraid of bothering him

125
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,460
and causing you to be punished.

126
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,700
So, I endured the humiliation alone.

127
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,100
But today,

128
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,500
how can you use this against me?

129
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,820
Did you really do
such disgraceful things?

130
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,100
Father,

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,140
she is twisting the truth.

132
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,100
She deliberately provoked me.

133
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,940
She's framing me, Father.

134
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,980
You must believe me.

135
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,940
Yes, I know.

136
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,180
I ruined your marriage after my return,

137
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,580
so you resent me for it.

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,940
I accept it all.

139
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,940
You've always wanted quick success,

140
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,780
eager to show off.

141
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,540
But you shouldn't have tampered
with the Imperial Exams.

142
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,980
I didn't steal the exam paper
from Father's study;

143
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,300
nor did I deceive Mr. He

144
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,980
for the essay.

145
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,140
Yuchi, your misconduct

146
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,780
not only ruined your future

147
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,620
but also brought shame to the family,

148
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,820
yet you still refuse to repent,

149
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,420
trying to shift the blame onto others.

150
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,100
You've failed Father's teachings

151
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,660
and our family's good reputation.

152
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,540
Stop twisting the truth!

153
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,060
You set me up!

154
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,100
- Yuchi!
- Stop!

155
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,140
Yuchi.

156
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,340
Zhuang Hanyan, tell the truth.

157
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,380
- Stop!
- Let go!

158
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,600
How could our family produce
such a beast like you?

159
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,420
Master, please don't get angry.

160
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
Yuchi's fever has made him confused.

161
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,420
I think I'm the confused one.

162
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,020
How could I have let you into my family

163
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,820
and let you give birth to such a beast?

164
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,740
Father, Father...

165
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,340
Father, you don't love me anymore.

166
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,940
Why do you always protect her?

167
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,820
I am your son,

168
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,940
the only heir of the family, Father.

169
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,860
Our family doesn't need
a child like you.

170
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,540
Since you don't want me anymore,

171
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,300
I'll leave.

172
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,460
- I'll leave!
- Yuchi!

173
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,060
Yuchi, Yuchi!

174
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,500
Yuchi, Yuchi!

175
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,980
Call a physician.

176
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
Call a physician!

177
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,740
- Our family is finished.
- Yuchi!

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,900
Wake up.

179
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,940
Just dig a grave for me

180
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,540
- and bury me alive.
- Yuchi.

181
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,780
Shiyang,

182
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,260
don't get so worked up
that it harms your health.

183
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,060
How did you hurt yourself?

184
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,220
It's just a minor injury.

185
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,340
I never meant to harm his life

186
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,740
and never thought this
would escalate to the Palace.

187
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,460
But you didn't see his attitude before.

188
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,460
When he learned the Emperor
favored his proposal,

189
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,300
he rushed to pressure me,

190
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,900
saying that if he became an official

191
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,620
and took control of the family,

192
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
the first thing he'd do

193
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,220
was throw me and my mother out.

194
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,580
That way,

195
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,220
you and this concubine

196
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,700
have had everything
laid out in the open.

197
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,140
I never thought

198
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,420
this would escalate to the Palace.

199
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,140
But I suppose it's time.

200
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,980
Miss Hanyan, Ms. Zhou is here.

201
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,780
Ms. Zhou, are you in the mood

202
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,660
to play this unfinished game with me?

203
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,980
Miss Hanyan, since you've spoken,

204
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,060
I shall certainly accompany you.

205
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,060
Please.

206
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,100
Ms. Zhou, why are you here

207
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,060
instead of taking care of Yuchi?

208
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,380
The master has ordered

209
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,300
to send Yuchi and Yushan

210
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,620
to the manor in the countryside

211
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,540
and to stay there
for the Chinese New Year.

212
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,980
The countryside is peaceful.

213
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,960
It's a perfect place
for Yuchi to recover.

214
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,660
Miss Hanyan, since I took control

215
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,620
of the family from your mother's hands,

216
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,300
you must hate me to the core, right?

217
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,820
It was Mother's fault.

218
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,340
How could I hate you?

219
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,300
Besides, since you took control,

220
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,060
our family has been thriving
and flourishing,

221
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,100
and the whole Capital praises us.

222
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,180
This is all thanks to your efforts.

223
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,300
At this point, why still flatter me?

224
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,340
Once the guild hall's sacrifice is over,

225
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,180
the control of the family

226
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,580
might fall back into your hands.

227
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,960
Ms. Zhou, I don't resent you

228
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,780
because of your false accusations
or your craving for power.

229
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,620
On my first day in the family,

230
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,780
you incited Yuchi to turn against me.

231
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,700
To throw me out,

232
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,580
you secretly brought in Taoist Duan
to pressure me.

233
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,620
Even when I went to the Qiumei Garden,

234
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,380
you had me wear gold and silver,

235
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,100
trying to humiliate me
in front of others.

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,860
Have you forgotten

237
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,780
each and every one of these actions?

238
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,450
But Miss Hanyan,

239
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,020
you're so clever,

240
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,170
always turning danger into victory.

241
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,960
I didn't gain any advantage either.

242
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,180
But there is one thing

243
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,700
that I couldn't fight back.

244
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,400
What?

245
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,740
17 years ago,

246
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,020
I was just an infant
in swaddling clothes,

247
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,840
but I was accused
of being a barefoot ghost.

248
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,260
Even Grandfather's death

249
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,860
was blamed on me.

250
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,540
I was sent to Danzhou,

251
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,340
separated from my mother for years,

252
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,620
because of you.

253
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,460
I insisted on returning to the Capital,

254
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,780
partly to find my family,

255
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,340
and partly to avenge the blood feud
from that year.

256
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,540
Miss Hanyan,

257
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,980
since you returned to the family,

258
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,060
your mother has loathed you the most.

259
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,980
Have you never resented her?

260
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,780
- Never.
- I don't believe that.

261
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,260
Of course, you won't.

262
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,180
Otherwise, you wouldn't have raised

263
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,980
Yushan and Yuchi in such a way.

264
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,020
Ms. Zhou, you are a smart woman,

265
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,300
but you have misunderstood one thing.

266
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,580
To protect your children,

267
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,500
you've swallowed
all the bitterness alone

268
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,020
and shielded them from all the storms.

269
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,900
But can you protect them
for their whole lives?

270
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,300
You should understand

271
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,060
that in this cruel world,
people are unpredictable,

272
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,060
and indulging them is killing them.

273
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,580
If a mother raises her child

274
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,460
to be weak and useless,

275
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,500
how can they survive in this world?

276
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,100
Miss Hanyan,

277
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,780
are you saying you're thankful

278
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,620
to the madam for her cruelty?

279
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,580
My mother didn't treat me kindly.

280
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,340
If I thanked her for it,

281
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,980
I'd be a filial fool.

282
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,900
But I won't hate her for it

283
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,420
because I understand

284
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,140
it's because I endured

285
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,100
so much hardship from a young age

286
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,660
that I've become

287
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,580
a victor

288
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,460
today.

289
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,860
Miss Hanyan,

290
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,620
the situation is not yet settled.

291
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,340
It's still too early

292
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,020
to judge the outcome.

293
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,780
Ms. Zhou, I've won again.

294
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
A defeat doesn't mean the game is over.

295
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,750
There's no such thing
as an undefeated general.

296
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,220
If you have any tricks up your sleeve,

297
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,500
feel free to use them.

298
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,100
I'll play with you

299
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,660
until the end.

300
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,940
Madam.

301
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,380
Miss Hanyan won this round beautifully.

302
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,100
She hit the enemy right on the spot.

303
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,780
For all these years,

304
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,100
Zhou Ruyin has never lost
as Zhuang Yuchi

305
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,540
is the only heir of the family.

306
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,180
Now that this young master's future
is ruined,

307
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,580
she has no more support.

308
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,500
I never expected

309
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,740
she would stir up such a storm.

310
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,380
Madam,

311
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,900
are you worried
about Miss Hanyan's safety?

312
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,580
Fighting with evil people for too long

313
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,580
will eventually drag you into the mud.

314
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm the best example of that.

315
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,700
Madam,

316
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,260
don't degrade yourself.

317
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,060
This child is stubborn.

318
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,980
She's somewhat like me.

319
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,740
I'm afraid she'll get
too deeply involved,

320
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,300
and it'll be harder for her to escape.

321
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,760
Madam,

322
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,560
Mr. Yuwen has returned from Danzhou.

323
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,140
This is his confidential letter to you.

324
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,140
(To Xiwen)

325
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,740
(It's been settled,
awaiting your orders.)

326
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,100
Ms. Zhou.

327
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,580
Zhuang Hanyan must've had
some hidden help

328
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,140
to set us up this time.

329
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,540
Are you referring

330
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,020
to the one from Jianjia Chamber?

331
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,540
I've been keeping an eye on her
for some time.

332
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,140
Those two haven't met again.

333
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,140
So, who are you talking about?

334
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,940
In the Capital,

335
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,820
the person closest to her

336
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,900
is Mr. Fu from the Judicial Review.

337
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,260
Yes.

338
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,340
That's right.

339
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,740
Miss Yushan has been jealous of it.

340
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
Well, this...

341
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,140
It's time to meet the one

342
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,740
who came from Dazhou.

343
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,140
Nanny Tao,

344
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,540
go to the Yinan Guild Hall now

345
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,700
and ask someone to come.

346
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,220
Yes.

347
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,740
Who is it?

348
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,580
Yang Ping.

349
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,940
Did you send me the message?

350
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,540
Things have been busy lately,

351
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,180
so I finally have time to meet you.

352
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,660
Sorry about that, Mr. Yang.

353
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,140
Please forgive me.

354
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,940
Please.

355
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,260
If you don't show yourself,

356
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,020
I'll have to return to Danzhou.

357
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,940
Mr. Yang, have you already let go

358
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,820
of the grudge over your disfigurement?

359
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
There always are four principles
for officials:

360
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,620
conduct, speech, writing, and judgment.

361
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,020
Because of my half-damaged ear,

362
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,900
I couldn't even pass
the provincial exams.

363
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,700
With such deep hatred,

364
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,340
how can I let Zhuang Hanyan off?

365
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,480
What are you looking at?

366
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,700
Sorry for my rudeness.

367
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,580
Mr. Yang, please don't be angry.

368
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,980
Before, you said

369
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,340
there was a relative
working at the yamen

370
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,580
who had the autopsy report
for Zhang Youchang and his wife.

371
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,580
Did you bring it with you?

372
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,340
Of course.

373
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,020
Well...

374
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm curious.

375
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,300
How did you determine

376
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,540
that Zhuang Hanyan committed murder?

377
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,740
At first, I found it unbelievable.

378
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,980
After all, she's just 17 years old.

379
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,140
How could she have the guts?

380
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,900
I briefly dismissed

381
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,020
the thought,

382
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,460
but now,

383
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,220
look at Miss Hanyan.

384
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,340
Killing, looting, and framing...

385
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,300
What is there she wouldn't dare do?

386
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,700
This is a crime punishable by death.

387
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,180
Do you really want me to expose her?

388
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,900
If I don't kill her,

389
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,700
she's probably already plotting

390
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,540
how to kill me.

391
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,580
Mr. Yang, you must've had doubts,
so you went to the yamen

392
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,500
to look at the autopsy report.

393
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,940
It's said it was done by bandits,

394
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,780
but I don't believe it.

395
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,580
In the entire Danzhou,

396
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,940
Nanzhang is the poorest place.

397
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,340
What would they want to rob?

398
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,460
The Wangs' old fishing net,

399
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
or the Zhaos' broken hoe?

400
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,050
Has Nanzhang never had bandit troubles?

401
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,510
There were some,

402
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,460
but not in the last ten years.

403
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,320
How could it be so coincidental?

404
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,660
So,

405
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,900
only Miss Hanyan claims
that it was done by bandits.

406
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,940
There's no evidence.

407
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,260
Then what's suspicious

408
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,620
about the official document?

409
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,940
Ms. Zhou, name a price.

410
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,730
How about 100 taels?

411
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,660
I spent quite a bit

412
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,240
on the journey here.

413
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,340
150 taels.

414
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,700
That's the most I can offer.

415
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,300
200 taels.

416
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,740
Fine.

417
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,420
I'll sell some gold and silver jewelry

418
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,980
to raise money for you.

419
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,220
Is that alright?

420
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,260
(Tender Bamboo)

421
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,500
Miss Hanyan, please wait.

422
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,380
What are you here for again?

423
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,620
Why are you so anxious?

424
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,540
Is there a bandit hiding

425
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,940
in Yuzhu Manor?

426
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,940
Mr. Fu, do you want to search?

427
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,780
Show me the search warrant then.

428
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,300
Miss Hanyan, please don't be angry.

429
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,980
Mr. Fu was just teasing you.

430
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,320
We're here because Zhuang Yuchi
was punished,

431
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,080
and the Judicial Review happened to be
in charge of the punishment,

432
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,660
so Mr. Fu had me bring some medicine,

433
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,970
and we came to check on him.

434
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,060
Mr. Fu, you've taken the wrong path.

435
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,820
You should be going to Gongtong Chamber.

436
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,980
Zhou Ruyin met a man

437
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,100
in the afternoon at Guangyuan Teahouse.

438
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,580
Mr. Fu, why do you know about this?

439
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,260
Do you already know who she met?

440
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,100
Someone else suddenly got involved.

441
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,740
Am I supposed to sit idly by?

442
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,540
Miss Hanyan, how meticulous of you.

443
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,980
Sorry for being nosy.

444
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,940
Goodbye.

445
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,900
Wait.

446
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,920
Though I know
about their secret meeting,

447
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,660
I don't know what they're scheming.

448
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,220
Have you found out?

449
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,300
There are many teahouses in the Capital,

450
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,920
but not every one of them

451
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,460
has spies from the Judicial Review.

452
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,500
You know the principle
of not chasing a dog

453
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,340
into a dead-end alley.

454
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,580
Now that you've removed a chunk of flesh

455
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,660
from Zhou Ruyin's heart,

456
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,460
she certainly won't spare you.

457
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,460
You should think

458
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,850
about what Yang Ping has on you.

459
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,380
Mr. Fu,

460
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,220
why are you helping me like this?

461
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Regarding the Danzhou murder case,

462
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,260
I harbored you,

463
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,660
so I don't want to be implicated.

464
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,580
Take care of yourself.

465
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,300
Have you made up your mind?

466
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,140
Do I need

467
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,380
to kill him or not?

468
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,220
Chai Jing,

469
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,460
do you remember?

470
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,280
Yang Ping lost his father
at a young age,

471
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,380
and his mother made a living
weaving nets.

472
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,140
Her eyes grew cloudy and yellow
from exhaustion,

473
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,100
and tears would fall
when the sea breeze blew.

474
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,780
So what?

475
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,940
His mother endured hardships for years

476
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,660
and finally raised him.

477
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,260
This time, he came to the Capital alone,

478
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,620
and his mother
must be filled with worry,

479
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,300
waiting for his return.

480
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,700
If they send back a corpse...

481
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,500
You're being soft.

482
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Being soft...

483
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,500
To me,

484
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,220
being soft is
the most beautiful virtue in the world.

485
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,820
What do you mean?

486
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,020
Throughout history, many great men,

487
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,940
for their so-called grand ambitions,

488
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,820
as well as power and wealth,

489
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,420
treat human lives like weeds,

490
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,380
causing countless wars and conflicts,

491
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,790
and yet they are remembered forever

492
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,180
for their great achievements.

493
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,980
It is the most laughable thing.

494
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,260
If they could be a little soft,

495
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,500
then the world

496
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,260
would have fewer innocent victims.

497
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,780
Tomorrow is the sacrifice
at the Yinan Guild Hall.

498
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,780
Aren't you afraid
they'll join forces to target you?

499
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,460
Let's find a middle ground.

500
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,220
Tonight, you'll tie him up

501
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,580
and lock him in your place.

502
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,540
After the sacrifice,

503
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,940
I'll meet with him.

504
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,260
He's very greedy for money.

505
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,460
It'll be perfect
if we can resolve the grudge.

506
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,580
If not,

507
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,380
we'll find another way.

508
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,980
Sure.

509
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,900

510

(Wine)

511
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,420
By the command of Heaven and Earth,

512
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,020
students are gathered here

513
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,160
to pay respect to you,

514
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,210
as you're the source of wisdom

515
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,660
and the ancestor of talent

516
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,460
who can guide us through the confusion

517
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,060
and grant us wisdom.

518
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,900
We offer flowers and wine

519
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,940
with sincerity

520
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,100
to pay respect to you.

521
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,420
May you bless us

522
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,220
with the light of wisdom

523
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,500
to awaken all our hearts

524
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,300
and help us succeed
in our academic pursuits.

(Scholarly Glory)

526
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,900
May you bless us here

527
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,140
with sweet dew across the continent

528
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,660
and offer protection to the world.

529
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,620
With our respect for you,

530
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,940
we shall inherit the wisdom
of our ancestors

531
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,500
and appreciate your grace.

532
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,380
After the ritual, the deity will depart.

533
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,660
As the banners rise,
the deity will ascend.

534
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,940
May the blessings come
and bring eternal peace.

535
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,980
What's going on?

536
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,180
Ruyin, thank you.

537
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,330
It's what I should do.

538
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
What is this?

539
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,470
Why don't you take it to the hall?

540
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,500
(Memorial Tablet for Late Friend,
Zhang Youchang)

541
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,500
Master,

542
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,500
Youchang and his wife were from Yinan,

543
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,740
and they raised Miss Hanyan on behalf

544
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,380
of you and Madam.

545
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,300
They've been gone for a long time,

546
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,880
but it seems there aren't
memorial tablets for them in Danzhou.

547
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,280
Since today is the sacrifice ceremony,

548
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,100
I'd like to offer
their tablets to the hall

549
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,060
to accumulate some good karma

550
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,740
and free them
from the suffering of samsara

551
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,300
so they can enjoy the afterlife bliss.

552
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,060
That sounds truly wonderful.

553
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,020
I was indeed careless.

554
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,780
Ruyin, how considerate of you.

555
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,580
Youchang and his wife had no children.

556
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,500
Only Miss Hanyan was there for them.

557
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,220
Though not by blood,

558
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,220
she is the closest to them.

559
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,700
Miss Hanyan, why not bring
their memorial tablets

560
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,420
into the hall?

561
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,600
Very well.

562
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,820
They raised Hanyan.

563
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,940
It's what Hanyan should do.

(Memorial Tablet for Late Friend,
Zhang Youchang)

565
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,420
Yes.

566
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,100
My foster parents treated me
like their own daughter.

567
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,060
I should make offerings

568
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,820
to their memorial tablets.

569
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,220
Do you really want me
to identify Zhuang Hanyan

570
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,580
as the murderer during the sacrifice?

571
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,820
Are you scared?

572
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,860
I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid,

573
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
but I feel like someone

574
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,540
has been secretly watching me lately.

575
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,500
I'm afraid this disturbance
at the welcome banquet

576
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,660
has already alerted her.

577
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,100
Don't worry.

578
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,060
The Capital is the Emperor's domain.

579
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,460
She couldn't kidnap you.

580
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,340
Why not give me

581
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,460
the autopsy report now?

582
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,980
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

586

Lang,

588
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,220
what are you doing?

589
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,580
Let go of me.

590
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,100
Mu Feng, she's disrupting the ceremony.

591
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,160
Drag her out.

592
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,580
You two really are in cahoots.

593
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,800
Zhuang Hanyan,

594
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,860
you killed Zhang Youchang and his wife.

595
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,400
You killed them.

596
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,840
Gentlemen, esteemed officials,

597
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,420
I have a grievance to reveal.

598
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,540
Please make him let me go.

599
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,540
Let go.

600
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
You can finish.

601
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,620
Master, My Lords,

602
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,460
it wasn't bandits

603
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,140
but Zhuang Hanyan

604
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,230
who killed Zhang Youchang and his wife.

605
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,300
You're just a maid.

606
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,980
What nonsense are you sprouting?

607
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,060
Indeed.

608
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,580
Without proof,

609
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,860
you can't make such accusations.

610
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,180
Of course, I have evidence.

611
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,380
Zhuang Hanyan, will you confess,

612
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,300
or should I say it for you?

613
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,260
I have nothing to confess.

614
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,890
But you've disrupted the ceremony.

615
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,860
If you cannot explain yourself,

616
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
I'm afraid

617
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,370
I'll need to charge you with slander.

618
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,680
Lang,

619
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,210
you were cast out of the family
because of me.

620
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,220
Even if you hate me,

621
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,300
you shouldn't use this to slander me.

622
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,140
This is the evidence.

623
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,500
What evidence is this?

624
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,080
Since you returned to the Capital,

625
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,880
you've repeatedly said

626
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,110
that you got along
with Zhang Youchang and his wife,

627
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,020
that your family was united and loving,

628
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,070
and that they treated you

629
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,820
like their own daughter.

630
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,820
Is that true?

631
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,200
So what?

632
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,820
You're still lying.

633
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,830
After I was cast out,

634
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,180
I went to Nanzhang Town in Danzhou

635
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,090
and made inquiries everywhere.

636
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,190
I found out

637
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,760
that you were abused and mistreated
by your cruel foster parents

638
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,640
since childhood.

639
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,100
You hated them deeply,

640
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,050
and the scars all over your body
are the proof.

641
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,020
What are you babbling about?

642
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,460
Many years ago,

643
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,200
Zhuang Hanyan fled the house,

644
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,430
with her head bleeding,
hiding in a neighbor's house.

645
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,050
Zhang Youchang chased her out

646
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,430
and trapped her

647
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,580
in a fishing net,

648
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,660
dragging her back home,

649
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,380
and attracting a crowd of onlookers.

650
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,410
Shut up!

651
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,320
How dare you slander

652
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,110
the deceased without evidence?

653
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,200
I want everyone to know

654
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,580
that Zhuang Hanyan is no kind person.

655
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
Just last year,

656
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,540
Zhuang Hanyan became enraged

657
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,060
and grabbed a cleaver,

658
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,840
hacking wildly at home.

659
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,900
Luckily, Zhang Youchang dodged in time,

660
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,900
but even so,

661
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,970
half of his little finger was cut off.

662
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,550
If not, he might've been killed.

663
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,500
This incident caused a huge uproar.

664
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,900
The county constables went
to question everyone.

665
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,780
There must be a record of it.

666
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,620
Hanyan,

667
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,820
is what she said

668
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,460
true?

669
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,580
It's true.

670
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,020
My foster parents treated me terribly,

671
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,580
and I hated them to the bone.

672
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,380
I kept these things hidden,

673
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,180
partly because I knew they were dead,

674
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,660
and it was over.

675
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,700
There's no need to damage
their reputation.

676
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,100
Besides, my parents sent me
to Danzhou when I was young.

677
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,660
If I reported this truthfully,

678
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,860
it'd seem like I was blaming my parents,

679
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,100
and it'd only make my family
feel guilty and sad.

680
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,460
Now that I've returned home,

681
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,940
with my family with me,

682
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,140
those old grudges should be let go.

683
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,500
Otherwise, it would be self-torture.

684
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,420
Since you still refuse to confess,

685
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,220
then let's have

686
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,780
Mr. Fu Yunxi
from the Judicial Review speak.

687
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,420
Not long ago, you visited Danzhou
to investigate this case,

688
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,860
but you claimed
that bandits killed them.

689
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,980
However, Nanzhang Town
is remote and poor.

690
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,720
Why would bandits wreak havoc here?

691
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,420
You must be trying to cover it up.

692
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,460
This place is not a court,

693
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,820
and you are not an official,

694
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,620
so I have no obligation to tell you.

695
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,780
I work for the Judicial Review.

696
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,740
You can't speak so insolently.

697
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
You've repeatedly accused others.

698
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,020
Do you have any real evidence?

699
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,980
Of course, I have evidence.

700
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,180
(Coroner Autopsy Report)

701
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,780
This is the coroner's autopsy report

702
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,620
from the yamen in Nanzhang Town.

703
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,540
It clearly states

704
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,740
that though Zhang Youchang

705
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,050
and his wife had knife wounds,

706
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,620
they died from a sharp weapon
stabbed through their necks.

707
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,000
Based on the wound, the coroner inferred

708
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,610
that the perpetrator

709
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,640
was a woman over five chi tall,

710
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,270
and the weapon

711
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,590
may have been a hairpin.

712
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,880
Zhuang Hanyan,
do you still refuse to confess?

713
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,700
Hanyan, what she says...

714
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,820
That's why you think I'm the murderer?

715
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,700
Am I the only woman in Danzhou?

716
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,840
Am I the only one in Danzhou

717
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,020
who wears a hairpin?

718
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,660
Then we should ask Mr. Fu.

719
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,740
This case is full of doubts.

720
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,540
Did you report it truthfully
to the Judicial Review?

721
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,900
If every case in the world had

722
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,620
to be reported to the Judicial Review,

723
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,500
would you be the one to handle it?

724
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,040
Today is the sacrifice
at the guild hall,

725
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,780
and it is not the time for debate.

726
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,740
Since this case still has many doubts,

727
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,980
take Zhuang Hanyan,
the lineal daughter of the Zhuangs,

728
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,140
to the Judicial Review
for further questioning.

729
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,940
Mr. Zhuang, forgive me.

730
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,260
Mr. Yan, you can't do this.

731
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,740
Mr. Yan, this case...

732
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,860
I'll personally handle this case.

733
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,060
The Judicial Review
will get to the bottom of it.

734
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,260
(Judicial Review)

735
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,460
Even the fiercest bandits

736
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,660
would confess their crimes

737
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,700
under these torture instruments.

738
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,540
Miss, you'd best confess,

739
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,020
at least to spare yourself some pain.

740
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,700
According to the law,

741
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,020
a suspect under arrest

742
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,420
must first undergo interrogation.

743
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,620
If they refuse to confess,

744
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,060
then the 12 Tortures are applied.

745
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,580
What right do you have to torture me?

746
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,820
You certainly know a lot.

747
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,180
Once you enter our interrogation room,

748
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,180
it's not your place to speak.

749
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,020
Stop.

750
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,260
Mr. Mu, do you have instructions?

751
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,340
Here.

752
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,620
Mr. Fu wants

753
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,660
a little leeway.

754
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,220
How can Mr. Fu interfere in this case?

755
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,400
But Mr. Yan is handling this trial.

756
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,180
I can't delay for long.

757
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,820
What about tomorrow?

758
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,450
The Zi hour tonight at the latest,

759
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,980
or I won't be able to explain it.

760
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,300
Fine, the Zi hour it is.

761
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,300
Don't act recklessly.

762
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,560
Mr. Fu is working on a plan.

763
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,620
My Lord,

764
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,140
Lang has signed her confession.

765
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,500
She has already left.

766
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,520
We're letting her go like this?

767
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,220
She has someone behind her,

768
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,780
so she won't back out.

769
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,620
No need to waste more time on her.

770
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,540
So, are we still going

771
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,560
to rescue Miss Zhuang Hanyan?

772
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,300
Recently, our family
has faced many hardships.

773
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,580
I pray for Hanyan to return home safely

774
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,460
and for Youchang's case
to be resolved soon.

775
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,420
Master, Miss Hanyan is blessed.

776
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,780
She'll be fine.

777
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,820
Even the Yama King
would lose half his life

778
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,300
under the Judicial Review's torture.

779
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,140
I shouldn't have

780
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,660
sent Hanyan to Danzhou years ago.

781
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,780
How much suffering
has she endured these years?

782
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,580
With Mr. Fu there,

783
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,460
I'm sure they won't make things hard
for Miss Hanyan.

784
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,420
Where is Lang now?

785
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,180
I don't know.

786
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,140
I really can't believe

787
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,820
that after she was cast out
because of Miss Hanyan,

788
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,780
she'd be so stubborn

789
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,100
and go to Danzhou.

790
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,220
Since she wants revenge,

791
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,620
she probably won't see us again.

792
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,830
Master,

793
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,020
why don't you go pull some strings?

794
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,820
Maybe there's still a way to maneuver.

795
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,380
Yes, yes.

796
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
I'll go now.

797
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
Miss Hanyan is imprisoned
by the Judicial Review.

798
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,980
I failed my duty

799
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,180
to protect her.

800
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,940
Please punish me, Madam.

801
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,660
Get up.

802
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,260
I already know.

803
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,900
Madam, please save Miss Hanyan.

804
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,900
The Judicial Review tortures
for confessions.

805
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,620
Even wrongful cases are made to stick.

806
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,620
Since she returned home,

807
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,580
I've arranged for you
to stay by her side.

808
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,620
Tell me.

809
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,700
Is she truly being wronged?

810
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,700
I...

811
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,860
I dare not speak recklessly.

812
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,540
If you ask me,

813
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,580
this is true.

814
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,860
Madam,

815
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,620
this is not the time for that.

816
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,100
Please save Miss Hanyan.

817
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,980
I don't plan to save her.

818
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,300
Madam...

819
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,260
I tried my best

820
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,660
to make her leave this place of turmoil,

821
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,620
but she wouldn't listen
to a single word,

822
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,500
just like I did back then.

823
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,220
People like us have to hit

824
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,220
that southern wall ourselves

825
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,620
until our heads are cracked,
our guts are torn,

826
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,620
and our families
are shattered and ruined.

827
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,860
Only then will we understand
what pain is,

828
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
and only then will we turn back.

829
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,900
Even if I save her today,

830
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,140
she'll still be doomed in the future.

831
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,500
However, Madam,

832
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,060
even if you're thinking far ahead
for Miss Hanyan,

833
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,260
she must first survive the present.

834
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,340
Shuhong,

835
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,780
don't worry about this for now.

836
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,100
When the madam heard
about today just now,

837
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,620
she wasn't sure

838
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,660
and went to Yuzhu Manor
to look for Miss Hanyan.

839
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,940
But Miss Hanyan wasn't there.

840
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,840
She was in the Judicial Review's prison.

841
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,820
I know

842
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,420
that the one in her room will save her,

843
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,620
but she might have to pay a price.

844
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,180
The one in her room...

845
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,980
Who is it?

846
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,220
Stop.

847
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,460
I have a question for you.

848
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,500
What happened

849
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,260
at the guild hall today?

850
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,020
The Danzhou murder case

851
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,380
has been exposed.

852
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,460
The Chief Minister
is investigating this case.

853
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,300
Even I can no longer intervene.

854
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,940
So, I came to see you.

855
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,980
What do you want to ask?

856
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,820
Why did Zhuang Hanyan
kill her foster parents?

857
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,820
It was an accident.

858
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,660
Tell me the whole story.

859
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,420
I need to know if there's any leeway.

860
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,780
I don't know.

861
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,300
That day,

862
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,460
I went to find her.

863
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,920
The place was already a mess
when I entered,

864
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,420
and there were two bodies on the ground.

865
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
Have you ever asked her?

866
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,180
I try my best

867
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,620
to carry out her orders,

868
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,500
but I never ask her

869
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,160
about things she doesn't say.

870
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,540
We've always been like that.

871
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,780
Where is she now?

872
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,660
In the Judicial Review's prison.

873
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,460
At the Zi hour tonight,
she'll face 12 Tortures.

874
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,860
If she confesses,
what will happen to her?

875
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,700
Killing her family
is against human nature.

876
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,740
It's a felony.

877
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,980
She'll be sliced

878
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,660
outside the Meridian Gate.

879
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,740
That couple was only
Mr. Zhuang's friends.

880
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,220
They weren't blood relatives.

881
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,780
If Zhou Ruyin hadn't let her

882
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,060
bring their memorial tablets

883
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,620
into the hall,

884
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,580
we could've used that,

885
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,460
but now...

886
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,300
Where are you going?

887
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,540
I'm going to surrender.

888
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,940
I killed them.

889
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,620
Do you know

890
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,460
what the 12 Tortures
at the Judicial Review are?

891
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,530
Finger and ankle crushing,

892
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,220
tendon pulling, skin peeling,

893
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,900
limb severing...

894
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,580
Aren't you afraid?

895
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,620
It's just death.

896
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,660
Is she worth this sacrifice?

897
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,900
It's not about that.

898
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,060
I just want to save her.

899
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,140
I truly admire

900
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,940
your loyalty and courage.

901
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,220
But if you rashly surrender now,

902
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,620
it'd be far-fetched.

903
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,260
What's your plan?

904
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,580
Once the bow is drawn,
there's no turning back.

905
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,780
Have you made up your mind?

906
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,060
Yes.

907
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,260
Zhuang Hanyan has a confession record.

908
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,500
There were seven or eight bandits.

909
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,560
Their faces
had no distinguishing features,

910
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,900
and they all wore dark blue clothes.

911
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,820
They also had strange tattoos.

912
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,180
I need one more favor.

913
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,820
Please tell me.

914
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,180
Don't let her know

915
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,460
about what I'll do.

916
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,860
But I want to know

917
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,260
who exactly you are

918
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,060
and what your relationship is.

919
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,280
Hurry up.

920
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,300
She's the last one.

921
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,100
Miss Zhuang Hanyan,

922
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,220
the Zi hour has passed.

923
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,620
Time to be tortured.

924
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,420
