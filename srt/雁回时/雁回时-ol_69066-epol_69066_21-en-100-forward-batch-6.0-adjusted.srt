=Episode 21=

00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,100
(Deng Mansion)

4
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,590
The messenger's identity is unknown.

5
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,480
Make sure to watch
over Mr. Deng's every move.

6
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Alright.

7
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,510
Be careful.

8
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,000
Watch over both the gates.

9
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,960
Keep an eye on anyone suspicious.

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,920
Yes.

11
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,190
(A Virtuous Legacy)
Come on, higher.

12
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,310
Come on.

13
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,990
Alright, that's enough.

14
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Good.

15
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,630
Master, we have a guest.

16
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,590
Who is it?
Why haven't you invited them in?

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,150
Alright, alright.

18
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,990
Grandfather.

19
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,120
It's Ms. Zhuang Hanyan.

20
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,960
She's come uninvited.

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,360
She must be up to no good.

22
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,960
I've seen her before.

23
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,470
She's a clever and proper young lady.

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,960
Grandfather, haven't you heard?

25
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,160
She's full of schemes
and is good at currying favor.

26
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,500
At this year's Lantern Festival,

27
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,240
Noble Consort Miao
even gifted her a jade bangle.

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,240
She's even associated
with Noble Consort Miao?

29
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,430
Greetings, Mr. Deng, Young Master Zaiye.

30
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,120
We didn't know you'd come.

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,510
Sorry for not welcoming you sooner.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Zhuang Hanyan,

33
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,910
we didn't send you an invitation, right?

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,880
I've long heard that Mrs. Deng is known
for her virtue and chastity,

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,430
and now she's been praised
by the Emperor.

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,700
(A Virtuous Legacy)
So, I wanted to pay my respects

37
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,850
and came uninvited.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,910
Mr. Deng, please forgive me.

39
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,840
Mrs. Fu, how considerate of you.

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,470
Your admiration for virtue and chastity

41
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,150
is indeed a comfort to us.

42
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,800
Please have a seat and enjoy some tea.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,470
Mrs. Fu, this way, please.

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,520
Congratulations, Mr. Deng.

45
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,680
- Wenzheng.
- Mr. Deng.

46
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,700
(Quelling the Rebels)

47
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,040
(A Virtuous Legacy)
Very good.

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
This is the Emperor's own handwriting.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,390
What honor for your family.

50
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,630
Mr. Deng, how fortunate you are.

51
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,950
Wenzheng,

52
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,680
that's not true.

53
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,950
Who in the court doesn't know

54
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,680
that Mr. Deng cares most

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,560
about family reputation and integrity?

56
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,310
It's only natural for him

57
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,390
to receive this honor today.

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,200
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Miss Deng Chan.

60
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,630
Miss, this is Mrs. Fu.

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,800
A woman's virtue

62
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,270
lies most in her chastity.

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,630
Mr. Zheng, you're quite fortunate.

64
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,210
Once your son marries
Mr. Deng's granddaughter,

65
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,680
as she will inherit her mother's will,

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
your family will also

67
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,680
enjoy this great honor

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,600
soon enough.

69
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Wenzheng, stop this nonsense.

70
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,630
Are you cursing my son?

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,600
Of course not. Come on.

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,680
Of course, I dare not.

73
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,040
Greetings, My Lords.

74
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,560
Today, you're the star.

75
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,070
Please take your seat.

76
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,070
Take your seat.

77
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,240
- Yes.
- Everyone.

78
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,190
Come on.

79
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,040
Have a look.

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,440
Take a look.

81
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,270
Congratulations.

82
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,360
- A virtuous legacy.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

83
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,680
Mrs. Deng is here.

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,750
Hurry. Please sit inside.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,140
Everyone, please take a seat.

86
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,070
Alright, sit down.

87
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,160
You've been a widow for years,
living in solitude.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,630
It must have been difficult for you.

89
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,950
In my opinion,

90
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,270
there is no easy life for any woman.

91
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,510
Being a widow is painful,

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,000
but caring for the husband and kids
is also hard.

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,000
Each has its own struggles.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,360
At least Mrs. Deng has received

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,310
a plaque from the Emperor.

96
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,750
But what about us?

97
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,680
What's happening?

98
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,310
Today is a day of celebration.

99
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,750
Let's all raise a cup

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,890
to Mrs. Deng.

101
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,390
- Here. To Mrs. Deng.
- Yes. To Mrs. Deng.

102
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
To Mrs. Deng.

103
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,150
- Come on.
- Cheers.

104
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,210
Please.

105
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,620
One more drink.

106
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,730
Alright, alright.

107
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,610
Let's drink.

108
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,450
One more drink.

109
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,290
Fill it up.

110
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,060
Sure.

111
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,490
One more drink to you.

112
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,760
A virtuous legacy.

113
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,230
How talented.

114
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,690
Good.

115
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,640
Qing,

116
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,850
did you see Zhuang Hanyan?

117
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,570
Young Master,

118
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,070
Mrs. Fu said she was going to change.

119
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,240
I feared she might get lost,

120
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,260
so I followed her out,

121
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,310
but I couldn't find her.

122
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
My son,

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,830
your mother has been
bedridden for years,

124
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,160
praying for your well-being in heaven,

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
so that you may protect our family.

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,950
Now,

127
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,000
she's finally had her wish fulfilled.

128
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,360
For 16 years,

129
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,480
Zhang has devoted herself to chastity

130
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,180
(Spirit Tablet of Deng Xiangzhao)
and has been filial and dutiful.

131
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,390
Today,

132
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,630
she's been honored
with a chastity plaque

133
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,430
by the Emperor.

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,160
(Outstanding Descendants)
This is an honor for our family

135
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,510
and for you.

136
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,270
Grandfather.

137
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,240
Zaiye, come here.

138
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,190
Come here to talk to your father.

139
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,030
Grandfather,

140
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,120
I just saw Zhuang Hanyan

141
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,920
sneak out from the banquet.

142
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,870
I followed her,

143
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,790
but somehow, she vanished.

144
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
Did you hear anything unusual?

145
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
How is it?

146
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,510
I didn't see anything wrong.

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,080
The banquet is almost over.

148
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,790
Could it be that your info was wrong?

149
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
Who are you?

150
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,000
That should be my question.

151
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,750
Sir, who are you?

152
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,240
Why did you sneak

153
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,510
into the Dengs' inner chambers so late?

154
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,870
I am Cheng Lei, a student
of the Directorate of Education.

155
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
I came tonight

156
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,200
to deliver something to Mr. Deng.

157
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
So, it was you.

158
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,270
What do you mean?

159
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,950
It is improper for an outsider
to trespass into the inner chambers.

160
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,080
Mr. Deng ordered me
to wait for you here.

161
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,600
Give me it.

162
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,200
This...

163
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,270
This is extremely valuable.

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,240
I must deliver it to Mr. Deng in person.

165
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,910
Grandfather,
you've always been reserved,

166
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,870
yet you drank so much tonight.

167
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,710
Let's go.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm glad.

169
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm so glad.

170
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,900
I thought we'd leave empty-handed,

171
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,120
but after a twist of fate,

172
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
we still obtained it.

173
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,940
(Legend of Huayue)

174
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,960
Why is it a novel?

175
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,420
Where is the joint memorial?

176
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,030
It seems the man from earlier

177
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
wasn't the messenger.

178
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,910
Then why did he sneak
into the Deng Mansion

179
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,050
in the middle of the night?

180
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,120
The small regular script is clearly
written by a woman.

181
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
Look.

182
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,480
This novel has

183
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,750
a lot of red comments.

184
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,910
They're probably from a man.

185
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,360
There's a name signed in the comments.

186
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,000
Cheng Lei.

187
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,390
Didn't the young master just say

188
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,750
his name was Cheng Lei?

189
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,870
Yes.

190
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750
That's it.

191
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,700
(By Chan Zhixue)
The author is Chan Zhixue.

192
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
It must be Deng Chan.

193
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,030
Those two...

194
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,950
They left these comments to each other.

195
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,600
Let's take a look

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,870
to find out how they met

197
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,070
and what their relationship is.

198
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,080
At the lantern banquet,

199
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I found this book by accident.

200
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,740
(Lantern Banquet)

201
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,800
Chan.

202
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Chan.

203
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,510
Coming.

204
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,060
At the lantern banquet,

205
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,670
I found this book by accident.

206
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
I carefully read it,
but it was not enough.

207
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,030
I boldly added some comments in red

208
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,390
and left it at Linjiang Pavilion.

209
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,390
(Legend of Huayue)

210
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,840
If you happen to collect it

211
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
and continue the story,

212
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
can you still leave it
at Linjiang Pavilion?

213
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,390
I'll visit every day to ask around.

214
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,440
Hopefully, I can read the rest.

215
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,360
Ms. Qu is a charming woman.

216
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,840
She's unconventional and brave,

217
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,970
(Legend of Huayue by Chan Zhixue)
breaking out of the mundane world.

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,030
You must be like this too.

219
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,080
I admire you,

220
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,670
and my heart longs for you.

221
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,870
(Legend of Huayue)
I hope we can meet.

222
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,790
(They ignore the moon)

223
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,270
The world loves appearances,

224
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,750
but I alone cherish the soul.

225
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,030
Mr. Meng and Ms. Qu
are meant to be together.

226
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,550
Ms. Zhixue, we know each other
through literature.

227
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,840
Is it also bound by destiny?

228
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,000
(Dressed in simple attire,
she went to offer advice.)

229
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,220
Like Mr. Meng,

230
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,360
I've fallen in love with a woman
who is unique in this world.

231
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,000
She haunts my dreams,

232
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,840
and I can't sleep at night.

233
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,630
I've fallen for you,

234
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,730
but I wonder what you think of me.

235
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,190
I am Cheng Lei, a student
of the Directorate of Education.

236
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,050
I don't have a prominent family
or much talent,

237
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,640
but I have a sincere heart.

238
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,240
I hereby propose to you.

239
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,320
I'll wait for you

240
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
at Changle Pavilion.

241
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,000
Thanks to your encouragement,

242
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,910
Legend of Huayue can continue its story.

243
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,030
(Legend of Huayue by Chan Zhixue)
Yet it's just a fleeting illusion.

244
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,540
I've been long trapped
in the inner chambers.

245
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,110
To meet someone who understands me

246
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,150
through literature
is already a stroke of luck.

247
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,080
You're a student with high aspirations

248
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,790
of the Emperor,

249
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,030
while I have been engaged.

250
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,560
I'm not the right one for you.

251
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,150
Today, this is my farewell letter.

252
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,630
Chan Zhixue no longer exists.

253
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,870
I hope you will return
to the right path,

254
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,440
and may your future be bright.

255
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,600
(Breeze Under Moonlight)
These two met through literature

256
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,750
and fell in love,
but could not be together.

257
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,000
So, Deng Chan wrote
this farewell letter.

258
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Tonight,

259
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,390
Cheng Lei was there to meet Miss Deng.

260
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,120
She's been engaged
to Young Master Ziyan,

261
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,640
but she has met someone
who understands her.

262
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,150
This is truly a dilemma.

263
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,000
Mr. Deng values honor
and integrity above all,

264
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,840
and today their family has received

265
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,910
a chastity plaque from the Emperor.

266
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,030
But Miss Deng

267
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,390
has a secret relationship with a man.

268
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,440
You mean...

269
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,960
My Lord,

270
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,830
it seems something is wrong
at the Deng Mansion.

271
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,550
Mr. Cheng,

272
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,150
my family is of a reputable lineage.

273
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,820
Today we've just received

274
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,670
the plaque of "A Virtuous Legacy".

275
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,790
Yet here you are,

276
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,150
unconscious in my inner chambers.

277
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
If this word gets out,

278
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,030
how will I ever show my face?

279
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,030
My Lord, please calm down. I'm sorry.

280
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,600
Why did you sneak into here?

281
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,680
Tell me.

282
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,000
I came tonight to see...

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
Grandfather.

284
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,870
Grandfather.

285
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,200
Why have you come to my house?

286
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,360
Chan.

287
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,240
Is Mr. Cheng here to see you?

288
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,390
Grandfather.

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,390
Let's get rid of this man first.

290
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,670
Greetings, Mr. Deng.

291
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,910
The banquet is over.

292
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,320
What is this about?

293
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,320
After the banquet was over,

294
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,150
we found a novel on our way out.

295
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,360
So, we came to return it.

296
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,800
Cheng Lei.

297
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,840
Chan Zhixue... Chan.

298
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,960
This book is filled with filth.

299
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,910
Did you write all of this?

300
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,230
Answer me.

301
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,630
Yes.

302
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,040
Yes, it was me.

303
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,390
Miss Deng,

304
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,320
don't speak nonsense
and ruin your reputation.

305
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,240
Chan Zhixue isn't you.

306
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Who's speaking nonsense?

307
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,910
Why did you come here today?

308
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,030
Do you want to ruin

309
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,270
my family's reputation?

310
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,230
Chan,

311
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,480
you're engaged to Young Master Ziyan.

312
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,200
How could you do such

313
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,000
a disgraceful thing?

314
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,750
Grandfather, please calm down.

315
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,630
I...

316
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,750
I know I was wrong.

317
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,200
Thank you.

318
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,390
This is our family matter.

319
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,360
Please leave.

320
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,200
Mr. Deng,

321
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,630
if this gets out,

322
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,550
it will surely damage
your family's long-standing reputation.

323
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,000
But don't worry.

324
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,120
My wife and I will

325
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,000
keep this secret.

326
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
We won't say a word.

327
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,270
What do you mean?

328
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,510
To keep a secret,

329
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,170
of course, there are conditions.

330
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,550
Apart from you,

331
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,750
who else also signed

332
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,750
the joint memorial?

333
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,240
As expected,

334
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,360
you two

335
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,270
are here for this.

336
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,750
Miss Deng Chan and I

337
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,240
have met before.

338
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,630
I would never harm her.

339
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,390
About this, we will...

340
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,270
Shut up.

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,030
As a woman,

342
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
instead of staying home
and observing your duties,

343
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,480
you're constantly out in public,

344
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,270
even associating
with a notorious consort.

345
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,910
Do you have any sense of shame left?

346
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,190
Grandfather.

347
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,800
You...

348
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,150
Mr. Fu.

349
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,790
Mr. Deng, I'm afraid

350
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,590
her behavior

351
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,880
is not for you to judge.

352
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,390
You...

353
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,590
I've dedicated

354
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,110
my whole life to serving our country

355
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,240
and contributed everything I can.

356
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,640
How can I be coerced

357
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,510
by you two?

358
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,010
Tomorrow, I will go to the Zhengs' place
to apologize and cancel the engagement.

359
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,350
Since you two have made such a mistake,

360
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,550
you must marry immediately.

361
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,750
It can't be delayed.

362
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,590
You can't do this.

363
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,440
You can't do this, Father.

364
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,960
Father, please reconsider.

365
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,270
How dare you come here?

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,640
Is this the daughter you raised?

367
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,670
Father,

368
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,350
I'm willing to be punished
at the ancestral hall,

369
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,760
but Chan

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,480
can't marry Mr. Cheng.

371
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,310
She's been engaged since childhood.

372
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,550
This is known throughout the Capital.

373
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,830
If we suddenly

374
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,680
let her marry someone else,

375
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,160
how will she

376
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,350
face others in the future, Father?

377
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,920
Chan.

378
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,240
Mother,

379
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,110
I'm willing.

380
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,000
- Miss Deng.
- Mr. Cheng.

381
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,790
What? In just a few days,

382
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,310
have you fallen for another woman?

383
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,280
No, I haven't.

384
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,350
Then marry me.

385
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,760
- I...
- Chan.

386
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,070
Don't be foolish.

387
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,350
Mother, I know

388
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,100
you went to great lengths

389
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,480
to choose Ziyan for me.

390
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,680
But now, I only love Mr. Cheng.

391
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,790
Don't persuade me anymore.

392
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,200
This might be better for all of us.

393
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,510
Cheng Lei isn't a good match.

394
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,310
You will regret it if you marry him.

395
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,070
Since you say I'm not a good match,

396
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,270
then what do you consider

397
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,590
a good match, Mrs. Deng?

398
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,430
You...

399
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,190
I...

400
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,030
I've heard of you.

401
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,640
As a student
of the Directorate of Education,

402
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,030
you have little real talent.

403
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,160
When your parents were alive,

404
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,880
they were lowly merchants.

405
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,960
You donated your family wealth

406
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,570
to get into the Directorate of Education

407
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,960
and became an extra student.

408
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,000
You'll amount to nothing in the future.

409
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,680
How can my daughter

410
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,880
give up Young Master Ziyan,

411
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,270
her childhood sweetheart
equal to her in status,

412
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,680
and marry you?

413
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,550
Mrs. Deng, I've long heard

414
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,400
of your good reputation.

415
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,160
Everyone says you are virtuous,

416
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,510
knowledgeable, and well-mannered.

417
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,790
But I didn't expect you

418
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,440
to be so arrogant and rude.

419
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,880
- You...
- So what if my parents were merchants?

420
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,130
In every class,
there is a place for everyone.

421
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,510
My parents died early,

422
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,070
leaving behind land and shops.

423
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,160
Though I can't hold an official post,

424
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,590
I can still support my wife and kids.

425
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,790
Shut up.

426
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,790
When did this family

427
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,960
fall under your control?

428
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,960
A virtuous legacy.

429
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,590
A virtuous legacy.

430
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,270
- The Emperor wrote this.
- Father.

431
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,270
As a mother,

432
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,270
you've failed to teach your kids.

433
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,960
How dare you kneel under the plaque

434
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,240
and say those shameless words?

435
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,920
Father...

436
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,200
You two

437
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,000
won't get your way.

438
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,070
My family's long-standing reputation

439
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,200
wasn't built through deceit.

440
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,200
It was passed down with respect

441
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,920
and righteousness through generations.

442
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,880
Even if we're shattered to pieces

443
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,830
and have to die for principles,

444
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,480
the Dengs

445
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,160
will bear it gladly.

446
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,280
Leave!

447
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,160
- Grandfather.
- Father.

448
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,880
Father.

449
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,740
(Calligraphy and Painting)

450
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,350
I didn't expect

451
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,960
that Mr. Deng would be willing

452
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,790
to let Deng Chan marry Mr. Cheng.

453
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,240
Don't you think

454
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,110
there's something more

455
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,680
between Cheng Lei and Deng Chan?

456
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,720
They were both supposed to be happy

457
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,410
as they were allowed
to marry each other,

458
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,550
but one was in tears,

459
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,640
and the other was filled
with shame and anger.

460
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,240
It's really strange.

461
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,880
Should I have Mu Feng and Mu Yan

462
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,080
keep an eye on them?

463
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,310
Alright.

464
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,180
(Two days later)

465
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,250
What's this?

466
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,590
Mu Feng just reported

467
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,030
that someone from the Deng family
sneaked out.

468
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,870
It was Deng Chan.

469
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,750
Tomorrow is the wedding day.

470
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,470
Is she trying to run away
from the wedding?

471
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,970
My Lord, Cheng Lei also sneaked out.

472
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,580
He seems to be heading towards the east.

473
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,510
Maybe he's going to see Miss Deng.

474
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,590
Mu Feng said

475
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,790
Miss Deng was heading towards the west.

476
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,590
Let's split up.

477
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,590
Alright.

478
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,480
You should go.

479
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,240
Leave the Capital tonight.

480
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,070
I'm begging you.

481
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,490
I won't go.

482
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,990
If I'm leaving, I'll leave with you.

483
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,680
You've suffered so much in this life.

484
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,530
It's enough.

485
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,780
You don't owe anyone anything.

486
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,550
Why are you being so foolish?

487
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
I've already closed my heart.

488
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm shackled.

489
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,110
Please stop being so childish, alright?

490
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,510
Ask yourself.

491
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,750
In your dreams of flowers and moonlight,

492
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,270
have I never appeared in them?

493
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,400
I love only Chan Zhixue.

494
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,400
I don't care if you're young or old,

495
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,110
beautiful or ugly.

496
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,510
Don't you understand me?

497
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,110
I was wrong.

498
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,270
You can't take back

499
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,810
the token of our love once it's given.

500
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,750
Let me break it for you.

501
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,570
Just consider that I've betrayed you.

502
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,480
Please forget me.

503
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,840
I don't understand.

504
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,440
We've known each other since childhood,

505
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
and we're supposed to get married.

506
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,000
How can that lose

507
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,540
to your relationship with an outsider?

508
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,980
I don't believe you've fallen
for someone else.

509
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Don't ask me anymore.

510
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,160
I've wronged your family.

511
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,830
Chan, what's the real reason?

512
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
Tell me.

513
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,370
We'll figure it out together.

514
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,840
I...

515
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,880
I never loved Cheng Lei.

516
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,070
I've only loved you.

517
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,910
But...

518
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,680
It concerns my family.

519
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,480
I...

520
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,030
I have no other choice.

521
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,350
Ziyan,

522
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,240
if you truly care for me,

523
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,400
stop questioning me, alright?

524
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,960
Miss, we should go back now.

525
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,590
It's wrong.

526
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,000
Everything's wrong.

527
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,240
It's my fault.

528
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,880
I didn't follow my duties as a woman.

529
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,750
I've damaged my reputation.

530
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,880
I shouldn't have written
such absurd things.

531
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,350
It's me.

532
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,400
I've ruined you.

533
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,480
I've ruined Chan.

534
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,020
(Legend of Huayue)

535
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,350
Mother.

536
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,800
Coming.

537
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,500
(Hopefully, I can read the rest.)

538
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,300
(Dressed in simple attire)

539
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,860
(Legend of Huayue by Chan Zhixue)

540
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,240
(As it turns out,)

541
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,880
(this is the truth.)

542
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,880
It's been widely spread in the Capital

543
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,510
that Mrs. Deng, Lady Zhang,

544
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,030
is a woman of great chastity and virtue.

545
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,880
I once thought

546
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,920
you were a silent statue,

547
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,690
free from sorrow or joy
and love or desire.

548
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,750
But that day, I realized

549
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,070
you are Chan Zhixue
who wrote the Legend of Huayue.

550
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,910
Do you know

551
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,750
how I felt?

552
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I don't want to know.

553
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,320
- I don't want to know.
- When my father was around,

554
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,790
I once talked about abandoning
the scholar path.

555
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,760
But my father

556
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,200
locked me in a dark, suffocating cellar

557
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,400
for three days and nights.

558
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,400
After three days,

559
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,550
I walked out in a daze

560
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,750
and looked up to see
the morning glow in the sky.

561
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,960
You are

562
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,110
that morning glow to me.

563
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,550
But I'm a widow.

564
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,270
I'm a widow
who is 12 years older than you

565
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,200
and just received a chastity plaque.

566
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,270
A chastity plaque...

567
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,750
Did you really care about that?

568
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,280
I...

569
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,590
Ms. Qu in your story

570
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,790
gave me the courage to abandon

571
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,500
the official path and enter business.

572
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,910
But now,

573
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,830
why don't you dare
break free from your cage?

574
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
As long as we're in love,

575
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,750
what does age, status,

576
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,310
or the eyes of the world matter?

577
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,240
Madam, we must leave.
Someone's following us.

578
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,830
Who's there?

579
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,840
Someone's here.

580
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,110
Let's split up.

581
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,000
Alright.

582
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,400
Be careful.

583
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,390
Father.

584
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,910
Father.

585
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,640
The servants reported

586
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,960
that you left the house so late,
but I didn't believe it.

587
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
Did you really have an affair
with an outsider?

588
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,390
Father,

589
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,390
I didn't.

590
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,550
Then who was that man talking
with you just now?

591
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,350
Tempting a chaste widow

592
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,350
is punishable by skinning

593
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,000
and dismembering if he were captured.

594
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,240
Father,

595
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,240
it's my fault.

596
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,400
I failed my duties as a woman

597
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,880
and went out without permission.

598
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,560
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

599
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,400
Father, please discern the truth.

600
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,160
You're still making excuses for him.

601
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,000
You can't even protect yourself.

602
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,040
- Come.
- Stop.

603
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,350
My Lord, it was me

604
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,030
who forced Mrs. Deng to meet me.

605
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,920
It's my fault.

606
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,200
No, Father.

607
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,040
Cheng Lei...

608
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,190
You...

609
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,430
So,

610
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,030
this obscene book

611
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,270
was your secret connection?

612
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,270
- No, Father.
- Have you no shame?

613
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,670
- Father.
- Shut up.

614
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,310
You shameless, immoral woman.

615
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,590
Mr. Deng, what is a woman's duty?

616
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,640
Why is it that a widower can remarry

617
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,680
but a widow can't?

618
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,270
Why can men have multiple concubines,

619
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,440
but women must be loyal
to one man forever?

620
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,110
Why is a man's flirtation praised,

621
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,000
while a woman seeking happiness

622
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,270
is nailed to the pillar of shame?

623
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,790
We're all human.

624
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,070
Are women born
to suppress their desires?

625
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,440
If this is your so-called women's duty,

626
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,240
then there's no need to carry it out.

627
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,350
Zhuang Hanyan, it's you again.

628
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,160
It must've been you

629
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,590
who instigated them to commit adultery

630
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,050
and ruin my family's reputation.

631
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,750
You wicked woman.

632
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,750
Before you got married,

633
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,750
I could tell you were no good.

634
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Now, after marrying Mr. Fu,

635
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,270
you often show yourself
in public, ruining morals.

636
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,310
If Fu Yunxi refuses to discipline you,

637
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,030
I will do it for him.

638
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,280
- Mother.
- You...

639
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,240
Chan.

640
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,870
Mr. Deng,

641
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,270
a couple is united as one.

642
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,350
Are you going

643
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,830
to slap me in the face?

644
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,880
Fine.

645
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,640
The public morals are falling apart.

646
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,440
Rituals and laws are doomed.

647
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,040
Chan.

648
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,520
Grandfather,

649
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,830
for the sake of my mother's years

650
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,160
of loyal service to our family,

651
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,040
please

652
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,460
spare her.

653
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,070
You're also defending her?

654
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,160
Are you also going to become

655
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,640
a shameless, immoral women like her?

656
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
I...

657
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,960
Chan, Chan.

658
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,640
Let me see it.

659
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,480
If my daughter had a choice,

660
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,880
I'd rather

661
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,440
she never became

662
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,900
a good woman like I was,

663
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,790
praised by everyone.

664
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,960
Zhang,

665
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
how dare you speak

666
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,030
such reckless words?

667
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,790
I just spoke the truth,

668
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,750
and you can't bear it?

669
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,640
Get up, Chan.

670
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,590
Today,

671
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,070
let me tell you all the truth.

672
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,880
It's been 17 years.

673
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,550
I've never missed

674
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
my late husband day and night

675
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,200
and adhered to a woman's duty.

676
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,000
I never truly loved your son.

677
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,200
I've even forgotten what he looks like.

678
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,590
- You...
- Between him and me,

679
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,750
there was never any warmth or affection.

680
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,830
He despised my poetry and literature

681
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,200
and burned my books.

682
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
But I know

683
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,550
he was just jealous

684
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,830
and afraid.

685
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,790
He was a mediocre man

686
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,750
who was born

687
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,920
into a scholarly family like yours.

688
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,110
You...

689
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,840
Do you know?

690
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,830
The essays of your son

691
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,070
that you highly praised

692
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,830
were written

693
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,200
by me.

694
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
He stole my talent

695
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
while suppressing me.

696
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,310
Whenever he felt inferior,

697
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,550
he would ignore and torment me.

698
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,000
I've had enough.

699
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,020
I don't want to endure this any longer.

700
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,510
I've had enough.

701
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,550
Nonsense.

702
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,700
How can you accuse my son without proof?

703
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,440
You can't believe the words
of a shameless woman.

704
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,510
What is a shameless woman?

705
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,840
If breaking free from chains
makes me a shameless woman,

706
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,700
and trapping myself
makes me a virtuous woman,

707
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,350
what's wrong with being
a shameless women?

708
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,190
You...

709
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,270
It's been 17 years.

710
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,680
I've sacrificed

711
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,880
17 years of my life.

712
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,070
For an empty reputation,

713
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,000
I've locked myself

714
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,440
in a cage

715
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,270
called chastity.

716
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,400
I've been tied to it
like it's part of my flesh,

717
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,510
and it's hard for me to break free.

718
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,550
But today,

719
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,550
I no longer wish

720
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,960
to keep that chastity plaque

721
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,920
for you

722
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,400
and for your vanity.

723
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,790
I want to reclaim my name.

724
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,480
My name is Zhang Wanjun,

725
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,880
the eldest daughter

726
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,710
of the Zhang family

727
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,550
in Jiying Alley.

728
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,510
For my brother's career,

729
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,550
for the prosperity of my family,

730
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,710
and

731
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,030
for my children's future,

732
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,590
I've endured for many years.

733
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,360
But today,

734
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,440
I want to live for myself.

735
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,630
I want to live well.

736
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,030
You've gone mad.

737
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,230
You've gone mad.

738
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,230
Yes, I've gone mad.

739
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,550
For 17 years,

740
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,710
I've shaped myself into a revered,

741
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,630
untouchable figure.

742
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,840
Today,

743
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,070
I'm going to shatter that figure
with my own hands.

744
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,360
Even if it breaks,

745
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,070
I can still piece it together.

746
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,840
I can do it.

747
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,710
I can do this.

748
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,480
Even if I'm bleeding

749
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,800
and covered in wounds,

750
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,960
as long as my name remains,

751
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,840
I am

752
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,510
a complete woman.

753
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,840
Why can't I

754
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,210
have someone who understands me,

755
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,720
respects me,

756
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,550
and cherishes me to love me?

757
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,110
Why can't I?

758
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,280
Why can't I

759
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,240
live without fear

760
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,550
for once?

761
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,430
Someone.

762
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,280
The madam is delirious,

763
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,400
speaking nonsense.

764
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,000
Take her back immediately,

765
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,310
and confine her for treatment.

766
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,280
Take the young lady back
and watch over her.

767
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,300
Tomorrow, she'll get married
at an auspicious time.

768
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,070
Whoever obstructs my family affairs

769
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,230
will face my wrath.

770
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,680
Go.

771
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,000
- Grandfather, I won't marry him.
- Go.

772
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,670
- No.
- I won't marry him.

773
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,710
I'm not afraid.

774
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,710
I won't marry her.

775
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,360
I love only Chan Zhixue.

776
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Let me go.

777
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,630
Let me go.

778
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,820
(Deng Mansion)

779
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,940
(Wedding procession, Zheng Mansion)

780
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,010
- This...
- Master.

781
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,770
Master, bad news.

782
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,060
The inner chambers are on fire.

783
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,990
Let's go.

784
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,840
Go fetch water. Water!

785
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,960
The imperial edict is in her room.

786
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,630
The edict is important.

787
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,150
Put out the fire.

788
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,230
Mr. Deng,

789
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,960
if you want peace in your home,

790
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,110
the fire you truly need to extinguish

791
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,760
is the stubborn,

792
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,840
obsessive fire in your heart.

793
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,030
It's you.

794
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,790
You let her go.

795
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,840
From now on, there won't no Mrs. Deng

796
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,920
or the student Cheng Lei in this world.

797
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,880
When did you let her go?

798
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,480
Where are all my servants?

799
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,880
I've served
in the Judicial Review for years.

800
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,070
This is just a piece of cake

801
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,590
for me.

802
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,590
Fu Yunxi,

803
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,070
you and your wife are very bold.

804
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,710
Don't you fear

805
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,880
being imprisoned or executed?

806
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,670
Your chaste daughter-in-law,

807
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,360
after receiving praise,

808
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,190
remembered her late husband
with deep sorrow,

809
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,760
so today, she set herself on fire

810
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,280
to join him in death.

811
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,680
Is Noble Consort Miao

812
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,110
behind all of this?

813
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,030
It's an act for the sake of justice.

814
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,880
No one is behind it.

815
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,360
What crime have I committed?

816
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,230
Would the heavens destroy me too?

817
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,230
You knew the importance
of a woman's reputation,

818
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,880
yet you still insisted on tarnishing

819
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,550
the name of an innocent childless woman

820
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,110
in the Palace.

821
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,510
Is this

822
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,710
not a crime?

823
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,630
Mr. Deng, you've repeatedly said

824
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,800
that you must protect your family's

825
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,530
long-standing reputation and foundation

826
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,960
even if you're shattered to pieces

827
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,630
and have to die for principles.

828
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,630
Zhang Wanjun has left the Capital,

829
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,480
and her name for chastity and virtue

830
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,960
should be burned clean

831
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,510
in this fire.

832
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,350
No, no, no.

833
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,390
I'll tell you.

834
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,590
I'll tell you everything.

835
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,320
We're all ears.

836
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,280
I know that everything you've done

837
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,760
is to help Noble Consort Miao,

838
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,440
but there's no need to involve others.

839
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,000
So, who should we involve?

840
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,550
Only one man is to be blamed for this.

841
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,710
The others

842
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,030
only did some paperwork.

843
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,320
The one who wants
to kill Noble Consort Miao

844
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,960
is Yao Zhidong, Grand Secretary

845
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,280
of the Hall of Literary Glory.

846
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,840
What I can do

847
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,510
is withdraw from this petition.

848
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,680
But Mr. Yao

849
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,480
has a great influence on the scholars.

850
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,150
As long as he doesn't stop,

851
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,360
more people will follow him
to submit petitions.

852
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
I've said everything.

853
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,510
You must guarantee

854
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,710
not to reveal Zhang's whereabouts.

855
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,800
As long as your words are true,

856
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,190
we won't breathe a word.

857
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,510
Let's go.

858
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,480
Ancestors above,

859
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,920
I've preserved our family's

860
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,670
long-standing reputation.

861
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,190
