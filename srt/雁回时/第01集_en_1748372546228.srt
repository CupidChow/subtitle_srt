1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
The same city is so great.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,280
The same city is so great.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,120
The same city is so great.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,720
Good thing you're here.

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,760
You'll understand when you go back.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
So to say,

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,040
now,

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,320
I have to change him to a brother-in-law.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Episode 1

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,560
My name is Zhuang Han Yan.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,040
My grandfather was born in me.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
My father was a prince.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,640
The emperor said

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,000
I was a devout.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,640
I would bring disaster to my family.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,680
So,

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,160
I was sent by Lian Ye

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,920
to the country.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,320
I was raised in the same house with my father.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,880
They said I was born in the capital.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,200
My father was a editor in the imperial court.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,280
My mother

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,400
is a famous girl from the capital.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,800
But I've never seen her before.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,440
I grew up in the village.

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,920
My family was a good girl.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,000
I was born at the time of my 17th birthday.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,520
Where did you get the money?

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,040
What?

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,680
You've got all the money?

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Take it away.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
I don't have any money.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,120
Qianqian paid you.

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,440
What else do you want?

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,760
If you had the power, you would have sold it for me.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Who wants to kill you?

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,400
You sold it.

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,360
Before he died,

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,280
he was raised for 17 years.

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,240
He was not even born.

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
You sold it to him.

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
You're dead.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Don't run.

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
Stop.

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,240
Don't run.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,200
Let me go.

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,520
Stop.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,040
Don't run.

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,440
Throw the ash too.

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,800
Qianqian.

51
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,880
Are you cold?

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,280
Qianqian.

53
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Sister.

54
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Zhi.

55
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Come back.

56
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Zhi.

57
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Leave her alone.

58
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
This is Miss Xia Jia.

59
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Miss.

60
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
What's wrong with you?

61
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Why are you hiding in front of our Zhuang family?

62
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I am

63
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Zhuang Han Yan.

64
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Zhuang Han Yan?

65
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Why is he acting like Zhuang?

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Miss San.

67
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Miss San.

68
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
It's that Miss San.

69
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
It's the Miss San in the family.

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Someone is coming.

71
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
She is coming.

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Master.

73
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Mrs. Cao.

74
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
She is back.

75
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
I heard that Miss San is back home.

76
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Where is she now?

77
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Miss San is in the military camp.

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Your uncle's life in Shen Shen

79
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
has been reported to the Prime Minister.

80
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
How did you escape?

81
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
I will never forget that day.

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,280
That time, Hai Fei broke into the family door with a knife.

83
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
It was uncle and aunt

84
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
who blocked their knife for me

85
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
and pulled their legs.

86
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
They fought for me for a thousand lives.

87
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
They died so long ago.

88
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
They all died to save me.

89
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
There are thousands of people in the capital.

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
I have been looking for them in the capital.

91
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I have been in the blood and I have been in the city for a long time.

92
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
How do you know

93
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
that Zhuang family is in the city?

94
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,280
It's hard to find out.

95
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Miss.

96
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Thank you.

97
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
How did you kill Hai Fei in your uncle's life?

98
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
How is your face?

99
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
How is your clothes?

100
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Please tell me more details.

101
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
There are seven or eight people in the palace.

102
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
I can't understand what they are saying.

103
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,280
My face is not normal.

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
But I have a lot of dirty clothes.

105
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,280
I have some strange feelings.

106
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
It's been a long time.

107
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
It's been a long time.

108
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
It's been a long time.

109
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
I can't remember what they said.

110
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I have no idea.

111
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
But I am like a girl.

112
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I will put these evil people in my heart.

113
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,280
If they catch me in the future,

114
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
I will be punished.

115
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Miss.

116
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Do you have any other questions?

117
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
I have been busy with my work.

118
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I don't dare to lie to the officials.

119
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Please don't mind.

120
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
I will get the evil money soon.

121
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I will pay for my uncle's death.

122
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
It's a justice.

123
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
If Miss. San is hiding something,

124
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
I am afraid she can't hide it for a few days.

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I will take my leave.

126
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Take care.

127
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
What do you want?

128
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Miss, you don't know.

129
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
This official is named Fu Yunxi.

130
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
He is a young man from Dali Temple.

131
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,280
He is also the husband of the late Fu Yunxi.

132
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
He is Fu Yunxi.

133
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
I am married to him,

134
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
but I have never been married.

135
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Why do you call him a son-in-law?

136
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Miss San is a young man from Dali Temple.

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
She seems to be a little unruly.

138
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
This marriage contract was signed by Miss.

139
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
by our family.

140
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
But Miss.

141
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
How is she?

142
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
She is a fat girl.

143
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
You should take care of her.

144
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
You will understand when you come back.

145
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
In that case,

146
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,280
I have to call her brother-in-law.

147
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Miss.

148
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Miss.

149
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Nothing.

150
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Miss, don't worry.

151
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Our father is a great man.

152
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
But this is the case of Changxiong.

153
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
He will catch the real brother soon.

154
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
What is the great man?

155
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
The father and the aunt are famous officials from Dali Temple.

156
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
They have been exposed to many cases.

157
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Even now,

158
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,280
the case of the heaven lock-up factory in the capital is also his case.

159
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
The Great General of Dali Temple

160
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
The Great General of Dali Temple

161
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
My lord.

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Have you called?

163
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Yes.

164
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
I can't say anything.

165
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Let's go and have a look.

166
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
My lord.

167
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Father,

168
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
you are a stubborn and filial man.

169
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You are a man of the past.

170
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,280
You are a man of the past.

171
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
You are a bastard.

172
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
What crime did I commit?

173
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Why did you take my place?

174
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Old rule.

175
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I am your father's uncle.

176
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
You...

177
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
You bastard.

178
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
You are a man of the past.

179
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
You are a man of the past.

180
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Do you know the name of the company?

181
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Don't laugh at me.

182
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
For decades,

183
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
the Great General of Dali Temple has been using the power of the heaven lock-up factory.

184
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Moreover,

185
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
he has set up a group factory in the capital.

186
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
He has collected the land and created the name of the party.

187
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
He even created the name of the rebel.

188
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
He has killed many innocent people.

189
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
He has been taking care of the crime of the court.

190
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
You are so loyal to the left.

191
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
I am really happy to be with you.

192
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
I can escape this time.

193
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Pei Dafu has been in the house for years.

194
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
He said that his private property can be used as a treasury.

195
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
But I have been in the Dali Temple for more than a few days.

196
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
I only see his family as a family and look at it as a couple.

197
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,280
What is the secret behind his name and property?

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
How would I know?

199
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Uncle.

200
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
If I can help you find the property,

201
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
maybe I can help you to save your life.

202
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,280
You are so loyal to the left and the right.

203
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
You killed so many people.

204
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
It turns out that you are a bastard.

205
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Uncle.

206
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
You are a good friend.

207
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
You are a good friend.

208
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
You should have been taken care of by Zhao Yu.

209
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Today,

210
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
I will send you a pain.

211
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Take care of yourself.

212
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
I hate you.

213
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Although I just understand,

214
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,280
it is not easy to give the feeling of giving it to someone.

215
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
At this moment,

216
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,280
although I am returning to the capital,

217
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I am still worried about him.

218
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Is there really a place where I can have my own will?

219
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Aunt, why are you so anxious?

220
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
What do you know?

221
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Miss San is the only enemy of the Zhang family.

222
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
How dare you be so slow?

223
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,280
But Master Yuchi is your own son.

224
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
The wolf is going to get married.

225
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
The old man is free.

226
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
He is holding me and a woman in the back house.

227
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Why are you so slow today?

228
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Follow him.

229
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Aunt, the ground is slippery.

230
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Be careful.

231
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Aunt.

232
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Aunt.

233
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
How can I take care of this person?

234
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
The ground is slippery.

235
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Aunt.

236
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Madam.

237
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Be careful.

238
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Aunt.

239
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Look.

240
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
My stupid appearance.

241
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
I just saw Miss San.

242
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I just want you to laugh.

243
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
I am not a madam.

244
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
I am Zhou Ruyan.

245
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
I am the wife of the old man.

246
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Miss San,

247
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
just call me Zhou Yiniang in the future.

248
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
I heard that you are cold.

249
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
You can't catch a cold.

250
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Come on.

251
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Put this on your skin.

252
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
You can't be cold anymore.

253
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
It's warmer.

254
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Let's go inside.

255
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Aunt.

256
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I was thinking that

257
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Han Yan went out to the house.

258
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I should go to greet the elders in the house.

259
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
I don't know if you can take me with you.

260
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Of course.

261
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Miss San is kind.

262
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Let's go.

263
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Come on.

264
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Today,

265
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
it's not a meaningful day for Miss San.

266
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
The past days

267
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
have been a mess.

268
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
You and your brother

269
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
and the money of the Han family

270
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
will be paid in person.

271
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
This is a serious matter.

272
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
It's harder to deal with

273
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
the marriage that is high-ranking.

274
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Just now,

275
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
the whole family was in a hurry.

276
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Your father is

277
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
working hard

278
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
to make a deal.

279
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Is it because of me?

280
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Who is the scoundrel?

281
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I know.

282
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
In the capital, it's said that I'm a deviant.

283
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I was a monk around me.

284
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Now, I'm in a bad mood.

285
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Of course.

286
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Don't say that.

287
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
The thing about the porridge

288
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
is that the Dali Temple

289
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
has been passed down.

290
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I thought

291
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
you were also taken by the thief.

292
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I didn't expect that you were so generous.

293
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
You escaped a lot.

294
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
It's a problem for the family.

295
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Don't say that.

296
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Let's go to the old lady's

297
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Yongshu Hall first.

298
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Let's go.

299
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Let's go to the worst hospital.

300
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
This one is almost red.

301
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
They are all Original Red Flower gold.

302
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
ano

303
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,380
This is a food soup that was opened by a уперт

304
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,500
by the yin doctor.

305
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
..

306
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,280
What is this?

307
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,680
..

308
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,780
What are you missing in the soup?

309
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Half Demon.

310
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,440
Probably H松's blood.

311
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,780
Ah, come!

312
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,720
Bring my herbal medicine besides H allowance.

313
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,520
Madam, you can't make it up again.

314
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,760
What do you know?

315
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,160
I've written down the old bones.

316
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,520
That's a life.

317
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,320
Hurry up.

318
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,320
Madam,

319
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,720
Mrs. Zhou and Mrs. Pei Dong

320
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,120
are here to greet you.

321
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,400
They're here.

322
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,040
They're not here.

323
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,000
Hurry up and kick them out.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,080
Don't take my life.

325
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,680
Tell them I'm sick.

326
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,720
No need.

327
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,720
Let them know when they hear it.

328
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,160
The water is stopped. Take it.

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,520
Here.

330
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,920
Why does it smell like a bone in the yard?

331
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,400
Is your mother not well?

332
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,520
Don't worry, Miss.

333
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,320
I like to take care of my health.

334
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,720
I have to use dozens of herbs and herbs to heal my body every day.

335
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,160
My body is hard.

336
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,640
That's good.

337
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,280
Madam,

338
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
I'm here to greet you.

339
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,040
What a coincidence.

340
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,280
Madam, you've been in a hurry today.

341
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,880
You're not feeling well.

342
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,840
You just fell asleep.

343
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,440
Why don't you come again next time?

344
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,240
Miss.

345
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,040
Please take care of your mother.

346
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,640
Han Yan will come again.

347
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Yes.

348
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,800
Within the house is advantageous space where you can receive vitality.

349
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:39,840
Search the storage

350
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,560
This is where she lives.

351
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,360
Yes, this is the yard of the master.

352
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Miss Jilan,

353
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Third Miss is here to greet the master.

354
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Aunt Chen,

355
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,960
is anyone here?

356
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Third Miss is back from Danzhou,

357
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
she is here to greet the master.

358
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
The house is so dirty.

359
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,560
Why is the house still locked?

360
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,560
The house is clean.

361
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,160
I love to be disturbed by others.

362
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,560
Third Miss, don't blame me.

363
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,560
Aunt Chen, Third Miss is here.

364
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,560
Aunt Chen,

365
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,560
it's been years since I last visited you.

366
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
I haven't been able to serve you.

367
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
I came to your house today

368
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,560
to greet you.

369
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,560
Please come in.

370
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,560
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,560
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,560
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Please be at ease.

375
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Aunt Chen, you're resting.

376
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,160
You're not seeing the guest today.

377
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,160
Take Second Miss back.

378
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,760
Aunt Chen,

379
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
come and save me.

380
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,360
Aunt Chen.

381
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,160
Let me go.

382
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,160
You're still in the house.

383
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,960
Aunt Chen.

384
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,560
Go back.

385
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,360
Don't do this.

386
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
Take good care of A'Cong.

387
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,760
Don't let the servants take her.

388
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,960
Aunt Chen,

389
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
the house is really messy today.

390
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Aunt Chen is tired

391
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,960
from coming here.

392
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,160
The teacher in the yard just now...

393
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,760
It's you, Second Sister Yushan.

394
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,760
She raised a horse in the house

395
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
and disturbed the master.

396
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,160
The master

397
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,160
locked her in

398
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
and locked her in the next door.

399
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Don't listen to her nonsense.

400
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,360
The master did this for her own good.

401
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,760
You're not living in that warm house.

402
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,760
It's not a long-term plan.

403
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,760
Why don't you move to my shared house?

404
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Do you think it's good?

405
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,960
I'm afraid I'll disturb you.

406
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,160
What are you talking about?

407
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Third Miss.

408
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,560
Please.

409
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,160
Miss.

410
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,960
Use some snacks first.

411
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,960
I heard that you often make green bean cake in the house.

412
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,760
Green bean cake is our next-class snack.

413
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Miss, you often use the bamboo shoots

414
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,160
to make it with the fresh bamboo shoots and noodles.

415
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
It's so refreshing.

416
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,960
But it doesn't suit your taste.

417
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,960
Your name is Shu Hong.

418
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,960
Yes.

419
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,360
I'm from the front yard.

420
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
The master heard that you're back

421
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
and asked me to come to visit you.

422
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,960
Although Third Miss is a little bit mature,

423
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,960
she's the only daughter of the Zhuang family.

424
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,160
From now on,

425
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,760
no matter what happens,

426
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
she'll be the only daughter of the Zhuang family.

427
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,560
No matter what happens,

428
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,360
you have to keep the best.

429
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,160
You can't have any loss or cold eyes.

430
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,160
But our shared house

431
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,360
doesn't have many similarities.

432
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Before your birthday,

433
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,560
you'll be released.

434
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,760
Please understand.

435
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,360
Aunt.

436
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,760
I don't care about the family.

437
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,760
Why do you bother us?

438
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,760
Lang, you're so annoying.

439
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Did I say something wrong?

440
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,760
Aunt, look at her.

441
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,160
She's so soft-hearted.

442
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
She can't be soft-hearted.

443
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Okay.

444
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
We're the master and servant,

445
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
but we're women.

446
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,960
We're not easy to live in the house.

447
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,560
We can't make each other difficult.

448
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Lang, you're so shy.

449
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,560
Don't talk nonsense.

450
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,560
Do you remember?

451
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,960
Yes.

452
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,160
Aunt, it's bad.

453
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
The front yard is messed up.

454
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
What's wrong?

455
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,760
The Han family is messed up.

456
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,160
The young master had some wine.

457
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,560
He scolded me for two days.

458
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,360
I'm so angry.

459
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,360
The master is going to go to the Han family to apologize.

460
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
What a small family.

461
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,960
Go and have a look.

462
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,960
I heard

463
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,560
what happened to the front yard.

464
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
Miss Tuo San's clothes.

465
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,960
We're in the mansion.

466
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
It's so annoying.

467
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
It's a big trouble for you.

468
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,760
It's so annoying.

469
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,160
You're the master and we're the servant.

470
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,160
How can we call each other sister?

471
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Besides,

472
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,960
this is not a meeting place.

473
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,760
If the speech is out...

474
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,560
Shu Hong,

475
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,160
how can I admit

476
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
the rules of the mansion?

477
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Miss Tuo San,

478
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I should be the one to say it.

479
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,760
What?

480
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,560
You want to hit me?

481
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,560
Xiao Ning.

482
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,560
Xiao Ning.

483
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,560
Young Master.

484
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,560
Aunt went out to look for you.

485
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,560
This is Miss Tuo San.

486
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,560
You're the one who ate the bones?

487
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,960
I...

488
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,760
Young Master.

489
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Miss Tuo San is a noble person.

490
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Now he's in the Dama Palace.

491
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,960
Your room is the widest.

492
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,160
It's already given to Miss Tuo San.

493
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,360
Get out of here!

494
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,960
You ruined my good deed.

495
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
You ruined my house.

496
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,560
You want me to take revenge on him?

497
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Who allowed you to do that?

498
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
You're the only daughter of the Zhuang family.

499
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm still the only son of my father.

500
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Get out of the Zhuang family!

501
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,960
Listen to me.

502
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,960
Half of the capital is in the palace.

503
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,560
They say the Zhuang family is a deviant.

504
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
They're all dead.

505
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,960
They're going to interrogate the house and escape from the capital.

506
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,960
Don't say that you're a wolf.

507
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
Look at this.

508
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
You're a little timid.

509
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,960
You don't dare to go in.

510
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,360
You're the third son of your father.

511
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,760
You're the fourth son of the family.

512
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,560
You're the one who can't be quiet.

513
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
Tell me.

514
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,560
Who can make this family forgive you?

515
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Speak!

516
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I was wrong.

517
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,560
I ruined your family's marriage.

518
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,160
My lady!

519
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
You're a beggar.

520
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
You're going to ruin my future.

521
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,560
How dare you bully me?

522
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,560
Do you think I dare not hit you?

523
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,760
How can I be angry?

524
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,760
Do you think I dare not?

525
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,360
Even if I die tonight,

526
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,960
will he still promise me

527
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,760
that he'll let you be a top-class man

528
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
and make you a top-class man?

529
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,760
You're so beautiful.

530
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,360
How dare you say that?

531
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,160
I'll kill you, you bastard!

532
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,960
My lady!

533
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Let me go!

534
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,560
Get out of here!

535
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,160
My lady!

536
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,560
Let me go!

537
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,360
Let him go!

538
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
I won't let you go!

539
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,960
My lady!

540
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,760
Let me go!

541
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Stop him from dying!

542
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,160
What are you doing?

543
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,160
My lady.

544
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
It's all my fault

545
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
to be called the crown prince.

546
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
When you come back from the Han family,

547
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,160
I'll report it to you in detail.

548
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,160
I'll let you

549
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,760
be a good man.

550
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,560
How long have you been in the Zhuang family?

551
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,560
It's not too long.

552
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,360
My lord

553
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
took my room first.

554
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,160
Then he married the mother and the son.

555
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,960
Then I should take the family's character

556
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
and let it all out.

557
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
You are...

558
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,760
My lady, you're so calm today.

559
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,560
You seem to be

560
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,560
a person who came from the Zhuang family.

561
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,360
I didn't take good care of you.

562
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,360
I'm sorry to make you suffer.

563
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,960
I heard from the family that

564
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
the husband and the aunt

565
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,560
married our eldest sister.

566
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,760
Yes.

567
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,760
She's a good woman.

568
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,560
She's my own flesh and blood.

569
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,960
It's been years since I passed away.

570
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,960
How did you pass away?

571
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,760
It's all gone.

572
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
It's not a big deal.

573
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
My lord doesn't allow it.

574
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,360
My lady, you should rest.

575
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
If you need anything,

576
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,360
let's talk slowly.

577
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
I won't disturb you.

578
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,360
Take care, aunt.

579
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
My lady, the fan is about to be heated.

580
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Drink it up.

581
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,560
Don't get cold.

582
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,760
Go get a stone and a river.

583
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
Put the medicine on.

584
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,960
Yes.

585
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,960
My lady.

586
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
My lady.

587
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,560
Why are you here again?

588
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,960
I heard from the family that the aunt had a cold.

589
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
So I made some soup.

590
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
I thought of sending it to you.

591
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,560
My lady has fallen asleep.

592
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,960
Give me the soup.

593
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,560
Please don't worry.

594
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,560
I saw the fire in the hall.

595
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,160
I thought the aunt was still asleep.

596
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,360
Who's that?

597
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Someone's coming.

598
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,560
There's a assassin.

599
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,760
Don't kill him.

600
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,360
Someone's coming.

601
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,560
Aunt, help me.

602
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,960
What's going on?

603
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,160
Let's go.

604
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
The assassin.

605
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,360
Someone's coming.

606
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,160
My lady.

607
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
The assassin is coming.

608
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,360
My lady.

609
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,160
Over there.

610
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
Someone's coming.

611
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
The doctor is coming.

612
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,360
The old man is fainted.

613
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,760
The old man is here.

614
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
The old man is here.

615
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
The old man is here.

616
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
The old man is here.

617
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
The old man is here.

618
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
The old man is here.

619
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
The old man is here.

620
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
The old man is here.

621
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
The old man is here.

622
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
The old man is here.

623
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
The old man is here.

624
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
The old man is here.

625
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
The old man is here.

626
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
The old man is here.

627
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
The old man is here.

628
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
The old man is here.

629
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
The old man is here.

630
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
The old man is here.

631
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
The old man is here.

632
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
The old man is here.

633
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
The old man is here.

634
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
The old man is here.

635
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
The old man is here.

636
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
The old man is here.

637
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
The old man is here.

638
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
The old man is here.

639
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
The old man is here.

640
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
The old man is here.

641
00:30:48,360 --> 00:31:17,560
A hip多少 desired,

642
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,440
Although I'm jealous of his marriage,

643
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,760
we're blood relatives after all.

644
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,880
He won't be so vicious.

645
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,240
You're in the Manor.

646
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,440
How can you say

647
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,360
he won't be so vicious?

648
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
I just guessed it wrong.

649
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,440
Let go of me.

650
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,760
I said let go of me.

651
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,720
Xu Er.

652
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,560
This is a criminal who is a criminal.

653
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,120
What's the point of me?

654
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,000
Xu Er.

655
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Why are you looking for me?

656
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
What crime did I commit?

657
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:55,560
At the Marquis' mother's mand doubles

658
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,400
and has no one to take care of him.

659
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,060
You're in charge now.

660
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,060
They blame you for being a criminal.

661
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,940
I'm just saying.

662
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,100
You yourself should complete and be okay with it.

663
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,600
The marriage should not be settled.

664
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,800
Okay.

665
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I said no obligation.

666
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,600
You can say it in detail.

667
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,480
Master,

668
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,160
how can the kids' plan be true?

669
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,080
Xiao Ning.

670
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,160
Stop it.

671
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,560
The four sisters are fighting.

672
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,640
How could they make a scene

673
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,160
of the beating and shouting?

674
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,960
Please repeat it again.

675
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,840
How did they fight?

676
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,760
It was Young Master who scolded Third Young Mistress

677
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,400
and pushed her into the ice pond.

678
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,960
He also said he wanted to beat her.

679
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,880
Third Young Mistress said

680
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,680
how could he be angry when he beat her?

681
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,680
Young Master used the beating and shouting

682
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,880
and said he wanted to beat Third Young Mistress.

683
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,720
I understand.

684
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,200
Yes.

685
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm also wrong.

686
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,680
I shouldn't have made a scene.

687
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,080
Did the thief break into the house

688
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,000
and beat Third Young Mistress?

689
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,480
It's true.

690
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,080
Madam Zhou,

691
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,760
this is a strange thing.

692
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,680
But Yuchi is suspicious.

693
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,440
I'm afraid I'll take her back to the Dali Temple

694
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
and get into trouble.

695
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,720
Gu Yunxi,

696
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
why did you arrest me?

697
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,880
Master. Master.

698
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,000
Please wait and see.

699
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,120
You know.

700
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,800
Out of all the things in the world,

701
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,040
I sent someone to beg you.

702
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,220
If you come back,

703
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,320
please deal with it.

704
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,920
Okay.

705
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,680
Who should tell the so-called Sire of the WUhouses?

706
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,660
Lord Zhuangkhan endures on face for blame in the cookest tomorrow.

707
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,080
They'reudeful little fellow.

708
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,280
Throw away the Coll istiyorum e phow.

709
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,000
You knew it.

710
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,360
==

711
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
==

712
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,180
I never thought

713
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,580
that this would be my first time meeting you.

714
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,080
I never thought

715
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,220
that she would play charges loved by me

716
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,060
and protect me.

717
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,800
Shan'er...

718
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
I don't know what kind of family I'm in.

719
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Even if I die,

720
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,400
I'll let you die to understand.

721
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,400
Miss San,

722
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,560
no matter what happens in our family,

723
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,280
no matter if it's black or white,

724
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,760
the master and mother will be punished.

725
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,320
How can you rule the government and the four regions?

726
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,360
The elders in the family are all ignorant.

727
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,160
If you can't understand,

728
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,040
no one will be the master for you.

729
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,400
Or are you afraid that in the capital,

730
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,600
no one will laugh at our family?

731
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,000
Mother, tomorrow,

732
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,440
I have no idea.

733
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:38,100
The兩個

734
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,040
have nothing to do.

735
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,820
We have a family of two.

736
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Mother!

737
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
Wait!

738
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,820
Wait! Don't fight!

739
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Wait! Don't fight!

740
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Mistress, San Si!

741
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,820
Miss San has been suffering for days and has been released from the family.

742
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
She is sick and has been ill.

743
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,820
She can't stand this punishment.

744
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,820
What's wrong?

745
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,820
You two look like some mother and daughter.

746
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,820
I don't dare to do this.

747
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,820
Miss San is the biological daughter of Mistress.

748
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Even if she is wrong,

749
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,820
she will be punished when she is better.

750
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,820
Mistress, do you know where you are wrong?

751
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Mistress.

752
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,820
Mistress, I don't dare to do this.

753
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,820
You are the best.

754
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,820
I know what's wrong.

755
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,820
I am punished.

756
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,820
I am wrong.

757
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
I am wrong.

758
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,820
I am wrong.

759
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,820
I am wrong.

760
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,820
I am wrong.

761
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,820
Don't fight, Miss San!

762
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,820
Miss San!

763
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,820
Don't fight.

764
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,820
You can't think in the House of the Dragon.

765
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,820
Why did you come out?

766
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Mistress, I made a mistake.

767
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,820
How could you be so cruel to her?

768
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,820
Stop it. Go back.

769
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,820
I won't go back.

770
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,820
You locked me up for so long.

771
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
But you still let me go.

772
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,820
You just want to see us as a mother and daughter.

773
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,820
You want to throw away the Weifeng Sect?

774
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,820
Who are you?

775
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,820
The one who raised you

776
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,820
and sold you out

777
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
is a man.

778
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
You are still a man.

779
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,820
You are acting like a man.

780
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Miss San.

781
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,820
You deserve it.

782
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,820
Who told you to stop?

783
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,820
Why is this?

784
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,820
What's wrong?

785
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,820
Why did you do the housework?

786
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
I did it.

787
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
I did it.

788
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,820
I beat my mother and Xiao Ni up.

789
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
Look.

790
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,820
She hit my mother's face.

791
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,820
Why did you invite me here?

792
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,820
I can't control it.

793
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
Mistress.

794
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,820
I beat her up

795
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,820
because I was so angry with her.

796
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,820
I will take care of the housework.

797
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,820
I am in charge of the housework.

798
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,820
What do you mean?

799
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Nothing.

800
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,820
You are a bit too much.

801
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,820
Don't be so selfish.

802
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
Mistress.

803
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
Mistress.

804
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
It's okay.

805
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,820
I was frightened just now.

806
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
I was a bit confused.

807
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,820
Let's go back and rest.

808
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,820
Mistress.

809
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,820
Go.

810
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,820
Go.

811
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,820
Maybe the old woman is back.

812
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
No.

813
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,820
It's all because of you.

814
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,820
It's all because of you.

815
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820
You are a coward.

816
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
You want to mess with the family.

817
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Why do you come back?

818
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
Yushan.

819
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Are you crazy?

820
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
What nonsense are you talking about?

821
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Zhou Ruying.

822
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,820
You are a good girl.

823
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,820
I am not dead yet.

824
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,820
I am here to take care of the housework.

825
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,820
The housework is all my fault.

826
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Miss.

827
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,820
If you want to explore the rich and expensive of the capital,

828
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,820
you should take a good look at it.

829
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,820
The life in the housework is so long.

830
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,820
Han Yuan is not a coward to explore the rich and expensive of the capital.

831
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
Zhao Yushan is a coward.

832
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,820
But he didn't say anything wrong.

833
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,820
You shouldn't have come back.

834
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Mother.

835
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
Chen Mengmeng.

836
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,820
There is no daughter like her in the Zhuang family.

837
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,820
She is a big man.

838
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,820
She is a big man.

839
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
She is a big man.

840
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
She is a big man.

841
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,820
She is a big man.

842
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,820
She is a big man.

843
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
She is a big man.

844
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
She is a big man.

845
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,820
What are you waiting for?

846
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,820
Take her out.

847
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,820
Mother.

848
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Mother.

849
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
Mother.

850
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Mother.

851
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
Mother.

852
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
Mother.

853
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,820
Mother.

854
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Mother.

855
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,820
Mother.

856
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,820
Mother.

857
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,820
The flower is still deep.

858
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,820
The flowers are still deep.

859
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,820
The moon is still bright.

860
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,820
The heart is still deep.

861
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,820
The sky is still clear.

862
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,820
The earth is still deep.

863
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
The sky is still clear.

864
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,820
The earth is still clear.

865
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,820
The sky is still clear.

866
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,820
