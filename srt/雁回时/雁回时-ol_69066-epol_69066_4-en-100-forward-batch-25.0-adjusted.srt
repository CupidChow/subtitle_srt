00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,180
=Episode 4=

3
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

4
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,510
I've never seen this hairpin before.

5
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Is that so?

6
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,760
This hairpin is simple and elegant.

7
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,950
It resembles a swan goose.

8
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,240
But it matches

9
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,870
your innocent face

10
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,750
perfectly.

11
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,840
Or perhaps

12
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,800
a noble lady of the Capital

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
no longer fancy

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,470
such simple things?

15
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,960
Since it's lost by someone else,

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
I dare not claim it.

17
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm afraid

18
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,680
it might cause trouble

19
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,590
and make me falsely accused.

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Please go easy on me.

21
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,520
What if

22
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,870
I won't?

23
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,870
I don't think I've offended you.

24
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,740
As the Vice Minister of the Judicial Review,

25
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,590
it is my duty to root out evil

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,750
and uphold justice.

27
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,680
I work according to the law,

28
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
but have offended

29
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,350
all the powerful figures in the city.

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,200
Miss Hanyan,

31
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,280
are you here at Qiumei Garden

32
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,150
in search of a suitor?

33
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,310
I am here by my parents' command.

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,960
When it comes to marriage,

35
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,000
I shall abide by the wishes of my elders.

36
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Then I'll leave you be.

37
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,400
As for this hairpin,

38
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,430
if you insist on not accepting it,

39
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,200
I'll have to take it back

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,630
and submit it to the authorities.

41
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
Wait.

42
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,630
Have you changed your mind?

43
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,120
Given your kind gesture,

44
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,190
it would be impolite of me to refuse.

45
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,630
What if I decide not to give it away?

46
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,190
Wish you find a good match soon.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I'll take my leave.

48
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,780
(Qiumei Garden)

49
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,920
Hanyan,

50
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,830
truly brave, aren't you?

51
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,160
You dare to provoke Fu Yunxi?

52
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,540
Indeed.

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,480
I'll return home to inform Father.

54
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,120
Let's see how he reprimands you.

55
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,000
What do you want to report, Yuchi?

56
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,390
Fu Yunxi

57
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,270
is now at the center of the storm.

58
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,270
The Zuohang Gang case

59
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
claimed the lives of numerous officials,

60
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,360
and no one dares go near him.

61
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,250
How dare you get involved with him?

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,830
Don't say I didn't warn you.

63
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,750
Now, officials, merchants,

64
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,640
and outlaws in the Capital all want him dead.

65
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,750
He's survived many assassination attempts.

66
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,310
If it weren't for his skills,

67
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,360
he would've met his demise long ago.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
If you don't want to be a widow,

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,190
you'd better stop thinking about him.

70
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,070
Assassination?

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,040
Figure it out yourself.

72
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,350
Let's go.

73
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,040
Think it through carefully.

74
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,870
(Fu Yunxi has been missing for days.)

75
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,680
(He unexpectedly went to Danzhou.)

76
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,120
(I don't know how he found this hairpin.)

77
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,600
(Nor do I understand)

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,430
(why he's so invested in this case,)

79
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,160
(traveling miles to check it out.)

80
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
(He never mentioned the case,)

81
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
(but his gaze is as sharp as a blade.)

82
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
(Not sure what he's plotting.)

83
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,300
(Masterful and Confident)

84
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,430
(After returning,)

85
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,630
(I waited for a long time.)

86
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,000
(But he never responded again.)

87
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,270
(Also because of this,)

88
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,920
(I felt even more uneasy.)

89
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,110
How's it going?

90
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,750
He has held office for years.

91
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,830
Before the Zuohang Gang case,

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,480
he was already notorious.

93
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,100
He navigates the light and the dark,

94
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,240
wielding the hidden scandals

95
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,070
of aristocrats and officials.

96
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
He used these hidden secrets

97
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,480
to bind and balance others

98
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,950
and to protect himself.

99
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,190
Has he faced assassination attempts?

100
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,470
Six times.

101
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,310
Kill him.

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,190
Don't act rashly.

103
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,790
I know what to do.

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Wait.

105
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,320
Don't hesitate.

106
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,100
(Judicial Review)

107
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,760
- Go.
- Go.

108
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,510
- While he's alive,
- I'm innocent.

109
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,800
finalize his confession,

110
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,950
- get his fingerprint and submit it.
- Sir.

111
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,790
Yes, sir.

112
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,700
- Send the case file
- Sir, I'm innocent.

113
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,360
of the Danzhou bandit case to my office.

114
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,470
My Lord.

115
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Why are you so concerned

116
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,560
about the Danzhou bandit case?

117
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,950
Just took a casual look.

118
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,950
In the Zuohang Gang case,

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,990
though we already know

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,430
Pei Dafu has an adopted son

121
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,310
who hid a large sum in the Capital.

122
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,720
We have no leads or clues to trace it.

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,000
If you have time,

124
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,800
why don't you think more about this?

125
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,230
Fine.

126
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
It's getting late.

127
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,480
Let's rest for today

128
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
and discuss it tomorrow.

129
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,790
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Please wait.

131
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,600
Sir, would you like some candied hawthorns?

132
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,920
I'll take two, please.

133
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,790
Alright.

134
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,350
Sorry.

135
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,360
Thank you, sir.

136
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,550
Who is there?

137
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,750
Why are you hiding?

138
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,300
(Fu Residence)

139
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,270
Hanyan, are you awake?

140
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,550
Father.

141
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,870
It's cold outside. Please come in.

142
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,750
Don't bother.

143
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,510
Hanyan,

144
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,320
I just came to ask

145
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,080
how was your visit to Qiumei Garden?

146
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,120
Did Yushan and Yuchi tell you anything?

147
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,510
They are just in fear

148
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,550
that you may have been mistreated.

149
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
Father, rest assured.

150
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,080
Mr. Fu was out on official business,

151
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,320
passing through Qiumei Garden

152
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,200
when he happened to find my hairpin.

153
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,510
That was the only reason we spoke.

154
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,550
You understand proper etiquette.

155
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,630
I'm reassured.

156
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,120
But…

157
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,750
Please tell me what's on your mind.

158
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,910
I'm listening, Father.

159
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,320
You are my unmarried, legitimate daughter.

160
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,750
I won't have your reputation ruined

161
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,790
by rumors.

162
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,440
What rumors?

163
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,270
Some gossipers say

164
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,390
Miss Hanyan of the Zhuang family

165
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,750
wants to help her sister

166
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,030
to be Fu's successor wife.

167
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,870
Bunch of nonsense.

168
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,480
Don't take it to heart.

169
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
Successor wife?

170
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
You have a child betrothal
with the Fu Family.

171
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,670
Are you aware of this?

172
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,030
I've heard a little.

173
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
Fu Pingsheng, Fu Yunxi's father,

174
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
worked at the Ministry of Personnel.

175
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,000
We are somewhat of fellow townsmen

176
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,670
and have been close for long.

177
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,070
So, we arranged a child betrothal.

178
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,390
But,

179
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,840
Pingsheng died young from illness.

180
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,670
He has already passed away?

181
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,320
It was last year.

182
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
I went to Danzhou.

183
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,390
So my sister married Fu instead.

184
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,320
In the second year after marrying,

185
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,550
your sister

186
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
passed away in the Fu Family.

187
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,270
This is a sorrow for both our families.

188
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,910
I ordered it never to be mentioned again.

189
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,270
However,

190
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,910
I should've told you earlier.

191
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,360
I know about this.

192
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,790
Why did Yuqin pass away?

193
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,790
Poisoned.

194
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,480
Still an unsolved case.

195
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,510
It's just pitiful for Lingzhi.

196
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,630
Who is Lingzhi?

197
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,550
Yuqin and Yunxi have a daughter.

198
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
Her name is Fu Lingzhi.

199
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,200
She is already five this year.

200
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,360
When you returned from Danzhou and fainted,

201
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,000
the first to find you was Lingzhi.

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,080
Ma'am, are you cold?

203
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,200
That was her?

204
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,320
She is Fu Yunxi's daughter?

205
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,270
Lingzhi lost her mother when young,

206
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,790
and Fu Yunxi never remarried.

207
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,270
Now, the entire Fu Family

208
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,600
relies solely on Yunxi.

209
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,080
Hanyan, what's wrong?

210
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,320
I may have caught a chill

211
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,670
while out today.

212
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,670
You should get some rest.

213
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,120
I'll ask Shuhong
to prepare some herbal medicine.

214
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,960
Father, I appreciate it.

215
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,810
It's quite alright.

216
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,720
I just came

217
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,080
to remind you of a few things.

218
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,670
I'm glad you understand.

219
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,030
It's snowing outside. Don't catch a chill.

220
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,550
Get some rest.

221
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,680
Yes.

222
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,280
You…

223
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,440
You didn't succeed, did you?

224
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,510
His arm is injured.

225
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,000
He hid in his family residence.

226
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,790
So,

227
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
I secretly entered his mansion,

228
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,390
locked his room door,

229
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,440
and set a fire.

230
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,390
What?

231
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,360
You don't need to worry.

232
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,510
Tonight, the Fu family will burn.

233
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,790
Tomorrow, the authorities
will see it as an accident.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Where are you going?

235
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,580
(Fu Residence)
Hurry up!

236
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,440
Keep up.

237
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,040
Quick.

238
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,390
Move aside.

239
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,150
- Fetch more water.
- Hurry!

240
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,110
Take this.

241
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,380
(Xu's Stir-Fried Liver)

242
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,870
Hurry!

243
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,470
Place it here.

244
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,110
Come inside.

245
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,180
(Fu Residence)

246
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
Hurry.

247
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,770
This way. There's more inside.

248
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,830
Quickly. Move this.

249
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,670
Faster.

250
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,250
Madam, please be careful.

251
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,830
- Madam.
- Be careful.

252
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,830
- Madam.
- Sister.

253
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,130
(Lady Qiu, the head of the Fu Household)
My painting

254
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,200
is still inside.

255
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,920
We almost got killed.
Forget the painting.

256
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,670
- Madam, hear me out.
- I have to go get it.

257
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,060
(Aunt Kou, Yunxi's aunt)
My ledger!

258
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,480
I forgot my ledger.

259
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,590
Hurry! Put it out! Quick!

260
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,740
(Fu Residence)

261
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,590
More water.

262
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,830
Father,

263
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,680
- my wooden horse is gone.
- More water.

264
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,350
- I'll make you a new one.
- Hurry up.

265
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,190
Is that okay?

266
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,750
A deal's a deal.

267
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,960
And my candied hawthorns, too.

268
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,280
I promise.

269
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,350
Water!

270
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,080
Coming.

271
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,010
I need water here.

272
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,870
- Quick!
- This way.

273
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,760
More.

274
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,550
Fu Yunxi's wife passed away,

275
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,270
leaving a daughter behind.

276
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,550
You didn't find this?

277
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,720
I did.

278
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,920
Why didn't you tell me?

279
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,070
It's a family matter.

280
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,020
What does it have to do with killing him?

281
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,480
Of course, it does.

282
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,440
Did I do something wrong?

283
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,880
You did nothing wrong.

284
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,640
It's my fault.

285
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,280
Why?

286
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,960
Sister, light some fireworks.

287
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,790
- So beautiful.
- Sister.

288
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,200
Save this for Mother later.

289
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,640
Sister, wait for me.

290
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,760
Chai Jing,

291
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,750
you are an orphan.

292
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,640
Although I have both parents,

293
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,960
I consider myself half an orphan.

294
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,030
The child is innocent.

295
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,590
No matter what,

296
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,350
we must not let the world

297
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,640
have one more unfortunate girl.

298
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,920
However,

299
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
we have angered him,

300
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,590
I'm afraid
you cannot stay in the Capital long.

301
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,960
At dawn, once the gates open,

302
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,400
leave the capital and hide.

303
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,100
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

304
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,920
These are all of my possessions.

305
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,070
Keep them safe.

306
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,950
What about you?

307
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,200
You leave the city to stay low.

308
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,040
Don't worry about me.

309
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,830
Zhuang Hanyan.

310
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,800
Father wants you to go have breakfast.

311
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
Let's go.

312
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,550
I caught a cold yesterday.

313
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,160
I'll pass,

314
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,440
so I won't spread it to others.

315
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,880
You're always floppy.

316
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,920
Mr. Fu is here

317
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,440
and he wants to see you.

318
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,550
He said, "Why isn't Miss Hanyan here?"

319
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,400
If you don't go,

320
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,200
he'd assume we're mistreating you

321
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,070
and making you starve.

322
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,200
Why did he come?

323
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,150
No idea.

324
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,400
Come on.

325
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,440
Stop dawdling. Hurry.

326
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,790
Wealth is not everything.

327
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,550
Safety is our greatest fortune.

328
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,590
You're right, Mr. Zhuang.

329
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,750
Father, she's here.

330
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Hanyan,

331
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,480
sit down.

332
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,000
Greetings, Father.

333
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,920
Greetings, Mr. Fu.

334
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,400
No need to be so formal.

335
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
You probably slept soundly last night

336
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,830
and haven't heard

337
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,400
my residence caught fire.

338
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,200
The whole place was burned down.

339
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,270
Are you alright?

340
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,160
Thankfully, everyone in the family is safe.

341
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,310
Only the houses were burned.

342
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,270
Repairs will take some time.

343
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,590
You are blessed.

344
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,160
Let's eat.

345
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,440
I came unannounced today

346
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,750
because I have a favor to ask,

347
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,510
Mr. Zhuang.

348
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,400
Certainly.

349
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,720
If there's anything you need,

350
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,160
we will do our utmost to help.

351
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,790
This morning,

352
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,790
my mother moved to my official residence.

353
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,070
But Lingzhi is still young,

354
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,920
and living outside would be inconvenient.

355
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,790
With no relatives in the Capital,

356
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,750
we hope to stay
at your side chamber briefly.

357
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,590
You don't have to agree

358
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,550
if it's inconvenient.

359
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,310
Not at all.

360
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,880
The year-end is approaching.

361
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,880
Wouldn't it be nice for our families

362
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,140
to celebrate New Year together?

363
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,720
What do you think?

364
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,680
That's right.

365
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,880
As a grandfather,

366
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,790
I often think about Lingzhi.

367
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,600
Even if you decide to stay permanently,

368
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,270
I would be more than delighted.

369
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,440
From today, I'll have to trouble you.

370
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,270
What are you talking about?

371
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,110
Make yourself at home.

372
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,640
I am busy with official duties,

373
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,160
and the Mu brothers

374
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,510
will come frequently.

375
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,160
Please understand, Mr. Zhuang.

376
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,590
Of course.

377
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,070
Make yourselves comfortable.

378
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,750
Our family has none of those formalities.

379
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,830
Yunxi,

380
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,510
I'll go tidy up Yuzhu Manor.

381
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,400
If you need something,

382
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,640
just let me know.

383
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,590
By the way,

384
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,640
where is Miss Hanyan staying now?

385
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,560
I…

386
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,350
I live at Ms. Zhou's Gongtong Chamber.

387
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,440
How far is it from Yuzhu Manor?

388
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,160
It's just across a wall.

389
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,160
That's good.

390
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,640
Mr. Fu, what are you…

391
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,830
The truth behind
the Danzhou case remains unclear.

392
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,310
Living closer to Miss Hanyan

393
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,590
makes it easier for me to inquire.

394
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,750
Thank you for your concern.

395
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,440
Youchang and his wife
have had a hard life.

396
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,750
And they were killed by the wicked.

397
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,960
I implore you to catch the real culprit.

398
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,820
Of course.

399
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,030
Once the culprit is caught,

400
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,880
we will sentence them to hanging.

401
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,310
I'll invite you all

402
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,270
to come and watch.

403
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm done. Enjoy.

404
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,590
Yushan.

405
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,440
Wait, Yushan.

406
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,830
Go check her out.

407
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,000
Master, no need to worry.

408
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,510
It seems that Mr. Fu

409
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,070
truly cares for his daughter,

410
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,030
which is why he's here for help.

411
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,880
Our son-in-law is no ordinary man.

412
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
He's now making his move.

413
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,550
He's thought through every step.

414
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,640
Known for his cunning.

415
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,110
Today,

416
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,720
he does seem a bit odd.

417
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,880
Yushan is not giving us peace.

418
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,550
Her marriage has been delayed for years.

419
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,920
She's determined to marry Yunxi

420
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
to be his successor wife.

421
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,200
Yunxi is her brother-in-law,

422
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,550
yet she has set her sights on him.

423
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,510
Look at her appearance today.

424
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,510
Arrogant, rude, and jealous.

425
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,750
How ridiculous.

426
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,310
You're right.

427
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,790
I will discipline Yushan.

428
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,340
But,

429
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,400
the way Mr. Fu looks at Hanyan

430
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
is indeed somewhat strange.

431
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,920
The Capital is filled
with tension these days.

432
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,310
Now, we have them living here.

433
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,090
I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse.

434
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,030
What have you done?

435
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,880
I asked you to add some charcoal.

436
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,580
Are you trying to burn down the house?

437
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,080
- I'm sorry.
- Get out!

438
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
Go out and find a cooler spot.

439
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
Kneel there.

440
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,850
I was too slow, only realizing

441
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,350
why Yushan opposed my every move

442
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,400
and even threatened me

443
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,880
to stay away from Mr. Fu.

444
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,110
Turns out she feared
I'd take away what she loves.

445
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,030
Miss Yushan has admired Mr. Fu
since childhood.

446
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,750
That year, Master decided

447
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,680
to marry Miss Yuqin to the Fu family.

448
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,070
She had not yet reached 15.

449
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,040
Yet she caused a great disturbance.

450
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,680
Then she should thank Father.

451
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,350
Or she'd die from poison

452
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,350
at the Fu's.

453
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,110
Miss, you know everything.

454
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,160
Father told me everything.

455
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,790
Yushan is determined to expel me.

456
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,510
Now it seems reasonable.

457
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,680
After all, this arranged marriage was mine.

458
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,680
Naturally, she can't tolerate me.

459
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,800
You can leave now.

460
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,160
I'll call you if needed.

461
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,910
Yes.

462
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,350
Should I still leave?

463
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,240
Though he threatened me a bit,

464
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,590
we didn't sever relations.

465
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,750
Now, I wonder

466
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,680
what he's after.

467
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,550
Now, it's within close reach.

468
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,920
I could go kill him again.

469
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,760
No.

470
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,160
He intentionally lives

471
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,960
in the side chamber nearby.

472
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,110
Perhaps it's to warn me.

473
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,790
If he dies mysteriously here,

474
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,440
it must involve me.

475
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,110
So, what's the next step?

476
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,880
Wait and see.

477
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,030
He will act again.

478
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,880
Miss Hanyan, Mr. Fu wants to see you.

479
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,030
Find yourself a safe place to stay

480
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,070
and wait for my word.

481
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,110
Got it.

482
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,980
(Awareness and Restraint)

483
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,670
What does he want me to do?

484
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,510
I have no idea.

485
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,310
I can go by myself.

486
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,910
Yes.

487
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,680
Little Horse, look.

488
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,310
Father, you're awesome.

489
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,110
You can build a new
wooden horse with one hand.

490
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,030
I have official duties today.

491
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,680
We can only finish after returning tonight.

492
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,680
Take your time.

493
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,400
Go to catch criminals first.

494
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,590
Good girl.

495
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,510
Lingzhi, look who's here.

496
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,880
Greetings, miss.

497
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,110
Are you here to play with me?

498
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,440
Of course.

499
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,550
Come and take a look.

500
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,070
Father made me a new wooden horse.

501
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,310
Isn't it beautiful?

502
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,910
It is.

503
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,880
But not as beautiful as Lingzhi.

504
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,110
She ate too much Laba Porridge
for lunch.

505
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
She can eat less in the evening.

506
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,830
I attend the Judicial Review daily for work.

507
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,550
I've no time for her.

508
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,720
From today, you will take care of Lingzhi.

509
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,240
Why?

510
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,920
Don't you want to play with me?

511
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,080
I do.

512
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,880
I like you a lot.

513
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,440
Then Lingzhi can be at ease.

514
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Lingzhi.

515
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,720
I have to go now.

516
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,790
Remember to listen to Aunt Hanyan.

517
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,350
I will come back tonight to get you.

518
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,240
I'll be good.

519
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,830
Goodbye, Father.

520
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,670
Go play now.

521
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,000
Little wooden horse.

522
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,590
Please take good care of her.

523
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,480
Otherwise, you know the consequences.

524
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,880
Why me?

525
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,400
You're gentle, virtuous, and obedient.

526
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,240
If not you, then who?

527
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,860
(Zhuang Residence)

528
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,550
Once the kite is ready,

529
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,880
let Father take us to fly kites together.

530
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Is that okay, sister?

531
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,480
Sure.

532
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,720
Lingzhi.

533
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,240
Actually, you should call me aunt.

534
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,640
But I have an aunt.

535
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,510
Her name is Aunt Yushan.

536
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,750
I'm Aunt Hanyan.

537
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,030
Aunt Hanyan?

538
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,160
So you're also my mother's sister.

539
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,240
Yes.

540
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,750
You're really smart.

541
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,590
Lingzhi,

542
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,160
why are you here?

543
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,030
Where's your father?

544
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,440
Aunt Yushan,

545
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,350
my father has gone to the Judicial Review.

546
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,840
Lingzhi,

547
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
would you like to go out and play with me?

548
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,270
I'll take you horse riding
and teach you archery

549
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,480
at the training ground.

550
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,330
No.

551
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,440
Father wants me with Sister Hanyan.

552
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
I can't just wander away.

553
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,150
Sister?

554
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,920
You're so cunning,

555
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,240
even trying to be a stepmother.

556
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,670
Yushan,

557
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,310
Lingzhi is still here.

558
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,030
Please watch your words.

559
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,270
You're the one scolding me?

560
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,480
Lingzhi, let's go.

561
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,030
Such an ugly kite.

562
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,110
Lingzhi, I'll buy you some candied hawthorns.

563
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,480
- Go.
- I don't want to.

564
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
Aunt Yushan, I don't want to.

565
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,800
Come on, let's go.

566
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,200
- Come with me.
- No.

567
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,400
Aunt Yushan, I don't want to.

568
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,270
Come with me.

569
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,120
Lingzhi.

570
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,510
What are you doing?

571
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,900
(Masterful and Confident)

572
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,000
Zhuang Hanyan,

573
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,070
you're even making a move now.

574
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,790
I'll go tell Father now.

575
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,510
Yushan, listen to me.

576
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,030
I've no intention of competing with you,

577
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,000
nor of raising his daughter.

578
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,070
I have no feelings for him whatsoever.

579
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,160
You don't need to make things hard for me.

580
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,390
I…

581
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,440
It has nothing to do with Yunxi.

582
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,190
We are both women.

583
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,840
No need to hide it like this.

584
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,550
What do I need to hide?

585
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,070
I simply can't stand you.

586
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Cuiyun,

587
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,840
open the window in Miss Hanyan's room.

588
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,190
I really want to see

589
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,150
if Lingzhi is attentive and considerate.

590
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,280
Yes.

591
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,880
I'll remove the charcoal, too.

592
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,400
Miss Hanyan.

593
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,840
Yushan,

594
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,550
Lingzhi was entrusted to me
by Fu Yunxi himself.

595
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,030
He asked me to protect her.

596
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,400
If you insist on this,

597
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,030
I won't tolerate your recklessness

598
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,320
like I did last time.

599
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,070
Think about it yourself.

600
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,030
If Lingzhi catches a cold,

601
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,400
will Fu Yunxi blame you?

602
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,480
Don't think a few words can frighten me.

603
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,400
Please try to understand.

604
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,280
I don't intend to cause trouble.

605
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,440
But today, I can't entrust Lingzhi to you.

606
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,760
Wait until Fu Yunxi returns,

607
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,280
feel free to come

608
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,480
and say you wish to take care of Lingzhi.

609
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,880
I'd actually appreciate the peace.

610
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,280
Is that acceptable?

611
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,710
Let go of her.

612
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
A bunch of losers.

613
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,360
Lingzhi, don't be sad.

614
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,280
We can make a more beautiful one.

615
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,400
Alright.

616
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,510
Adults are strange.

617
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,070
Good things, yet you destroy them.

618
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,800
What's that supposed to mean?

619
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,880
Aunt Yushan doesn't like this kite,

620
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,670
so she crushes it.

621
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,280
Father dislikes our house.

622
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,630
He wants to burn them all down.

623
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,550
Your house was burned by your father?

624
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,320
Not exactly.

625
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,070
Father said a candle fell.

626
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,670
That's how it started.

627
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,440
But when a room first caught fire,

628
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,630
Grandmother wanted
to call the Firefighting Team.

629
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,230
She said a few buckets of water
could extinguish it.

630
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,880
But Father stopped Grandmother.

631
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,510
Why is your father stopping her?

632
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,630
I have no idea about that.

633
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,110
I was half asleep.

634
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,800
I only heard my father say,

635
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,070
"Since it started burning,

636
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,280
might as well burn it down completely."

637
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,670
He even added more fuel.

638
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,150
Aunt Hanyan,

639
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,480
what's wrong with you?

640
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Aunt Hanyan?

641
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,010
Your father truly deserves his position

642
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,590
at such a young age.

643
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,230
Are you praising my father?

644
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm not just praising him.

645
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,670
I'm also admiring him.

646
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,980
(Judicial Review)

647
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,900
(Mu Yan, Reviewer, Judicial Review)

648
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,160
Sir.

649
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,060
(Study Room)

650
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,000
Why aren't you working?

651
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,400
What are you thinking about?

652
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,040
On our way back days ago,

653
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,630
we passed by Qiumei Garden.

654
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,030
When you saw Zhuang's carriage
at the entrance,

655
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,550
you rushed inside in a hurry

656
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,410
and wouldn't let us take a look.

657
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,530
Once the Zuohang Gang case is resolved,

658
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,510
I will find a good wife for you.

659
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,630
Really?

660
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
Where do you plan to find her?

661
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,360
Do you know what I like?

662
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,470
I don't.

663
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,920
I will find someone for you
based on my standards.

664
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,270
What are your standards, sir?

665
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,070
Diligent and frugal?

666
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,320
Virtuous and obedient?

667
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
Rather than being all that,

668
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,510
it's better

669
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,400
to be clear in grudges and bold in strategy.

670
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,960
Sir, have you... lost your mind?

671
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,510
The Capital

672
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,480
devours the good and the kind.

673
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,670
If you don't want to be treated as prey,

674
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,110
be the one in control.

675
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,150
A virtuous woman
knows how to manage.

676
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,470
But a strong woman
can safeguard the family.

677
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,230
So it is in choosing a wife,

678
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,000
and so it is for men

679
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,280
navigating the court.

680
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,030
It's getting late.

681
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,440
Go home and think about it.

682
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,000
He made a fair point.

683
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,000
It's clearly a twisted one.

684
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,400
Think for yourself.

685
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:17,150
How did his former wife meet her end?

686
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,840
You…

687
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,920
Where's Lingzhi?

688
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,280
I tucked her in.

689
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,800
Thank you for today.

690
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,510
I will trouble you again tomorrow.

691
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,200
Wait.

692
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,120
What?

693
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,920
Is there anything else to say?

694
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,190
Lingzhi's mother.

695
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,590
How did my eldest sister die?

696
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,720
Poisoned.

697
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,190
Who poisoned her?

698
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,760
I only know the poison was meant for me.

699
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,280
She was innocent and implicated.

700
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,280
By accident, she drank the poisoned wine.

701
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,150
Thus, she died unjustly at home.

702
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,630
Why do the Capital's people
all want to kill you?

703
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,160
Well,

704
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,360
Miss Hanyan,
you should know this very well.

705
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,230
Because I've uncovered

706
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,320
the secrets you dare not expose.

707
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,320
Yunxi.

708
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,090
Greetings, Miss Yushan.

709
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,480
Yunxi,

710
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,670
I watched Lingzhi grow up.

711
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,000
Why must you entrust her to Zhuang Hanyan?

712
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,280
Besides, she and Lingzhi have only met once.

713
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,230
You're a bit impatient.

714
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,230
- I…
– Miss Hanyan is more patient.

715
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,630
Are you interested in her?

716
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,230
It's getting late. I should return.

717
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,230
Miss Hanyan, thanks for today.

718
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,360
I'll bring Lingzhi over tomorrow.

719
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,550
Miss Hanyan, good night.

720
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,200
Yunxi.

721
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,860
(Masterful and Confident)

722
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,670
Zhuang Hanyan, what exactly do you want?

723
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,480
What do you mean?

724
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,230
Stop pretending.

725
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,480
Tell me honestly.

726
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,040
How did you worm your way into his head?

727
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,070
Your arranged marriage
has long been nullified.

728
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,760
Do you really want to marry him?

729
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,320
I don't understand what you're saying.

730
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,920
Don't think just because
you have a pretty face

731
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,760
and read a few books

732
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,480
in the countryside in Danzhou,

733
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,230
you can call the shots in the Capital.

734
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,280
I'm telling you, we're childhood sweethearts.

735
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,190
We grew up together.

736
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,280
You don't stand a chance.

737
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,000
Yushan, stop your nonsense.

738
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,920
Good night.

739
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,590
Wait. I'm not done yet.

740
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,630
Father.

741
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,480
Lingzhi is awake.

742
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,110
Why are you so happy?

743
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,630
What are you laughing about?

744
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,510
I found out

745
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
who burnt your wooden horse.

746
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,230
I got revenge for Lingzhi.

747
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,190
Who did it?

748
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,430
A secret.

749
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,230
(I can't figure it out)

750
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,880
(what Fu Yunxi's real motive is?)

751

(is utterly unbearable.)

(That night,)

760
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,610

761
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,840
(I went to find Fu Yunxi)

762
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,670
