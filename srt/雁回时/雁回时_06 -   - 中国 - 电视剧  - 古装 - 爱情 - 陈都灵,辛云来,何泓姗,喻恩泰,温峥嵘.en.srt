00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,260
=The Glory=

2
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,100
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,620
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

4
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,490
(A few days later)

5
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,330
Lingzhi.

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,950
Here. Have some candied fruit.

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
And try

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,200
the plum blossom cake.

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
Also,

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,230
the sweet lotus root.

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,710
Try them all.

12
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,640
See which flavor you like best.

13
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
Thank you, Aunt Yushan.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,710
I like them all.

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,640
Good girl. If you like them,

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,120
I'll bring you more next time.

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
Is that alright?

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,840
Alright.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
Miss Yushan, you came uninvited.

20
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,360
So you're no longer grounded?

21
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,150
Yunxi, you underestimate me.

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,470
How could the ancestral hall confine me?

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,470
It's been days since I last saw Miss Hanyan.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,630
I wonder if she's doing well.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,630
She's currently recovering.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,750
Smallpox is dangerous.

27
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,400
Even after recovery,

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,750
it leaves the face covered in scars.

29
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,870
It's better for her not to go out anymore,

30
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,990
so as not to frighten others.

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Father, is Aunt Hanyan ill?

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
Lingzhi, don't worry.

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Aunt Yushan

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,310
is jealous of Aunt Hanyan's beauty

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
and spoke rudely.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,130
I…

37
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,750
You mean I'm jealous?

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,680
Yunxi…

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Sir,

40
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,710
she's here.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
Who's here?

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,590
Oh my heavens.

43
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,960
How could you leave the ancestral hall?

44
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,990
Come on.

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,150
Come back with me now

46
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,590
before Madam and Master notice.

47
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,630
Yunxi,

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
did you call her here?

49
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,760
Miss Yushan has broken the family rules.

50
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,800
If Mr. Zhuang finds out, punishment awaits.

51
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm doing this for your own good.

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
You…

53
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,560
You don't trust me?

54
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,870
I had nothing to do with the cloak.

55
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,030
It was Zhuang Hanyan.

56
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,520
She framed me and set me up.

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
I thought you were busy with duties today,

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,710
so I helped take care of Lingzhi.

59
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,680
I'll ask my mother

60
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,080
to take care of Lingzhi these days.

61
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,990
Don't bother, Miss Yushan.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,030
I don't mind, Yunxi.

63
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,960
Miss Yushan, please stop talking.

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,120
Hurry up and leave.

65
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,550
Go quickly.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Let go.

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,710
Who told you to come?

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,900
It was you, right?

69
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,840
Take care, Miss Yushan.

70
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,310
Take care, Aunt Yushan.

71
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,680
Lingzhi, have some soup.

72
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,920
My Lord.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,710
It seems ordinary,

74
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,720
but once steamed, it fills the air
with fragrance.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,470
Cook it with dried fish, and it turns

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
appetizing.

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,950
Yushan loves
the smoked cured meat you make.

78
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,560
Every year, she'd enjoy a big bowl of it.

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,830
Sadly, she can't have it this year.

80
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,000
Any news on Cuiyun?

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Yushan is kind and honest.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,950
She was deceived and provoked by Cuiyun

83
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,190
and did some foolish things.

84
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,040
Yet she values their bond

85
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,600
and refuses to reveal the whereabouts of her.

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,040
Let's wait a bit longer.

87
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
Wait until Mother calms her anger

88
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,070
and releases her from the ancestral hall.

89
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,480
I will make sure she is not mistreated.

90
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,720
You must remain fair to all.

91
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Miss Hanyan has

92
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,950
been quiet for days.

93
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,360
Smallpox is dangerous.
I wonder how it goes.

94
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
Don't worry.
Her mother is taking care of her.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,270
She should've recovered by now.

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,390
You brat,

97
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,000
I called you here,

98
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,800
but you don't speak.

99
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,920
Please forgive me.

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,510
If you'd like to know
Miss Hanyan's condition,

101
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
let Madam come and ask her.

102
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,510
We, as servants, should follow our duties.

103
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
We mustn't gossip.

104
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
You…

105
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,190
Forget it.

106
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,790
Go back now.

107
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,470
Yes.

108
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,870
The maids of Jianjia Chamber

109
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,510
keep their mouths shut.

110
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,870
Ma'am, please take care.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,630
It's better not to overthink.

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,560
Hanyan's mother is relentless.

113
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,120
How can I not be worried?

114
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,500
(Jianjia Chamber)

115
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,340
(Jianjia Chamber)

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
Miss Hanyan,

117
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,950
today's meal is here.

118
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,680
The two gentlemen from yesterday

119
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,630
didn't suit your taste,

120
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,680
so your mother selected
three more suitors for you to consider.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,390
Please have a look.

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,190
This is Mr. Tao,

123
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,160
a native of Yuzhong's northern border.

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,070
His family's been in the tea and horse trade

125
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
and is fairly well-off.

126
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,680
This is a scribe from Yazhou.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,040
He cared for his gravely ill wife
for eight years.

128
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,750
With such devotion,

129
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,000
being his successor wife
wouldn't be a bad choice.

130
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,120
And this is Deputy Shen

131
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,920
from a military household of Bashu.

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,630
He is known for being gentle
and protective.

133
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,510
If you marry him,

134
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,000
you'll surely

135
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
live a comfortable life.

136
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,720
Porridge again?

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
You've just recovered

138
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,310
and should avoid greasy food.

139
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,430
I wonder if these gentlemen

140
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,600
are to your liking today.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,510
Mother has truly been put to great effort

142
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,160
find these suitors from a remote corner.

143
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,430
It must've taken quite a bit of trouble.

144
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,560
Is there anyone else?

145
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,390
Besides these choices,

146
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,000
anyone from more distant places?

147
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,360
These men are all from upright families.

148
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,930
Their birth charts have been matched.

149
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,510
You should make a decision soon.

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,830
Do I even have a choice?

151
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,480
Madam said,

152
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,360
no matter whom you choose,

153
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,360
it's better than getting involved
in this mess.

154
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,720
For years,

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,440
I have failed to serve my parents

156
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,750
as a filial daughter should.

157
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Today, I swear,

158
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,240
I will never marry.

159
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,510
I will dedicate my life to my parents

160
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,870
to make up for the regret.

161
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,910
It seems

162
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,030
none of these suitors

163
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,030
are to your liking.

164
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Take them down.

165
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,630
Miss Hanyan, I'll take my leave.

166
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,710
Wait.

167
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,720
Have you changed your mind?

168
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,320
Take the porridge away.

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,750
I want food.

170
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,080
Wait.

171
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,360
Stop.

172
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
Nanny Chen.

173
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
The kitchen prepared some snacks.

174
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,630
Grandmother instructed
to send some to Miss Hanyan.

175
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,080
Please open the door.

176
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
Nanny Chen…

177
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,350
Nanny Chen.

178
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,960
These are for Miss Hanyan…

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,150
We appreciate it.

180
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,230
You may return now.

181
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
Give it to me.

182
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
Give it to me.

183
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,750
It's better to present it to Madam first.

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,240
If anything goes wrong after you eat it,

185
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,150
I can't afford to take the blame.

186
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,230
Give it to me.

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,080
What's the fuss?

188
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,230
What?

189
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,310
It's only been days,

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,890
and you're fighting with the servants?

191
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,670
I dare not.

192
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,630
Hungry, huh?

193
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,320
A bowl of thin porridge each day

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
doesn't fill the stomach.

195
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
Indeed, you're a bit thinner.

196
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,150
Why not settle on a marriage soon?

197
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,360
Find a husband who cares for you.

198
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,320
Even a simple life with plain meals

199
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,960
is better than suffering before me.

200
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,670
Ms. Zhou considers family status

201
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,240
when choosing a husband for me,

202
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,840
yet you only seek to send me

203
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,550
to some remote, desolate place

204
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,510
to marry a man I've never met

205
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,790
and spend my life with him.

206
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,670
What have I done wrong

207
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,750
for Mother to reject me so?

208
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,200
I may have failed you as a mother,

209
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,840
but in this vast Zhuang household,

210
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,960
no one will stand up for you,

211
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
and no one can save you.

212
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,360
You might as well accept your fate.

213
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,870
If I had accepted my fate,

214
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,510
I would've died in Danzhou long ago.

215
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,630
You blame me?

216
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,390
Why shouldn't I blame you?

217
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,750
Even if it was giving birth to me

218
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,960
that caused your legs to be crippled,

219
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,840
what does that have to do with me?

220
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,390
Do you truly believe

221
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm willing to have come to this world?

222
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,500
When you gave birth to me,

223
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,240
did you ever ask for my consent?

224
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,750
All these years,

225
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,270
Father would occasionally

226
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,880
send some silver and pastries to Danzhou,

227
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,080
write a few letters to show his concern.

228
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,270
But you?

229
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,630
What have you ever done for me?

230
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,270
Truly your father's dutiful child.

231
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,320
Zhuang's perfect daughter.

232
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,470
Fine.

233
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,840
From today,

234
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,910
there is no bond between us.

235
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,720
Take her to the side room.

236
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,310
Lock all the doors and windows.

237
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,390
Without my orders,
she cannot leave the room.

(Justice Without Mercy)

264
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,600
Yuwen Chang'an?

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,890
Yes.

266
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,200
He seems quite intrigued by Pei Dafu lately.

267
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,740
He used the pretext of review

268
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,440
to uncover the entire case file,

269
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,030
and privately investigated

270
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,150
Pei Dafu's adopted son.

271
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,680
Although he's the Left Imperial Censor,

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,550
the Zuohang Gang case

273
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,080
is not under his jurisdiction.

274
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
Thus, I believe

275
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,380
there must be something unusual.

276
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,800
By the way,

277
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,150
he arranged a meeting

278
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,320
with some officials from Yinan

279
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,390
at Chaling Tavern.

280
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,670
Go inform Mr. Jiang

281
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,720
to host them in Hongyun Hall
on the second floor.

282
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,180
(Chaling Tavern)

284
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,320
Gentlemen,

285
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,660
they say Jianxi's tea is unmatched.

286
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,480
Please have a taste.

287
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,600
Alright.

288
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,390
Mr. Yuwen,

289
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,670
you've never been one for crowds
or hosting banquets.

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,550
It isn't just about tasting tea, is it?

291
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,850
You may not be aware of this.

292
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,600
The Emperor tasked me
with drafting the Trade Law.

293
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,710
While I understand legal statutes,

294
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,790
I'm unfamiliar with commerce.

295
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,320
Both of you are from Yinan

296
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,150
and likely have
merchant friends or relatives.

297
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,270
Could you inquire for me?

298
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,150
If we can establish contact

299
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,270
with Danzhou Chamber of Commerce,

300
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,480
it would be perfect.

301
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Though my kin includes merchants,

302
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,720
none have achieved prominence.

303
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,870
I'm afraid they won't be of much help.

304
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,910
However, there is someone in the Capital,

305
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,000
who commands great influence there.

306
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,510
But he's already...

307
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,040
Pei Dafu?

308
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,280
Mr. Yuwen,

309
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,120
mind your words.

310
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,200
That name must not be mentioned.

311
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,390
Indeed.

312
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,870
If these words reach

313
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,800
the ears of that official
at the Judicial Review,

314
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,870
we'll be branded as remnants,

315
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,960
then we're doomed.

316
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
Mr. Sun.

317
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,430
Mr. Yuwen,

318
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,910
I have family matters to attend to,

319
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,270
so I must take my leave.

320
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,910
Please forgive me.

321
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,390
I'm tied up with official duties,
so I'll take my leave.

322
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,030
We are just having tea and chatting.

323
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,360
There's no need to be so overly cautious.

324
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,200
Well…

325
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,910
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

326
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,150
Hold on. Please.

327
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,790
Keep a close watch on Yuwen Chang'an.

328
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,080
Yes, sir.

329
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,070
Miss Hanyan?

330
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,920
Miss Hanyan?

331
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,520
You…

332
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,680
Looking at your features,

333
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,200
you resemble your mother in her youth,

334
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,070
with her grace and charm.

335
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,400
Xiwen was both talented and beautiful,

336
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,630
renowned in the Capital.

337
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,590
Among the young scholars of Hanlin Academy,

338
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,270
at least half admire her deeply.

339
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,900
(Flying Swan on Snow)

340
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,110
Xiwen, perhaps we should

341
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,400
communicate by letter in the future.

342
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,390
It's not safe.

343
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,440
It's better to discuss it in person.

344
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
I've heard rumors

345
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,440
spreading in the Capital
about Pei Dafu's adopted son.

346
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,310
If that's the case,

347
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,750
we have no choice but to take a risk.

348
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,920
Miss Hanyan, what are you doing?

349
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,630
Stop right there.

350
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,030
What are you doing?

351
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,720
- Stop it.
- Let me go.

352
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
Let me go!

353
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,480
What's going on?

354
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,240
Mr. Yuwen, please go inside.

355
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,400
What did you hear?

356
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,070
Everything.

357
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,830
Let me hear it.

358
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,310
You secretly met a man at night.

359
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,550
What else do you want me to say?

360
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,480
Such a stubborn nature.

361
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,640
Only Deputy Shen from Bashu

362
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,750
can handle you.

363
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
Nanny Chen,

364
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,390
deliver the proposal to the Shens.

365
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,590
Then tie her up

366
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,040
and send her to the manor outskirt.

367
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,000
Keep a close watch on her

368
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,270
until the wedding day.

369
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Where else do you think you're going?

370
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,960
Let go of me.

371
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,830
I will not marry.

372
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,000
It's not up to you.

373
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,070
I will not marry.

374
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,910
Try me.

375
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,430
Hold on a moment.

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,160
Mr. Fu.

377
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,110
You trespassed into the ladies' at night.

378
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,590
I expect a proper explanation.

379
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,570
Miss Hanyan cannot marry.

380
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,150
Fu Yunxi,

381
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,510
the Zhuangs allow you
to stay temporarily.

382
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,960
Yet you even meddle
in the family matters now?

383
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,030
I'm not here as Zhuang's son-in-law,

384
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,220
but the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review.

385
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,250
It's about the Danzhou bandit case.

386
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,920
We have uncovered new evidence.

387
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,270
Miss Hanyan is the sole eyewitness.

388
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,590
Every detail must be verified with her.

389
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,030
It was an emergency, so I had to rush in.

390
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,550
Please understand.

391
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,270
What evidence?

392
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,960
It's not to disclose for now.

393
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,200
Miss Hanyan,
please come with me to the Judicial Review.

394
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,340
What if I refuse to let her go?

395
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,270
If you interfere,

396
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,550
don't blame me for being rude.

397
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,480
Take her.

398
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,440
Before the case is fully resolved,

399
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,880
Miss Hanyan is forbidden
to leave the Capital.

400
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,680
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

401
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,820
(Judicial Review)

402
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,910
Hungry?

403
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,640
Trying to scare me, are you?

404
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,590
Most women who end up in the prison

405
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,070
either wail for mercy or faint outright.

406
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,440
Even men like Mu Feng,

407
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,590
spent days retching

408
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,750
from the stench of blood
when he first arrived.

409
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,030
But you seem completely unfazed.

410
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,070
I grew up in the countryside.

411
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
I've seen animals being slaughtered.

412
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,160
You get used to the smell after a while.

413
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,240
Good to hear.

414
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,100
I wouldn't want to upset your stomach.

415
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,310
Why aren't you eating?

416
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,030
Is the food not to your liking?

417
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,510
Quite the opposite.

418
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,350
It's absolutely to my liking.

419
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,350
Glutinous rice.

420
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,590
Dongpo pork.

421
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,070
Three-crisp delicacies.

422
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,110
They're all my favorite.

423
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,440
You're quite attentive.

424
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,040
It's a habit.

425
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,760
A habit

426
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,960
of observing others' preferences.

427
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,080
Yes.

428
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,110
Why?

429
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,440
Makes it easier

430
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,960
when poisoning someone.

431
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,030
Aren't you afraid?

432
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,440
You won't poison me.

433
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
Why are you so certain?

434
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,590
You went through so much trouble
to save me.

435
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,440
Was it just to poison me?

436
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,670
I didn't save you.

437
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
I'm interrogating you.

438
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,110
Go ahead.

439
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,110
What did Yuwen Chang'an and your mother

440
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,350
talk about?

441
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,790
How do you know about that?

442
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,030
Answer my question.

443
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,070
The two met secretly tonight.

444
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,480
What did they discuss?

445
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,000
What exactly

446
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
are you trying to do?

447
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,200
Answer my question.

448
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,310
Too far away.

449
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,510
I couldn't hear clearly.

450
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,440
I only heard them recite a few poems.

451
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,830
Just ancient tales.

452
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,030
I could have you tortured.

453
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,310
Believe it or not.

454
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,070
Aren't you curious

455
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,510
about the connection between your father,

456
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,880
your mother, and Yuwen Chang'an?

457
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,750
What kind of connection do they share?

458
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,550
What connection?

459
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,270
It's an old story.

460
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,200
Your mother's father,

461
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,160
your grandfather,

462
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,820
was once a Grand Scholar
of the Hanlin Academy,

463
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,300
and a mentor to many scholars.

464
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,700
(Young Yuwen Chang'an)

465
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,270
Zhuang Shiyang and Yuwen Chang'an

466
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,110
(Young Ruan Xiwen)
were both his students.

467
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,980
(Young Zhuang Shiyang)

468
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,060
(Ruan Manor)

469
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,790
Later, the Ruans incurred imperial wrath

470
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,260
and fell into ruin overnight.

471
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,350
Yuwen was sent
to Qingzhou on official duty.

472
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,210
By the time he rushed back

473
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,590
to the Capital,

474
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,640
(Zhuang Residence)

475
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,030
(Wedding Procession)
it was too late.

476
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,220
(Happiness)

477
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,640
From that day forward,

478
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,200
Yuwen became Zhuang's sworn rival,

479
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,680
constantly at odds in court.

480
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,480
Though his career flourished,

481
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,350
he never married.

482
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,240
Rumors have long suggested

483
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,720
that he still has feelings for Ruan Xiwen.

484
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,040
He

485
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,680
still loves my mother?

486
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,830
What caused the Ruans' downfall?

487
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,830
I have no interest in your mother's past

488
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,670
with Yuwen.

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,960
I must find out

490
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,550
what they are plotting.

491
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,650
Now, only you

492
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,400
can help me uncover the truth.

493
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,270
You overestimate me.

494
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,920
I can barely protect myself.
Let alone helping you.

495
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,640
With the edict from the Judicial Review,

496
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,830
no one would dare force you into marriage.

497
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Besides,

498
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,270
aren't you even a little curious

499
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,260
about what they're scheming?

500
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,150
Miss Hanyan,

501
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,030
where is your hairpin?

502
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,110
Today,

503
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,480
why didn't I see you wearing it?

504
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,350
What do you want me to do?

505
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,480
How you investigate is your concern.

506
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,880
You startled the Jianjia Chamber tonight.

507
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,400
They won't meet again anytime soon.

508
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,070
Go back and rest.

509
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,510
I will devise a plan

510
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,000
to make them meet again.

511
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
I'll let you know in advance.

512
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,880
I can't act freely in Jianjia Chamber.

513
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,040
How will you get word to me?

514
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,110
Through music.

515
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,760
Sir,

516
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,750
a Zhuang's nanny's here to take her back.

517
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,190
Did you get enough?

518
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,590
I lost my appetite.

519
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,400
Thank you for the meal. I'll take my leave.

520
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,590
I'll see you off.

521
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,520
Go ahead.

522
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,250
Make sure to look miserable.

523
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,070
You're good at that.

524
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,800
Miss Hanyan,

525
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,110
this way, please.

526
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,020
(Seclusion)

527
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,140
(Zhuang Residence)

528
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,460
(Jianjia Chamber)

529
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,680
Tonight's curfew. Watch over the servants.

530
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,350
Without my orders,

531
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,590
no one steps outside.

532
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,760
Understood.

533
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,720
Xiwen.

534
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,070
What's so urgent

535
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,720
that we must meet tonight?

536
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,360
It's too dangerous.

537
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,180
An emergency.

538
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,360
(To Yuwen Chang'an)
I received a letter today.

539
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,350
Take a look.

540
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,820
(I'm Zhao Wangshan,
Head of Danzhou Chamber of Commerce.)

541
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,200
(I request an audience.)
Head of Danzhou Chamber of Commerce?

542
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,400
Didn't you meet him last year?

543
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,510
Didn't he refuse to reveal anything?

544
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,360
That's what puzzles me.

545
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,880
But this letter contains only one line.

546
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,430
It's vague and incomplete.

547
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,960
(To Yuwen Chang'an)
Where did it come from?

548
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,900
I haven't found out yet.

549
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,230
Someone left it

550
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,070
on my desk.

551
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,150
Feels like a test.

552
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,440
If he's truly willing to testify,

553
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,710
with the irrefutable evidence I hold,

554
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,400
we can bring him down for good.

555
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,920
The situation is treacherous lately.

556
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,000
We must proceed with caution.

557
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,590
It's of great importance

558
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,280
and requires deliberation.

559
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,030
You know I've been

560
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,230
gathering evidence for years.

561
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,360
Maybe we should wait longer.

562
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,070
- Perhaps…
- There's no perhaps.

563
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,110
I've planned for years,

564
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,360
considered every angle.

565
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,590
There's no need to persuade me further.

566
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,430
However,

567
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,030
my daughter returned unexpectedly.

568
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,630
I must get her out of here at once.

569
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,400
She's still a teenager.

570
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,150
She's suffered enough.

571
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,480
I don't want her to be involved anymore.

572
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,400
I only hope her life from now on

573
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,500
can be filled with happiness and peace.

574
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,070
Ms. Zhou.

575
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,070
Why are you so flustered?

576
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,190
Just now Nanny Chen brought a man

577
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,840
to the backyard.

578
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,400
He seemed suspicious

579
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,670
and headed toward Jianjia Chamber.

580
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,840
Did you see his face?

581
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,150
The night is too dark to see clearly.

582
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,370
But it's definitely not someone
from our household.

583
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,230
Prepare my outfit.

584
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,070
The crimson one.

585
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,480
I need to look my best.

586
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,400
Let's go.

587
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,560
I brought some night snacks

588
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,880
and came to keep you company.

589
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,070
But I found the door open,

590
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,190
and the room in disarray.

591
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,960
Someone must've rummaged through.

592
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,360
I took a quick look.

593
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,920
The only thing missing is your official seal.

594
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,880
This is a disaster.

595
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,110
Who could have stolen it?

596
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,550
There's been a theft.

597
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,190
Should we report it?

598
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
Relay my orders

599
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,150
to lock down the residence tightly.

600
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,470
Conduct a thorough search.

601
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,110
Perhaps the thief hasn't gone far.

602
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,880
- Yes.
- Move quickly.

603
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,260
(Seclusion)

604
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,440
Search every room thoroughly.

605
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,920
- Move.
- Go.

606
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,920
Shiyang,

607
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,400
what happened?

608
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,760
Mother, we've been robbed at home.

609
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,650
My official seal has been stolen.

610
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,550
Did you hear anything unusual?

611
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,360
Oh heavens. I had just gone to bed.

612
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,960
Make sure to search thoroughly.

613
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,070
Don't let the thief escape.

614
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,910
Yes, yes.

615
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,670
Thankfully, you're safe.

616
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,150
But as for Madam...

617
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,960
I'll keep an eye here.

618
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,150
Take more people with you

619
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,360
and check the Jianjia Chamber.

620
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,510
Yes.

621
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,350
Be careful.

622
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,000
Come with me, quickly.

623
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,700
(Jade and Bamboo)

624
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,440
Why are you here?

625
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,430
Forgive us, sir.

626
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,960
The Master has ordered
every courtyard to be locked.

627
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,880
Search each courtyard thoroughly.

628
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,190
No one is allowed to leave.

629
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,710
- I think she…
- Madam, something's wrong.

630
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,000
Ms. Zhou said
there's been a thief here.

631
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,460
Master's official seal's been stolen.

632
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,030
The entire household is now surrounded.

633
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,590
Madam, we must get Mr. Yuwen out of here.

634
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,710
At least have him leave our courtyard first.

635
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,840
Otherwise, it will be hard to explain.

636
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,320
Xiwen,

637
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,190
perhaps I should leave now.

638
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,230
This is clearly aimed at us.

639
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,670
It's already too late.

640
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,840
Mother.

641
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,280
Zhuang Hanyan?

642
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,000
You tipped off Zhou Ruyin, didn't you?

643
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,760
I knew you'd suspect me,

644
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,960
but it has nothing to do with me.

645
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,840
I just want to know

646
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,230
what did you mean?

647
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,670
What are you plotting together?

648
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,590
Over these past days,

649
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,840
you have humiliated me time and again,

650
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,710
determined to drive me out of this house.

651
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,320
Are you afraid I might get implicated?

652
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,480
What did you overhear?

653
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:30,020
(Jianjia Chamber)

654
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,070
- Bust it open.
- Yes.

655
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,070
Madam, they're forcing their way in.

656
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,280
You must decide now.

657
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,630
We'll talk about this later.

658
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,630
Mr. Yuwen, go to my room for now.

659
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,550
How can I go to your room?

660
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,190
Ms. Zhou is coming in aggressively.

661
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,070
Clearly, they aim to tarnish Mother's name.

662
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,830
She is the Madam of the Zhuangs.

663
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,680
Her reputation must remain untarnished.

664
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,470
But I am not afraid.

665
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,630
Why are you not afraid?

666
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,760
You're an unmarried young lady.

667
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,880
How can you say that?

668
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,550
A few rumors mean nothing.

669
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,190
Compared to being called a barefoot ghost,

670
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,110
what does it matter?

671
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,840
As long as Mother is secure,

672
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,450
I'll have nothing to fear.

673
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,400
If Mother loses power, all will be ruined.

674
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,960
Where did you learn such schemes?

675
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,460
At this point,

676
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,190
there's no need for us to doubt each other.

677
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,030
I know you have secrets,

678
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,000
but I trust you won't hurt me.

679
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,320
Why are you so sure?

680
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,670
Let me warn you again.

681
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,230
Stop using your talents

682
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,670
on trivial household matters.

683
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,190
Now is not the time to discuss this.

684
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,440
Mr. Yuwen, come with me.

685
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,840
Nanny Chen,

686
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,120
take her.

687
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,030
Miss Hanyan.

688
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
Miss Hanyan.

689
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,510
Mother.

690
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,360
Even if I lose everything today,

691
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,620
it has nothing to do with you.

692
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,030
It's all my own matter.

693
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,600
Jilan,

694
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,800
push me outside.

695
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,430
- Mother.
- Miss Hanyan.

696
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,320
It's…

697
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,510
Xiwen, don't go out.

698
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,350
Mr. Yuwen,

699
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,920
no matter what happens out there,

700
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,760
do not step out.

701
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,440
Nanny Chen, close the door.

702
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,950
Let's go.
