00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, I can hear you.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
I know.

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,800
The tones of tempo

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:26,620
رب

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,200
I have imagined my dreams wouldn't change.

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
So many are already coming true.

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,300
I don't have to worry anymore.

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,940
If I were Builder,

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,200
I would also take the responsibility

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,760
of being His Majesty's temporary servant

58
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,480
and being His Majesty

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,340
the one and only one.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,660
But how?

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,840
When I saw that entire thing,

62
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,840
I just forgot

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
how to make up for it.

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,160
―......

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,260
Aunty Hanyue, It is you here!

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
Santi

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,660
Aunty Hanyue, You will sad해 daddy!

68
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,860
I wonder if there will be a mother in the future.

69
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
I'm just afraid

70
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,260
I can't be a mother.

71
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,460
Since I was a child,

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,460
other mothers

73
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,660
will wait for their children.

74
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,860
A'zhi's mother

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,060
is not a good mother.

76
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,660
I saved her

77
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,060
a hundred times,

78
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,060
a thousand times,

79
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,060
a thousand times.

80
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,060
But I never have a father.

81
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,860
I, too,

82
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,660
don't want to be A'zhi's mother.

83
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,060
A'zhi.

84
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,060
Father,

85
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,060
stop crying, okay?

86
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,860
Aunt Han Yan likes you.

87
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,460
But we just got married.

88
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,260
You need to spend more time with her, okay?

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,860
Father.

90
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,260
Stop crying.

91
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,260
It's late.

92
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,860
Go back and rest.

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,660
A'zhi.

94
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,860
I was careless and hurt her.

95
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,260
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,260
It's okay.

97
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,860
Take your time.

98
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,660
We need to suspect

99
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,460
all the changes.

100
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,060
I believe you just now.

101
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,060
It's not your fault

102
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,460
to pretend to be A'zhi.

103
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,060
You're so naive.

104
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,060
Zhou Ruying

105
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,660
won't trust me.

106
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,860
Did you

107
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,060
let go of Chai Jing today?

108
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,060
I just told her

109
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,460
that I was going to stay.

110
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,060
I've kept her

111
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,260
all the time.

112
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,460
I don't want her to worry.

113
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
This is what the servants gave me.

114
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,060
Chai Jing

115
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,060
should be the one who gave you the letter.

116
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,460
Han Yan,

117
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,660
good night.

118
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,460
Since we met in Danzhou,

119
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,060
we've known each other for three years.

120
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
I've thought about it countless times.

121
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,060
Maybe one day,

122
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
we'll go to the sea together.

123
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,060
From now on, we'll live together.

124
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,060
But I've been thinking about

125
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,660
whether I should leave

126
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,060
and protect you

127
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,660
from a cruel person.

128
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,260
I don't want to be your burden,

129
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,260
but I'll always be determined.

130
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,460
Until today,

131
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,460
you have someone who can protect you for me.

132
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,460
I'll be at ease.

133
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
From now on,

134
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,860
you won't be alone in the future.

135
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,660
No matter if you need me or not,

136
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,260
I'll take your secret

137
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,460
and go back to the sea.

138
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,060
That's my home.

139
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,860
That's my destiny.

140
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,860
Will you leave me forever?

141
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,460
No.

142
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,860
What if I find my home?

143
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,860
Then I...

144
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,460
I'll always be there.

145
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,060
I often think that

146
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
the world is hard to find.

147
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,060
So, after growing up,

148
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,460
I want to be a person who can protect myself.

149
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,660
Even if one day you're powerless to protect yourself,

150
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
you don't have to be afraid.

151
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,060
I'll be there for you.

152
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
I'll be there for you.

153
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
I'll be there for you.

154
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,460
The RedBull真朋友

I'm just a man

165

I'm not a god, I'm not a god

I'm just a man

167
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
So pretty

168
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,960
Better than fireworks

169
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,840
You've never seen a pretty fireworks

170
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
You've seen it?

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,600
I've seen it when I was in the sea

172
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
The fireworks in the sea

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I think it's better than the normal fireworks

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,600
If you marry me

175
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I'll make you

176
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
the fire in the sky

177
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Marry you?

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I've never thought about it

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
There's something in the fireworks

180
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,600
But I don't know if I can see it today

181
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I hope you won't be worried or afraid

182
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
You'll be happy all your life

183
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm worried

184
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm worried

185
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Don't move the cold water

186
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
There's something in the fireworks

187
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
You have to live well

188
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I hope you can have a good time

189
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
The fireworks in the sea

190
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Aunt

191
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Aunt

192
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
The spirit is ready

193
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Please go and have a look

194
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm not dead

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm not dead

196
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I'm not dead

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm not dead

198
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Aunt

199
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I'm not dead

200
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I should have gone to the wood

201
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
and had a good time

202
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Aunt

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm not dead

204
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Aunt

205
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Aunt

206
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
My son

207
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,600
The wind blows on the road

208
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm not afraid

209
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm here for you

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
My son is afraid

211
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Aunt

212
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I didn't protect you

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm a father to you

214
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm not afraid

215
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Zhang Shiyang

216
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
I have been raising my son for more than ten years

217
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
He's dead without a word

218
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
How do you want to be with me?

219
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Zhi'er

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
She's my son

221
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
She can't come to her home

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
She's dead

223
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I raised her

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Who's here to accompany me?

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
You raised her

226
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I raised her

227
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
It's me

228
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
And

229
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
And my umbrella

230
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I was so cruel to raise them

231
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Now my son is dead

232
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
My daughter is like this

233
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
You don't deserve it

234
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
You don't deserve it

235
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
You let me go

236
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
What do you want?

237
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Who doesn't know this?

238
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Don't take me as a scapegoat

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Aunt

240
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Ruoyin

241
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
You want to come to Wenshun

242
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Don't make trouble

243
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Don't let me get my soul broken

244
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Wenshun's gift

245
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I was in the Zhuang family for a long time

246
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I was a little servant

247
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
But I'm a father

248
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
My son is dead

249
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Now

250
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
My daughter

251
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
She's dead

252
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm not a scapegoat

253
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
I'm not a scapegoat

254
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
You're a thief

255
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
You're a man

256
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
You're a criminal

257
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
You're a man

258
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Master

259
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You're a man

260
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I thought I was a scapegoat

261
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
But I didn't know

262
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
You're so sad

263
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Don't talk nonsense

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Talk nonsense

265
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I remember

266
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
After Pei Dafu died

267
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Master always talked nonsense

268
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
in his dream

269
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Master

270
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
If you want to kill me

271
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
You'll be in trouble

272
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
But I'm a woman

273
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm a man of the Zhuang family

274
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
If you can make a mistake

275
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
and you're dead

276
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,600
How can I make a living?

277
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Even if I'm a woman

278
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Even if a woman wants to kill you

279
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I won't be in this family

280
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm willing to be in this family

281
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
and be alone

282
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
From now on

283
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
We're the same

284
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Master

285
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Can you trust me?

286
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Don't say that

287
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Don't say that

288
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
I know what you want

289
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Zhu Wanfu

290
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Okay

291
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Go to your work

292
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Yushan

293
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Come here

294
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Where are you going?

295
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Everyone is so busy

296
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Yushan

297
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
From now on

298
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
You're the enemy of Zhuang family

299
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Even if you're a pretty woman

300
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
From now on

301
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
No one will dare to insult you and my mother

302
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Pretty woman

303
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
You're so lucky

304
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
It seems that you're not dead

305
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
At least I wish you good luck

306
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
and a good life

307
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Yushan

308
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm doing this

309
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Is it not for you?

310
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
From now on

311
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
You're not a woman

312
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm not a woman

313
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
You can be serious

314
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
and change me as a mother

315
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
How is your father's daughter?

316
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
From a young age

317
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,600
If you didn't fall into the world every day

318
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
I don't care about these

319
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
The real rainbow

320
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
is always you

321
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
You were killed by me

322
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
and you were killed by me

323
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm the one who killed my mother

324
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I should have killed her

325
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I said it

326
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Don't call me mother

327
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
You remember me

328
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Chi'er

329
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Chi'er was not killed by you and me

330
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,600
He was killed by Zhuang Hanye

331
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Now he's married to his father

332
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
He's married to a rich man

333
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
He'll be even more successful in the future

334
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
But now

335
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm Zhuang's mother

336
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
You're Zhuang's enemy

337
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
You're not a slave

338
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
As long as you marry into the high school

339
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
We'll be in no danger

340
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Mother wants me to marry to god

341
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
There are many noble people in the world

342
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
The royal family is not familiar with it

343
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
You're a good husband

344
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
than you are

345
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Why should I marry into the royal family?

346
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
You said I'm a great teacher

347
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
How can you ask such a question?

348
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I've said it many times

349
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Our women are the ungrateful

350
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
The history of the world

351
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Only father and husband

352
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Your father's position is no longer right

353
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Your future is in the world

354
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Only your husband is left

355
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
It seems that my father is dead

356
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Mother has put the hope of the future

357
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
on her daughter

358
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Yu Yan

359
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Are you going to be Zhuang Hanye

360
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
from now on?

361
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
You're under my feet

362
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
No

363
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
But I don't want to

364
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,600
make you the enemy of the world

365
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
You've been willing to do it for years

366
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
In the future

367
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
You should be your mother

368
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Drink the soup

369
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
You'll get better

370
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
No need

371
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
We're married

372
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
We should be happy

373
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Mother and aunt

374
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Please take care of them

375
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Don't let them see you

376
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Otherwise

377
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
There will be trouble in the future

378
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
I will do what I want

379
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
But there is one more thing

380
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
You need to help me

381
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
What is it?

382
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
I left the capital with mother

383
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I've seen Yu Yan before

384
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Hanye?

385
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Uncle Yu Wen

386
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Did your mother ask you to come?

387
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
My mother has got the divorce certificate

388
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
She wants to get up early tomorrow

389
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
to leave the capital soon

390
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Xie Wen finally agreed

391
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Yes

392
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Okay

393
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
It's great

394
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Hanye

395
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
I want to thank you

396
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I did all this

397
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
to get the divorce certificate

398
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
to complete this life

399
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Although you can't grow up with Xie Wen

400
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
You're really a good daughter

401
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
We'll get up early tomorrow

402
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Since you're free

403
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
You can get up early tomorrow

404
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Unfortunately

405
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
You can't get married

406
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
You're so stubborn

407
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
You've done a lot of work

408
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
these years

409
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
What else did you do?

410
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
I was a good daughter

411
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I was a bad girl

412
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
I was looking for evidence

413
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
to find the fake

414
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
for Zhuang Shiyang

415
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
I just hope I can catch the culprit

416
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Did you find any clues?

417
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I did find some

418
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
But I found the evidence

419
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
when I was in the hospital

420
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I've found the evidence

421
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
and put it in a box

422
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
in the capital

423
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I've made my decision

424
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
If Xie Wen doesn't want to leave the capital

425
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll have to

426
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
deal with Zhuang Shiyang

427
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
for the rest of my life

428
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I'll find the evidence

429
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
to find the culprit

430
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
and put it in the box

431
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
I've put the evidence

432
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
in the box

433
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I don't need to

434
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
think about it

435
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
We'd better leave the capital

436
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
and find a place

437
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
to live

438
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
and live

439
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I don't need to think about

440
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
the things that should be done

441
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Are these evidence

442
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
still in the capital?

443
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I was in the hospital

444
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
and I've found the culprit

445
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
If I can find the evidence

446
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
for the past ten years

447
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
I'll have the help

448
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
from the minister

449
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
But I have to

450
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
find the culprit

451
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
What?

452
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
You can't do it?

453
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I've been in charge of the original paper

454
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
but I want to go to the capital

455
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
It's not easy

456
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
If it's easy

457
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
what else do you need?

458
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
I'll try my best

459
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Remember to take the medicine

460
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
The cold is getting better

461
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
The young madam has been in bed for two or three days

462
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
and she's fine

463
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
She said she'd come to the police

464
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Sister

465
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Sister

466
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
It's so embarrassing

467
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Why are you so nervous?

468
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Someone just sent me here

469
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
I'll open the box

470
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
What is it?

471
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
It's a letter from the police

472
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
I'm sorry

473
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I'm sorry

474
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Sister

475
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Sister

476
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Don't look at me

477
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I'll kill you

478
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
It's okay

479
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Sister

480
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Are you okay?

481
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Hurry up

482
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Have some tea

483
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Have some tea

484
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
What's going on?

485
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
There are some things

486
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
I've been thinking about it

487
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I know it all

488
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
The young madam

489
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
just got out of the palace

490
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
and she's a good girl

491
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Enough

492
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Don't say it

493
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm a rich and a good girl

494
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm a good girl

495
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I don't believe it

496
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
But think about it

497
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
She's been here for a few days

498
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
How could she bring up such a disgusting thing?

499
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Think about the angel

500
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Han Yan

501
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I've seen mother

502
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
You're not well

503
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
You don't have to be so polite

504
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I heard that you sent some gifts

505
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Well

506
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Han Yan, don't

507
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
This disgusting thing

508
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Go away

509
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Hurry up

510
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Miss Zhuang San

511
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
You really have grown up

512
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
You've been working on this

513
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
and you're not good at it

514
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
What's the use of a dead leaf?

515
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I only know

516
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
there are four ways to eat a leaf

517
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
It's to eat the heart, blood, skin, and meat

518
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
It's all different

519
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Since someone sent this West Han thing

520
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
to the door

521
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
and helped a lot

522
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Why do we have to waste it?

523
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Okay

524
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
It's all yours

525
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I'm so afraid

526
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
We're lucky to have it

527
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
This house

528
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
still has a new smell

529
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Qiu Yue, let's take madam back to the room

530
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Sister, there's a big smell in this house

531
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
You go back and rest

532
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Madam Shao

533
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
You're really brave

534
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Even if the official comes

535
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm afraid he won't lose

536
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
In the future

537
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
we have to rely on madam Shao to manage the house

538
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Aunt, you're so good

539
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
I've heard from Yunxi

540
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
that the house is in charge of managing the house

541
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Only you can be called a general

542
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Han Yan has grown up with a good husband

543
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
He's very kind

544
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
He can't be a man

545
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
You're right

546
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
The house is in charge of managing the house

547
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
As madam Shao

548
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
you're responsible for managing the house

549
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
It's better to learn from him

550
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I must teach him

551
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Why?

552
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
You don't want to learn?

553
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Since you don't teach him

554
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,600
I dare not to say anything

555
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
I'll listen to you

556
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Okay

557
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Do you remember the rules I said?

558
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Yes

559
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Okay, let's do it

560
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Do you really remember it

561
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
or you're fooling me here?

562
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Okay

563
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Cheng Jiujia

564
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Let go

565
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Why did you do that?

566
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
You said

567
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
you'd become a general after dinner

568
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
You're so fast

569
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
You haven't had your soup yet

570
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
You dare to play with me?

571
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
You shouldn't have beaten me

572
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
If you're so stubborn

573
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll be in the prison

574
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
How dare you!

575
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
If you're here

576
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
and you're so rude

577
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
how can you let yourself be?

578
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I'll kick you out of the house

579
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Don't worry, aunt

580
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm always generous

581
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I won't be mad at you

582
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,600
I'm not that kind of person

583
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Let's go to the tent

584
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
We don't have many people

585
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I have to have 20 or 30 people

586
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Just the money I make every month

587
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
is a big deal

588
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Plus, I buy it daily

589
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
I eat and drink

590
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
I put them all in the tent

591
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I have to calculate the date and time

592
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
to get a half a cup of tea

593
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I'll get you a half cup of tea

594
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Is it a wedding?

595
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm sorry, aunt

596
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Don't underestimate the 91 beads

597
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
It's the use of clothes

598
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Even if the country is falling

599
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
it's still in the cold

600
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Since you said it's a wedding

601
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I'll test it today

602
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,600
From the basis of your walk

603
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
start with your wedding perfume

604
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Come on

605
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Su Xing's perfume

606
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
has 8 beads

607
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Nanshi Luo Cheng Hu's yellow robe

and 3.4 silver

617
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
The yellow beef

618
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
has 10 gold

619
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
and 6.5 silver

620
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
The yellow beef

621
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600

622

The white beef

623
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
has 7.2 silver

624
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Yang Jiu's national brand

625
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
has 2 beads

626
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Song Jiang's national brand

has 1.2 silver

628
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
The red one has 6.5 and 9 silver

629
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
The gold one has 2.8 silver

630
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
The purple one has 3.8 silver

631
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600

00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600

The red one has 1.2 silver

637
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
What are you doing?

638
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm afraid that the 21-year-old

639
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
will bite my tongue too soon

640
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Again

641
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
You're so afraid?

642
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Today, the 21-year-old

643
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
taught me to be a housekeeper

644
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I'm afraid that I'll be

645
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
really afraid of your housekeeper

646
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
What are you talking about?

647
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
I've been busy in this house

648
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
for the rest of my life

649
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
You've been here for days

650
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
You can't even

651
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
understand the people in the house

652
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
I'm afraid that you won't be able to do it

653
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I've been busy for the rest of my life

654
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
but I'm an outsider

655
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
You

656
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Stop

657
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Zhuang Haiye, stop

658
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
What do you mean?

659
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
I put my heart into my stomach

660
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
I can't see the power of the housekeeper

661
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Okay

662
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
If you don't want to study

663
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I'll let Yunxi

664
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,600
study in the house

665
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Of course someone wants to study

666
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
If there are many sisters in the house

667
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Han Yan is happy

668
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
and can't come

669
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Really?

670
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Really

671
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Okay

672
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
I think

673
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
your sister's pregnancy is good

674
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
The child is old

675
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
and the mother is also young

676
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I also think she can...

677
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
I don't agree

678
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Yunxi

679
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
If you think that

680
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Qiu Yue is not happy

681
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
I'll help you find another...

682
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Second Aunt

683
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
You've been busy in your life

684
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
and you're fine

685
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Why do you

686
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
have such a bad temper today?

687
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I'm just thinking about you

688
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
How can you talk to me like this?

689
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Han Yan just came in

690
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
and hasn't been here for a few days

691
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
You're acting like a fool

692
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
and you're angry with me

693
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Do you have any respect for her?

694
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
She agreed just now

695
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
What does it have to do with me?

696
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
You two are good

697
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Now you're husband and wife

698
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
You're both here

699
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
You're both singing a white face

700
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
and a black face

701
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
You're acting with me, right?

702
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Second Aunt, you remember

703
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
I won't be a concubine

704
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
and I won't be a maid

705
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I only have one right

706
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
From now on

707
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
you can't

708
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
interfere with

709
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
what we have done

710
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Yunxi

711
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
I brought you up

712
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
You married a wife

713
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
and you don't let me take care of you, right?

714
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Don't come to me again

715
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
after you're married

716
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
I'll clean up now

717
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
and go back to my hometown

718
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Don't come to me

719
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I didn't want to argue with her

720
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
She didn't let me

721
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Do you really want me to take the money?

722
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
I don't want to

723
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
but I want to

724
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
I want to

725
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
I want to

726
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
I want to

727
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
I want to

728
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
I want to

729
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
I want to

730
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
I want to

731
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I want to

732
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
You and I

733
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
have our own ways

734
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
In this house

735
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I only take care of

736
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
a good wife

737
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
I don't have the right

738
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
to do anything else

739
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Have you been to the Du Chanyuan?

740
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Yes

741
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
The Du Chanyuan is a three-year-old house

742
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
It's a small house

743
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
and it's not a big house

744
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
I don't have any money

745
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I don't have any money

746
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Did you live in Uncle Yunwen's house?

747
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,600
So I went to the market with Mu Feng and Mu Yan

748
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,600
I didn't find the opportunity to talk about the marriage

749
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Since that

750
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I can only make a mistake

751
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Then how do you make a mistake?

752
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
I've figured it out

753
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
If you want to be a daughter of the capital city

754
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,600
you must be a high-ranking official

755
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
and a scholar

756
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Do you know

757
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,600
who is the first daughter of the capital city?

758
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Miao Guifei

759
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Yes

760
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
If I can be his daughter

761
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
and be his daughter

762
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
then I can be

763
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
a good wife in the capital city

764
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
It's good that you are a good wife

765
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
and you are a good wife

766
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
I can do anything

767
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Don't burn it

768
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600
He and your mother are my enemies

769
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Do you still want to thank him?

770
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
What about the enemies?

771
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
In this world

772
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
there is no eternal enemy

773
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
As long as there is interest

774
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
you can be a good wife

775
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
After the banquet

776
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
there is a rumor in the capital

777
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Miao Guifei seems to have some trouble

778
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,600
I want you to investigate this matter

779
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
You really want to burn this soul water?

780
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Even if it's bitter

781
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
and it's not water

782
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
I will burn it

783
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Young Madam

784
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
What?

785
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
There is some bad rumor

786
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
about you in the capital city

787
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,600
I'm afraid that you have heard it

788
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,600
What rumor?

789
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Really?

790
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
The day before yesterday

791
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
I went to Young Madam's room to exchange the passive

792
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
I saw it personally

793
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
I saw that Young Madam is a woman

794
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Did you see it wrong?

795
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I didn't see it

796
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
There is no red on the white bed

797
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
I can't see it

798
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
You can't believe it

799
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
What you two said is true

800
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
The rumors are spread in the capital city

801
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
If I didn't meet them

802
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
I would have been in trouble

803
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Sister, don't panic

804
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
I'll ask him personally

805
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
when Han Yan comes

806
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Mother

807
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Han Yan

808
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Sit down and talk

809
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Sister, you can't pull your face down

810
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I'll ask him

811
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Han Yan

812
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
I'll ask you one thing

813
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Before you married into the family

814
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
you still have a son

815
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
I don't know what I did wrong

816
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,600
I have to suffer such a humiliation

817
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Please explain

818
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
You don't have to take me as your shield

819
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I'll ask you

820
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
You can answer me

821
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Han Yan

822
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Never give up

823
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Of course it's a clear day

824
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Okay

825
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
I'll ask you again

826
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Since you are a white god

827
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,600
why don't you see the red on the wedding night?

828
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Forget it

829
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Han Yan said he is a white man

830
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm sure he won't be married

831
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Sister, you are so stupid

832
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
How can you recognize such a thing?

833
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
It's about our family's door

834
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Why don't we find a woman

835
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
and ask her for a word?

836
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
It's not right

837
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
What's wrong?

838
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Madam

839
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
This is...

840
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Mr. Tan

841
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Mother

842
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
This is the doctor in the palace

843
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Mr. Tan Yun Xian

844
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
I've seen you

845
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Mr. Tan

846
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Mr. Tan, please sit down

847
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Please have a seat

848
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,600
I heard you are a good doctor

849
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I wonder what's the reason for you to come to the mansion today?

850
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Mother

851
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
I've heard from the mansion

852
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
I've heard from you

853
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
so I've invited you here

854
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm a good person

855
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
I'm not a good person

856
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm just kidding

857
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
What did you say?

858
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I don't dare to say the truth

859
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
But I've never been a good person

860
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
in the man and woman's room

861
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Sister

862
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Mr. Tan is a good person

863
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
He must be very smart

864
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Why don't we ask Mr. Tan

865
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
to have a night for you?

866
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
If you are innocent

867
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Of course

868
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
no one else will suspect you

869
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm a young lady

870
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
After the checkup

871
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
I said she is innocent

872
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
You can say

873
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
we have already made a deal

874
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
to call her innocent

875
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
But she is still in the house

876
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
and is still in a bad mood

877
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,600
If I say that you are not a good person

878
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
then you will be in trouble

879
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
You can drive her out of the house

880
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I can guess it

881
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Mr. Tan

882
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
You really blame me

883
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
You are a good doctor

884
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
You must be a good person

885
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
If I am a good person

886
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
I will be a good lady

887
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Today

888
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
you just need to rest

889
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
and have a night for Mrs. Tan

890
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
No matter what the result is

891
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
I will be a good doctor

892
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Then I dare to ask you

893
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Are you a stupid person?

894
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Of course not

895
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Our Mrs. Tan

896
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
is very clever

897
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
How can she be a stupid person?

898
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,600
The ordinary people know me

899
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
If I want to pretend to be a good person

900
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
I will be in a wedding night

901
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,600
with a white cloth

902
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
and a bright light

903
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
I will not think of this

904
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
with Mrs. Shao's intelligence

905
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Since it is not so

906
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
it means that Mrs. Shao

907
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
is a good person

908
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
who is a good person

909
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
and is a good person

910
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Mr. Tan, you are right

911
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
The world is so beautiful

912
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
People often think

913
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
without a reason

914
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
But you never think about it

915
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
It is the night in the forest

916
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Shao Nan finds two

917
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
same things

918
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Moreover

919
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
there are thousands of women

920
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
in this world

921
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
They are not the same

922
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
When the night is out

923
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
women are really

924
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
a good person

925
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
I have never

926
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
thought about how many women

927
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
are wronged

928
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Guifu is a family

929
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
with a good family

930
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
and a good husband

931
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
God is good

932
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
I wish you a good life

933
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Mr. Tan, you are right

934
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I was confused

935
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
and made Han Yan feel wronged

936
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Mother, don't blame yourself

937
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Han Yan has never

938
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
put this thing in his heart

939
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
That's good

940
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,600
This matter is over

941
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
I am not disturbing

942
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
I will take my leave

943
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Mr. Tan, please

944
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Mr. Tan

945
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I will send you

946
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Please run

947
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
It's okay

948
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,600
How is the leg of the hall?

949
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
Is there any secret medicine?

950
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Mother, she is fine

951
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Please take care of Mr. Tan

952
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Thank you

953
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
for letting her stand on the wheel

954
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
This matter is for her

955
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
It's no use

956
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
to fight

957
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
It's just a matter of holding hands

958
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Don't worry

959
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
By the way, is it

960
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
a problem

961
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
for Noble Consort?

962
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
This matter is very serious

963
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
I really

964
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
dare not say anything

965
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Goodbye

966
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Mr. Tan, take care

967
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Please

968
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Is there any progress?

969
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Take a look at this

970
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
What is this?

971
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
The Empress of Dexia

972
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
gave birth to this letter

973
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
To return the 20th memorial of the princess

974
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
in the palace

975
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Someone has overestimated the number of people

976
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
and has been spreading it in the capital

977
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
to the palace to meet the Noble Consort

978
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Why?

979
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
The crown prince died in the Eastern Palace

980
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
The Empress died because of the illness

981
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
After the Noble Consort was returned to the palace

982
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
she insisted on taking the crown prince

983
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
as her son

984
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
She was so heartless

985
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,600
She was so upset

986
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
that someone wanted to kill her

987
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
She was so anxious

988
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
and couldn't resist

989
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
So she gave birth to this letter

990
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
and secretly sent a letter to the palace

991
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,600
to make her live up to the news

992
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
They are

993
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
afraid that the Empress will be in a hurry

994
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
If she is in the cold

995
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,600
Noble Consort Miao will take this opportunity

996
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,600
to control the court

997
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Yes, the new court

998
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
has five officials

999
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
who have been sent to the palace

1000
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
to send the letter to the palace

1001
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
I'm afraid that it will be the last

1002
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
of the Noble Consort Miao's death

1003
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Noble Consort Miao is in great danger

1004
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
She is in a difficult position

1005
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
Do you still want to betray her?

1006
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
No

1007
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,600
If she is in the palace

1008
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
how can she be so proud of her?

1009
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
These ancient officials

1010
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
are talking about Noble Consort Miao

1011
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
They are the first to be eliminated

1012
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
But you and I

1013
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
are the ones who have broken the rule

1014
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
If we can break them

1015
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
then Noble Consort Miao

1016
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
can be in danger

1017
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
If she can return to the palace

1018
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
and re-establish the whole world

1019
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,600
and keep the order

1020
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
then we can

1021
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
take down the protective suit of Zhuang Shiyang

1022
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
and continue to investigate

1023
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
and punish her

1024
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,600
as soon as possible

1025
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Even if you save her

1026
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
will you be willing to help her?

1027
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Do you want to help her?

1028
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
As long as I enter the palace

1029
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
then I will be able to do it

1030
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
If you delay the rule of the state

1031
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
then you will be able to complete the rule

1032
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
without any delay

1033
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,600
Fu Yunxi

1034
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
When did you become the guard of this place?

1035
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
When Zhuang Shiyang burned down

1036
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,600
and made a big mistake

1037
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
he thought he would not be able to complete the rule

1038
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
Now that he has made the rule

1039
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,600
he wants to make the rule

1040
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,600
I want to make the rule too

1041
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,600
then I will make a big one

1042
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Otherwise

1043
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
what will happen?

1044
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
I didn't see you wrong

1045
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
What do you mean?

1046
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,600
The carriage is ready

1047
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Can you come with me?

1048
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,600
The daughter of the emperor

1049
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,600
is married to Deng

1050
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Deng is a merchant

1051
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
and the wife is a carpenter

1052
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Deng is a doctor

1053
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
and the wife is a carpenter

1054
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,600
and the wife is a carpenter

1055
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
and the wife is a carpenter

1056
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,600
Deng is a prince

1057
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,600
and Deng is a carpenter

1058
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
and has been a guard for many years

1059
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
The emperor and the court are very well-behaved

1060
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,600
and have a lot of respect

1061
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
This is the joy of the royal family

1062
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
Deng is a carpenter

1063
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,600
and has a lot of respect

1064
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,600
Deng is a carpenter

1065
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,600
and has a lot of respect

1066
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Thank you, Your Majesty

1067
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
So?

1068
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
The five ministers of the palace

1069
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
are very secretive

1070
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,600
and have no one to know

1071
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
I can only find out one of them

1072
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,600
It is also a old man

1073
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
Deng is the one

1074
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,600
You want to take this opportunity

1075
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
to visit the palace tonight

1076
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
and get a secret letter

1077
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,600
What secret letter?

1078
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
You have to have a treasure

1079
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
to report to the government

1080
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
Tonight, there will be a person

1081
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
who will send the letter to the government

1082
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
to let Deng be the emperor

1083
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,600
The letter to the government is a list

1084
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,600
and a treasure

1085
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
You have already planned it

1086
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Since you promised to be your

1087
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,600
rank and rank judge

1088
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
you must fulfill your promise

1089
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
But these five ministers

1090
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
are very secretive

1091
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
We have to find out

1092
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
what they will do

1093
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
and what they will do

1094
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
until they are done

1095
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,600
The emperor and the government

1096
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,600
are very secretive

1097
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
Do you dare?

1098
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Why not?

1099
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,600
I don't know

1100
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
I don't know

1101
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
I don't know
