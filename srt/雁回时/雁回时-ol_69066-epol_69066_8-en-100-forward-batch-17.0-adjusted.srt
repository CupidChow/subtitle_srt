00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,100
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,590
Zhuang Hanyan.

4
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,680
(Scholarly Glory)

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,710
It's only been a few days,

6
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,760
and now you're acting
all virtuous and graceful.

7
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,120
This is...

8
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,230
Greetings, gentlemen.

9
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
I am Yang Ping,

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,510
a scholar from Nanzhang Town
in Danzhou.

11
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,950
I live next door
to Mr. Zhang Youchang and his wife,

12
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,000
and have long been acquainted
with Miss Hanyan.

13
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,230
Forgive me.

14
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,240
I didn't notice you earlier, Mr. Yang.

15
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,560
But if I recall,
you failed the provincial exams.

16
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,120
What brings you to the Capital?

17
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,000
I came with fellow townsmen

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,150
to broaden my horizons.

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,150
What's it to you?

20
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Of course, it doesn't.

21
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
It's been a while.

22
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,960
Here's a toast to you.

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
I wouldn't dare.

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,190
Miss Hanyan, please keep your distance.

25
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,360
I fear you might
bite my other ear as well.

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,870
What do you mean?

27
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,080
Mr. Zhuang, haven't you heard?

28
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,630
Miss Hanyan was truly remarkable

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,120
back in Danzhou.

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Biting off ears was nothing for her.

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,910
Stealing from the neighbors

32
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,630
and beating up children was also her doing.

33
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,280
She's known as the wild and unruly girl.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,960
When I saw her just now,

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,220
I didn't dare to recognize her.

36
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,150
How come she's changed completely

37
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,680
since coming to the Capital?

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,000
She's even acting like a proper lady now.

39
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,030
Not just in Danzhou,

40
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,190
she was domineering even in our household.

41
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,750
What an embarrassment.

42
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,030
Look at her now.

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
Only when leaving the house,

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,190
does she act so pretentious.

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Yuchi.

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,280
Mr. Yang, is there some misunderstanding?

47
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,120
- Hanyan is…
- No misunderstanding.

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,520
Everything he said is true.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,710
Beating up children?

50
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,150
That was giving back what I got.

51
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,000
Stealing from the neighbors?

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,680
That was reclaiming my jewelry
after it was taken,

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
with nowhere to seek justice.

54
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,960
In a fit of rage,

55
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,590
I bit off half your ear.

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,310
Was it not because you called me
the Barefoot Ghost,

57
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,120
stole my shoes and socks,

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,030
and forced me to walk barefoot
on thorns and brambles

59
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,910
until my feet bled for your amusement?

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
I only fought back in desperation.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,080
You've studied classics since childhood,

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,800
yet you took delight
in tormenting a helpless girl

63
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
without even the slightest sense of shame.

64
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,840
Still sharp-tongued as ever.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,360
I was raised in the rural lands of Danzhou,

66
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,680
lacking proper manners and refinement.

67
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,890
But the Zhuang family is strict and upright,

68
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,270
and Father is strict
in disciplining his children.

69
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,560
I've been home but two short months,

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,680
yet under my father's guidance,

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
I've worked hard to shed my old habits,

72
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,830
lest I bring shame upon my parents.

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,300
The ancients said, "A gentleman,
even when parting ways, does not speak ill."

74
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,070
Yet when you saw me today,

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,950
you cast aside propriety

76
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,600
and humiliate me over past grievances.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,630
Who would dare befriend you after this?

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,470
You…

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,510
Mr. Yang.

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
This is a joyful gathering.

81
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,360
Let's not dampen the mood.

82
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,680
Hurry back and enjoy your meal.

83
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,040
Mr. Zhuang, with such a daughter,

84
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,680
your home may soon know no peace.

85
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,470
How insolent.

86
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,020
Ms. Zhou,

87
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,300
why did you choose to ride
in the same carriage with me?

88
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,660
For the incident at the banquet,

89
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,020
thank you for stepping up

90
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,180
and saving our family from disgrace.

91
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,220
I'm deeply grateful.

92
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,980
Naturally, I must properly thank you.

93
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,380
No need for the courtesy.

94
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,420
We are family. Don't mention it.

95
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,020
You've suffered injustice today.

96
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,340
Back in Danzhou,

97
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,050
your foster parents should've protected you.

98
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,980
How could they allow that scoundrel

99
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,300
to humiliate you so?

100
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,100
Foster parents have cared for me tirelessly.

101
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,740
I don't want to worry them anymore.

102
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,140
You've always been so thoughtful and caring.

103
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,060
Unlike my two little troublemakers.

104
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,580
The household matters are many,

105
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,020
and it's my first time managing them,

106
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,420
so there are bound to be lapses.

107
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,380
Miss Hanyan, please assist me
whenever you can.

108
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,620
This is all for the sake of our dignity.

109
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,620
You handle everything with care.

110
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,140
There is no need for me to worry.

111
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,660
It's just that during today's banquet,

112
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,020
Yuchi claimed he's confident
about tomorrow's test.

113
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,660
All the elders are to see his fine work.

114
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,980
You may need to remind him to stay focused.

115
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,020
If he falters, and Father is shamed,

116
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,380
I fear Father's anger may turn on you,

117
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,220
blaming you for poor upbringing.

118
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,980
Thank you for your advice, Miss Hanyan.

119
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,340
This spot is indeed secluded.

120
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,300
Is it convenient for you to live here?

121
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,020
I'm fine.

122
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,700
Why are you here?

123
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,580
Do you remember Yang Ping?

124
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,900
The one whose ear you bit off?

125
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,700
He's in the Capital.

126
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,780
He's staying at the Yinan Guild Hall.

127
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,100
I never expected

128
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,740
I'd run into that scoundrel again.

129
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,100
What's he doing here?

130
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,540
It's likely Ms. Zhou's doing.

131
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,820
Zhou Ruyin?

132
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,820
She sent someone to Danzhou?

133
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,460
I'm just speculating.

134
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,540
Since she already sees me as a rival,

135
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,940
she'd want to know her enemy.

136
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,340
I don't know what other tricks
she has up her sleeve.

137
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Yang Ping has held a grudge for years,

138
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
and he is a threat.

139
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,940
Should we get rid of him first?

140
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,140
Fu Yunxi is watching you.
Don't act recklessly.

141
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,260
But right now, there's another matter.

142
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,860
Today's incident was just an appetizer.

143
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,940
Maybe we don't have to start with the key.

144
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,380
If we aim to bring them down completely

145
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,700
and seize the power in their hands,

146
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,980
we must address the root cause.

147
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,860
That country girl

148
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,620
puts on the airs of a noble lady,

149
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,660
flaunting her pathetic literary skills.

150
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,260
Now she managed to win Father's favor.

151
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,380
Because of her, I'm stuck here studying.

152
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,500
You're acquainted with the frivolous.

153
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,180
Why not spread the word about our

154
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,780
Miss Hanyan?

155
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,940
Find her a husband and marry her off.

156
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,660
Then, she'll stop attracting trouble

157
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,020
and clinging to Yunxi.

158
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,060
Dear sister,

159
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,740
that's not hard at all.

160
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,340
Other girls are flawless,

161
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,580
even under a magnifying glass.

162
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,020
I told you to watch your brother study,

163
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,820
but you're gossiping here.

164
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,300
My sister doesn't know poetry or literature.

165
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,100
Having her watch over me is useless.

166
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,060
If you had any talent,

167
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,140
Mom wouldn't have sent me here.

168
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,260
Enough.

169
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,900
I've started managing.

170
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,860
The slightest mistake could
be used against me.

171
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,380
The last thing we need is more trouble.

172
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,020
You troublemakers had better shape up!

173
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,940
Shape up.

174
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,140
(Analects, Volume 15)

175
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,620
Regarding tomorrow's test,

176
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,500
are you fully prepared?

177
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,180
Yuchi, sit down.

178
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,300
Here.

179
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,300
Read this passage.

180
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,900
Made him leader of all the princes,

181
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,780
and brought order to the world.

182
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,070
To this day,
people benefit from his gifts.

183
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,580
But for Guan Zhong, we might now

184
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,460
be folding our robes to the left.

185
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,780
What does "brought order to the world" mean?

186
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,740
Mom, why are you suddenly asking this?

187
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,380
Mom,

188
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,060
could it be in tomorrow's test?

189
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,820
You don't need to excel in tomorrow's test,

190
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,860
just handle it calmly and steadily.

191
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't disgrace the Zhuang family again,

192
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,820
and don't make your father angry.

193
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,180
Today,

194
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,980
you must not step out of this room.

195
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,630
Work on that phrase

196
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,380
and burn it into your brain.

197
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,680
No more questions.

198
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,580
Yes.

199
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,520
I won't embarrass you, Mom.

200
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,100
Even with this question in hand,

201
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
you still wouldn't know how to answer it.

202
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,340
You always understand me.

203
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,940
If you want my help,

204
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,380
say something nice.

205
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,220
Dear sister.

206
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,140
Dear sister, come on.

207
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,140
Sit.

208
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,620
I'll handle Zhuang Hanyan for you,

209
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,580
just help me one this time.

210
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,420
Deal.

211
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Do you have a plan?

212
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,420
Of course.

213
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,940
Zhuang Hanyan's demeanor.

214
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,380
I can manage that too.

215
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,300
Awesome.

216
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,900
(Yinan Guild Hall)

217
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,700
(Everlasting Glory, Eternal as Sun and Moon)

218
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,140
Mr. He, you're studying hard.

219
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,860
Have some tea and snacks.

220
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,940
You must be Miss Zhuang Yushan.

221
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,690
I dare not trouble you.

222
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,160
A meeting this late might be…

223
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,920
I heard your grandfather
once passed the imperial exam.

224
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,600
You're from a noble family, too.

225
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,020
Grandfather earned the title
in his twenties.

226
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,460
My father is a county-level scholar.

227
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,500
Now, he barely manages to support the family.

228
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,980
Miss Yushan, what brings you here?

229
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,100
When I read earlier today,

230
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,340
I came across a sentence in the Analects

231
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,900
that I couldn't quite grasp.

232
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,420
Word has it

233
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,660
that among the scholars from Yinan,

234
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,460
you're the most gifted in literature.

235
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,040
(Brought order to the world)
I was hoping you could enlighten me.

236
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,540
You flatter me.

237
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,820
(Brought order to the world)

238
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,220
So it's this sentence.

239
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,740
It's also in Cao Cao's

240
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,580
"Short Song Ballad".

241
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,780
"His achievements top the hegemons.

242
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,540
He united the lords
and brought order to the world."

243
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,940
That phrase means…

244
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Wait a moment.

245
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,700
I have no extraordinary memory skills.

246
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,540
Could you, perhaps, put your insights

247
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,040
into an essay so that I may take it back

248
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,860
and study it in detail?

249
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,580
Alright.

250
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,060
Many thanks, Mr. He.

251
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,140
By the way, at today's banquet,

252
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,580
Miss Hanyan was…

253
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,860
What about her?

254
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,220
I…

255
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,420
Nothing.

256
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,740
Miss Hanyan is quite talented.

257
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,060
If you have any questions,

258
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,540
it's more convenient to ask her.

259
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,980
Are you unwilling

260
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,540
to enlighten me?

261
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,660
No.

262
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,660
I'll start writing now.

263
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,020
(Brought order to the world)

264
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,380
(Yinan Guild Hall)

265
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,540
How did it go?

266
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,580
Like fish in a barrel.

267
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,420
Let me see.

268
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,580
I don't quite understand his essay.

269
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,340
You'd better read through it carefully.

270
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,440
No mistakes allowed.

271
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,540
Yes.

272
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,560
Thank you, sister.

273
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,780
If there's no issue,

274
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,060
it's best to memorize it all.

275
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,020
If someone asks about it someday,

276
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,340
make sure you can answer.

277
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,340
I'll surely do well on the test.

278
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,660
Let's go.

279
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,230
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

280
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,380
- Greetings.
- Good day.

281
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,350
Please, come inside.

282
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,220
Father.

283
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,780
Your son is truly outstanding.

284
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,860
He must have inherited your wisdom.

285
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,460
You flatter me.

286
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Greetings, gentlemen.

287
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,180
Greetings, gentlemen.

288
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,100
I appreciate your efforts.

289
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,460
The hour has come.

290
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,660
Test begins.

291
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,360
(Test One, Guan Zhong served
and brought order to the world.)

292
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,780
(The Emperor)

293
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,340
Sir.

294
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,860
May I withdraw

295
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,260
from this test?

296
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,340
Why is that, Scholar He?

297
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,460
While casually reading last night,

298
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,900
I came across an essay on this topic.

299
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
If I simply replicate it now,

300
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,900
it'd be the same as cheating.

301
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,700
Scholar He, you are upholding integrity.

302
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,980
I deeply admire that.

303
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,980
This is a small test among our Yinan peers

304
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,940
for our own enjoyment.

305
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,220
If you wish to withdraw, you may do so.

306
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,020
Thank you.

307
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,220
(to bring order to the world)

308
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,420
Your son indeed has the talent
of a top scholar.

309
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,060
This topic is drawn
from "The Analects: Xian Wen."

310
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,100
(Virtue and Vice)
It refer to Confucius' praise of Guan Zhong,

311
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,260
meant to assess one's
understanding of humanity.

312
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,060
Mr. Zhuang's essay,

313
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,540
has a polished beginning,

314
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,900
cites classical references in the middle,

315
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,170
and ends seamlessly as one cohesive piece.

316
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,190
Truly a masterpiece.

317
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,180
- A masterpiece.
- Indeed.

318
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,700
My son happened to catch the timing.

319
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,060
It's nothing remarkable.

320
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,540
Mr. Zhuang, you are too modest.

321
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

322
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,030
Kneel!

323
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,300
Kneel.

324
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,300
Recite the original line from The Analects

325
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,080
that mentions bringing order to the world.

326
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,100
Father, why do you ask this?

327
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,160
The Master said, "Guan Zhong acted
as prime minister to Duke Huan,

328
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,000
made him leader of all the princes
and brought order to the world.

329
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,900
To this day,
people benefit from his gifts.

330
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,580
You can't even remember the original text.

331
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,500
How can you write such a compelling article?

332
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,620
Father is well-read and is renowned

333
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,780
for your incredible memory.

334
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,260
But I was not blessed with the same gift.

335
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,380
Then repeat what I just said.

336
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,590
Confucius said…

337
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,340
Said...

338
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,580
This is the son you've raised.

339
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,580
Master, this is my fault.

340
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,460
Yuchi lacks a quick mind,

341
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,420
so I had him prepare in advance

342
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,300
to uphold your honor.

343
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,820
What do you mean?

344
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,500
I...

345
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,540
I caught a glimpse

346
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,540
of the question in your study.

347
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,980
So I told Yuchi in private.

348
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,140
You...

349
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,020
Did you write this essay yourself?

350
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,620
"A ruler must possess
the virtue of governance,

351
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,830
thus, the gentleman
will choose to serve him."

352
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,050
Yes, Father, I wrote it.

353
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,340
Even if the question was known beforehand,

354
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,220
producing such a work
is quite an achievement.

355
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,700
Ruyin, you're Yuchi's mother

356
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,660
and in charge of household affairs.

357
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,100
You should not have resorted to such act.

358
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,620
Master, it is entirely my fault.

359
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,220
Please punish me.

360
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,660
Forget it.

361
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,540
A few words of praise today mean little.

362
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,740
Once the Spring Exam comes,

363
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,780
the truth will be revealed.

364
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,380
Let's take it one step at a time.

365
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,580
Master, is there anything in this essay

366
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,460
that might cause trouble?

367
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,620
Only the three examiners have seen it.

368
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,460
I've already filed it away.

369
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,580
Do not let word spread.

370
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,460
If anyone praises or flatters you,

371
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,300
remember to remain humble.

372
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,980
Just say it was a coincidence.

373
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,240
Do you understand?

374
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,100
Understood.

375
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,700
Rest assured, Master.

376
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,380
I will make sure to guide Yuchi properly.

377
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,180
Yuchi, tell me the truth.

378
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,020
The examiner said the essay
has the makings of a top scholar.

379
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,840
But you've only studied for a few days.

380
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,260
How could you write
something of such quality?

381
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,300
Why? Are you unhappy

382
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,780
that I'm talented?

383
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,860
In your eyes,

384
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,300
am I nothing but a useless fool?

385
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,660
Sister.

386
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,820
Look at you.

387
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,380
(Nurturing Grace)

388
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,220
Mr. You.

389
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,660
Bottom up.

390
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,500
Cheers.

391
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,020
To be honest,

392
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,860
Miss Hanyan is more stunning
than the actresses

393
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,290
(You Yong)
of the Music Institution.

394
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,780
When can I visit her in person?

395
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,860
Leave it to me.

396
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,780
Mr. You, if you're interested,

397
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,260
you can visit anytime.

398
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,160
Deal.

399
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,100
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

400
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,420
You've been stealing the light these days.

401
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,220
I heard your essay

402
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,380
was highly praised recently.

403
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,900
Tell me, what exactly did you write?

404
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,060
Come on. Share it with us.

405
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,780
Young Master Yuchi,

406
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,020
I heard your essay is comparable

407
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,340
to "Ode to the Three Capitals."

408
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,140
How did you approach the topic?
Could you share?

409
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Please.

410
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,300
Tell them.

411
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,460
Just humble work.

412
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,820
- So modest.
- You're too humble.

413
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,180
They say the scholars of Yinan
are unmatched.

414
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,540
And upon meeting today, I see
there are always

415
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,860
mightier men.

416
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,100
Well said.

417
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,820
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

418
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,660
Please.

419
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,820
Join us at the table.

420
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,860
Alright.

421
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,700
- Please.
- Please.

422
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,020
Mr. Zhuang comes from a scholarly family.

423
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,380
We are truly humbled in comparison.

424
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,220
My father serves in the Hanlin Academy.

425
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,420
He personally taught me.

426
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,340
I have mastered all the classics.

427
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,180
That's a true scholarly family.

428
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,180
Indeed.

429
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,020
Mr. Zhuang,

430
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,740
why not seize the moment today

431
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,220
and emulate the ancients?

432
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,460
Recite a few lines from your essay,

433
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,580
then join the songstress in harmony.

434
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,980
Let us all learn.

435
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,820
Excellent suggestion.

436
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,980
Recite for us.

437
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,250
- Alright.
- Share a few lines.

438
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,180
Here we go.

439
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,980
A ruler must possess
the virtue of governance,

440
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,820
thus, the gentleman…

441
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,260
The gentleman.

442
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,600
Thus, the gentleman
will choose to serve him.

443
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,660
Serve him.

444
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,040
Mr. Zhuang, have you forgotten?

445
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,180
You forgotten?

446
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,050
No, I haven't.

447
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,320
I haven't.

448
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,020
The next line is "Gentleman."

449
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,740
Gentleman…

450
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,740
A gentleman values fairness and virtue.

451
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,100
Haven't you all not seen it?

452
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,180
How would you know?

453
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,140
I haven't seen it. Have you?

454
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,140
Let's have a drink.

455
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,980
Let's drink.

456
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,420
Full of talk about sages, reeking of alcohol.

457
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,110
How can one write like this?

458
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,620
Who's causing a ruckus here?

459
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,320
Who are you?

460
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,900
- Let's check it out.
- Let's go.

461
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,740
Let's go.

462
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,500
Mr. Zhuang, such vile men must be punished.

463
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,620
Please.

464
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,740
Go take a look.

465
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,060
Yes.

466
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,940
Who are you?

467
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,700
Where did you come from?

468
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,220
Showing off before the son
of a Junior Compiler?

469
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,180
Exactly.

470
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,620
A gentleman

471
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,220
must seek wisdom

472
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,130
from the great emperors,

473
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,540
governing with virtue

474
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,860
and using law as the last resort.

475
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,820
If Confucius knew a scholar like you,

476
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,060
he'd die of shame!

477
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,140
What nonsense!

478
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,460
That quote was from your essay.

479
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,260
You don't even recognize your own words?

480
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,700
I don't need to.

481
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,020
Exactly.

482
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,540
Memorize it all you want.

483
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
That's right.

484
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,460
It seems you hardly live up to your name.

485
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,610
Just an empty reputation.

486
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,460
Not worth my time.

487
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,570
- Let's go.
- Go.

488
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Who are you?

489
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,540
Utter foolishness.

490
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,020
Mr. Zhuang, he's not worth your attention.

491
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,860
Let's go up and drink.

492
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,340
- Ignore him.
- Drink up.

493
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,580
Seems Young Master Zhuang

494
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,660
is about to cause trouble again.

495
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,620
Mr. Zhuang's essay…

496
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,220
Zhuang Hanyan.

497
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,500
What a coincidence.

498
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,580
Mr. You, come here.

499
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,340
It must be fate.

500
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,820
Isn't the one you seek right here?

501
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,820
Greetings, Miss Zhuang Hanyan.

502
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,660
That's right.

503
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,420
I am You Yong.

504
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,100
It seems fate has brought us together.

505
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,980
I just heard…

506
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,320
Mr. You.

507
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,620
Be careful.

508
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,360
Watch your step.

509
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,840
Are you alright?

510
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,540
Zhuang Hanyan,

511
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,980
apologize to your future husband.

512
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,140
Yuchi, this is a public setting.

513
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,500
I advise you to restrain yourself.

514
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,740
Don't disgrace your own family.

515
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,740
Zhuang Hanyan,

516
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,860
don't be ungrateful.

517
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,060
Mr. You,

518
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,980
tonight, I shall decide for her.

519
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,700
She will be betrothed to you.

520
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,190
Prepare a fine guest room.

521
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,030
Go.

522
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,460
- They'll consummates the marriage tonight.
- Yes.

523
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,420
It's too fast.

524
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,500
Congrats, Mr. You.

525
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Congratulations.

526
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,220
Zhuang Hanyan.

527
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,300
Did I say you could leave?

528
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
From the Judicial Review?

529
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,900
Why are you here?

530
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,540
Miss Hanyan, Mr. Fu summons you.

531
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,500
We'll find another chance.

532
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,620
Miss Hanyan, what an elegant evening.

533
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,380
Drinking alone?

534
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,340
Aren't you the same?

535
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,220
We're tracking a female bandit.

536
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,540
It's said she appeared at Chaling Tavern.

537
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,060
Miss Hanyan's fish took the bait tonight.

538
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,780
But mine hasn't yet.

539
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,180
Fishing always requires bait.

540
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,460
What bait are you using?

541
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,740
Isn't she sitting right in front of me?

542
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,180
She's got excellent sword skills.

543
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,420
I'd actually like to spar with her again.

544
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,340
Must you force me this way?

545
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,020
Miss Hanyan, what do you mean?

546
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,980
Could it be that you know that bandit?

547
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,020
I don't know her.

548
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,620
What is her background?

549
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,040
How long have you known her,
and what's your relationship?

550
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

551
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,920
Since you arrived in the Capital,

552
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,300
I've helped you multiple times.

553
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,900
Yet you still don't trust me.

554
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,220
Please forgive me,

555
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,980
I don't know

556
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,060
what exactly you want me to say.

557
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Your guard is impressive.

558
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,220
In the Capital, fewer words
mean fewer troubles.

559
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,540
A fish keeps its mouth shut

560
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,100
is often harder to catch with a hook.

561
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,300
If there's nothing else,

562
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,220
I'll take my leave.

563
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
What are you doing?

564
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,460
If I were to kill you right now,

565
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,460
do you think she would show herself?

566
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,900
Even the vice minister of Judicial Review

567
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,660
cannot take lives so recklessly.

568
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,580
Not if it's a commoner.

569
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,660
But if it's a bandit criminal,

570
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,860
then it's simply execution before reporting.

571
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,500
Finally took the bait.

572
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,220
Run. He's tricking you.

573
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,780
Who are you, really?

574
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,820
Speak.

575
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,020
Let her go.

576
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,860
Run.

577
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,180
Zhuang Hanyan,

578
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,400
this is the second time
you tried to kill me.

579
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,580
I thought you were just a sly fox.

580
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Turns out, wolves hunt in pairs.

581
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,780
You forced me to do this.

582
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,380
Mr. Gao.

583
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,220
Mr. Gao, please.

584
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,060
This way, please.

585
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,570
This way.

586
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,420
Mr. Gao, please.

587
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,660
Serve the dishes.

588
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,620
Yes, sir.

589
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,900
Mr. Gao, any news
from the Ministry of Punishments?

590
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,420
Though the Three Judicial Offices
are working together

591
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,480
to eradicate the remnants
of Pei's faction,

592
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,460
but all power lies
within the Judicial Review.

593
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,220
The Ministry of Punishments
is merely a group of errand boys.

594
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,020
There are rumors that Pei Dafu
had an adopted son

595
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,780
still hiding in the Capital.

596
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,420
Are you aware of that?

597
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,660
Two years ago, Pei Dafu held a banquet.

598
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,780
I happened to catch a glimpse
of his adopted son.

599
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,780
The man stood nine feet tall,
with a face full of bristling whiskers.

600
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,140
When he spoke,

601
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,980
his voice rolled like thunder.

602
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,600
It was truly awe-inspiring.

603
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,580
You really saw him?

604
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,500
Why would I lie?

605
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Here.

606
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,260
Mr. Gao.

607
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,660
What do you want?

608
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,960
Miss Hanyan is smart and resourceful.

609
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,660
Why don't you take a guess?

610
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,460
The most frequented

611
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,500
Chaling Tavern of capital officials

612
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,780
hides a secret chamber.

613
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,060
If you push me any further,

614
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,020
I'll spread the word

615
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,260
about what I saw and heard.

616
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,560
Chaling Tavern will never
get customers again.

617
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,740
As for the adopted son they mentioned,

618
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,580
I will reveal that as well.

619
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,940
Miss Hanyan,

620
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,860
play with fire, and you might get burned.

621
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,940
Play with fire?

622
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,780
I am the fire.

623
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,460
Sir.

624
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,980
Those two at Hongyun Hall.

625
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,280
Their words are hard to discern.

626
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,420
Bring them back for interrogation.

627
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,820
Yes, I will handle it at once.

628
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,130
I won't interrupt your fine evening
with Miss Hanyan.

629
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,100
Cut it out.

630
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,900
Sir, about that other matter.

631
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,260
Are we going to proceed?

632
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,100
Get lost.

633
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,580
What is the matter?

634
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,220
Does it concern me?

635
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,900
Miss Hanyan,

636
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,620
the case of the adopted son is critical.

637
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,460
If you're interested,

638
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,420
why not join the Judicial Review?

639
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,060
We have secret informants
across the capital.

640
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,660
As you saw tonight,

641
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,180
Chaling Tavern is part of our property.

642
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,140
If you're willing to work as one,

643
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,380
I'll ensure you're well compensated.

644
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,260
I'm not capable of such things.

645
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,260
Just use a fraction of the skills you have

646
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,460
to deal with Zhuang Yuchi.

647
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,420
Yuchi and I are bound by blood.

648
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,660
Why would I go against him?

649
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,060
What about those instigators earlier?

650
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,580
Weren't they hired by you?

651
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,180
I only just arrived in the Capital.

652
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,100
I just wanted to see the bustling taverns.

653
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,980
How could I know anyone?

654
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,180
Where is she?

655
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,540
She's here.

656
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,340
Here she is.

657
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,540
Miss, we finally found you.

658
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,460
We thought

659
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,780
you ran off.

660
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,660
Indeed.

661
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,260
Everything you asked for is done,

662
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,300
but there's still half the payment left.

663
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,500
- Right.
- Right.

664
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,580
Take the silver and leave quickly.

665
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,180
- Thank you.
- Much appreciated.

666
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,100
- Let's go.
- Call us next time.

667
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,260
Back to drinking now.

668
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,780
You two put on quite a show.

669
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,860
Your double act

670
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,580
is more entertaining than the opera.

671
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,420
It's getting late. I'll be going now.

672
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,140
We should stay out of each other's way
from now on.

673
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,540
Take care, Miss Hanyan.

674
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,540
Does it hurt?

675
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,540
Nothing serious.

676
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,900
You were too reckless.

677
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,980
He wouldn't actually kill me.

678
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,820
Why did you have to fight him?

679
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,500
His mind is as deep as a pool.

680
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,340
It's unfathomable.

681
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,980
Never trust him easily.

682
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,100
He may not want to arrest you.

683
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,220
Moreover, today,

684
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,740
I've also found a handle against him.

685
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,220
In recent days, he may not dare act rashly.

686
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,900
Be careful not to anger him.

687
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,460
Don't worry.

688
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,300
However,

689
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,740
his subordinates mentioned
one unfinished task.

690
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,420
Their words seem to involve me in some way.

691
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,980
Leave me alone.

692
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,300
Mr. You,

693
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,140
does your grandfather know

694
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,300
you're indulging in pleasure
and neglecting your duties?

695
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,500
Mind your own business.

696
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,380
Who are you, anyway?

697
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,260
I'm passing along a message.

698
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,220
Stay away from Miss Zhuang Hanyan.

699
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,660
Don't think about pursuing her.

700
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,860
Well, I'm telling you now.

701
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,990
I will have

702
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,040
any woman I fancy.

703
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,060
Just watch me.

704
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,340
Help.

705
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,380
I can't swim.

706
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,020
The water's shallow.

707
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,820
You won't drown.

708
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,660
Help.

709
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,660
Hello?

710
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,020
Is anyone there?

711
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,780
Get me out.

712
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,380
Hurry.

713
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,380
Don't let him escape.

714
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Stop him.

715
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,620
How is he?

716
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,300
He's drunk.

717
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,580
He spilled alcohol on me. Disgusting.

718
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,500
That was a personal matter for you.

719
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,320
It can't be counted in the stipend.

720
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,660
(Hanlin Academy)

721
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,620
Mr. Zhuang, you're here.

722
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,540
(Endless Learning)
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuang.

723
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,380
A son should aspire to be like Zhuang's son.

724
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,340
Indeed.

725
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,140
What's there to celebrate?

726
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,460
You always said
your son was unambitious,

727
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,900
uninterested in scholarly pursuits.

728
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,620
Turns out it was deliberate modesty.

729
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,600
A punishment's in order.

730
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,460
That's right.

731
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,540
Don't pretend you don't know.

732
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,820
Your son's essay has stunned the Capital.

733
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
Even the Emperor has heard of it.

734
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,060
This morning, His Majesty
summoned Yinan Guild Hall,

735
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,860
requesting the finest essays for review.

736
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,560
Your son's bright future is about to come.

737
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,140
His Majesty reviewed the papers?

738
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,460
I knew nothing of this.

739
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,860
Mr. Zhuang, stop pretending.

740
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,620
When you host the victory banquet
after the Spring Exam,

741
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,380
be sure to invite us.

742
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,180
Yes, that's right.

743
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,220
Mr. Zhuang may have an excellent memory,

744
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,460
capable of reciting the classics,

745
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,100
but when it comes to literary talent,

746
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,620
you might be overshadowed by your son.

747
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,860
The student surpasses the teacher.

748
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,620
Excuse me.

749
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,390
- Mr. Zhuang.
- Mr. Zhuang.

750
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,260
(Unfulfilled Talent)

751
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,100
It's no trivial matter. It must
be investigated thoroughly.

752
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,900
Mr. Zhuang is truly anxious.

753
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,460
You've come just in time.

754
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,460
What's going on?

755
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,300
Mr. Zhuang, your arrival is timely.

756
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,460
Saves us the trouble of sending for you.

757
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,340
Fifty catties of white cogongrass.

758
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,060
Five loads each of jujube, peach,
hazelnut, plum, and water caltrop.

759
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,330
Got it.

760
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,180
Before the ritual,

761
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,140
all offerings must be placed
atop the white cogongrass

762
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,300
- to show reverence.
- Yes.

763
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,340
Mom.

764
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,680
It seems you're the one
managing the household now.

765
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,860
You've got everyone
running around tirelessly.

766
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,820
You should be studying.

767
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,020
No need to concern yourself with the ritual.

768
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,370
You might not have heard yet.

769
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,380
His Majesty has requested my test paper.

770
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,060
This is a great honor for our family.

771
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,540
I had to come share the good news.

772
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,900
The Emperor reviewing your paper?

773
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,620
Are you serious?

774
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,940
Scared?

775
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,660
What's the use of reading
the useless books all day?

776
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,340
You're nothing but a foolish woman

777
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,730
who's not qualified for the exams.

778
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,280
If I achieve greatness in the future,

779
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,220
the Zhuangs will certainly not keep you here.

780
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,500
Though we were not born of the same mother,

781
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,100
we are still bound by blood.

782
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,900
Why must you be so cruel?

783
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,600
Ruan Xiwen was in charge for years.

784
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,180
Do you know how much my mom has endured?

785
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,180
I'll make sure you and your mother
pay it back in full.

786
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,220
I will never let you off the hook.

787
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,740
Don't drive a dog into a corner.

788
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,380
Don't you understand that?

789
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,900
What do you mean?

790
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,300
If you push me too far,

791
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,180
you'll force me to fight you.

792
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,560
Are you certain you can defeat me?

793
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,070
Yuchi?

794
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,580
Mom.

795
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,380
What brings you to the kitchen?

796
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,820
His Majesty reviewed my paper.

797
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,740
How did it reach His Majesty?

798
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,340
If word of the leak of question spreads,

799
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,500
it would be a grave crime.

800
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,220
It's only known to us.

801
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,660
How could it get out?

802
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,860
No way Yushan is trying to hurt me.

803
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,860
Mom.

804
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,860
Yuchi, bad news.

805
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,220
Mr. Han and the Judicial Review have arrived.

806
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,060
They're summoning everyone
to the guild hall.

807
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,100
- Let's go.
- Go.

808
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,700
(Eternal as Sun and Moon)

809
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,060
Young Master Zhuang,

810
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,980
"Brought order to the world",

811
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,820
was this essay written by you?

812
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,700
It was.

813
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,060
Very well. Then explain this to me.

814
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,300
Why is the essay you wrote recently

815
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,820
identical to the essay

816
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,420
composed by Vice Minister Han Wenzheng

817
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,860
twenty years ago?

818
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,500
That piece has been seen by few,

819
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,460
and the manuscript's kept
in Mr. Han's residence.

820
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,060
I have no idea.

821
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,260
The examiner should explain

822
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,540
why this topic was set.

823
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,020
This question was indeed created by me.

824
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,020
In previous tests,

825
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,460
students were often tasked with topics

826
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,260
on livelihood and governance.

827
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,380
The phrase may seem simple,

828
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,940
but it encompasses countless meanings.

829
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,660
It tests the students' knowledge
of various schools of thought.

830
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,580
I wonder how Young Master Zhuang came to…

831
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,420
It seems Mr. Zhuang has raised a fine son.

832
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,260
Even before the imperial exam,
he resorts to cheat,

833
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,580
causing such an uproar

834
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,060
that His Majesty has taken notice.

835
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,380
To put it bluntly,

836
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,620
it's a crime of deceiving the Emperor.

837
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,300
Kneel.

838
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,580
I am guilty.

839
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,820
My son is young and ignorant,

840
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,760
bringing disgrace to the exam and my family.

841
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,700
I plead for His Majesty's forgiveness.

842
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,420
I shall punish him strictly.

843
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,260
Sir.

844
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,220
The essay was not written by my brother.

845
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,220
It was He Wenshen who wrote it.

846
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,860
Yes, it was He Wenshen.

847
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,700
Yes.

848
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,980
Where is He Wenshen?

849
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,460
I'm here.

850
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,500
Greetings, sir.

851
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,420
What do you have to say?

852
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,540
Sir,

853
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,380
on the night before the test,

854
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,860
Miss Yushan took "The Analects,"

855
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,020
seeking my guidance.

856
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,420
She asked how that phrase
should be explained

857
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,420
and requested me to write it down for her.

858
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,260
Only then did I…

859
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,620
Mr. Zhuang, blinded by fatherly devotion,

860
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,540
had revealed the question himself.

861
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,760
Yushan,

862
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,420
where did you get that question?

863
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,980
Father, I sought guidance from Mr. He.

864
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,300
But the essay was indeed written by him.

865
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,500
He plagiarized it.

866
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,020
Sir, may I have a look?

867
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,620
The essay Young Master Zhuang wrote

868
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,080
is not the same as the one I wrote.

869
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,060
Although I have studied for a few years,

870
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,440
I could never produce

871
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,020
such a brilliant work.

872
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,170
That night, I drafted multiple versions

873
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,100
while refining my thoughts.

874
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,060
I have the drafts.

875
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,660
You can check them to verify.

876
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,940
Present them.

877
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,460
This is indeed completely different.

878
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,460
How could this have happened?

879
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,740
Although I inadvertently
learned of the question early,

880
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,620
I dared not engage in any dishonest act.

881
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,580
I withdrew on the day
of the test.

882
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,260
All the sirs can vouch for me.

883
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,060
Zhuang Yuchi,

884
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,340
do you have anything else to say?

885
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,060
I'm innocent, Mr. Yan.

886
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,060
Someone must be trying to set me up.

887
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,420
This essay was clearly written by He Wenshen.

888
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,180
How could it be Han Wenzheng's work?

889
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,180
Zhuang Yuchi, silence.

890
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,330
Father.

891
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,580
The Emperor has issued a decree.

892
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,620
Zhuang Yuchi has acted dishonorably.

893
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,980
He is accused of plagiarism
and moral corruption.

894
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,140
Considering it's not formal,

895
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,100
he will not face severe punishment.

896
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,540
However, he is permanently barred
from future exams.

897
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,590
Take him to the entrance
of the Judicial Review

898
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,880
and display him for three days.

899
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,780
Mr. Yan, I am innocent.

900
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,060
Junior Compiler Zhuang Shiyang.

901
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,300
Poor parenting. Dock half a year's salary

902
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,420
as a warning to others.

903
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,060
Guards, take him!

904
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,900
Have mercy.

905
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,780
Your Majesty, please have mercy.

906
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,940
- Father, please save Yuchi.
- Father.

907
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,860
- Father.
- Father.

908
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,260
- Yuchi.
- Yuchi.
