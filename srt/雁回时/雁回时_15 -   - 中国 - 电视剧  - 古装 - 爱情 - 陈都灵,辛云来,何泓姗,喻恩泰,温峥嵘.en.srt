00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,300
(To Miss Zhuang Hanyan)

4
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,350
Mother, what do you think?

5
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,000
Mother,

6
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,550
I know these noble ladies of the Capital

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,010
are the harshest with their words.

8
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,640
They treat your legs

9
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,070
as fodder for gossip during their chats.

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,950
They maliciously speculate

11
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,490
about you accusing your husband.

12
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,850
But it's because you've stayed
in the inner quarters,

13
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,990
unwilling to show yourself,

14
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,900
that others have the chance
to fabricate and spread rumors.

15
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,000
Words can indeed be terrifying.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,800
But why not use this opportunity

17
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,680
to discredit those rumors?

18
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,750
You're healthy.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,430
How can you understand the pain
of being a cripple?

20
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,430
Over the years,

21
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,030
I've been called barefoot ghost.

22
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,240
I've also been subjected to the mockery

23
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,290
you've endured.

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,460
Mother,

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,310
whatever happens in the future,

26
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,960
you will step out of the inner quarters.

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,710
If anyone humiliates you,

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,750
we will rebut them openly.

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,360
If anyone dares to be rude,

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,750
we will make sure those villains

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,930
will never dare again.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,650
With your daughter by your side,

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,070
you are no longer alone.

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,920
Fine.

35
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,120
I'll go with you.

36
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,850
- Get up.
- Miss Hanyan, please spare me.

37
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,710
Then you must promise me one thing.

38
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,590
What is it?

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,910
- Cast out Nanny Tao.
- Miss Hanyan, please spare me.

40
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,080
She's been punished.

41
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,450
Her daily wailing is unbearable.

42
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,010
Mother, please endure
for a few more days.

43
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,120
I let her stay in Jianjia Chamber

44
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,920
because I wanted
to intimidate Zhou Ruyin

45
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,590
and leave bait.

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,640
Then you should throw her

47
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,800
into the fish pond.

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,920
I've instructed Nanny Chen

49
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,840
to keep a close watch on her movements.

50
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,270
If Gongtong Chamber still tries
to cause trouble,

51
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,990
she will surely collude with them.

52
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,660

(Linjiang Pavilion)

56
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,390
Why is the Vice Minister also here?

57
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,430
Isn't he always absent
from our banquets?

58
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,720
(Linjiang Pavilion)

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,830
Perhaps

60
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,750
he came to check out a new wife.

61
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,150
Let's go.

62
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,900

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,580
(Linjiang Pavilion)

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,440
Madam, slow down.

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,360
Who is she?

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,040
She seems to be the lady
from the Ruan family.

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,830
The one who falsely accused her husband

68
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,870
is her.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,430
She almost ruined her entire family.

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,040
How dare she show her face?

71
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,630
If it were me, I'd be too ashamed.

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,950
When we were trapped
in the Yinan Guild Hall,

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,680
it was dangerous for everyone.

74
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,310
My mother, out of kindness,

75
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,700
couldn't bear to watch

76
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,600
the innocent lose their lives,

77
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
so she risked her own safety

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,280
to report her family's crimes

79
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,210
to buy time

80
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,800
and save others' lives.

81
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,570
This was an act of righteousness.

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,870
What is there to be ashamed of?

83
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,350
Let's go, let's go.

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,470
Hanyan.

85
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,600
Don't argue with them.

86
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,280
Yes, Mother.

87
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,440
Mrs. Zhuang, please.

88
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
About our plan last night,

89
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,950
how confident are you?

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,560
I've done everything I can,

91
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,990
but I only have a 50% chance.

92
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,280
50%?

93
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,830
I've been suspended.

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,000
Is 50% not good enough

95
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,440
for you?

96
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,480
If we can't bring that noble here,

97
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,750
tonight's effort

98
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,750
will be wasted.

99
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,310
I'll go investigate further.

100
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,840
You play it by ear.

101
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,470
Sure.

102
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,120
Nanny Chen.

103
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,560
I'll do it.

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,520
Sure.

105
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,840
Greetings, Mrs. Zhuang.

106
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,160
Mrs. Zhuang, you can't move

107
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,380
and have always stayed at home.

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
(Li Jiaqi, Grand Councilor's daughter)
Yet you're here.

109
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,600
You must care
for your daughter's marriage.

110
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,390
What a loving mother.

111
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,870
Naturally.

112
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,560
What a noble lady
from the Zhuang family.

113
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,700
She carried a corpse to save the family.

114
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,800
If it were anyone else,

115
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,680
which unmarried girl would dare

116
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,510
to be so close to a man?

117
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,070
Yes.

118
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,950
I misspoke.

119
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,280
It's a corpse,

120
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,950
so it can't be called a man anymore.

121
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,920
Though the corpse is filthy,

122
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,560
compared to Miss Hanyan's

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,070
heroic act,

124
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,750
what does

125
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,120
a woman's reputation matter?

126
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,120
- I...
- This young lady is right.

127
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,510
Having such a daughter

128
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,870
is my family's blessing.

129
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
In the past, Princess Pingyang

130
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,670
fought on the battlefield
on behalf of her father.

131
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,390
Xie Daoyun also

132
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,150
led the women in the family

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,750
to protect their home during a crisis.

134
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,670
Now, my daughter carried a corpse
to save the family.

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,440
It's just a small matter.

136
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,750
No need to overpraise her.

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,020
I've heard that Miss Hanyan
is very talented

138
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,390
and known for her resourcefulness.

139
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,320
I wonder if that's true.

140
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,670
Today, everyone happens to be here.

141
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,270
Why not solve some lantern riddles?

142
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,560
I'd surely join the fun.

143
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,390
It's found in mouthfuls
but not in handfuls.

144
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,480
It's found in mouthpieces
but not in eyepieces.

145
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,710
Guess the word.

146
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,320
The answer is the "mouth".

147
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,300
(Mouth)

148
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,360
Looks like this child's trick

149
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,960
won't be hard for you.

150
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,390
It's hard to travel
on the road in the rain.

151
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,830
With tears, I wave goodbye to you.

152
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,150
Guess the name of a bird.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
Bring me paper and a brush.

154
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,380
(Rain, road, people, departure)

155
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,350
Miss Hanyan,

156
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,440
the answer should be a bird name.

157
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,080
These four characters

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
might not quite match.

159
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,910
The answer is a crane, right?

160
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
Is there any explanation?

161
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,390
You might've gotten lucky.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,720
Please let everyone see

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,150
the lantern riddle.

164
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,670
If I'm not mistaken,

165
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,150
when you read the riddle,

166
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,510
(Cao'e Format)
you forgot the riddle format.

167
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,950
There have been records
of riddles

168
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
since the Commentary of Zuo.

169
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,030
Riddles then became popular
among the people.

170
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,080
A riddle consists of a question,

171
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,060
an answer, and a format.

172
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,790
The format, like a tune name,

173
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,120
has its own specific rules.

174
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,080
The Cao'e Format,
from the 18 Formats of Guangling,

175
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,210
is the oldest riddle format.

176
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,840
According to the Cao'e Format,

177
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,960
the answer should be
two or four characters.

178
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,950
Each character must be split

179
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
into two characters

180
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,870
to form the answer.

181
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,360
So,

182
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,090
these four characters

183
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,880
form the Chinese phrase for "crane".

184
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,300
(It's hard to travel
on the road in the rain.)

185
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,900
(With tears, I wave goodbye to you.)

186
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,140
(A bird name, Cao'e Format)

187
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,900
(Crane)

188
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,940
Miss Hanyan understands
the meaning of the text

189
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
and knows the origin of the riddle.

190
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,720
Truly outstanding.

191
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,910
My apologies.

192
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,350
Thank you.

193
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,440
Miss Li,

194
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,550
shall we continue?

195
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,750
Of course.

196
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,080
Miss Hanyan, please enlighten us.

197
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,990
Please.

198
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,900
(Meeting of Friends)

199
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,510
I must have seen it wrong.

200
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,480
That lame madam from the Zhuang family

201
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,510
has shown herself tonight?

202
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,020
(Mrs. Tan)
Are you referring

203
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,050
to Ruan Xiwen?

204
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,320
That's right.

205
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,440
How does she look?

206
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,270
I suppose she must be aging.

207
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,120
Are there wrinkles on her face?

208
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,150
Has her hair turned gray?

209
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,910
Is she still

210
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,960
unable to walk?

211
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,690
(Mrs. Qian)
You can see for yourself.

212
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,630
Who brought the rouge?

213
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,600
It's so pretty.

214
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,710
Yes.

215
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,830
Mother.

216
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,120
This riddle is simple.

217
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,630
I'm sure it won't stump Miss Hanyan.

218
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,790
A firewood stick leaning
on a shoulder pole.

219
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,440
Guess a type of person.

220
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,600
Miss Hanyan, you were
so confident just now.

221
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,360
Why can't you

222
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
guess this playful riddle now?

223
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,120
It's a cripple, right?

224
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
In that case,

225
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,510
I'll also present a riddle for you all.

226
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,900
To recognize a character,
start from the beginning.

227
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,600
Guess a type of person.

228
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,920
What?

229
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,750
None of you know this?

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,030
I don't know.

231
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,240
Zhuang Yushan, what about you?

232
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,480
I've never heard of this riddle.

233
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,520
To recognize a character,
start from the beginning.

234
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
It's a petty person.

235
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,150
I've been incomplete for years,

236
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,750
and I feel ashamed to show myself.

237
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,560
But tonight's events made me realize

238
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,440
that the incomplete person is not me.

239
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,670
We all have our limbs intact.

240
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,990
What's missing in us?

241
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,150
In this world,

242
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,390
there are many
evil spirits and monsters,

243
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,200
wearing human skin and causing havoc.

244
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,750
But once they speak,

245
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,200
they can't hide the stench
of their rotten mouths.

246
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
How dare you scold me?

247
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,120
My father is the Grand Councilor.

248
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Do you want to die?

249
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,600
I didn't name anyone,

250
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,030
so why is this
Grand Councilor's daughter

251
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,790
rushing to claim it?

252
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,390
- You...
- Jiaqi, don't be angry.

253
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,510
Let me just advise you one thing:

254
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,910
In the inner quarters,
women making friends

255
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,270
is no different from men going to war.

256
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,840
However close you are,

257
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,030
if they only push you to the front lines

258
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,150
on the battlefield,

259
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,030
it means they're just
using you as a shield

260
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,090
and a scapegoat to be sacrificed.

261
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,840
Jiaqi, don't be misled.

262
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,070
On the day
of my hair pinning ceremony,

263
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,360
I believe you sent me a gift.

264
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,720
Today, I believe it's you

265
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,510
who invited me to this banquet.

266
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,560
We have no grudges between us.

267
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,420
Why turn hostile today?

268
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,750
How about befriending me?

269
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,840
In the future, if you need me,

270
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,030
just let me know.

271
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,080
I can't claim to be wise,

272
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,710
but I certainly won't hide behind,

273
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,960
plotting in secret

274
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,870
and pushing you forward
to offend people.

275
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,600
Moreover, your father is powerful.

276
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
You must be cautious.

277
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,270
Don't let those who curry favor
with the powerful use you

278
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,440
to make enemies everywhere,

279
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,390
while they only appear as the good ones.

280
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,510
What you say does make some sense.

281
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,510
We shouldn't make enemies.

282
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,030
I grew up in the countryside

283
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,320
and don't know the rules here.

284
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
If I offended you earlier,

285
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,510
please forgive me.

286
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,270
If you don't mind,

287
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,580
I'd be grateful for some guidance.

288
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,240
Hanyan, you're being too kind.

289
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,670
This conflict has brought us close.

290
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,360
I was misled by someone malicious

291
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,870
and made a momentary lapse.

292
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,030
Please don't take it to heart.

293
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,440
Of course, I won't.

294
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
Jiaqi, I...

295
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,390
What else do you need?

296
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,840
Isn't this Ms. Ruan?

297
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,750
Long time no see.

298
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,440
I'm married.

299
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,670
I'm Mrs. Zhuang now.

300
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
(Mrs. Tan)

301
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,150
Did you put on makeup just now?

302
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,480
Why are you mingling with young girls?

303
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,760
Our close friends from the past

304
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,320
are all in the hall.

305
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,000
Why don't you join us?

306
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,410
The poetry gathering is ready
at Plum Garden.

307
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,080
Everyone, please come to the garden.

308
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,280
Hanyan,

309
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,040
let's go together.

310
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,470
My mother has difficulty moving,

311
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,110
so I'll stay and serve her.

312
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,150
You go ahead.

313
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,360
Is this your daughter?

314
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,880
It's the Lantern Festival tonight.

315
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,670
Why not go and pick a husband?

316
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,030
Are you going to drink tea

317
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,230
with us old ladies?

318
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,440
Go ahead.

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,560
Nanny Chen is here with me.

320
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,790
Very well.

321
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,710
Let's go then.

322
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,430
Let's go.

323
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,280
We should catch up tonight.

324
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,000
Before you got married,

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,160
you were

326
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,120
the most prominent young lady
in the Capital.

327
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,400
You excelled at the four arts

328
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,950
and were good at tea-making.

329
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
I wonder

330
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,670
if you've lost
your tea-making skill over time.

331
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,800
Could you

332
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,750
show us again

333
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,870
so we can admire
the grace of a noble lady?

334
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,600
The ancient art of tea

335
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,950
emphasizes six elements, three points,
and seven taboos.

336
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,210
Among the six elements,
the first one is tea selection.

337
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,560
The tea should be fresh,

338
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,070
preferably tender leaves plucked
at an appropriate time.

339
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,080
This is plucked after Guyu.

340
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,910
It's aged.

341
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,620
The second one is water selection.

342
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,320
Well water is the least desirable,
inferior then mountain and river water.

343
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,840
If you make tea with well water,

344
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,280
it's a waste of good tea.

345
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,840
For our time, white porcelain
and blue-and-white porcelain

346
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,590
from Jingdezhen, and Yixing
purple clay teapots are top-tier.

347
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,950
These are rough and clumsy

348
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,360
from the previous dynasty.

349
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,640
It seems that I'm not the one

350
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,040
whose skill is lacking, but you.

351
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,320
Mrs. Zhuang, you're still good at this.

352
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,430
Sorry for failing to train

353
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,230
my servants.

354
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,680
Why not ask this nanny

355
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
to go with my maid

356
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,950
to select tea and water

357
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,950
and offer some guidance?

358
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm just a simple servant.

359
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,040
How could I know the art of tea?

360
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,670
Mrs. Tan, you flatter me.

361
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,230
You foolish old thing.

362
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,300
To receive orders from the wife
of a Grand Scholar

363
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,550
is your honor.

364
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,830
Do you fear that no one

365
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,910
can serve your madam here?

366
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
She can't be so ungrateful.

367
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,120
Nanny Chen, go ahead.

368
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,520
Teach them a lesson.

369
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,210
Go.

370
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,520
Mrs. Zhuang,

371
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,550
please.

372
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,400
Please.

373
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,080
Nanny, please enter and select the tea.

374
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,040
What's this about?

375
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,120
Open the door.

376
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,280
Open the door, open the door.

377
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,520
Open the door.

378
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,840
Mrs. Zhuang,

379
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,120
please enjoy your tea.

380
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,080
To Mrs. Zhuang.

381
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,840
Mrs. Zhuang,

382
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,800
please accept this tea.

383
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,870
Mrs. Zhuang,

384
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,270
please enjoy your tea.

385
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,390
To Mrs. Zhuang.

386
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,840
Tonight, there will be no banquet
in Plum Garden.

387
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,640
Young ladies can hide their names

388
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,560
in two lines on a sheet

389
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,000
and hang it on a branch.

390
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,630
Gentlemen,

391
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,550
if you can match the second line

392
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,920
with your name,

393
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,840
you may share a drink.

394
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,460
(Cold pond mirrors sky and water;)

395
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,700
(a northbound goose departs.)

396
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,900
(Gift the hero with a hairpin)

397
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,460
(Cold pond mirrors sky and water)

398
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,100
(When a young girl comes of age)

399
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,180
(Cold pond mirrors sky and water;
a northbound goose departs.)

400
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,180
(Literature)

401
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,020
(A lone boat fades afar among the mist;
where do these strings rest?)

402
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,920
Cold pond mirrors sky and water;

403
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
a northbound goose departs.

404
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,150
A lone boat fades afar among the mist;

405
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,670
where do these strings rest?

406
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,560
With the scenery and feelings,
these lines match.

407
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,040
Hanyan.

408
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,670
Yunxi?

409
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,760
Miss Yushan, why do you reek of alcohol?

410
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,150
What's it to you?

411
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,280
Mr. He, who hung this?

412
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
I don't know.

413
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,080
I only know it was just hung up.

414
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
"Where do these strings rest?"

415
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,790
What does it mean?

416
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,910
Since ancient times,
scholars have often used strings

417
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,390
as a metaphor

418
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,560
for strings of affection.

419
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,080
Fu Yunxi,

420
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,910
I have a question for you tonight.

421
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,840
Do you have someone you like?

422
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,230
I don't think

423
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,430
I should explain it to you.

424
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,600
(Yunxi)
Did you

425
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,280
write this?

426
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,470
Yes. What's wrong?

427
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,040
Do you know

428
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,230
I've always admired you?

429
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,670
I've made it clear to you.

430
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,840
I can't like you back.

431
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,280
What do you like about Zhuang Hanyan?

432
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,710
You can tell me. I can learn.

433
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,230
Just don't like her anymore.

434
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,040
Miss Yushan, you're drunk.

435
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,800
It's better for you to rest early.

436
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,430
I'm not drunk.

437
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,230
Everything I said is from my heart.

438
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I don't care
if you are my brother-in-law,

439
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,350
nor do I care

440
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,080
if others think I'm foolish.

441
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
As long as you say yes,

442
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,040
I'll have no regrets.

443
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,000
For the sake of your reputation,

444
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,190
we shouldn't talk here.

445
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,440
Goodbye.

446
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,710
Fu Yunxi,

447
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,390
you will regret this one day.

448
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,870
Mrs. Zhuang, please enjoy your tea.

449
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,640
Here.

450
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,520
I toast to everyone.

451
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,790
Here.

452
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,960
I offer tea instead of wine

453
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,120
to congratulate Mrs. Zhuang
on getting rid of your burden

454
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,760
and return to social occasions.

455
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,150
It's late.

456
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,590
We shouldn't drink much tea.

457
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,120
Thank you for your kindness.

458
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,880
Mrs. Zhuang, you've drunk
so many cups of tea from others.

459
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,360
Why am I the only exception?

460
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,960
Outsiders might think

461
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,840
there's a rift between us.

462
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
I can't refuse your kindness.

463
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,190
Let me change and come back

464
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,710
to offer you tea.

465
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,760
The tea grows cold as people leave.

466
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,230
It's rare for us to gather here.

467
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
If you leave now,

468
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,760
the atmosphere will cool down.

469
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,670
- You'd better stay.
- Yes.

470
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,200
Mrs. Zhuang, please stay.

471
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,590
Why don't we let Mrs. Zhuang change

472
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,120
before coming back for tea?

473
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,150
Here, Mrs. Zhuang.

474
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,270
Please.

475
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,320
Mrs. Zhuang, please.

476
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,240
- Please, Mrs. Zhuang.
- Please.

477
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,440
Miss Hanyan.

478
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
Is anything wrong?

479
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,920
As you instructed,

480
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,520
I've been keeping an eye on Miss Yushan.

481
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,680
I saw her ask someone to bring a horse

482
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,870
into the stable
behind the Linjiang Pavilion.

483
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,550
A horse?

484
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,440
Yes.

485
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,640
From what I can tell,

486
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,040
nothing seems unusual.

487
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,840
Keep an eye on her.

488
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,310
Tonight is crucial.

489
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,960
We must not let her stir up trouble.

490
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,920
Yes.

491
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,750
Mother.

492
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,600
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

493
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,870
Take me to change.

494
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,600
Sure.

495
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
How rude.

496
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,070
How can you not

497
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,680
greet elders?

498
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,590
Is this how you're taught at home?

499
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,390
Do I need to apologize to you?

500
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,670
How rude.

501
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,550
How dare you speak to an elder this way?

502
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,640
If you respect my mother,

503
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,950
I'll respect you as an elder.

504
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,150
But you don't respect my mother.

505
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,830
Why should I respect someone

506
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,240
as malicious as you?

507
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,800
You...

508
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,190
Seeing is believing.

509
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,290
I've heard that Miss Hanyan

510
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,750
grew up in Danzhou

511
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,360
and behaves recklessly.

512
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,630
There's a rumor among the scholars
of Yinan this year

513
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,440
that one of her fellow villagers

514
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
had his ear bitten off by her.

515
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,390
I'm a wild woman raised
on raw meat and blood.

516
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,570
If you dare to make
sarcastic comments again,

517
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,320
I might just bite your ear off too

518
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,870
and eat it with my wine.

519
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,560
Look at this.

520
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,190
Who would dare

521
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,910
to marry such a girl?

522
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,730
My young lady won't marry your son
even if you kneel.

523
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,840
You lowly thing, get lost.

524
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,840
My madam is well-mannered,

525
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,390
and Miss Hanyan knows right from wrong,

526
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,400
but as an old servant,

527
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,870
I don't follow such rules.

528
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,510
Since you didn't act properly,

529
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,360
I have no reason to hold back.

530
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,870
With your lowly behavior,

531
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,400
you were not as good as Ms. Ruan

532
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,190
20 years ago,

533
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,590
and you still aren't as good

534
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,350
as Mrs. Zhuang now.

535
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,800
With the sins this life,

536
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,280
you'll be a beast and serve
as our wine snack

537
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,320
in your next life.

538
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,310
Ruan Xiwen,

539
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,910
how dare you let your servant

540
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,520
insult the madams like this?

541
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,150
That's right. She's insulting you.

542
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,160
If Mr. Tan knew
that his wife was like this,

543
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,830
he'd probably abandon you overnight

544
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,190
and send you back to your family.

545
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,670
How dare you!

546
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,150
A cripple like you
has no right to lecture me.

547
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,920
Today, I'll teach you a lesson.

548
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,950
What can you do about it?

549
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,840
Stand up

550
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,680
if you can.

551
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,200
Stand up and hit me.

552
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,600
Stand up and scold me.

553
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,080
Go on, stand up!

554
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,030
You...

555
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,950
How dare you hit me?

556
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,800
Wretched women!

557
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll fight you both to the death today!

558
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,230
The Noble Consort is here.

559
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,360
Greetings, Your Highness.
I wish you well.

560
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,870
Mrs. Zhuang.

561
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,560
(Noble Consort Miao)
Long time no see.

562
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,430
How have you been?

563
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,230
There are no hosts
at the Lantern Festival banquet,

564
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,760
and indulgence inevitably leads
to a lack of decorum.

565
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,760
Go bring the wake-up soup

566
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,800
for everyone.

567
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

568
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,870
Mrs. Tan,

569
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,230
you should go and adjust your attire.

570
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,920
Yes.

571
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,840
Mrs. Zhuang.

572
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,680
Yes?

573
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,360
My mother can't do it,

574
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,950
so please allow me to pay respect
to you on her behalf.

575
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,950
Are you Zhuang Hanyan?

576
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,840
Yes, Your Highness.

577
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,910
Mrs. Zhuang,

578
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,150
you didn't teach her well,

579
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,040
so I'll have her kneel
and receive punishment.

580
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,950
Do you have any objections?

581
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,080
I dare not.

582
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,950
Thank you for your teachings.

583
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,000
I thought

584
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,000
Noble Consort Miao would protect her.

585
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,000
They used to be known
as the two beauties of the Capital,

586
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,710
with top-tier families,
talents, and beauty.

587
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,800
It was inevitable
that people compared them.

588
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,190
Back then, Ruan Xiwen

589
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,120
was always above Noble Consort Miao.

590
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,120
Now, how could she
allow her to act recklessly?

591
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,350
Miss Hanyan,

592
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,670
you invited me here.

593
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
How do you want to work with me?

594
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,150
I heard that every year
during the Spring Festival,

595
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,670
Noble Consort Miao visits her family.

596
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,560
She's also been seen
at banquets in the Capital.

597
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,000
I want to meet her
at the Lantern Festival banquet

598
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,920
in the Linjiang Pavilion tomorrow.

599
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,080
Do you have a way?

600
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,360
Why?

601
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,880
I want

602
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,560
to convince my mother to divorce.

603
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,960
My mother is deeply obsessed,

604
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,510
and she's trapped in the Zhuang family.

605
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,310
She spends every day with her enemies.

606
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,190
I don't want her to live
such a tortured life.

607
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,230
Besides,

608
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,880
if there turns out to be solid evidence

609
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,750
that Zhuang Shiyang
is Pei's adopted son,

610
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,550
though you promised me
that my family would be fine,

611
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,080
it's not a foolproof guarantee.

612
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,110
If I can get my mother

613
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,080
to sever ties with the Zhuang family,

614
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,040
I'll have no more worries,

615
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,040
so I can fully cooperate with you.

616
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,670
But even if Noble Consort Miao is here,

617
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,830
what difference will it make?

618
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,400
At the recent hair pinning ceremony,

619
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,380
Noble Consort Miao gave me
a congratulatory gift.

620
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,000
I heard from my mother

621
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,670
that they were old friends.

622
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,790
I thought about it.

623
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,400
If I could get her old friend
to persuade her,

624
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,960
perhaps it might work.

625
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,270
It seems

626
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,120
that even if I am powerless,

627
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,750
I must give it a try.

628
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,230
(Could it be that she's an enemy?)

629
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,270
Time passes,

630
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,880
and you're not quite the same

631
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,630
as before.

632
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,710
Your Highness, you're even more

633
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
outstanding than before.

634
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,880
Your temperament hasn't changed.

635
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,190
Everyone says Ms. Ruan

636
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,880
is virtuous and gentle,

637
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,520
but only I know

638
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,960
you are stubborn

639
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,600
and born rebellious.

640
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,480
Even when you soften your words,

641
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,350
you never truly submit to anyone.

642
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,830
Your Highness, you flatter me.

643
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,350
I dare not accept such praise.

644
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,840
Dare not?

645
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,750
That's the second time

646
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,150
you've said that,

647
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,670
but since I entered this hall,

648
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
you've never once lowered your head.

649
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,320
Miss Yushan fed something strange
to that red horse

650
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,670
and drove it to the front yard.

651
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,120
Back in the day, your embroidery work

652
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,920
was unmatched
among the ladies of the Capital.

653
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,710
You claimed

654
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,710
it was merely idle entertainment,

655
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,550
but little did people know

656
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,410
the hard work you put in secretly.

657
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,880
Now, looking at it,

658
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,000
I find the stitches are sparse,

659
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,790
careless, and rough.

660
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,270
All your efforts were wasted after all.

661
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,520
Times have changed.

662
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,960
Now, you surely won't pay attention

663
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,790
to something as trivial
as a handkerchief.

664
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,270
Did you use fragrance?

665
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,220
It doesn't smell
like the usual fragrance.

666
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,790
It has more of a herbal scent.

667
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,150
What strange things have you done?

668
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,560
Miss Hanyan.

669
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,110
What did you hear?

670
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,440
I didn't hear anything from them.

671
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,790
I only saw Miss Yushan

672
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,080
handing a handkerchief to Nanny Tao.

673
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,270
Protect the Noble Consort!
Protect Her Highness!

674
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,350
Protect the Noble Consort!

675
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,330
Your Highness, Your Highness.

676
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,880
Hanyan!

677
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,310
Give me the handkerchief.

678
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,400
Pull on the reins.

679
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,750
Hanyan! Hanyan!

680
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,190
Bow down.

681
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,190
Hanyan!

682
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
Zhuang Hanyan.

683
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,360
Hanyan.

684
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,510
Zhuang Hanyan.

685
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,720
Give me your hand.

686
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,080
Are you injured?

687
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,280
No.

688
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,270
You should get up now.

Did you get hurt on your back?

699
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,920
It's a small wound. It's nothing.

700
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,710
I didn't mean to do it just now.

701
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,560
It's fine.

702
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,240
What's this?

703
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,150
A handkerchief

stained with the juice
of mad horse grass.

705
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,790
What happened to that horse?

706
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,400
Zhuang Yushan released that horse
into the Linjiang Pavilion

707
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,710
and used this handkerchief as bait

708
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,750
to harm my mother.

709
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,480
On such a festive occasion
with so many people,

710
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,960
she has truly lost her mind.

711
