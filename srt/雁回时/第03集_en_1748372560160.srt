1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ours

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,760
Which of the four serving cooks are suitable for you?

3
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,800
Be happy

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Episode 1

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
I killed him.

6
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Don't be afraid.

7
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
You're leaving with me.

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
No.

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm going to the capital.

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Why?

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Where?

12
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
This is my home.

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Episode 1

14
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Episode 1

15
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Your Highness is...

16
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
I'm Duan Zhenren.

17
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm Han Yen.

18
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm from the imperial family.

19
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Duan Zhenren.

20
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Duan Tian.

21
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Lord Zhuang, long time no see.

22
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Good to see you, Duan Zhenren.

23
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I heard you went to the Yingtian Manor recently.

24
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I don't know when you'll be back.

25
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
How can I get the money to manage Han's company?

26
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
I can't even tell the news.

27
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm so lucky to have a successor.

28
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Lord Zhuang, you don't have to be so courteous.

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
You're a good man.

30
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
You're a good man.

31
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm here to help you.

32
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
He Yan.

33
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Why don't you go back to the palace?

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
I'll take care of the palace.

35
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Wait.

36
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
This is the third lady of the Zhuang family, right?

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Yes.

38
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Lord Zhuang,

39
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I wonder if anyone has been ill or suffering since you came in.

40
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
No.

41
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Father, don't take care of me.

42
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
My mother is ill.

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
She's not up for long.

44
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Duan Zhenren is blinded.

45
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm afraid she's already known.

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Since that,

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Lord Zhuang,

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,800
may I ask you to look into her illness?

49
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes.

50
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Zhenren,

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
do you see any signs?

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
As of 17 years ago,

53
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Zhuang's family has been destroyed.

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Her health is in danger.

55
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
She's been suffering from a stroke.

56
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Now, she's in the position of the imperial doctor.

57
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
You're so generous.

58
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Please save her.

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Zhuang's family is destroyed?

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Lord,

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I mean,

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
isn't it the 17 years ago?

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
That's...

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Aunt,

65
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
what nonsense are you talking about?

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
It's strange.

67
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Although the channel is channeled,

68
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
it's still a physical problem.

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
We need to start a conversation

70
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
to ask the God to look into her illness.

71
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
If you're worried about her,

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
then you can come to the court as soon as possible.

73
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Duan Zhenren,

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I heard you're a good person.

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
So what?

76
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Not so.

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
What do you think?

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
The snow is slippery.

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Be careful.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
The emperor is here.

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Please come in.

82
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Father.

83
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Lord Zhuang,

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
what are you doing?

85
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Duan Zhenren is in the court.

86
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
He's praying for my family's blessing.

87
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
How did you come here?

88
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Just now,

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
the old lady said she's sick.

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
You suddenly left and went back.

91
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
I'm worried that

92
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
something really went wrong.

93
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
We'll come and take a look.

94
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
The emperor is here.

95
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
How about this?

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Lord Zhuang,

97
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
you should go back to the mansion first.

98
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
We'll discuss about the memorial ceremony.

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
We'll discuss it another day.

100
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
That's great.

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
That's great.

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Lord Zhuang,

103
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
let's...

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
You're so thoughtful.

105
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
How can I be so considerate?

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Moreover,

107
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Lord Zhuang said that

108
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
the house is quiet.

109
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
It's not strange.

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Today, I, Han Mouran,

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
will hear

112
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
what the old lady said.

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
In case of future,

114
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
we'll have a good marriage

115
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
between Zhuang Han and his daughter.

116
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Lord Zhuang.

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Zhenren, how is it?

118
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Miss.

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
This is not from the small pit.

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm afraid that

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
the late lord will be against the unrighteous.

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Unrighteous?

123
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
The god of justice knows

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
the birth of the person who is broken.

125
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
If you want to save the old lady's life,

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
you need to kill the broken one

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
to change his life.

128
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
But the one who is broken

129
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
is the old man

130
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
who came to Lord Zhuang's bone blood.

131
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Master.

132
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Duan Zhenren.

133
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Although my Zhuang family is not

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
a family of three,

135
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
we should be loyal to each other.

136
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
That's also the case of the Shuyang Sect.

137
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
How can we

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
make up for the broken one?

139
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Eight words are here.

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Lord Zhuang, please

141
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
take care of it yourself.

142
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
How...

143
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
How could it be possible?

144
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
How could it be possible?

145
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
It's impossible.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
It's impossible.

147
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
You are so considerate.

148
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Why do you want to hurt my sister?

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
How could it be Yushan?

150
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
This is

151
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
the birth of the second sister.

152
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Duan Zhenren.

153
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
17 years ago,

154
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
you said my third daughter, Han Yan,

155
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
was a ghost in the corner.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
17 years later,

157
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
you said my second daughter, Yushan,

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
was a ghost in the corner.

159
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
You called me Zhuang family.

160
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
You were so innocent.

161
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Why did you

162
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
have a heart attack?

163
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Lord Zhuang, don't worry.

164
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I have an old thing

165
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
that I want to tell you.

166
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I want to tell you

167
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
that I owe you three things.

168
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
17 years ago,

169
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
you were a ghost in the corner.

170
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
You were a ghost in the corner.

171
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
You were blinded by the evil evil.

172
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
That's why you blamed my third daughter.

173
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Zhuang family has been

174
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
affected by you for years.

175
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
You have nothing to do with it.

176
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
And your birth certificate

177
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
has been approved.

178
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Now,

179
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
you are the one who is responsible for the transfer of Xiangrui.

180
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
You are the treasure of the mansion.

181
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Then, Duan Zhenren,

182
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
you said that

183
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Han Yanta is not a ghost in the corner.

184
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
You have been suffering for years.

185
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,800
You have been guilty for your second daughter.

186
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Yushan is my adopted son.

187
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
She always has a reason to blame me.

188
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Why didn't she want to know?

189
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
You are not trustworthy.

190
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
You are not a good person.

191
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
But you are not good at breaking up.

192
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Your birth certificate is not good.

193
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
You are a good person.

194
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
You are not worthy of your father's name.

195
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Take the demon knife.

196
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
What are you doing?

197
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Yushan, don't be rude.

198
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Father, the thief is a good person.

199
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I have evidence.

200
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You should report it to the court.

201
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
What evidence?

202
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Lan'er, you go and talk.

203
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Master, I saw it last night.

204
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Miss San was in the palace with Duan Zhenren.

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
She was in a meeting with Duan Zhenren.

206
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
I didn't hear what they said.

207
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
But I saw Miss San

208
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
giving Duan Zhenren a big package.

209
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
When did you meet Miss San?

210
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
You should have killed her.

211
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Don't be afraid.

212
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Yes.

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
I was suspicious.

214
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
So I followed Duan Zhenren.

215
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I saw she went to the fishing season store

216
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
and sold a lot of gold-gain jewelry.

217
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
After she left,

218
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I asked the chief of the fishing season.

219
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I saw all the gold-gain jewelry

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,800
were given to Miss San yesterday.

221
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I came back to report it to you.

222
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
You are a good person.

223
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
You are a good person.

224
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,800
I am a good person.

225
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
But you are so suspicious.

226
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
You want to fight with me at home,

227
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
you bought the angel and framed me.

228
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Han Yan, are they serious?

229
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Father, listen to me.

230
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,800
How can you answer Duan Zhenren?

231
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
You are so stubborn.

232
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Who told you to slander me?

233
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Duan Zhenren,

234
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
why don't we go to the fishing season store

235
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
and see if we can slander her?

236
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Duan Zhenren, tell me the truth.

237
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Did you really see Han Yan last night?

238
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Hit him.

239
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Hit him until he opens his mouth.

240
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Hit him.

241
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Stop.

242
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
How dare you.

243
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Zhu Mu, Yong Shou Hall is in trouble.

244
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Take her there.

245
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Yes.

246
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Stop.

247
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Stop.

248
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Stop.

249
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Stop.

250
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Stop.

251
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Stop.

252
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Uncle Wang.

253
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Uncle Wang.

254
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Lord Zhuang,

255
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I was forced to do it.

256
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
What do you mean?

257
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I...

258
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I...

259
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I...

260
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
I...

261
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
I...

262
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
I...

263
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I...

264
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
I...

265
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I...

266
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
I...

267
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I...

268
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I...

269
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
I've found a great man.

270
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I'm even more fierce than him.

271
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm not afraid of him.

272
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
This show is full of twists and turns.

273
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I have to be determined.

274
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Zhuang Yu Shan is absolutely not that kind of person.

275
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
It's really a good thing to use someone else

276
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
when you're behind the scenes.

277
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Even the crime of 17 years ago

278
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
could be done by one person.

279
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
But I won't let you get away with it.

280
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Father.

281
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
I met Duan Zhen Ren last night.

282
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
His behavior today

283
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
is indeed a matter of taking care of my daughter.

284
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Han Yan.

285
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You're so stupid.

286
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Master, don't be angry.

287
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Miss San must have her own difficulties.

288
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
You're right.

289
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Han Yan has difficulties.

290
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
What kind of difficulties do you have?

291
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
You're so stubborn

292
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
that you forced me to kill my father.

293
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Don't worry.

294
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Even if you're not touched by this,

295
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
I'll tell the truth.

296
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I won't let you fall into my trap.

297
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Han Yan.

298
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Why...

299
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Why do you say that?

300
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm getting more and more confused.

301
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Father.

302
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
My daughter's behavior today is not a joke.

303
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
It's to prove to the world

304
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,800
that Duan Zhen Ren is the best at taking care of people.

305
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Duan Zhen Ren is also a strange and chaotic person.

306
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
He's a superstitious person.

307
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
He's never suspicious.

308
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Duan Zhen Ren, let me ask you something.

309
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
If I bought you today,

310
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
who would you buy

311
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
the dirty and dirty house 17 years ago?

312
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
You...

313
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
You're a good-for-nothing.

314
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
You're the only one who can save the lives of the people.

315
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
You took money and became a coward.

316
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
You're not afraid of retribution.

317
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I only caused you a lot of pain

318
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,800
because of your words.

319
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I suffered so many disasters

320
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,800
that I had to take care of them with you.

321
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Why don't you take your own life?

322
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
You've been in the capital for many years.

323
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
How many times have you been insulted

324
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
and how many times have you been framed?

325
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

326
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
When did I ever frame you?

327
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
You're a vicious and evil person.

328
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,800
How could you be treated like this?

329
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
If I'm a vicious and evil person,

330
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
how could you

331
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,800
dare to defame me?

332
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

333
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Zhuang Han Yan,

334
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
you're pretending to be a mother.

335
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
If my sister didn't expose

336
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
your evil and dangerous tricks,

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
you'd be afraid that she'd be wronged.

338
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
I believe you.

339
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
If everything is your plan,

340
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,800
why did you get so serious?

341
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Please answer me.

342
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
You shouldn't answer me.

343
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Mrs. Chen, what are you doing?

344
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Master Huibing,

345
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
this is Mrs. Zhou's mother

346
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
from Yilan's family.

347
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
She's the wife of the old lady.

348
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
She's been drinking and playing with you

349
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
for the past few days.

350
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Tell me,

351
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
what did you do

352
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,800
in Mrs. Chen's restaurant?

353
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Mrs. Chen,

354
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
what nonsense are you talking about?

355
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm sorry.

356
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm sorry.

358
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
I've searched the restaurant's food.

359
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Only one of them is wild wild boar.

360
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
I heard that if you don't cook

361
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
and cook,

362
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
you'll be punished for your actions.

363
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
You can't open the restaurant.

364
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
You can't go there alone.

365
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
You can't kill people.

366
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm sorry.

367
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I can't kill people.

368
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
What can you do?

369
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
There are so many people in the mountain.

370
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
There are so many people.

371
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Mother saw it and killed it.

372
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Even if she ate it,

373
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
no one will harm her.

374
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
No one will harm her.

375
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Master, it's not that simple.

376
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
What are you talking about?

377
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
You have to say it here.

378
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
This is the record of the food for the day.

379
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
This chef knew that

380
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
in the old lady's soup,

381
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
there was a horse tree.

382
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
It was made of the same kind of incense.

383
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
But it was made of the same kind of incense.

384
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
It was used by the old lady for a long time.

385
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
This is why she was so angry.

386
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Master.

387
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Master, check it out.

388
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
I checked the prescription

389
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
of the old lady at home.

390
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
But I only saw the fire fire.

391
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
It's not reasonable.

392
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
How can I figure it out?

393
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
You're not reasonable.

394
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
But there is

395
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
a woman in the house.

396
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
She is a drug addict.

397
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Master.

398
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm not good at using people.

399
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I didn't take good care of the old lady.

400
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Please punish me.

401
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Father, the soup and medicine are high-end.

402
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
They are all made by the mother.

403
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
It's a waste of time.

404
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
It's just a stupid idea.

405
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I can't help it.

406
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Yes, father.

407
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
The old lady is in the house.

408
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
She was asked by the mother.

409
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
She was laughing at her mother.

410
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Forget it.

411
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Ruyan, get up.

412
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
It's a coincidence.

413
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
It's a coincidence.

414
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
A coincidence?

415
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Master.

416
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
It's about the old lady's health.

417
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
It's a coincidence.

418
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I'm afraid it's a disaster.

419
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
What do you want to do?

420
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Master.

421
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm sorry.

422
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
The incense is not common.

423
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
But the master did it.

424
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
It's suspicious.

425
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
No.

426
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
I sent you several incense sticks.

427
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
If you don't need it,

428
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm afraid it's broken.

429
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I didn't expect it to be a high-end incense stick.

430
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Master.

431
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
The mother's soup and medicine are similar.

432
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
There are so many incense sticks in the house.

433
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
What are you doing?

434
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
The kitchen is only made by the mother.

435
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,200
Why are you

436
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,800
hanging it in our shared yard?

437
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Yes.

438
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Miss, you are so good at playing.

439
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
The mother's soup and medicine are used by the master.

440
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
She never sent it to the kitchen.

441
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Really?

442
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
You still don't understand?

443
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Miss, you...

444
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Enough.

445
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Stop it.

446
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
You are so stubborn.

447
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
You should have lost your face.

448
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
You are so happy.

449
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Father.

450
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
You are in the court today.

451
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
You should know

452
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
what happened in the house.

453
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
It's a disaster.

454
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
How could you...

455
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Father, don't worry.

456
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Listen to me.

457
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
If you have any records in the military court,

458
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
if you are poisoned with food,

459
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
and you are in trouble,

460
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
you will be healed.

461
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
The mother is ill.

462
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
You should take it seriously.

463
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Aunt Sun.

464
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Go to the kitchen and cure the antidote.

465
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Drink it for the mother.

466
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Yes.

467
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Miss, you are so stubborn.

468
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
I will do it.

469
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
As for the mother's soup and medicine,

470
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,120
maybe it is cousin's Avengers'

471
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,800
and Datin' Consume's pot.

472
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,300
I think we should

473
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,800
remove it to fill the Formosa's level.

474
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Father, don't worry.

475
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Tan Yan,

476
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,420
how do you know these things?

477
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Today, Chief of Department of praising

478
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,600
the Jiang Family

479
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
hid all the troubles

480
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
due to the slanderer's finalmente visiting the gate.

481
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,800
It's best to make trouble on purpose,

482
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
his öyle and his husband's school.

483
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,440
He also got the郵局 to see

484
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,960
the tutor Lu Caidong

485
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,440
think more deeply

486
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,800
to increase the number of fun facts

487
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,080
all the way to be in charge.

488
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Theashing Bureau

489
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,640
has nothing to do with the ido.

490
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,800
but he didn't know my feelings at all.

491
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,080
On the contrary, his subordinates

492
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,280
investigated me so hard

493
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,640
that even my死 trees got in the way of hisoya.

494
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,600
He was the one heảns me,

495
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,960
but I believe that

496
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
the threehibo tomb rowers facing the king

497
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,260
were released to the territory.

498
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,560
Do not defame me,喔,

499
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,680
Hello? Say away.

500
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,620
You and those two

501
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,340
were deeply linked.

502
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,200
Did you not

503
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,200
tell them what you buried me?

504
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,000
You bastard!

505
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,440
You need to know what happened.

506

sort to end your career.

525
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,180
Detective Duan,

526
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,500
how dare you!

527
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,540
and make him handle you.

528
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,580
Let's see

529
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,780
who you really are.

530
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,300
You.

531
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,980
How dare you!

532
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,700
Han Yan.

533
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,620
You念头珠是想害我,

534
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,400
our Lord.

535
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,460
Han Yan.

536
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,340
Where are you going?

537
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,180
Father.

538
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,900
That man had over 70 prince numbers.

539
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,220
He Defeaters the Heavenly Lord.

540
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,820
You don't need to kill him

541
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,340
since he has too many powers.

542
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,580
I'm not a fool.

543
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm going to the palace

544
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,940
to pray for the noble.

545
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,700
If it's too late,

546
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,020
no one will be able to take care of me.

547
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,500
Master,

548
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,540
I don't need to say anything.

549
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,860
I heard that

550
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,700
the concubines in the palace

551
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
are a bit close.

552
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,060
Aunt Zhou,

553
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,220
if we pretend to be the family,

554
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,820
we know that this person is a liar.

555
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,180
But we know that

556
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,700
the palace is full of noble people.

557
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,780
I'm afraid that the East window will be exposed.

558
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,780
We will be in trouble.

559
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,220
What are you doing?

560
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,660
Even if the King of Heaven

561
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,500
is guilty,

562
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,700
I will be the one to hold it.

563
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
It's been 17 years.

564
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,180
You demon,

565
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,980
you should be the one to show your true colors.

566
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,900
I'll go.

567
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,220
I've told a doctor.

568
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,380
Are you drunk,

569
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,460
is it evil?

570
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,100
No.

571
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,580
andsomeness will be easily defeated

572
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,740
by falseargies.

573
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,360
A demon

574
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,860
is certainly a fake рd horse.

575
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,260
How is the fake èa oil?

576
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,300
What's wrong with you?

577
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,020
The hero is not asking about the origin.

578
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,700
It's not good to be born with a poor body.

579
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,380
But you've been called by the Immortal Sect for years.

580
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,540
What's wrong?

581
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,780
Do you still want to punish me for being innocent?

582
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,420
The Immortal Sect

583
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,820
cannot be punished for being a criminal.

584
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm sorry that I'm too young to pursue the net.

585
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,380
But

586
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,060
I've heard that Duan Zhenren has been attacked by the government for many years.

587
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,980
Duan Zhenren,

588
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,740
I can help you hide your life.

589
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,260
But you

590
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,500
want to give me a life.

591
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,460
What do you mean?

592
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,340
The two incidents 17 years ago

593
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,820
are behind the person who ordered them.

594
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,540
If you tell me the truth,

595
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,580
I'll promise to let you go.

596
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,980
If you insist,

597
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,220
I'll just let you go.

598
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,180
I heard that you're in jail

599
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,100
and you can't bear to punish a criminal

600
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,980
who doesn't speak up for you.

601
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
I said...

602
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,260
I said...

603
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,740
What are you doing?

604
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,660
Master, I didn't...

605
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,820
Zhou Yiniang,

606
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,220
you and Miss San used this to threaten me.

607
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,140
Now that the situation is exposed,

608
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

609
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Just give up.

610
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,940
Shut up!

611
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,780
Master,

612
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
why did you frame me like this?

613
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,940
No,

614
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,540
don't listen to him.

615
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,420
I saw it with my own eyes last night.

616
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,500
I even gave him a lot of money

617
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
to think of the three girls and Duan Zhenren.

618
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,580
I didn't take back the gold and silver jewelry.

619
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,100
I'll just keep it for myself.

620
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,020
Since you're so wise,

621
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,780
we don't need to go.

622
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,300
You admit it, right?

623
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,500
Lan'er,

624
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,620
when did you see Duan Zhenren's thoughts?

625
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,340
Good idea.

626
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,780
He's probably lost his temper.

627
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,300
Tell me about it then.

628
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
What is your opinion

629
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,900
of big- socioeconomic affairs?

630
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,380
I...

631
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,780
That means

632
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,980
you don't see the face of a woman?

633
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,860
This bride is a new for Lady Th comprendre.

634
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,580
There's nothing more.

635
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,820
Aunt Zhou,

636
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,980
you don't need to시

637
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,900
make any savings.

638
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,060
I'm afraid the bank bank

639
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,020
you gave me

640
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,100
isprove Liverpool now.

641
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,400
But we can ask огром

642
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,060
you did it in the same way.

643
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,860
My lady,

644
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,900
I am the WHOO

645
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,140
atteen ofECHoors.

646
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,260
You are the home of Greetings, your majesty.

647
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,300
If厉i doesn't honor me

648
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,420
at all,

649
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,860
I'm not afraid of her.

650
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,180
Adbreaker neitheralted

651
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,940
nor purified.

652
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,740
It's just啬

653
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,540
and appeared just to be하면 a rare crime.

654
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,140
Master.

655
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,900
Master.

656
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,660
Chen Shunshun is gone.

657
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,660
Madam.

658
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,660
Madam.

659
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Madam.

660
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
Ruyi.

661
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Madam.

662
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Ruyi.

663
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Madam.

664
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
Madam.

665
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Master.

666
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Let her go.

667
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,260
Let her go.

668
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Madam.

669
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
Madam.

670
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Why did you leave?

671
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
Miss.

672
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,540
How did you let her go?

673
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Cui An.

674
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,100
I've been wanting to get you out of here

675
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,540
every day and night.

676
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,540
I want to protect you.

677
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,540
Let you go.

678
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
You're so naive.

679
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
That day,

680
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,540
I was caught by the devils

681
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
who were watching me for years.

682
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
I finally got rid of them.

683
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
I finally

684
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,540
are out of this seclusion.

685
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,660
Don't be anxious.

686
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,780
But...

687
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,620
Han Jiangashii,

688
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,340
leave your friend alone here.

689
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,080
Ren Noeneshu

690
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,380
will not leave.

691
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,900
And he's not my son.

692
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,660
Ren Noeneshu,

693
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,780
don't worry.

694
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,820
Rose,

695
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,820
please leave me alone here.

696
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,900
Don't be anxious.

697
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,900
How can you be yourself?

698
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,160
I can accept you.

699
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,960
You can just break the spirit with my life.

700
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,540
I'll send your army to the island.

701
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,380
D momentos of Zhuang and Chi have gone completely quiet.

702
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,920
부� might be monocled with Zhuang Het How?"

703
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,600
Zhuang He segments in,

704
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,380
then curator Liu off the redirected Cl reinforcement of the local constitution.

705
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,700
and it's been a few days.

706
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,940
It's a mess.

707
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,180
My father said

708
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,420
the words of Duan Zhenren

709
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,700
are true and false.

710
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,220
We can't do anything about it.

711
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,380
We must deal with it with the government.

712
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,980
The play is a three-part play.

713
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,700
In the end,

714
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,420
a maid

715
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,100
took all the blame.

716
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,980
Mrs. Chen suddenly appeared.

717
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,900
She was prepared.

718
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,940
The role about mother

719
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,980
makes me countryw short of words,

720
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,460
while the secret lady

721
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,900
meio public believe

722
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,740
robbed me of my love.

723
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,420
Sounds like we sat in starters

724
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,460
with some words upon.

725
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,180
When we were cooking,

726
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,020
someone was in the middle of game.

727
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,900
No matter what,

728
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,980
the winner

729
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,620
will always be me.

730
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
But more importantly,

731
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,900
the person in the front will be more reliable.

732
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
It's all because Duan Tian Shi

733
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,900
was so arrogant and framed us.

734
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,900
It's been so many years that you've been in trouble.

735
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
It's all in the past.

736
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,900
You don't have to worry about me.

737
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
But you're not young anymore.

738
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,900
It's time to marry someone.

739
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
I've been crying for 17 years.

740
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
I finally got a home.

741
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
I want to

742
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
let my grandmother live for a while longer.

743
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Han Yan, listen to my advice.

744
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
A girl can't stand being alone.

745
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
It's been a day and a half.

746
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,900
It's time to turn around and become an old lady.

747
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
It's better to look at the good old lady earlier.

748
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,900
I'll listen to your advice.

749
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Bao Yue, what day is it?

750
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
Mrs. Liao, the month of the spicy moon is out.

751
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,900
It's also the day of the snowy snow.

752
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Snowy snow?

753
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Snowy snow is the plum of spicy and cold.

754
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
The capital has a plum shop.

755
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
When the winter comes,

756
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,900
we'll have a snowy snowy snowy moon.

757
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Let the young ladies have a look.

758
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
If there are two lovers,

759
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
the young ladies will be able to have a date

760
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
at the New Year's Day.

761
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
They'll be engaged to the empress.

762
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,900
Miss Liao, you're still blaming me.

763
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
What do you mean?

764
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,900
Father has already said that it's all a misunderstanding.

765
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,900
It's been a day and a half.

766
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,900
I've always been worried about you.

767
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
I'm just afraid that you'll think too much.

768
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
But I don't know

769
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,900
how to apologize to you.

770
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,900
What crime did you commit?

771
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Lan Er is a maid in the palace.

772
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,900
She grew up with Yushan.

773
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,900
I'm the one who's been doing nothing wrong.

774
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,900
I let her marry a thief and kill the mastermind.

775
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
I don't blame Lan Er.

776
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,900
She's just a newbie.

777
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Miss Liao, you're so kind.

778
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
You're joking.

779
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I was born in the capital but I grew up with my husband.

780
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
I'm not a coward.

781
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,900
I don't know what's on my mind.

782
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,900
I know that I'll get what I want.

783
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,900
Miss Lan, you're indeed the birth daughter of your mother.

784
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,900
The pink ribbon of the hunter is so natural.

785
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,900
You're the one who's been in the top position today.

786
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
You must be very lucky.

787
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,900
I'm worried.

788
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,900
Please accept my offer.

789
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Why are you still pretending?

790
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Are you leaving?

791
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
What are you doing?

792
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Second Sister is still unmarried.

793
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
She's older than me.

794
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
She's not married yet.

795
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
I've taken her head off.

796
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,900
You can wear these jewelry.

797
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,900
I hope you'll get married soon.

798
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
No, no.

799
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,900
When did I ever wear such a dirty thing?

800
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
You want me to be ugly, right?

801
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Ugly?

802
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,900
These are all made by my aunt.

803
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Do you mean that

804
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,900
my aunt made me go out and embarrass myself?

805
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
I...

806
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Miss Lan, you're joking.

807
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,900
Yushan is just a girl who doesn't like the three-flower gold.

808
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,900
She doesn't know how to dress.

809
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Little girl, I'll get married soon.

810
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
When can I wear these?

811
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
You're a good sister.

812
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,900
You can try them on.

813
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Your aunt won't blame me for being a flower fairy?

814
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Of course not.

815
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,900
That's good.

816
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Second Sister.

817
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,900
Second Sister's makeup today is so pretty.

818
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
It's like an entrance to the village.

819
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Shut up.

820
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Look at her.

821
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Come on, easy, bigger.

822
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
Why are you stopping?

823
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
Miss Lan.

824
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,800
Lets say,

825
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,860
This is nothingnin lady

826
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,300
Which family are you from?

827
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,780
I'm from Zhuang family.

828
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,980
Greetings, Your Excellency.

829
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,100
Are you going to Qiu Meiyuan?

830
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,460
Yes.

831
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,540
Where's the car?

832
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,220
Fangcai was there.

833
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,740
She suddenly disappeared.

834
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,900
If you don't mind,

835
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,420
you can go to my carriage.

836
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,060
I'll take you there.

837
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,540
I'm afraid it's not reasonable.

838
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,580
I'm Yuwen Chang'an.

839
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,460
It's the capital of the capital.

840
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,620
It's the same as the capital of the capital.

841
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,660
In conclusion,

842
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,420
you should call me Yuwen Bobo.

843
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,140
Get in the carriage.

844
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,180
I heard you've returned from Danzhou.

845
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,580
I didn't expect you to grow up.

846
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,740
Please forgive me.

847
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,700
Have you seen your mother?

848
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,500
You're so beautiful.

849
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,380
You're so young.

850
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,820
You're so talented.

851
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,780
But Yuwen Bobo and Jiaci are also old acquaintances.

852
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,100
They're not just old acquaintances.

853
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,180
Your grandfather was Han Linyuan's college student.

854
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,100
Shiyang and I were students at the gate.

855
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,060
We were very talented.

856
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,860
We were very talented in the capital.

857
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,820
Han Linyuan is a young talent.

858
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,700
At least she has a good luck.

859
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,580
Sorry.

860
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,580
I heard your mother's story many times.

861
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,100
It's a pity that you can't be so talented as Du Qi.

862
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,780
I shouldn't have said that

863
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,140
about your family's house.

864
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,660
But I still want to say something.

865
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,460
Your mother has her own reasons.

866
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,340
Don't hate her.

867
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,260
Of course.

868
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,060
I don't hate my mother.

869
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Good.

870
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,580
We're almost at the end of the road.

871
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,900
You can get off the carriage.

872
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,380
Don't make trouble for her.

873
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,180
Yes.

874
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,140
Thank you for your concern.

875
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,140
Stop the carriage.

876
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,060
Miss San.

877
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,980
It's been a long time.

878
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,380
The weather is getting better.

879
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,140
I'm worried about you.

880
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,140
On the way here,

881
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,900
I found a house of Miss San.

882
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,140
It's a special return home.

883
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,140
I'm sorry.

884
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,140
I'm sorry.

885
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
I'm sorry.

886
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
I'm sorry.

887
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,140
I'm sorry.

888
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,140
I'm sorry.

889
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,140
I'm sorry.

890
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,140
I'm sorry.

891
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
I'm sorry.

892
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,140
I'm sorry.

893
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,140
I'm sorry.

894
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,140
I'm sorry.

895
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,140
I'm sorry.

896
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
I'm sorry.

897
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
I'm sorry.

898
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,140
I'm sorry.

899
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
I'm sorry.

900
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,140
I'm sorry.

901
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
I'm sorry.

902
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,140
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,140
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,140
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,140
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,140
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,140
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,140
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,140
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,140
I'm sorry.

913
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
I'm sorry.

914
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,140
I'm sorry.

915
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,140
I'm sorry.

916
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,140
I'm sorry.

918
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,140
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,140
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,140
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,140
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,140
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,140
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,140
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,140
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,140
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,140
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,140
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,140
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,140
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,140
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,140
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,140
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
I'm sorry.

935
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,140
I'm sorry.

936
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
I'm sorry.

937
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
I'm sorry.

938
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,140
I'm sorry.

939
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,140
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,140
I'm sorry.
