I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,700
Because you probably might think that, but I'm not sure if you can keep the formula

3
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,920
Because you probably might think that, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it

4
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,320
Because you probably will see it

5
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,120
Because you probably will see this

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,640
But I don't think it will ground

7
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,800
But the next step is slowly

8
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,360
Slowly

9
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
From now on

10
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,460
Until

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,360
Right

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,540

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,980
on

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,240
think over the trouble.

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,600
Advalia Bluetooth

17
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,320
Shut down a hundred respects with you.

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,620
Um Childe

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,200
Better chose the wrong.

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,400
The little girl hasn't seen her hairpin

21
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Was it?

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Adapt-!?

23
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,000
Her hair was so recessed and she fell flat after running affair on evening

24
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,360
Of course she was a woman

25
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,120
She has such a subtle fluffy skin

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,820
It's shrimpy

27
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,440
Plus...

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,440
This пришelsess girl

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
has done nothing!

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,020
Although others Drop-stay

31
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,160
You dare not take my favour

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,960
I no longer worry

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,620
and use you to stay quiet for 5 minutes.

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,620
Don't know your husband's strength.

35
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,500
If I do not force you,

36
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,860
you can never offend my father.

37
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,420
Xiasu.

38
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,400
I can provide for you

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,120
thanks to you.

40
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:47,260
Our

41
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,420
Her parents living here

42
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,220
couldn't help it.

43
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Master Hunyan

44
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,900
will do the nicest thing

45
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,180
with Elder CEO.

46
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,300
Then,

47
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,140
I won't see am llamous midwife.

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,420
As for her hair specialty,

49
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,420
if Miss III can cure them,

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,260
I will only take them back

51
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,700
and give them to the Naili Temple.

52
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,380
Wait.

53
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,740
Miss III

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,660
has returned to the dorm.

55
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Since you have a gift for me,

56
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
I dare not take your beauty.

57
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,860
If I don't want to give it to you,

58
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
I wish you

59
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
to find a home soon.

60
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
Goodbye, father.

61
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
My love.

62
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
Third Younger Sister.

63
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,860
Guozhen is so brave.

64
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
She even dared to provoke him.

65
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Exactly.

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
I will tell father

67
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
how he taught you.

68
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
What do you want to report?

69
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
His father is now a man

70
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
who is on the loose.

71
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
He has killed many high officials

72
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,860
in the airport.

73
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,860
Everyone knows about it.

74
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,860
How dare you go to his city?

75
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,860
Don't blame me for being a coward.

76
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
Now, the capital is closed.

77
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,860
The business is in trouble.

78
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
Everyone wants his life.

79
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,860
He has been killed many times.

80
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,860
If he didn't have some skills,

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,860
he would have been killed.

82
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
If you don't want to go in,

83
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
you can be a widow.

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Don't play tricks on him.

85
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
You can kill yourself.

86
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,860
You can kill yourself.

87
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
Go.

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,860
Just kill yourself.

89
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Fuyunxi has been missing for days.

90
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,860
He has gone to the Danzhou.

91
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,860
I don't know how he found this house.

92
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,860
I don't know why he is so sad about this murder.

93
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
He is not willing to do anything for himself.

94
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,860
He didn't say anything about the murder.

95
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
But his eyes are like a knife.

96
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
I don't know what to decide.

97
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,860
After he returned to the city,

98
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
I waited for a long time.

99
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,860
He was gone again.

100
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,860
That's why I felt more uneasy.

101
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
How is he?

102
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
He has been in the capital for many years.

103
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
Before the left bank was arrested,

104
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,860
he was already dead.

105
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
He was in the middle of the night.

106
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,860
He was holding many secret treasures.

107
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,860
He used the secret of the missing people.

108
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,860
He used them to protect himself.

109
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
He has been assassinated.

110
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
Six times.

111
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,860
Kill him.

112
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Don't act rashly.

113
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
I know what to do.

114
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Wait.

115
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Don't hesitate.

116
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Go.

117
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Go.

118
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Send him a breath.

119
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
And prepare the empty bag.

120
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
Follow the instructions.

121
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
Give him to the Du Chaoyue.

122
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
Yes.

123
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
Bring the men from the Danzhou.

124
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
To my office.

125
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,860
Sir.

126
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,860
Why do you have so much concern for the Danzhou?

127
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
I have nothing to do.

128
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,860
I just want to see the report.

129
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,860
Although we know that

130
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,860
there is a reason for the left bank's case,

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
it is a dirty matter.

132
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,860
But there is no clue.

133
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
If you have any clue,

134
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
you can think of it as a plan.

135
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
Forget it.

136
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
It's late.

137
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Take a rest first.

138
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
I'll be back tomorrow.

139
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Yes.

140
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Sir, please wait.

141
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
Sir, please buy some soup.

142
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
Give me two.

143
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Okay.

144
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Sorry.

145
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Thank you, sir.

146
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Thank you, sir.

147
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Sir.

148
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Sir.

149
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Sir.

150
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Sir.

151
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
Sir.

152
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,860
Who are you?

153
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Why don't you dare to kill me?

154
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
I'm not a murderer.

155
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
I'm a murderer.

156
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
I'm a murderer.

157
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
I'm a murderer.

158
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm a murderer.

159
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm a murderer.

160
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
I'm a murderer.

161
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm a murderer.

162
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
I'm a murderer.

163
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,860
I'm a murderer.

164
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
I'm a murderer.

165
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
I'm a murderer.

166
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
I'm a murderer.

167
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
I'm a murderer.

168
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,860
I'm a murderer.

169
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
I'm a murderer.

170
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm a murderer.

171
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm a murderer.

172
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
I'm a murderer.

173
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
I'm a murderer.

174
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm a murderer.

175
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
I'm a murderer.

176
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,860
I'm a murderer.

177
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm a murderer.

178
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm a murderer.

179
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I'm a murderer.

180
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
I'm a murderer.

181
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
I'm a murderer.

182
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
I'm a murderer.

183
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm a murderer.

184
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,860
I'm a murderer.

185
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
I'm a murderer.

186
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
I'm a murderer.

187
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
I'm a murderer.

188
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
I'm a murderer.

189
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
I'm a murderer.

190
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
I'm a murderer.

191
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm a murderer.

192
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm a murderer.

193
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
I'm a murderer.

194
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
I'm a murderer.

195
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
I'm a murderer.

196
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
I'm a murderer.

197
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
I'm a murderer.

198
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm a murderer.

199
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
I'm a murderer.

200
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm a murderer.

201
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
I'm a murderer.

202
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
I'm a murderer.

203
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
I'm a murderer.

204
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
I'm a murderer.

205
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
I'm a murderer.

206
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
I'm a murderer.

207
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
I'm a murderer.

208
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
I'm a murderer.

209
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
I'm a murderer.

210
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
I'm a murderer.

211
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,860
I'm a murderer.

212
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,860
I'm a murderer.

213
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Han Yan.

214
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,860
Have you taken a rest?

215
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
Father.

216
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
It's cold outside.

217
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Father, come in.

218
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,860
Okay.

219
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
Han Yan.

220
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Have you taken a rest?

221
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Father.

222
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,860
It's cold outside.

223
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Father, come in.

224
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Don't be afraid.

225
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Han Yan.

226
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
I just want to ask

227
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
how the Qiuming Garden is.

228
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
What did Second Sister and Fourth Brother

229
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
say to Father?

230
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,860
These two kids

231
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
are worried about you.

232
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,860
They're afraid you'll be bullied.

233
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Don't worry, Father.

234
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
The Qiuming Garden

235
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860
is just an outdoor project.

236
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
The Qiuming Garden is just an outdoor project.

237
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
They just cut off

238
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
my hair and took it off.

239
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
That's why they said those words.

240
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,860
You know the most about the Qiuming Garden.

241
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
Father, of course, don't worry.

242
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,860
It's just...

243
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
Father, you can just say what you want.

244
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
I'm listening.

245
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,860
You're the enemy of our Zhuang family.

246
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
I'm afraid that some of them

247
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
have a bad reputation.

248
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,860
They've lost your reputation.

249
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
What reputation?

250
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Some of them are a bit too old-fashioned.

251
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
They said that our Zhuang family

252
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,860
is a good place

253
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
to help our sister.

254
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
They said that we should go to the Fu family

255
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
and make a living.

256
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
You can listen to them.

257
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Don't worry about it.

258
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Madam Tianfang?

259
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
You and the Fu family have a family.

260
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Do you know about this?

261
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
I have two questions.

262
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Fu Yunxi's father Fu Pingsheng

263
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
is in Libu Palace.

264
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
We're half-sisters.

265
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,860
We've been friends for a long time.

266
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
So we've decided to have a family.

267
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
It's just that

268
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Pingsheng is a good man.

269
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Pingsheng is a good man.

270
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,860
Has your father passed away?

271
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Last year.

272
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
I went to Danzhou

273
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
so my sister

274
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
joined the Fu family for me.

275
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
The Fu family joined the Fu family for the second year.

276
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Your sister

277
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,860
joined the Fu family for the second year.

278
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,860
We're both sad.

279
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
I can't take it anymore.

280
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,860
But I should have told you

281
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
about the fate of the family.

282
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
I should have told you

283
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
about this.

284
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I should have told you

285
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,860
about the cause of the cause of the cause.

286
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
The death of the poison.

287
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
The Jinrong family is a blood case.

288
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
It's a pity for Zhi.

289
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
Who is Zhi?

290
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,860
Yu Qin and Yunxi Xixia have a daughter.

291
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
She's a father of the Hua family.

292
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,860
She's five years old.

293
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,860
That day, you came back from Danzhou

294
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
and fainted at the door.

295
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
The first person to find you

296
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
was Zhi.

297
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
Sister, are you cold?

298
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
It's her.

299
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
She's the daughter of Fu Yunxi.

300
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Zhi has a mother.

301
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
She's not married yet.

302
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Now, the whole Fu family

303
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
is alone in the Yunxi family.

304
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
Han Yan, are you...

305
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
Are you...

306
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,860
Maybe I was cold

307
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
when I was out today.

308
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Then, take a rest.

309
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,860
I'll ask Shu Hong to get some herbs.

310
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Please, father.

311
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
It's okay.

312
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
I'm here today

313
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,860
to give you a few words.

314
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
You know it's good.

315
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
There's a wind outside.

316
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Don't catch a cold.

317
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
Take a rest.

318
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Yes.

319
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
You...

320
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

321
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
He was injured.

322
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,860
He was in his own house.

323
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,860
So, I secretly went into the house

324
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
and locked him in the door.

325
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
And I put the fire away.

326
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
What's wrong?

327
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Don't worry.

328
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,860
The Fu family will be gone tonight.

329
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
The government will be in charge tomorrow.

330
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,860
We'll be in charge of the accident.

331
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Where are you going?

332
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
Hurry up!

333
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,860
Hurry up!

334
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Hurry up!

335
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Hold on!

336
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Take him away!

337
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Hurry up!

338
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Come on!

339
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
Hurry up!

340
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
Hurry up!

341
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Hurry up!

342
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Hurry up!

343
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
Hurry up!

344
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Where's he?

345
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
Hurry up...

346
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
Come on...

347
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Hurry up, hurry up...

348
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
Just for fun.

349
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
No matter what happens,

350
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
Zhu Qiang will be in charge of the accident.

351
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
Hurry.

352
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,860
avors.

353
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
Hurry!

354
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
No, Mother.

355
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
Huh...

356
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,260
道園

357
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,740
We... My 걸로

358
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,500
I didn't start Лi

359
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Where?

360
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:47,180
but I had to enjoy myself

361
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180
I'm going to die.

362
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Daddy, I'll make you another one tomorrow.

363
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
Okay?

364
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,180
Daddy, you're talking about the tree.

365
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,180
You're going to die on the way to the Tang Dynasty.

366
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
I promise you.

367
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Water!

368
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
It's coming!

369
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
There's still water!

370
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,180
Hurry!

371
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Water!

372
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,180
Water!

373
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Water!

374
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:44,180
The King of the West, Wang Gu.

375
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,180
There's a woman left behind.

376
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,180
You didn't find out about this.

377
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,180
Why didn't you tell me?

378
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,180
What does it have to do with Jiazhai?

379
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Of course it has to do with him.

380
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Did I do anything wrong?

381
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Daddy!

382
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Daddy!

383
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
You're right.

384
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
I was wrong.

385
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Why?

386
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
Sister, you're here to give me a flower.

387
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,180
It's so beautiful.

388
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,180
Sister, I'll give it to my mother later.

389
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Sister, wait for me.

390
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Chaijing, you're Gu'er.

391
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I have a father and a mother,

392
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
but I'm half a Gu'er.

393
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
I'm innocent.

394
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,180
No matter what,

395
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
we can't let this world

396
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
have another bitter girl.

397
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,180
But

398
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
we've made her angry.

399
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm afraid you can't stay in the capital anymore.

400
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Tomorrow morning,

401
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
when the city gate is open,

402
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,180
you'll leave the capital and get out of the capital.

403
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
The garden is free.

404
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
It's natural.

405
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
Everything is in the way.

406
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,180
The inner and outer are precious.

407
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,180
When you go to the peach garden,

408
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,180
you'll see the people who will take you there.

409
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
More people will come to the peach garden

410
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
to enjoy the new season.

411
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
These are all the treasures I have.

412
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
You keep them.

413
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
What about you?

414
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,180
You'll leave the capital first.

415
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
Don't worry about me.

416
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
Zhou Hanye.

417
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Father asked you to have breakfast with him.

418
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,180
Let's go.

419
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
I had a cold last night.

420
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
I still can't go.

421
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,180
I'm sick.

422
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
You're sick all day.

423
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
The father and the aunt are here.

424
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,180
They're calling you.

425
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Why don't you show up?

426
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
If you don't go,

427
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
they'll think we're a gang.

428
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
They won't eat for you.

429
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
Why is he here?

430
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
How would I know?

431
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
Let's go.

432
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Don't be so anxious.

433
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Hurry up.

434
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,180
The money is the foreign property.

435
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,180
It's a crime to be safe.

436
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Father, you're right.

437
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
Father,

438
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
you're here.

439
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Han Yan is here.

440
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Have a seat.

441
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Han Yan greets Father.

442
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Greetings, Father.

443
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Don't mind, Miss.

444
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,180
I'm afraid

445
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,180
you didn't know

446
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
that our father

447
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,180
had a big fire

448
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
and burned the entire house.

449
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
Are you feeling better?

450
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
My parents are safe.

451
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
The house is safe and sound.

452
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,180
But the house is burnt.

453
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,180
I need some time to fix it.

454
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
I'm so lucky.

455
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
Let's eat.

456
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
I came here today

457
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,180
to ask for your help.

458
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
You're welcome.

459
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,180
We can do anything.

460
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,180
We can fix it.

461
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
We need

462
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,180
to fix the house.

463
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
This morning,

464
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
I came here to visit you.

465
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
But you're still young.

466
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,180
It's inconvenient to stay outside.

467
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,180
Our father is not very good in the capital.

468
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,180
So,

469
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,180
I want to borrow some money

470
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
from your family.

471
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,180
If you don't mind,

472
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
of course, you don't need to force me.

473
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
No, no.

474
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
The year is coming.

475
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Let's spend the Spring Festival together.

476
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
It's good, right?

477
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Yes.

478
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,180
I'm a father.

479
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
I often miss Zhi.

480
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,180
You two stay here.

481
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
I'm happy.

482
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
From now on,

483
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,180
I'll be

484
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
the one to take care of you.

485
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
I'm sorry.

486
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,180
I'm sorry.

489
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
I have to play the piano.

491
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,180
Can you play the piano?

492
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,180
Just stay at home.

493
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
The house is busy.

494
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
Xu is the only one

495
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
who has two brothers.

496
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
I'm afraid he'll be here soon.

497
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
Please let me know.

498
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Of course.

499
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
You can do whatever you want.

500
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,180
Our family

501
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
is not in a hurry.

502
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
Yunxi,

503
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
I'll go and pack the jade scroll.

504
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
If you need anything,

505
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
just tell me.

506
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
By the way,

507
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
Miss San,

508
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
where are you going now?

509
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,180
I...

510
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,180
I live in the palace of the royal family of Zhou Yi.

511
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
How far away is the jade scroll?

512
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
About one wall.

513
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
That's good.

514
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Gu Yan, you...

515
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
You are...

516
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
The case of Danzhou

517
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
is not yet known.

518
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,180
It's easier for me

519
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
to ask

520
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,180
when I live near Miss San.

521
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Gu Yan, you're too much.

522
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
You're always in trouble.

523
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
You're already dead.

524
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,180
You're being killed again.

525
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Please take care of

526
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,180
the real brother.

527
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
Of course.

528
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
When the real brother is dead,

529
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
the real brother will be out of the house.

530
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
In the meantime,

531
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,180
I'd like to ask you all

532
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
to come and see him together.

533
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
I'm full.

534
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
I'll be back.

535
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,180
Yushan.

536
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,180
This is Yushan.

537
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Hurry up and have a look.

538
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Master,

539
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
don't worry.

540
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
I think the family's caretaker

541
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,180
really loves his daughter.

542
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,180
That's why she's asking for help.

543
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Our daughter-in-law

544
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
is not easy.

545
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,180
Now that she's taken this step,

546
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,180
she's already taken the 100 steps behind her.

547
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
She'll be the best judge.

548
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Today,

549
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,180
I'm going to ask you

550
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,180
to take care of the real brother.

551
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,180
He does look a little annoying.

552
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,180
Yushan doesn't let people worry.

553
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,180
The wedding is delayed for so many years.

554
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,180
She's going to marry her husband to make a house.

555
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
He's obviously a brother.

556
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,180
He's always in the brotherhood.

557
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,180
Look at him today.

558
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,180
He's so stubborn and jealous.

559
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
He's making people laugh.

560
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Master is right.

561
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,180
I'll take care of Yushan.

562
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
But

563
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,180
the husband and the husband

564
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,180
are so strange.

565
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,180
Now that the family is in the middle of the world,

566
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
and they're so poor,

567
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
I wonder if they're alive.

568
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
What are you doing?

569
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,180
I just want you to be warm.

570
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Do you want to burn us again?

571
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm sorry.

572
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Get out of here.

573
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
Get out of here.

574
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
I was too late.

575
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
I just realized

576
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,180
why you were always against me.

577
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
You even made me afraid

578
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
to stay away from my husband.

579
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,180
I was afraid I'd be in his way.

580
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,180
You were the one who kept your husband away from you.

581
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,180
That year,

582
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
you decided to let him marry you.

583
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,180
But he's still in a hurry.

584
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
He's still in a big trouble.

585
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
He should thank you.

586
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,180
Otherwise, he'd be the one

587
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
who was killed in the house behind the husband.

588
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
You know everything, my lady.

589
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
You told me everything.

590
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,180
You wanted to drive me out of the house.

591
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,180
Now, you're so reasonable.

592
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
After all, I'm the one who made this marriage.

593
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
Of course, he can't tolerate me.

594
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
You go out first.

595
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,180
I'll call you if there's anything.

596
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,180
Yes.

597
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Am I still in a dream?

598
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,180
He threatened me a few times,

599
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
but he didn't even think about it.

600
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,180
I'm still in a strange place.

601
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,180
What exactly does he want?

602
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
I'm still in a state of helplessness.

603
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
I can kill him again.

604
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
No.

605
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
He lived in a place

606
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
where I only had a wall.

607
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Maybe he wanted to warn me.

608
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
If he's not clear,

609
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
and died in the house behind the husband,

610
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
I can't get rid of him.

611
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
What about the next step?

612
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
No matter what,

613
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
he'll be in trouble.

614
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,180
My lady,

615
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
the husband is invited.

616
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,180
You go find a safe place first.

617
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
Wait for my news.

618
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,180
Okay.

619
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,180
What does he want me to do?

620
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,180
I don't know.

621
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,180
I'll go by myself.

622
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Yes.

623
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Xiaoman, look.

624
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,180
You're so good.

625
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,180
You can at least be a new mother.

626
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
I still have work to do.

627
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
I'll be back late tonight.

628
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,180
I'm not in a hurry.

629
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,180
I'll go and bring the silk-dried man.

630
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,180
I'm so good.

631
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Who are you looking for?

632
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
I've seen pretty girls.

633
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Are you here to play with me?

634
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Of course.

635
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,180
Come and see.

636
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,180
Is my brother's new mother pretty?

637
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
She's pretty,

638
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
but not as pretty as Ah-zhi.

639
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,180
He ate too much porridge today.

640
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
He needs to eat less tonight.

641
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,180
I have to go to the Dali Temple to take care of the house every day.

642
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,180
I have no time to bring him.

643
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
From now on,

644
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,180
I'll leave Ah-zhi to you.

645
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
Why?

646
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Don't you want to play with Ah-zhi?

647
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
No.

648
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,180
Of course, I like Ah-zhi.

649
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,180
Then, I'll be at ease.

650
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
Ah-zhi.

651
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,180
I'm leaving.

652
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Remember to listen to Aunt Hanye.

653
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
I'll come back to pick you up tonight.

654
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,180
I'll be back.

655
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Bye, brother.

656
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,180
After you.

657
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,180
Bye.

658
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Take good care of him for me.

659
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
Otherwise, you'll know the consequences.

660
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
Why me?

661
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
You're so cold and cold.

662
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,180
You're so calm.

663
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Don't be so anxious.

664
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,180
The wind is blowing.

665
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Let's take our dad to the wind.

666
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
Okay, sister?

667
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Okay.

668
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
Ah-zhi.

669
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
You should call me aunt.

670
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
But Ah-zhi is the last one.

671
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Her name is Yushan.

672
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,180
I'm Aunt Hanye.

673
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Aunt Hanye?

674
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,180
You're also my mom's sister.

675
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
Yes.

676
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Ah-zhi is so smart.

677
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Ah-zhi.

678
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,180
Why are you here?

679
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
Where's your dad?

680
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Yushan.

681
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Aunt Hanye.

682
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,180
My dad went to the ceremony.

683
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,180
Ah-zhi.

684
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180
You should go out with aunt Hanye.

685
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,180
I'll take you to the school.

686
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,180
I'll teach you how to shoot.

687
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
No.

688
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,180
Dad asked me and Hanye to be together.

689
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
I can't go anywhere.

690
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Sister?

691
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
You're so good.

692
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,180
You dare to be her stepmother?

693
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Sister.

694
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Ah-zhi is still here.

695
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Please be careful.

696
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
You're here to teach me.

697
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,180
Ah-zhi, let's go.

698
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,180
You're so ugly.

699
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
Ah-zhi.

700
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,180
I'll buy you some candies.

701
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,180
No.

702
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Yushan, I can't go.

703
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Let's go.

704
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
I can't go.

705
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Yushan, I can't go.

706
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
Go.

707
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
Ah-zhi.

708
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,180
What are you doing?

709
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,180
Ah-zhi.

710
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
What are you doing?

711
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,180
I'm going to get my father.

712
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Sister, listen to me.

713
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,180
I don't want to fight with you.

714
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,180
I don't want to help my son-in-law.

715
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,180
I don't have any feelings for him.

716
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
You don't have to make it difficult for me.

717
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
I...

718
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,180
What does it have to do with me and Yunxi?

719
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,180
We're both women.

720
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,180
We don't need to be friends.

721
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
We're not friends.

722
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
We are sisters.

723
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
We're both women.

724
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
We don't need to be so harsh.

725
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,180
What's the point of being harsh?

726
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,180
I just can't stand you.

727
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
Qiaoyun,

728
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,180
open the window in the third-sister's room.

729
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
I want to see

730
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,180
if Ah-zhi is a cold and hot person.

731
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Yes.

732
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I'll go with the fire.

733
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Third-sister.

734
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,180
Second-sister.

735
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
Ah-zhi is Fuyunxi who personally taught me.

736
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
She told me to protect her.

737
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
If you insist on doing this,

738
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
I won't be like the previous one

739
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
and make you mad.

740
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
Think about it.

741
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,180
If Ah-zhi finds a cold,

742
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
will Fuyunxi

743
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
take your position?

744
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,180
Don't think that

745
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,180
you can scare me with your words.

746
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,180
Please understand, Second-sister.

747
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
I don't want to make you suffer.

748
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,180
But I can't leave Ah-zhi to you today.

749
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,180
When Fuyunxi comes back from the Dali Temple,

750
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
you can come here yourself.

751
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
You can say that you want to help me.

752
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
I'm happy to see you.

753
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Do you think so?

754
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,180
Let go of my hand.

755
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
You're going to destroy me.

756
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Don't be sad, Ah-zhi.

757
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,180
We can still be more beautiful.

758
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
Okay.

759
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
You're so strange.

760
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
You must go back

761
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
to your good things.

762
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
What do you mean?

763
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,180
You don't like this seal.

764
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,180
You want to break it.

765
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
You don't like my house.

766
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,180
You want to burn them all.

767
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Your house

768
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,180
is your father's house.

769
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,180
He didn't burn it.

770
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,180
He said it was a candle.

771
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,180
That's why he burned it.

772
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,180
When he was in the house,

773
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,180
his mother came to pick up the fire.

774
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,180
She said that the water from the chicken

775
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,180
could be extinguished.

776
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,180
But he always came to his mother.

777
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Why did your father stop him?

778
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,180
I don't know.

779
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,180
I was sleeping in a deep sleep.

780
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,180
I only heard what he said.

781
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,180
Since he burned it,

782
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,180
he must have burned it.

783
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,180
He even lit several candles.

784
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,180
Aunt Han, what's wrong?

785
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,180
Aunt Han?

786
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,180
Your father is young

787
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,180
and can be a young man in the palace.

788
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,180
Aunt Han, are you praising him?

789
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,180
I'm not praising him.

790
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
I admire him.

791
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,180
My lord.

792
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,180
Why are you here

793
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,180
to do nothing?

794
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,180
I went back to the capital a few days ago.

795
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
I came to the garden.

796
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,180
My lord saw a car parked at the door.

797
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,180
He even went in with the fire.

798
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,180
I didn't even go in.

799
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
I went to the bank to find the water.

800
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,180
I searched for it for you personally.

801
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
Really?

802
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
My lord, you're going to the river.

803
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
Do you know what I like?

804
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
I don't know.

805
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
I'll find it for you

806
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
according to my standards.

807
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
What's your standard?

808
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,180
I'll pay for it.

809
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,180
It's good for health?

810
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,180
It's not bad for health.

811
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,180
I'd rather be a good man.

812
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,180
My lord, are you confused?

813
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,180
In the capital,

814
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,180
people eat good people.

815
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,180
People eat good people.

816
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,180
If you don't want to be a fish

817
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,180
that can be cut into pieces,

818
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,180
good women can eat good people.

819
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,180
But bad women can be protected.

820
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
If you marry a woman like this,

821
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,180
it's always like this in the capital.

822
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
It's late.

823
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,180
Go home and take care of yourself.

824
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,180
My lord, you're right.

825
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,180
It's obviously because of the law.

826
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Think about it.

827
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,180
How did you get your ex-wife to live?

828
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
You...

829
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Where's Zhi?

830
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,180
He's gone to sleep.

831
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,180
Thank you for today.

832
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,180
I'll be in trouble tomorrow.

833
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
Wait.

834
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
What?

835
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Anything else?

836
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Zhi's mother.

837
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,180
How did our sister die?

838
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
She was poisoned.

839
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Who poisoned her?

840
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
I only poisoned her.

841
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
I only poisoned the poison.

842
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,180
She was innocent and was killed by me.

843
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,180
She was poisoned by the poison.

844
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
That's why she died.

845
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,180
Why do you want to kill the people in the capital?

846
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
Well,

847
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,180
you should know it better.

848
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Because I know you can't see the light.

849
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
I'll kill you.

850
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Brother Ling Xi.

851
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,180
Greetings, Miss Er.

852
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Greetings, Miss Er.

853
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,180
Brother Ling Xi.

854
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,180
I've seen Zhi grow up.

855
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180
Why did you have to teach her to pretend to be a man?

856
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
And she's never seen Zhi before.

857
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,180
You're a bit too old-fashioned.

858
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
I...

859
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,180
You're even more patient.

860
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Did you see her?

861
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
It's late.

862
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
I should go back.

863
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Thank you, Miss Er.

864
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
I'll send Zhi back tomorrow.

865
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,180
You should rest early.

866
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Brother Ling Xi.

867
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,180
Lord Zhuang.

868
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
What do you want to do?

869
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,180
What's the meaning of sister Er's words?

870
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,180
Don't pretend there.

871
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,180
Tell me the truth.

872
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
What did you scare her with?

873
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
You've already wasted your marriage.

874
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,180
You really want to marry her?

875
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,180
I don't understand what sister Er is talking about.

876
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,180
What?

877
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,180
Don't think that you're so selfish.

878
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
You've read your uncle's script in the country.

879
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,180
You can be a fan of the capital.

880
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
I'm telling you.

881
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
I'm the queen of Qingmei.

882
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
We grew up together.

883
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,180
You have no chance.

884
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,180
Don't make trouble for sister Er.

885
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,180
I'm going to rest.

886
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
You don't know.

887
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
I haven't finished yet.

888
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
Father.

889
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
Zhi is awake.

890
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,180
Why are you so happy?

891
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
What are you laughing at?

892
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,180
Zhi's wooden horse waist is burned.

893
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,180
He found the murderer.

894
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
He avenged Zhi.

895
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,180
Who is the murderer?

896
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,180
Secret.

897
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,180
I don't understand

898
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,180
what's the purpose of Fu Yunxi.

899
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
He seems to have seen through all my lies.

900
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,180
But he didn't take off his clothes.

901
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,180
He's like a rose.

902
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
He's the first to know the truth behind me.

903
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,180
He's the one who doesn't know the truth.

904
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,180
But he doesn't know the truth.

905
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,180
That kind of double-edged sword.

906
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,180
I'm so happy to be found by others.

907
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,180
It's hard to bear.

908
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,180
That night,

909
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,180
I couldn't help myself to find Fu Yunxi.

910
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,180
I had to tell him everything.

911
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,180
I didn't know that.

912
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,180
I didn't know that.

913
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
I didn't know that.

914
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
I didn't know that.

915
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
I didn't know that.

916
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
I didn't know that.

917
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,180
I didn't know that.

918
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,180
I didn't know that.

919
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,180
I didn't know that.

920
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,180
I didn't know that.

921
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,180
I didn't know that.

922
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,180
I didn't know that.

923
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,180
I didn't know that.

924
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,180
I didn't know that.

925
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,180
I didn't know that.

926
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,180
I didn't know that.

927
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,180
I didn't know that.

928
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,180
I didn't know that.

929
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
I didn't know that.

930
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,180
I didn't know that.

931
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,180
I didn't know that.

932
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,180
I didn't know that.

933
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,180
I didn't know that.

934
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
I didn't know that.

935
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,180
I didn't know that.

936
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,180
I didn't know that.

937
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,180
I didn't know that.

938
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,180
I didn't know that.

939
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
