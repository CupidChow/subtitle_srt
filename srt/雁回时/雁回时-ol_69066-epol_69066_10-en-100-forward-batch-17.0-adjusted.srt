00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,150
(The memories of my origins)

3
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,510
(have long since faded.)

4
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,310
(I do not know where I was born,)

5
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
(nor do I know)

6
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,400
(where my parents are.)

7
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,870
(Since I can remember,)

8
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
(I have made a living on a boat.)

9
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,070
(For a long time,)

10
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,790
(I did not understand emotions.)

11
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,070
(I only knew what exchange was.)

12
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,430
(The old boat master gave me food)

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,230
(and a bed to rest upon.)

14
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,150
(So, he was my master,)

15
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,430
(and I had to be loyal to him.)

16
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,960
(Even if I was trained
to be an assassin,)

17
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,910
(I had to become)

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,870
(the sharpest blade
in my master's hand.)

19
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,030
What are you doing?

20
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Who are you?

21
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,360
Where is this place?

22
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,630
My name is Chai Jing.

23
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,920
What is your name?

24
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,430
My name is Zhuang Hanyan.

25
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,870
They all call me

26
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,070
the barefoot ghost.

27
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,120
Do you have any food?

28
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,590
Eat slowly.

29
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,600
What is that on your hand?

30
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,070
My foster mother wants to lock me up.

31
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Do not be afraid.

32
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,350
Come on.

33
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,150
Give me your hand.

34
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,160
(I drifted across the sea for years.)

35
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,830
(I thought)

36
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,480
(I'd be cut off from the world forever.)

37
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,190
(Yet I never expected)

38
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
(to form)

39
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,920
(such a bond with her.)

40
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,870
After an hour,

41
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,360
we will reach the Capital.

42
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,360
You are already free.

43
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,910
Why must you return

44
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,830
to the Zhuang Residence?

45
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,000
I've missed that place since childhood.

46
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,510
At least, I want to see

47
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,830
what my home looks like.

48
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,720
Do you not want to go to sea with me?

49
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Chai Jing,

50
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,190
I know you are not used to life on land.

51
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,120
You can leave on your own.

52
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,830
You do not need to stay by my side.

53
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,600
I can take care of myself.

54
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,120
(She saved my life,)

55
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
(tended to my wounds,)

56
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,600
(and gave me food.)

57
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,800
(It was she who made me realize)

58
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
(my life)

59
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,100
(was not as insignificant
as an insect's.)

60
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,190
(In those years,)

61
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,720
(she treated me as a sister,)

62
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,160
(but I knew)

63
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,390
(she was my new master.)

64
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,290
(If she wished to pluck the stars,)

65
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,000
(I would carve my bones into steps.)

66
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,160
(If anyone sought to harm her,)

67
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,680
(I would stand)

68
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,750
(as her strongest shield.)

69
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,830
(No matter what she wanted to do,)

70
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,270
(I'd give my all to help her)

71
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,110
(and protect her)

72
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
(until death.)

73
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Speak.

74
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,430
Where are your accomplices hiding?

75
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,630
I would like to see

76
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,320
just how tough you can be.

77
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,350
Do you regret it?

78
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,150
No.

79
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,780
=Episode 10=

80
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,320
Miss, you are awake.

81
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,420
I'll go inform the master at once.

82
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,350
Don't.

83
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,390
Hanyan.

84
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm glad you are awake.

85
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,670
I'm glad you are awake.

86
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
Thanks to the Bodhisattva.

87
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,360
Miss Hanyan is so fortunate.

88
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,480
She even escaped the bandits.

89
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,440
Even if the Judicial Review
is like hell,

90
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,000
she has nothing to fear.

91
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,790
I am so overjoyed

92
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,880
that I forgot to ask.

93
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,360
Why did the Judicial Review
suddenly release you?

94
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,790
That officer did not explain it.

95
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,750
I know

96
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,040
nothing of this.

97
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,960
Did they torture you?

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,840
What happened to your face?

99
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,960
It is just a small injury.

100
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Sorry for being unfilial

101
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
and making Grandmother and Father worry.

102
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,360
Miss Hanyan, you must rest well.

103
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,630
You just escaped death.

104
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,510
You mustn't exhaust yourself.

105
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,510
Father,

106
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,270
I am weary today.

107
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,750
I would like to rest early.

108
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
Very well.

109
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,480
We will speak in detail tomorrow.

110
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,020
Mother,

111
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,560
you should go rest as well.

112
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,870
Rest well.

113
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,600
Master,

114
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,790
Mr. Fu is here.

115
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,750
The culprit has been caught?

116
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,840
During the sacrifice yesterday,

117
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,230
with many irrelevant people present,

118
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,790
I could not reveal the truth.

119
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,470
In fact, the culprit
of the Danzhou bandit case

120
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,720
was captured long ago.

121
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,090
As this case may be linked

122
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,030
to another classified case,

123
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,510
I kept the matter secret

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,870
and had the culprit detained elsewhere

125
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,100
for further interrogation.

126
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,440
Since this has escalated

127
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,000
and damaged Miss Hanyan
and my reputation,

128
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,270
I had to hand the culprit over

129
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,270
to the Judicial Review
for investigation.

130
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,910
What is the classified case
you speak of?

131
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,910
I cannot disclose it now.

132
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,000
Sorry for asking too much.

133
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,600
Please forgive me.

134
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,140
Yunxi, thank you for solving the case.

135
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,260
Youchang and his wife can rest in peace,

136
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,940
and my daughter's name has been cleared.

137
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,980
I do not know
how to repay this kindness.

138
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,140
Mr. Zhuang, I just did my job.

139
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,960
If there's nothing else,

140
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,020
I shall take my leave.

141
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,400
I'll see you off.

142
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,740
Mr. Fu,

143
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,780
what does the culprit look like?

144
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,300
Was it truly a woman?

145
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,220
As Miss Hanyan testified,

146
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,740
it was done by bandits.

147
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,380
I can say no more for now.

148
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,140
Since returning to the Capital,

149
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
the Danzhou case has weighed heavily
on my mind.

150
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,420
The other day,

151
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,060
before the Bodhisattva, the deities,
and the ancestors,

152
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,540
I was falsely accused

153
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,340
of murdering my foster parents.

154
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,980
The grievance in my heart
was beyond words.

155
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,200
Thankfully, the truth has been revealed,
and the culprit has been captured.

156
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,780
I am the only eyewitness
to the Danzhou case.

157
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,780
Both emotionally and logically,

158
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,900
I should go to the Judicial Review
as a witness with you.

159
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,660
Hanyan makes a good point..

160
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,260
- Why not...
- It's not necessary.

161
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,940
The Judicial Review has its procedures.

162
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,500
If Miss Hanyan is needed,

163
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,940
I will summon her.

164
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,220
Yunxi, let me walk you out.

165
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,220
Ms. Zhou,

166
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,700
that maid Lang...

167
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,500
The day she was cast out,

168
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,700
I ordered her to go to Danzhou
to investigate.

169
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,740
Good for her to track down Yang Ping.

170
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,500
Give her some money and have her

171
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,980
leave the Capital quietly.

172
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,420
She must never return.

173
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,660
Understood.

174
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,660
Nanny Tao,

175
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,300
tell me.

176
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,620
Were Zhang Youchang and his wife

177
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,020
truly killed by bandits?

178
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,140
I don't think so.

179
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,500
Miss Hanyan

180
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,460
can't be innocent.

181
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,740
But he said the culprit had been caught.

182
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,220
Could they have found someone

183
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,780
to be the scapegoat for Zhuang Hanyan?

184
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,020
Yet Chief Minister Yan
has always been strict.

185
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,740
How could he be deceived so easily?

186
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,660
- Indeed.
- And he also said

187
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,540
that this is connected
to another classified case.

188
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,020
I really do not understand

189
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
what game they are playing.

190
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,140
Ms. Zhou, how cunning of you.

191
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,540
You knew Zhuang Hanyan was watching me,

192
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,900
so you discarded me like a used pawn.

193
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,380
Mr. Yang, you are being paranoid.

194
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,220
That day,
I waited for you for a long time.

195
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,380
You acted so recklessly,

196
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,260
and Zhuang Hanyan still escaped.

197
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,940
Anyway, I gave you the autopsy report.

198
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,060
Did you bring the money

199
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,980
we agreed upon?

200
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,220
This is not enough.

201
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,060
You only completed half the task,

202
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,020
so you only get half the payment.

203
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,460
A fellow scholar says

204
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,420
there is a way to buy
an official position,

205
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,100
but it requires 300 taels.

206
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,580
Yet my pockets are truly empty.

207
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,540
What does that have to do with me?

208
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,220
If you cannot raise the money,

209
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,660
I cannot guarantee what I might say.

210
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,940
The commotion at the Yinan Guild Hall

211
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,060
has brought disgrace to the Zhuangs.

212
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,720
Everyone will be surprised to know
you're behind it.

213
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,020
How dare you?

214
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,220
Why should I be afraid?

215
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,540
This time, for the sacrifice
at the Yinan Guild Hall

216
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,740
and delicacies for the Spring Festival,

217
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,140
the accounts have been running
at a deficit.

218
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,300
Where would I find 200 taels of silver?

219
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,940
You've been favored
in the family for years

220
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,220
and now oversee the household.

221
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,020
You will find a way.

222
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,420
Deliver the money

223
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,220
to this guild hall
by tomorrow at the latest.

224
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,660
I know you are a ruthless woman

225
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,900
and have prepared a backup plan.

226
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
If you try to harm me in secret,

227
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,540
this will spread like wildfire,

228
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,740
and the entire city will know.

229
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,380
I take my leave.

230
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,740
You...

231
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,420
Leave me.

232
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,740
Miss Hanyan, rest well.

233
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,500

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,660
(Court of the Judicial Review)

235
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,500
Stop.

236
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,980
Who are you?

237
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,400
I am Zhuang Hanyan
from the Zhuang family.

238
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,500
I want to see Mr. Fu.

239
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,620
Mr. Fu is busy.

240
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,920
He's not receiving guests today.

241
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,360
Please inform him.

242
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,500
Mr. Fu told us this morning.

243
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,680
He is not seeing anyone today.

244
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,900
Miss Hanyan, please return.

245
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,580
You mustn't trespass
on a restricted area.

246
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,380
Sorry, Miss Hanyan.

247
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,620
(Court of the Judicial Review)

248
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,740
(Court of the Judicial Review)

249
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,940
What's the name of the bandit captured

250
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,260
by the Judicial Review yesterday?

251
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,000
(Study Room)
It concerns a classified case.

252
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,060
I can't disclose it.

253
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,300
Have you seen Chai Jing recently?

254
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,580
Who is Chai Jing?

255
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,420
I do not know.

256
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,660
Mr. Fu,

257
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,660
everything you said

258
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,780
at my home today

259
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,820
was a lie, right?

260
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,860
You knew Chai Jing was innocent,

261
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,460
yet you branded her a murderer
and had her imprisoned

262
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
and tortured, right?

263
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,680
As the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review,

264
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,100
you violated the law despite knowing it.

265
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,420
It's punishable by death, right?

266
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm the culprit
of the Danzhou murder case.

267
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,220
I killed Zhang Youchang and his wife.

268
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I've come here today to turn myself in.

269
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,300
Mr. Fu, please release the innocent.

270
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,020
I offer my life in exchange.

271
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,940
Fu Yunxi, let go of me.

272
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,200
She came to prison voluntarily.

273
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,140
I did not force her.

274
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,600
If you continue to make a scene,

275
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,560
you'll fail to save her,

276
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,860
and both of you will die.

277
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,460
Is there a way to save her?

278
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,580
She's confessed in the imperial prison.

279
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,500
She can never retract her statement.

280
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,060
Is there no other way?

281
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
At this point,

282
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,660
there is no need for us to lie.

283
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,900
Tell me everything

284
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,980
and all the hidden details

285
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,860
about the Danzhou murder case.

286
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,100
According to Zhang Youchang,

287
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,860
he came from a poor family

288
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,100
and studied hard since childhood.

289
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,380
He claimed to be well-versed
in the classics

290
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,460
but failed the exams repeatedly.

291
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,660
He watched helplessly as my father,

292
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,060
Zhuang Shiyang, a mediocre man,
rose to fame.

293
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,260
He'd been secretly hating him
for a long time,

294
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,900
and he also began to resent me.

295
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,410
Youchang...

296
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,240
- Over the years,
- Stop, stop.

297
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,860
his life was difficult,

298
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,900
and his temper grew more violent.

299
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,580
As his wife could not conceive,

300
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,940
he often beat her.

301
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,500
My foster mother, angered by this,

302
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,860
would vent her frustrations on me.

303
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,020
Since childhood,

304
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,100
I'd endured countless tortures
in that house,

305
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,980
as if I were in hell.

306
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,220
I could bear all of this

307
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,060
but

308
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,980
on my 17th birthday...

309
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,780
Where did the money go?

310
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,460
What are you doing?

311
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,900
Where did you hide the valuables?

312
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,980
Bring them out.

313
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,940
I have no money left.

314
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,460
You've spent it all.

315
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,700
What valuables are left?

316
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,060
If you have the guts, sell me.

317
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,380
Who would want you?

318
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,380
Sell her. She's worth something.

319
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,340
You've raised her for 17 years

320
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,400
without gaining anything.

321
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,060
Sell her to a brothel,

322
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,540
and you'll have money for wine.

323
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,220
At that moment,

324
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,140
Zhang Youchang's gaze towards me

325
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,500
still sends chills

326
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,500
down my spine.

327
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,500
Hold her down. Bring the rope.

328
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,020
You want to run?

329
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,300
Where can you run to?

330
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,980
Come here.

331
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,860
Be good.

332
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,180
Why are you only

333
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,300
telling me all this now?

334
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,140
A murderer will be sentenced to death.

335
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,380
Would the law and the Judicial Review

336
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,580
show mercy for my grievances?

337
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,540
I have no evidence

338
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,340
or witnesses.

339
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,300
(Justice and Reasoning)
My words alone

340
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,020
weren't enough to convince
the officers in Danzhou.

341
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,940
What is your purpose for coming

342
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,500
to the Capital with Chai Jing?

343
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,100
When I first entered the Capital,

344
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,540
I told you the truth.

345
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,620
I just wanted to live

346
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,940
and have a family.

347
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,020
Do you believe me?

348
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,100
For you,

349
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,420
what is family?

350
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,300
I want to have my blood relatives

351
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,620
with me.

352
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,940
So, without a blood bond,

353
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,460
that would not be your family?

354
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,740
I once had such a family

355
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
in Danzhou,

356
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,100
in Nanzhang.

357
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,240
That was not the kind of family
I wanted.

358
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,420
I have told you everything

359
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,740
you wanted to know.

360
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,060
Now, let me sign the confession

361
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,220
and send me to prison.

362
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,220
Are you truly willing to trade your life

363
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,100
for Chai Jing's?

364
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,500
Yes.

365
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,860
It's too late.

366
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,420
What do you mean?

367
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,540
The bandits are Chai Jing's accomplices.

368
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,460
She knows Pei Dafu.

369
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,020
They used a ship to help him

370
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,300
transport stolen goods overseas.

371
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,580
That's why I arrested her

372
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,620
in secret.

373
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,140
I want to use her

374
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,980
to find Pei Dafu's adopted son,

375
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,060
the stolen goods, and the money.

376
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,220
What nonsense are you saying?

377
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,780
If the Danzhou murder case

378
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,700
were not linked to Pei Dafu's case,

379
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,380
how could Mr. Yan believe
my side of the story?

380
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,700
But because of this,

381
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,540
it is even harder for Chai Jing

382
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,660
to survive in prison.

383
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,300
Mr. Yan is here.

384
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,260
Miss Hanyan, please return.

385
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,940
You've been an official
in the Capital for years.

386
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,220
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)
As the Vice Minister,

387
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,380
tell me one thing honestly.

388
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,140
Do you truly have no way or opportunity

389
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,340
to save Chai Jing?

390
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,500
I have laid bare all my past to you,

391
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,300
but you

392
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,780
still hide many secrets.

393
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,740
When we first met,

394
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,220
you had seen through

395
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,740
all my lies and tricks.

396
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,180
You even went to Danzhou
and retrieved that hairpin.

397
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,980
But you didn't arrest me.

398
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,280
Instead, you always helped me.

399
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,940
When I was framed by Zhuang Yushan,

400
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,900
you guided me on how to respond.

401
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,380
When I was trapped in Jianjia Chamber

402
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,540
and nearly forced to marry,

403
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,180
you brought me to the Judicial Review
just in time.

404
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,740
When I angered Zhou Ruyin,

405
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,660
you planned ahead for me

406
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,020
and secretly monitored
Yang Ping's every move.

407
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,420
On the night
before Taoist Duan's incident,

408
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,060
I found a note in the candle.

409
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,980
It was you, wasn't it?

410
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,060
Yes.

411
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,420
There must be a reason

412
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,880
behind everything you've done for me.

413
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
What do you think

414
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,620

Leave me.

She's dead.

480
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,220
Go report it.

00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,500
Alright, let's go.

482

is New Year's Eve.

It's time for a family reunion.

485
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,220
We shouldn't let the house

486
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,100
be cold and quiet, right?

487
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,740
Thanks to our ancestors,

488
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,260

Thank you, Master.

491
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,220

Master. Ms. Zhou.

495
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,020
I heard a rumor outside just now

496
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,940
that the bandit died last night

497
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,020
in the Judicial Review.

498
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,750
- Dead?
- Dead?

499
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,860
Has she confessed everything?

500
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,260
Is the case closed now?

501
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,740
Don't drag Hanyan into this again.

502
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,620
I'm not sure about that.

503
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,340
I'll go find out.

504
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,500
Congratulations, Miss Hanyan.

505
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,020
The Danzhou murder case is closed.

506
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,340
You're cleared now.

507
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,300
Closed?

508
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,940
You don't know?

509
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,700
That female bandit confessed everything

510
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,180
and died last night
in the Judicial Review.

511
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,180
Where did you hear this nonsense?

512
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,340
It's spreading everywhere outside.

513
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,660
How can it be nonsense?

514
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,620
As expected,
the bandit is your accomplice.

515
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,860
You two killed
Zhang Youchang and his wife, right?

516
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,620
Are you tricking me?

517
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,100
No.

518
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,620
The woman is indeed dead.

519
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,420
I heard she was tortured

520
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,100
all night in the prison

521
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
at the Judicial Review.

522
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,900
Her hands and feet were broken,

523
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,180
her scalp was peeled off,

524
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,660
and she was no longer human.

525
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,980
Miss Hanyan,

526
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,540
how did you know that bandit?

527
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,100
She was willing to die for you.

528
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,500
Zhuang Hanyan, how dare you harm me?

529
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,420
You know what you've done.

530
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,180
Why should I be afraid?

531
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,700
Ms. Zhou, are you okay?

532
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,900
Where is Chai Jing?

533
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,540
I've secretly sent her
out of the Capital.

534
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,460
Is she still alive?

535
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,300
Yes.

536
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I want to see her.

537
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,180
Stay calm.

538
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,660
Don't lose your composure.

539
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,380
When the others are not around,

540
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
I'll come and get you.

541
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,500
Chai Jing!

542
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,860
Why is she so seriously injured?

543
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,340
What did you do to her?

544
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,060
If she wasn't gravely injured,

545
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,820
how could she have fooled everyone

546
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,600
and allowed us to save her?

547
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,940
Hanyan.

548
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,740
Don't move.

549
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,860
Lie here properly.

550
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,100
My hands

551
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,220
were crippled.

552
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,580
I can no longer hold a saber

553
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,540
to protect you anymore.

554
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,620
I'm sorry.

555
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,980
What nonsense are you saying?

556
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,140
It's I who should apologize.

557
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,700
I shouldn't have let you come
to the Capital with me.

558
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,900
It's my fault.

559
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,540
From now on,

560
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,420
you must take up the saber

561
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,420
to protect yourself.

562
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,220
Recover here.

563
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,180
From now on,

564
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,020
I'll protect you.

565
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,460
Is that okay?

566
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,940
The day we first met,

567
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,340
I asked you your name,

568
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,260
and you said

569
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,540
you were called the barefoot ghost.

570
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,260
You almost stole my shoes.

571
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,340
We walked barefoot together on the beach

572
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,060
for a long time.

573
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,180
Do you remember?

574
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,340
Of course, I do.

575
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,420
Now, you have a family.

576
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,940
You no longer need to walk barefoot.

577
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,140
That's enough.

578
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,660
Chai Jing,

579
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,500
I've long

580
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,980
considered you my family.

581
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,220
In my 20 years of life,

582
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,500
I never knew

583
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,340
what family was

584
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,860
and what love was.

585
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,220
I only knew my master

586
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,140
and orders.

587
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,900
Meeting you

588
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,020
was the greatest fortune

589
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,860
of my life.

590
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,420
I have no regrets.

591
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,820
Don't cry.

592
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,070
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

593
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,090
A little higher.

594
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,950
Alright.

595
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,740
Go to the inner yard.

596
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,060
Go a little higher.

597
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,380
- A bit more to the right?
- Yes.

598
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,900
Done.

599
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,380
Zhuang Hanyan.

600
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,420
Her injuries need more time to heal.

601
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,100
I'll send someone to look after her.

602
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,740
But from now on,

603
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,460
she cannot appear in the Capital.

604
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,420
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

605
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,060
I will always

606
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,820
remember this favor.

607
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,740
Now, can you believe

608
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,900
that I don't want to hurt you?

609
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,100
You know all my secrets now,

610
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,340
yet you haven't confided in me.

611
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,740
I still can't agree to help you

612
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,880
with eavesdropping on Mother.

613
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,580
That's my bottom line.

614
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,540
What if I had asked you to do this

615
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,480
when you asked me to save Chai Jing?

616
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,180
I'd pretend to agree,

617
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,500
but I'd go back on my word.

618
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,380
How honest of you.

619
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,860
- Go back.
- Wait.

620
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,980
What's wrong?

621
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,420
Fu Yunxi,

622
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,460
can I truly

623
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,780
trust you?

624
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:33,180
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

625
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:49,580
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

626
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,700
It's almost the Spring Festival.

627
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,980
I've heard about all the trouble

628
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,420
you've caused recently.

629
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,540
I haven't intervened to help you.

630
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,820
Do you resent me?

631
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,180
If you can protect yourself,

632
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,700
that's helpful enough.

633
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,980
After this disaster,

634
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,100
do you still refuse
to leave the Capital?

635
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,900
Since the day I returned home,

636
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,860
you've always wanted to drive me out.

637
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,220
Even when selecting my husband,

638
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,260
you'd choose those living afar.

639
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,740
Now,

640
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,420
I know the reason.

641
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,580
What have you known?

642
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,860
The Capital is full
of the rich and noble.

643
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,220
Some struggle to survive,

644
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,980
and some die unwillingly.

645
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,410
Once caught up in these disputes,

646
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,340
there are no winners.

647
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,180
Things have come to this,

648
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,500
yet you still won't leave?

649
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,660
That's the terrifying part.

650
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,780
It's like gambling.

651
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,940
When you win, you'll want more;

652
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,620
when you lose,
you'll try to overturn it.

653
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,540
Once you've tasted it,
you'll fall deeper.

654
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,660
That's human nature.

655
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,780
Even I am not exempt.

656
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,420
You didn't have to suffer this cycle.

657
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,100
As a woman,

658
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,100
this is my fate.

659
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,300
You think you've been enlightened,

660
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,060
but in reality, you've only seen
the shallowest part.

661
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,620
Please, Mother, enlighten me.

662
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,060
Do you think there's fairness
in this world?

663
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,500
I don't know how to answer that.

664
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,340
Mother, what do you want to say?

665
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,900
You sacrificed a friend this time.

666
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,660
What will you sacrifice next?

667
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,220
What else can you sacrifice?

668
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,260
Even if you eventually win,

669
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,620
you'll be left with wounds

670
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,460
and loneliness.

671
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,300
What's the meaning of that?

672
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,220
When injustice falls upon you,

673
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,140
endurance is painful,

674
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,540
but so is resistance.

675
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,660
That's the essence of injustice.

676
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,020
It won't be long.

677
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,700
Let's celebrate the festival for now.

678
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,460
Soon, you'll understand.

679
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,860
Go back now.

680
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,180
(Flying Swan on Snow)

681
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,940
(As the rising sun shines
upon thousands of households,)

682
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,720
(the old peach wood charms are replaced
with new ones.)

683
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,940
(A new year is coming.)

684
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,220
(Everything has a new life.)

685
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,860
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

686
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,380
(I now understand)

687
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,000
(Mother's words for the first time.)

688
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,220
(Was everything I've done)

689
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,500
(Flying Swan on Snow)

690
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,860
(really wrong?)

691
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,100
(Maybe from today onwards,)

692
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,500
(I can truly let go of the past hatred,)

693
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,220
(but in my heart,)

694
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,340
(I still feel uneasy.)

695
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,260
(I seem to sense)

696
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,180
(that this joy and happiness)

697
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,300
(are not as peaceful as it seems.)

698
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:39,060
