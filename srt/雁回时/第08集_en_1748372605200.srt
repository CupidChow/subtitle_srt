1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
overd beads

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,760
I'm not sure.

35
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,760
I'm not sure.

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,600
My soul lent rats as well

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:09,100
Soft-weak

42
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,620
Greetings, everyone.

43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,940
I, Shengyang Ping,

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,940
came from Nanzhang Town, Danzhou.

45
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,060
I've been competing with Zhang Youchang

46
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,940
to compete with Miss Hanye.

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,740
I've met her before.

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,500
I was on the table.

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,620
I didn't see Brother Yang just now.

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,060
But I remember you met him

51
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,940
and fell in love.

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,340
Why did you come to the capital

53
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,460
to have fun?

54
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,140
I came to the capital early with my friends.

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,420
I've grown up a little.

56
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,700
I love you.

57
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,980
Of course.

58
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,420
I haven't seen you for a long time.

59
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,860
I'll drink to you.

60
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,820
I dare not.

61
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,060
Miss Hanye,

62
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,020
don't be nervous.

63
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,420
I'm afraid you'll bite my other ear.

64
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,780
What are you talking about?

65
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,820
Mr. Zhuang,

66
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,860
didn't you hear that?

67
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,420
Miss Hanye is in Danzhou.

68
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,140
It's a little emergency.

69
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,780
It's a small matter to bite off the other ear.

70
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,700
Today, we stole the Linzha property.

71
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,420
We'll fight against the same family tomorrow.

72
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,580
It's a famous girl.

73
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,940
I didn't come to see her

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,420
for a while.

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,900
Why did Miss Hanye come to the capital

76
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,660
and become like her?

77
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,860
She's really a good girl.

78
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,220
Why is she in Danzhou?

79
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,020
She's a big star in our family.

80
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,020
She can't get on the stage.

81
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,300
Look.

82
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,780
Only when you're out of the house

83
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,140
is she the star.

84
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,940
She's the star?

85
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,780
Did Mr. Yang have any misunderstanding?

86
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,500
Hanye...

87
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,860
No misunderstanding.

88
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Mr. Yang is right.

89
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,980
The so-called same-sex child

90
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,780
is just bullying and making fun of her.

91
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,500
The so-called stealing of the Linzha property

92
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,620
is just a misunderstanding

93
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,900
that the jewelry was stolen.

94
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,820
It can only be stolen secretly.

95
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,300
As for the anger,

96
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,060
I'll bite off your ear.

97
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,260
Is it because you're always changing me to eat dumplings?

98
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,820
You're forcing me to

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,180
take the blame on you

100
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,220
and make me eat dumplings?

101
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,580
That's why I'm fighting back.

102
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,740
Mr. Yang has been a hard worker.

103
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,020
If you're so obsessed with Linzha,

104
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,980
you'll be in trouble.

105
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,100
It's true that Linzha is a good girl.

106
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,820
I grew up in a village in Danzhou.

107
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,220
I don't have any rules.

108
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,140
But my father is strict with me

109
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,980
when he's in charge of the family.

110
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,220
I've been living in my family for two months.

111
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,860
My father taught me every day.

112
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,140
That's why I'm always being stubborn.

113
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,340
I try not to make my parents lose their face in front of me.

114
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,500
I'm a man.

115
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,700
I can't make a living out of my husband.

116
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,500
But Yang's brother

117
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,140
has been humiliating me

118
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,700
in the court because of his personal grudge.

119
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,820
Who else will dare to be your friend?

120
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,660
You...

121
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,900
Mr. Yang.

122
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,220
Let's have a toast today.

123
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,940
Don't ruin our family's reputation.

124
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,020
Go back to the kitchen.

125
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,220
Mr. Zhuang has found a good girl.

126
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,780
Be careful.

127
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,820
This is so rude.

128
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,420
Why did you come to Yiliangmache with me today?

129
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,460
I made a mistake today.

130
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,740
I was too lazy to save Miss San.

131
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,900
I didn't let our Zhuang family lose their reputation.

132
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,980
I'm so grateful to you.

133
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,220
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,580
I'm sorry.

135
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,780
I'm sorry.

136
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,300
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm sorry.

139
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,700
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,980
I'm sorry.

141
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
I'm sorry.

145
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,700
I'm so grateful.

146
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,260
Of course, I want to thank you.

147
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,980
You don't have to be so polite.

148
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,620
We're here for you.

149
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,020
Don't be so modest.

150
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,580
Miss San, you've been wronged today.

151
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,740
In the case of Danzhou,

152
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,380
I will protect you.

153
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,260
Why would I let that little disciple

154
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,180
humiliate you so much?

155
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,860
I've been worried about you

156
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,780
all the time.

157
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,420
I don't want to make them worry.

158
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,620
Miss San,

159
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,420
you've been so thoughtful since you were little.

160
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,460
Unlike the two little bubbles in my family,

161
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,460
I'm the first one to grow up

162
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,780
and I can't afford to make them worry.

163
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,100
Miss San,

164
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,620
you need to help your mother a little.

165
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,060
This is also for the sake of our Zhuang family.

166
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,700
You don't have to worry about me.

167
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,820
But on the banquet today,

168
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,940
the four brothers will be called

169
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,060
the little brother-in-law tomorrow.

170
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,740
All of you are waiting for the family dinner.

171
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,060
I'm afraid that you need to be so modest.

172
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,180
If you let me

173
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,540
make my father worry,

174
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,620
I'm afraid that he will be angry.

175
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,900
I will blame you for not raising your child.

176
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,500
Thank you for your advice, Miss San.

177
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,660
Wei,

178
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,980
take this.

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,980
I'll be back.

180
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,980
It's very hidden.

181
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,980
It's convenient for you to live here.

182
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
It's good.

183
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Why are you here?

184
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Do you still remember Yang Ping?

185
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
The one who bit your ear?

186
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
He came to the capital.

187
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
He lives in Yilan's mansion.

188
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,980
I didn't expect to meet this local Wu Lai here.

189
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Why did he come to the capital?

190
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,980
I'm afraid it's Zhou Yingniang's handwriting.

191
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
Zhou Ruying?

192
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,980
He sent someone to Danzhou.

193
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,980
I just guessed.

194
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,980
He knew I was the enemy.

195
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Of course he knew about it.

196
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
He knew about it.

197
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
But I don't know what he's looking for.

198
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Yang Ping has been hatred with you for years.

199
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
It's a disaster.

200
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Do you want to get rid of him?

201
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Fu Yunxi has been watching you.

202
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,980
Don't be rash.

203
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
But now,

204
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
there's one more thing.

205
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Today's lesson is just a little trick.

206
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
But Qin will not have to go first.

207
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,980
If we want to move the flag completely,

208
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
we need to follow the rules.

209
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,980
The girl in the neighborhood

210
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
is always like Miss Di.

211
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
She's so ugly.

212
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Now, my father looks at her.

213
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
I don't know what to say.

214
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
You and the innocent people in the capital

215
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,980
should teach our three ladies the lesson.

216
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Find a husband for her

217
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
and get out of there.

218
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Don't let them know

219
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
that you're a woman.

220
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Get out of there.

221
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
Don't let them know

222
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
that you're a woman.

223
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
You're still pestering me.

224
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Okay, thank you.

225
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
It's not hard to die.

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
Other women

227
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
can't even get out of trouble

228
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
when they're fighting.

229
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,980
I told you to read your brother's books.

230
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
You're here to talk to me.

231
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
Exactly.

232
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,980
You don't know poetry.

233
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
You told him to watch me.

234
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,980
I fell in love with him.

235
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
If you're angry,

236
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
why would I come to see you?

237
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
Okay.

238
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Now that I'm a grown-up,

239
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
I'll be a burden to others

240
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
if I don't stay.

241
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
You can't be a burden to others

242
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
when you die.

243
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
You two,

244
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
make me some air.

245
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Get out of there.

246
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
The school exam tomorrow

247
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
is very important.

248
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Yuchi, sit down.

249
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Come on.

250
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Read this.

251
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,980
The school exam.

252
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Lord Zhu.

253
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
The world is full of

254
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
people,

255
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
and the people are all in charge.

256
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,980
No one is allowed to

257
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,980
vote.

258
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
What do you mean?

259
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
The world is full of people.

260
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
What do you mean?

261
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
What are you doing

262
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
when you're doing this?

263
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
Xiao Niang,

264
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
is this the school exam tomorrow?

265
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
The school exam tomorrow

266
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
is not for you to be a burden.

267
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
It's for you to be stable and stable.

268
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
Don't lose your family's dignity.

269
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Don't be angry with your father.

270
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,980
Today,

271
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
you can't step out of this house

272
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
and make the world

273
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
full of people.

274
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
You'll be in trouble.

275
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
You'll be in trouble.

276
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Don't ask others anymore.

277
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Yes.

278
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,980
I won't let you down.

279
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
I'm afraid that the exam

280
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
is still not over.

281
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,980
It's still 2 o'clock.

282
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
If you want to help,

283
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,980
call me Sister Hao.

284
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Sister Hao.

285
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Sister Hao.

286
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,980
Sit down.

287
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Sister Hao,

288
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
I'll help you make the cold dinner.

289
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
You help me this time.

290
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Deal.

291
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Do you have a way?

292
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Of course.

293
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,980
I can do it, too.

294
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Awesome.

295
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,980
It's really hard to get a job here.

296
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
Come and have some tea.

297
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,980
You're Miss Zhuang Jia'er.

298
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
I don't dare to bother you.

299
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,980
I'm afraid that ...

300
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
I heard that

301
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Master He's grandfather

302
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
used to live in the middle of the city.

303
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
I can't believe

304
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
you're a guest in the house.

305
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
I'm afraid that

306
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
you'll be in trouble.

307
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
I heard that

308
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
Master He's grandfather

309
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
used to live in the middle of the city.

310
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,980
He's also a guest in the house.

311
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,980
Master He was a guest in the house

312
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,980
when he was born.

313
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,980
My father is just a cook.

314
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Now,

315
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
he's just a guest in the house.

316
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
What's your opinion

317
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
about Miss Zhuang Jia'er's visit to the house?

318
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
I'm not sure.

319
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
I was confused and confused.

320
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,980
I found that

321
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
there's a sentence

322
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
on the top of the sentence.

323
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
I don't know the meaning of it.

324
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
I heard that

325
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,980
Master He's talent

326
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,980
is the best

327
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
among the men who come here.

328
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,980
Master He, please teach me.

329
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
No.

330
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
So,

331
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
the short-sleeved dress

332
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
made by the late Cao Mengde

333
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,980
is very useful.

334
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
The palace is a great skill.

335
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
It's the best for the people

336
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
in the world.

337
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,980
The world is the best.

338
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Master He,

339
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
I don't have

340
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
any bad habits.

341
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
Can you

342
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
use this as a tool

343
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
to make a piece of 8 pieces

344
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
of high-end paper

345
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
to make me

346
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
take back to the library?

347
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Okay.

348
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,980
Thank you, Master He.

349
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
By the way,

350
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Miss Zhuang Jia'er

351
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
is the guest in the house today.

352
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
What do you think?

353
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
I...

354
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
It's okay.

355
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
She's very talented.

356
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,980
If she has any difficulties,

357
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
it's more convenient

358
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
to ask her.

359
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Master He,

360
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
are you not willing

361
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,980
to make a deal with me

362
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,980
for a young lady?

363
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
No.

364
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
I...

365
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
I'll make a deal with you.

366
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
It's very easy to make.

367
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
Then, why don't you make a deal with me?

368
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,980
I'll do it.

369
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,980
I'm not very good at this.

370
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
You'd better

371
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
read it out.

372
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
There's no place for it.

373
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,980
Yes.

374
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,980
Thank you, Miss Zhuang Jia'er.

375
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,980
If there's no problem,

376
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
you'd better memorize it all.

377
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
If someone asks

378
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
about one of the contents,

379
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
it's better not to answer them.

380
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,980
It's a good idea.

381
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,980
Let's go.

382
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
My lord.

383
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,980
My lord.

384
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
Father.

385
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
You're a talented man.

386
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
I'm sure you'll be

387
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
able to win Master Zhuang's heart.

388
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Thank you.

389
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Good day, everyone.

390
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,980
Good day, everyone.

391
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
Good day, everyone.

392
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,980
It's time to pray.

393
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Good day.

394
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
My lord.

395
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Can I withdraw

396
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
from the exam today?

397
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
Why not?

398
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
I read the letter

399
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
with my hand last night

400
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
and saw the letter in the mirror.

401
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
I made a deal

402
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
with Hu Lu Flower Pavilion today.

403
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
I can't avoid it.

404
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
He Xiaolian is a good person

405
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
who is good at reading and writing.

406
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm very good at it.

407
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
The teaching exam

408
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
is our first encounter in the south.

409
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
We're here to

410
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
share our happiness and happiness.

411
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
If you withdraw,

412
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
you'll be fine.

413
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Thank you.

414
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,980
You're a talented man.

415
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
The question is

416
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
about the reputation of the officials

417
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
in the imperial court.

418
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
It's about the students'

419
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
understanding of the people.

420
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
The article

421
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
is about the history of the palace

422
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
and the ancient history of the palace.

423
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
The history of the palace

424
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,980
is about the history of the palace.

425
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
We should be proud.

426
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Yes.

427
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
We should be proud.

428
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
But the whole family

429
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
has their own interests.

430
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
I can't do that.

431
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
I can't do that.

432
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
I can't do that.

433
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
Mr. Cheng, you're so modest.

434
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
Kneel down.

435
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Kneel down.

436
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,980
How can the people

437
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
in the imperial court be sent away?

438
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Father, what are you doing?

439
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Zi Yue is going to the imperial palace.

440
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
The late Lord

441
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
has been the first to be sent away.

442
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
He's been the first to be sent away.

443
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,980
You can't even remember the original text.

444
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
How can you write

445
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,980
the long and long article?

446
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
Father, you're generous.

447
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,980
You're generous.

448
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,980
You're a famous man in the capital.

449
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,980
I can't predict your good memory.

450
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
Then you can recite

451
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
what I just said.

452
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
Zi Yue.

453
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Yue...

454
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Yue...

455
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
Yue...

456
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Look at your son.

457
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,980
Master, it's my fault.

458
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
I'm not in a good mood.

459
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,980
I asked him to prepare

460
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,980
for the sake of protecting your reputation.

461
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
What do you mean?

462
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
I...

463
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
I saw the exam paper

464
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
in your study.

465
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,980
I thought it was a rumor.

466
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
I...

467
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
You wrote this article

468
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
by yourself?

469
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,980
The person who wrote it

470
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,980
is the man who wrote it.

471
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Father, it's true that I wrote it.

472
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Even if you wrote it in advance,

473
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,980
it's a fake.

474
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Ru Yin,

475
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,980
you're a good son

476
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
and you're responsible for the sake of the exam.

477
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
You shouldn't have done

478
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
such a thing.

479
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Master, it's my fault.

480
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Please punish me.

481
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Forget it.

482
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,980
I'm sorry for today.

483
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,980
But when it comes to the spring,

484
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
I'll definitely show my innocence.

485
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Let's take a step at a time.

486
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Master,

487
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,980
there's something wrong with this article.

488
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,980
It won't cause any trouble, right?

489
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Only the three examen have seen it.

490
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
I've already written the exam paper.

491
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Don't go out.

492
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,980
If anyone exaggerates the title,

493
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
remember,

494
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
be careful.

495
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
If it's a coincidence, remember?

496
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Yes, master.

497
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Don't worry, master.

498
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
I'll definitely make sure to tell Chi'er.

499
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Chi'er,

500
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
tell me the truth.

501
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
The exam said that this article

502
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
has a good quality.

503
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
You've only worked for a few days.

504
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
How could you write such a good article?

505
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
What?

506
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
I have a good news.

507
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,980
I'm not happy.

508
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
I'm not happy.

509
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
I'm not happy.

510
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
I'm not happy.

511
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
I'm not happy.

512
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I'm just a beggar.

513
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,980
I'm just a beggar.

514
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,980
I'm just a beggar.

515
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,980
You're so stupid.

516
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
Brother Liu,

517
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,980
drink more.

518
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,980
I agree.

519
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
To be honest,

520
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
you have three children.

521
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,980
You're more successful than the red card.

522
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Who told me to visit you?

523
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,980
I have a bag.

524
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Liu,

525
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
if you have a request,

526
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,980
you can visit me anytime.

527
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Drink it.

528
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
Drink it.

529
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
The next episode will be about

530
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
the new season of the Tao Bao.

531
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
The next episode will be about

532
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
the new season of the Tao Bao.

533
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,980
What are you thinking?

534
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
Tell me.

535
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
Tell me.

536
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
Mr. Zhuang,

537
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,980
I heard that you're a great fan of the world.

538
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,980
You're a fan of the world.

539
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,980
I wonder how you can

540
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
spread the word.

541
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Spread it.

542
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
Tell us.

543
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,980
It's all about the word.

544
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,980
It's all about the word.

545
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
You're right.

546
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Mr. Zhuang, you're right.

547
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,980
I've learned a lot from you.

548
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Today,

549
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,980
I'm really a good person.

550
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Yes.

551
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
You're right.

552
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
Drink it.

553
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Come on.

554
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Please.

555
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Come on.

556
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Let's sit down.

557
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Okay.

558
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
Please.

559
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
Mr. Zhuang,

560
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
you're a great fan of the world.

561
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,980
I'm proud of you.

562
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,980
Mrs. Jia, Han Lingyue,

563
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,980
taught me how to read.

564
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
I'm a great fan of the world.

565
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
I'm proud of you.

566
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,980
I'm proud of you.

567
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
You're a great fan of the world.

568
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,980
Mr. Zhuang,

569
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Mr. Zhuang,

570
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
why don't we

571
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
have a chat

572
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
with the old schoolboy today?

573
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
You can send

574
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
the words in the article.

575
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Then,

576
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
we can sing together.

577
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Let's sing together.

578
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
Let's sing together.

579
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Good question.

580
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Let's have a chat.

581
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
Okay.

582
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,980
I think there's a long time.

583
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,980
A gentleman...

584
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
A gentleman.

585
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
A gentleman.

586
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,980
A gentleman.

587
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
I know it.

588
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
I know it.

589
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Mr. Zhuang, you forgot.

590
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
Yes, I forgot.

591
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
You didn't?

592
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
No.

593
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
No.

594
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Next is a gentleman.

595
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
A gentleman.

596
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
A gentleman.

597
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
A gentleman.

598
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
A gentleman.

599
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
A gentleman.

600
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
A gentleman.

601
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
Didn't you see it?

602
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
How did you know?

603
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
I didn't.

604
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
You saw it?

605
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,980
We'll have a drink.

606
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Let's have a drink.

607
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
The whole school is full of people.

608
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
It's full of wine.

609
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
How can we do a formal document?

610
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,980
Why are you laughing here?

611
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Who are you?

612
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
Let's go.

613
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Let's go down and have a look.

614
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Let's go.

615
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Brother Zhao,

616
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
this kind of person

617
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
will be punished.

618
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
Please.

619
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Let's go out and have a look.

620
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
Yes.

621
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Who are you?

622
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Where did you come from?

623
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
How dare you

624
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,980
sell yourself in front of the son of the Banshou City in Hanling?

625
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Exactly.

626
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,980
A gentleman is a man who wants to know everything.

627
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
The ancient Xian army

628
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,980
was made of the people of Dehua and the people of Yumin.

629
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
The man who is afraid of the weak

630
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,980
will have a son like you in the future.

631
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
He will be ashamed to death.

632
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
What kind of a son are you?

633
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
I just used it.

634
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,980
It's exactly what the world says.

635
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,980
You don't remember it yourself?

636
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
I don't need these.

637
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
Exactly.

638
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Who is the man?

639
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
Who is the man?

640
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
It seems that the master of the Zhuang family

641
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,980
is a man of the south.

642
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
He is a man of the south.

643
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,980
The man who is not good enough

644
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
is a man of the north.

645
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
Let's go.

646
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Who are you?

647
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
You are a man of the north.

648
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
You are a man of the north.

649
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
You are a man of the north.

650
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
You don't need to be polite.

651
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,980
Exactly.

652
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
Let's drink here.

653
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
No polite.

654
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,980
Drink.

655
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,980
I'm afraid that the master of the Zhuang family

656
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
will be ashamed again.

657
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
It's okay.

658
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
We are the brothers.

659
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
You are right.

660
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
You are here.

661
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,980
You are here.

662
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Come on.

663
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
The thousand miles of the English language is a thousand miles.

664
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Isn't the person you are looking for

665
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,980
here?

666
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,980
This is the master of the Zhuang family.

667
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
I'm You Yong.

668
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,980
We are really friends.

669
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,980
I'm Fang Zi.

670
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Fang Zi.

671
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Fang Zi.

672
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Thank you.

673
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Thank you.

674
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Are you okay?

675
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
Zhuang Hanye.

676
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
Don't you want to say goodbye to your future husband?

677
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
Brother.

678
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Under the broad daylight,

679
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
I advise you to be more polite.

680
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Don't lose your face.

681
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,980
Zhuang Hanye.

682
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Don't be a taichi.

683
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Mr. Liu.

684
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,980
I'll be the one to do this tonight.

685
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,980
I'll give you the money.

686
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Mr. Liu is great.

687
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Come on.

688
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Get a good guest room.

689
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Go back.

690
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Tell these people to be quick.

691
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,980
He's so fast.

692
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Congratulations, Mr. Liu.

693
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Zhuang Hanye.

694
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Didn't I tell you to go?

695
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
Where is the Dali Temple?

696
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,980
What are you doing here?

697
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Miss. San.

698
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
My lord, please.

699
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
Come on.

700
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Let's go.

701
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Miss. San is so elegant.

702
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,980
She came to eat alone.

703
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,980
You're not her husband either.

704
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Dali Temple is looking for a girl.

705
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,980
It's said that in this Chalin Jiu's house,

706
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,980
Miss San's fish is in the palace tonight.

707
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,980
But mine is still not here.

708
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,980
You're so quiet.

709
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,980
What is your fish?

710
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Isn't it just sitting in front of me?

711
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,980
Excuse me.

712
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,980
This person has a good knife skills.

713
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,980
I'd like to have a meal with him.

714
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
You must force me.

715
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
What's the meaning of Miss San's words?

716
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Do you know Han Fei?

717
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
I don't know.

718
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,980
What's the reason?

719
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,980
How long have you known each other?

720
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
What's the relationship?

721
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

722
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,980
Since you came here,

723
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
I've been helping you.

724
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,980
But you still don't believe me.

725
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

726
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
What do you want me to say?

727
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Miss San is a good cook.

728
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,980
She's a good cook in the capital.

729
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
She's a good cook.

730
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,980
She's often been taken away by the fish.

731
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
If you don't mind,

732
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
I'll take my leave.

733
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
What are you doing?

734
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,980
If I want to kill you now,

735
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
do you think he'll be my boss?

736
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Even if he's a big-headed man,

737
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
he can't be so cruel.

738
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,980
If he's a good man,

739
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
if he's a criminal,

740
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,980
he'll be a criminal.

741
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,980
I'm sorry.

742
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
It's enough.

743
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Let's go.

744
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
He's here.

745
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,980
I'm sorry.

746
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
What are you doing?

747
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Say it.

748
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
Let him go.

749
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
Let's go.

750
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,980
Duan Yan,

751
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
this is the second time you're going to kill me.

752
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
I only think you're a fox.

753
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,980
But you're not like a wolf.

754
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
You forced me to do that.

755
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
You forced me.

756
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,980
Lord Gao.

757
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,980
Lord Gao, please.

758
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,980
Please.

759
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
Please come in.

760
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
Please come in.

761
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Serve the dishes.

762
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
Yes.

763
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
Lord Gao,

764
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,980
is there anything wrong with the Ministry of Justice?

765
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
Although it's a three-way communication cooperation,

766
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
we're not following the party's order.

767
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
But actually,

768
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,980
the power is in the hands of the Court of Judicial Review.

769
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
The Ministry of Justice

770
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,980
is just a little building.

771
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,980
Recently, I've heard that

772
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,980
there's a man named Pei Da Fu.

773
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
He's still in the capital.

774
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
Do you know about that?

775
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,980
A thousand years ago, Pei Da Fu was a hundred years old.

776
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,980
I've seen him before.

777
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,980
He's tall and long-haired.

778
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
He's full of love.

779
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,980
If he speaks,

780
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,980
he'll be in trouble if he's in trouble.

781
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,980
He'll be in trouble if he's in trouble.

782
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Have you really seen him?

783
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,980
I can still lie to you, can't I?

784
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Come on.

785
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Brother Gao.

786
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,980
What do you want to do?

787
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,980
You'd better guess the power of the three-way communication.

788
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,980
The most famous tea-making hotel in the capital,

789
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,980
there's a secret secret.

790
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,980
If you make it difficult for me,

791
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,980
I'll ask the way I saw it and make a big announcement.

792
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,980
Don't you ever want anyone to come in.

793
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,980
And they mentioned the same thing just now.

794
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,980
I'll tell you everything.

795
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Miss San.

796
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,980
Be careful.

797
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
You'll get caught.

798
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
You'll get caught?

799
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
I'll pretend to be a fool.

800
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,980
Sir.

801
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,980
The two in Hongyun Pavilion,

802
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Yan Yu and Nan Fen are really strong.

803
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Take them back to the Dali Temple to interrogate them.

804
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Yes.

805
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
I'll do it now.

806
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,980
I won't disturb you and Miss San's ambition.

807
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,980
You're so naughty.

808
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
Sir.

809
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
Then...

810
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
What else...

811
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Do you want to do?

812
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Get lost.

813
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,980
What's the matter?

814
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
It's about me.

815
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
Miss San.

816
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
It's a serious matter.

817
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
If you're really interested,

818
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
why don't you come to my Dali Temple?

819
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
There are many houses in the capital.

820
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,980
You saw it today.

821
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,980
The Dali Temple is a Dali Temple.

822
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
If you're willing to be a spy,

823
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
I'll give you a great credit.

824
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,980
I don't have the ability.

825
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
Just take out three of the abilities

826
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
to deal with Zhuang Yu Chi.

827
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Fourth Brother and I are blood relatives.

828
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
Why should I deal with him?

829
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Didn't you ask the people who were

830
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
the ones who asked for it?

831
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
I went to the capital.

832
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
I just want to open my eyes

833
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
in this Dali Temple.

834
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
Who do you recognize?

835
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Where is she?

836
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Here.

837
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Here.

838
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Miss, you finally found your way.

839
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,980
We thought you were gone.

840
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
Yes.

841
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
You're right.

842
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,980
You're right.

843
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,980
You're half the money.

844
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
That's right.

845
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Take the money.

846
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
Go.

847
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
Thank you, Miss.

848
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
Thank you, Miss.

849
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
Go.

850
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Next time, you'll find us.

851
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Go on, Miss.

852
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
You're so good at singing.

853
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
Miss, you're so good at singing.

854
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,980
You're better than Li Yuan.

855
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
It's late.

856
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,980
I'll take my leave.

857
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,980
I hope we can be safe and sound.

858
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
It's dark.

859
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
Miss, take care.

860
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
Does it hurt?

861
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,980
It's okay.

862
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
You're too busy.

863
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
He won't really kill me.

864
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Why do you have to fight with him?

865
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,980
He's as thoughtful as a talker.

866
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,980
He's so unkind.

867
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
He's so unkind.

868
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
He's so unkind.

869
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
He's so unkind.

870
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,980
He might not really want to catch you.

871
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
And today,

872
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,980
I caught his arm.

873
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Maybe he won't dare to act again today.

874
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Be careful not to make him angry.

875
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Don't worry.

876
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
But...

877
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,980
I heard from him that there's still a long way to go.

878
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,980
It's about me.

879
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Don't bother me.

880
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Mr. Yue,

881
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,980
your family is in a hurry.

882
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,980
You're not going to be a good teacher.

883
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
You're bothering me?

884
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Who are you?

885
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
I'm just saying.

886
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,980
You're far from Miss Zhuang Jia San.

887
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
I'm not a good teacher.

888
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
I'm not a good teacher.

889
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
I'm not a good teacher.

890
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,980
I'm not a good teacher.

891
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Don't play with her.

892
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
You're far from Miss Zhuang Jia San.

893
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
I'm telling you.

894
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,980
I didn't get the girl Mr. Yue saw.

895
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
I'm lying.

896
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
Help!

897
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
I won't swim!

898
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Don't worry.

899
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,980
I won't die.

900
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Help!

901
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
Help!

902
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,980
Help!

903
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
Pull me up!

904
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
Pull!

905
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Let him run away!

906
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,980
I can't pull him up!

907
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,980
How is it?

908
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
I'm sorry.

909
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
I was too drunk.

910
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
I'm so happy.

911
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
I just did what you asked me to do.

912
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
I can't live in the front yard.

913
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,980
Brother Zhuang is here.

914
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
Congratulations, Brother Zhuang.

915
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Congratulations, Brother Zhuang.

916
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
Congratulations, Brother Zhuang.

917
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Congratulations, Brother Zhuang.

918
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,980
You were the son of Zhuang.

919
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Yes.

920
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
You're the son of Zhuang.

921
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,980
You always said that you don't want to go to the top.

922
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
You didn't study hard.

923
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
But you did it on purpose.

924
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
You're a criminal.

925
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
A criminal?

926
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,980
You know what?

927
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,980
You know how the world of Zhuang

928
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,980
and the capital of Ming is

929
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,980
all passed down to His Majesty.

930
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
Today,

931
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
His Majesty has a hard time getting paid.

932
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
He asked for the best of the few documents

933
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
and the best of the best.

934
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,980
Mr. Zhuang is not a prince.

935
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
He can't be a prince.

936
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,980
His Majesty is in the hospital for examination.

937
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
I don't know about this.

938
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
Don't pretend, Mr. Zhuang.

939
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
This year,

940
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
you should remember to take me

941
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,980
to the celebration banquet.

942
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Yes.

943
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,980
You're so good at reading.

944
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
You can memorize the four books.

945
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
But the literature

946
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,980
is going to be compared with my son.

947
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
The stars are out of the blue.

948
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
Yes.

949
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
I'm sorry.

950
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Mr. Zhuang.

951
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Mr. Zhuang.

952
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Mr. Zhuang.

953
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
This is a small matter.

954
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,980
You don't need to check it.

955
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
What?

956
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Mr. Zhuang is so impatient.

957
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
He's just in time.

958
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
Mr. Zhuang.

959
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,980
Mr. Zhuang is just in time.

960
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
We can't let him get involved.

961
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
50 jin of white cat grass.

962
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
It's a good amount of rice,

963
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
steamed rice,

964
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
and all kinds of eggs.

965
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
Okay.

966
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
Remember to take all the documents

967
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,980
and put them on the white cat grass.

968
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
Yes.

969
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Shengniang.

970
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,980
You're the one who came to the house.

971
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,980
Why did you take the documents?

972
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
My brother went to the study room to study.

973
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
You don't need to worry about the documents.

974
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,980
You don't know that, right?

975
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,980
The emperor asked me to take the exam.

976
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,980
The grand ceremony of the Grand Hall of the Four Seasons

977
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,980
was to be held for the bride.

978
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,980
The emperor asked you to take the exam?

979
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
Are you serious?

980
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,980
Are you afraid?

981
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
I'm afraid.

982
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
I'm afraid.

983
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
Why do you have to take the exam?

984
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,980
You're a pure woman.

985
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,980
You can't take the exam.

986
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,980
If I see you in the future,

987
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,980
I'll keep you until I die.

988
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
You and I are not born to the same mother,

989
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
but we're blood-sucking.

990
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

991
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
I've been a teacher in the Western culture for many years.

992
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,980
I've been bullied a lot by my mom.

993
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,980
I'll surely get your mother's head in this war.

994
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
I won't let you go.

995
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
You dare to be so mean,

996
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,980
I won't let you go.

997
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
I'm not as good as you.

998
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980
What do you mean?

999
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980
You're so mean,

1000
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,980
you're forcing me to be with you.

1001
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,980
Do you have the right to win me?

1002
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
Shi'er.

1003
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Xiao Niang.

1004
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,980
What are you doing in the kitchen?

1005
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,980
The emperor asked me to take the exam.

1006
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Why are you in the capital?

1007
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,980
If the emperor gets out one day,

1008
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
it'll be a huge crime.

1009
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
This is the land of heaven and earth.

1010
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,980
How could you spread it?

1011
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,980
Did my sister harm me?

1012
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,980
Xiao Niang.

1013
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Yuchen.

1014
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,980
Something happened.

1015
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Lord Han and Dali Temple are all here.

1016
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,980
Everyone is in a hurry.

1017
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,980
They'll close the door.

1018
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,980
Let's go.

1019
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Let's go.

1020
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,980
Lord Zhang.

1021
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,980
The book of the world is made by you.

1022
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,980
It's made by me.

1023
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,980
Okay.

1024
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
Please explain.

1025
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,980
Why did you make the book

1026
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,980
that Lord Han made

1027
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,980
20 years ago?

1028
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,980
You're not qualified.

1029
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,980
It's rare to see people like you.

1030
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,980
It's because you've always been with Lord Han.

1031
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,980
I don't know.

1032
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Please explain.

1033
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,980
Why did you make the book?

1034
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,980
It's because I'm old.

1035
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,980
I took the exam.

1036
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,980
I asked the students to design it.

1037
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,980
The medicine of the country is the subject.

1038
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,980
It seems simple to make the book.

1039
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
But it's full of things.

1040
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,980
It's a hundred-year-old school.

1041
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,980
I don't know how you can make it.

1042
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Lord Zhang is a good son.

1043
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,980
He didn't make the exam.

1044
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,980
He even made the book.

1045
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
He even surprised the emperor.

1046
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
He was so happy.

1047
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,980
As you know, this is the crime of the seven armies.

1048
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,980
Kneel down.

1049
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,980
It's my fault.

1050
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,980
It's my fault.

1051
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
I'm so ignorant.

1052
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
I'm so bad at it.

1053
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
I'm so bad at it.

1054
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
I'm so bad at it.

1055
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Lord Zhang.

1056
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,980
It's not what my brother wrote.

1057
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,980
It's the book of the country.

1058
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Yes.

1059
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
It's the book of the country.

1060
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,980
It's...

1061
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,980
What's the matter with the book of the country?

1062
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
The student is here.

1063
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,980
Greetings, sir.

1064
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,980
What do you want to say?

1065
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,980
Lord Huibing.

1066
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,980
The teacher asked me to ask you

1067
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,980
what you should explain to me

1068
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,980
when you take the book of the country.

1069
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,980
I wrote the book of the country to him.

1070
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
I'm so...

1071
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,980
So you love your brother and love him.

1072
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,980
You wrote the exam yourself.

1073
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,980
Yushan.

1074
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,980
Where did you get the exam?

1075
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,980
Father.

1076
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,980
I did ask you to teach me.

1077
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,980
But the article is written by him.

1078
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,980
It's written by him.

1079
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,980
Sir.

1080
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,980
Can you show it to the student?

1081
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,980
The book of the country

1082
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,980
is not what I wrote.

1083
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,980
In the past few years,

1084
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,980
I couldn't make the best decision.

1085
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,980
When I was writing the exam for Miss Zhuang,

1086
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,980
I tried to make some changes

1087
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,980
and left it in my hands.

1088
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,980
You can see it.

1089
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,980
Yes.

1090
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,980
It's really different.

1091
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,980
How come?

1092
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
I didn't know the exam was coming up.

1093
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,980
I didn't dare to do anything.

1094
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
I was the first one to take the exam.

1095
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,980
All the ministers can testify for me.

1096
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,980
Zhuang Yuchi.

1097
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,980
What else do you want to say?

1098
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,980
I'm sorry, Sir.

1099
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,980
Someone must want to frame me.

1100
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,980
The article is written by He Wenshen.

1101
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,980
How come it's a letter from Han Wenzheng?

1102
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,980
Zhuang Yuchi.

1103
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,980
Shut up.

1104
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,980
Father.

1105
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,980
I have a command.

1106
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,980
Zhuang Yuchi.

1107
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,980
He is ill.

1108
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,980
He is in a bad condition.

1109
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,980
He is in a bad condition.

1110
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,980
You are not a proper subject.

1111
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,980
You can't be a subject.

1112
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,980
But you can't be a subject in the middle of life.

1113
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
Take him to the gate of the Dali Temple

1114
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,980
and have him dead for three days.

1115
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,980
Father.

1116
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,980
I didn't...

1117
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,980
Han Linyuan, don't pretend to be a water deer.

1118
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,980
It's okay.

1119
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,980
You can't be a water deer.

1120
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
You are already a young man.

1121
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,980
Come on.

1122
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Go back to the court.

1123
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,980
It's a clear case.

1124
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,980
It's a clear case.

1125
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
It's a clear case.

1126
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Father.

1127
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,980
