Is Yunxi

10
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,390
alright now?

11
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,870
Rest assured.

12
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,040
It's not poisoned.

13
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,880
I know.

14
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,910
You made an oath with Fu Yunxi,

15
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,470
so you'd never go back on your word.

16
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,960
I know.

from now on,

19
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,830
we'll never meet again.

20
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,910
There's something

21
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
I've been wondering for a long time.

22
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,830
In your life,

23
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
besides yourself,

24
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,590
who have you truly loved?

25
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,200
There was only one person,

26
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,320
and that was your mother.

27
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,670
Really?

28
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,000
Your mother

29
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,470
being crippled

30
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,240
was just an accident.

31
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,390
I never intended to harm her.

32
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,640
That night at Shili Stop,

33
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,640
she died in my arms,

34
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,710
and I was heartbroken too.

35
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,470
I was crying as I let her go.

36
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,710
For all these years,

37
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,030
I often dream about the beautiful scene

38
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,510
when your mother and I

39
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,120
first met.

40
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,150
I loved her so much,

41
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,280
but

42
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,200
I had to personally kill her.

43
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,430
Hanyan,

44
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,390
you're an adult now.

45
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,870
You should understand

46
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,200
what it means to be helpless.

47
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,640
Since that year

48
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,320
when Eunuch Pei found your grandfather,

49
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,070
the gears of fate

50
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,830
began to turn,

51
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,510
pulling

52
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,390
all of us

53
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,150
into the whirlpool.

54
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,070
I was pushed step by step by fate

55
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,030
until I arrived at this point.

56
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,510
Saying the softest words

57
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,200
while doing the most ruthless things.

58
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,710
You've never changed.

59
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,270
Hanyan,

60
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,510
if right now,

61
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,350
you knew Fu Yunxi

62
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,340
was plotting to usurp the throne,

63
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,310
you knew

64
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,680
he would surely fail,

65
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,030
bringing ruin to your entire family,

66
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,360
and I handed you the knife,

67
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
would you kill him?

68
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,710
You can't answer me?

69
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,350
No.

70
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,390
I suppose

71
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,950
I would kill him too,

72
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,150
but I wouldn't pin the blame

73
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,040
on a child

74
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,760
or stir up disputes
in the inner chambers

75
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,880
to cover up my own crimes.

76
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,200
I wouldn't ignore the kindness
as a human

77
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,120
just for my own survival,

78
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,000
killing one innocent person
after another

79
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,630
while putting on a false, virtuous face,

80
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,350
and trying to shift

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,240
all the blame onto fate.

82
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,000
I dare to admit

83
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,710
the things I've done,

84
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,830
but you don't.

85
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,440
That's the biggest difference
between us.

86
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,120
Actually, we're the same.

87
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,720
We just want

88
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,200
a warm and harmonious home.

89
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,430
What do you think

90
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,560
makes a home?

91
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,870
A table full of delicious dishes
is in front of you,

92
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,950
but you can't even have a single bite.

93
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,950
You have no trust in your family.

94
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,320
How could someone like you

95
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,200
have a home?

96
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,240
You don't know what love is,

97
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,200
so naturally,
you don't know what home is.

98
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,800
We're like carrying a snowball
down a hill.

99
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
When you can't bear the weight,

100
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,790
you let it roll bigger and bigger

101
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,280
until it crashes onto my back.

102
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,630
But I won't let go.

103
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,040
I will carry it

104
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,230
until I walk off the cliff.

105
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,230
I can sever all the harm

106
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,750
and pain

107
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,550
passed down
from the previous generation,

108
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,160
and I'll never let the children
suffer that harm again.

109
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,520
But you can't do that.

110
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,200
You only bring more harm and pain.

111
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,830
It's fine that you don't admit it.

112
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,630
I don't need to waste more words on you.

113
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,160
As we agreed before,

114
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
today,

115
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,350
I will let you go.

116
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,710
But I don't know

117
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,160
whether others

118
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,560
will do the same.

119
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,160
It's you.

120
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
I want to tell you

121
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,080
you could've not ended up empty-handed.

122
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,550
Where is everyone?

123
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,790
Where is everyone?

124
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,630
Where have all the servants gone?

125
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,280
Nanny Tao.

126
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,400

Mother,

150
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,900
it's because of your cowardice
and selfishness

151
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,750
that I'm left with no support
in the family.

152
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,590
Otherwise, how would I
have taken such risks,

153
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,040
leading to endless trouble today?

are devoted to their children,

157
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,520
but you're cold and selfish.

158
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,830
Can you really bear to watch me die?

I know

164
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,680
that you

165
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,440
are the only one

166
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,720
who has cared for me the most

167
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,520
in my life.

168
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,910
She wants to kill her husband

169
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,320
in broad daylight.

170
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,430
Yushan,

171
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,040
when did you return?

172
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,520
Duke Qi has fallen.

173
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,040
I have no home to return to.

174
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
Where else could I go?

175
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,920
The day you were captured by Duke Qi,

176
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,590
I regretted it deeply.

177
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,850
At that moment, I swore

178
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,670
that as long as there was
a glimmer of hope,

179
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,110
I would bring you back.

180
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,470
I would never allow you

181
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,520
to suffer.

182
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,040
It was supposed to be temporary.

183
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,520
Your mother went mad.

184
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,000
She was incited by Zhuang Hanyan

185
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,780
and was running around
with a knife at home,

186
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,900
trying to harm me.

187
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,440
Only you could stop her.

188
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,160
Please talk her out of it.

189
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,870
You've always hated Hanyan.

190
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,920
You were right.

191
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
She is indeed despicable.

192
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,750
Father, please step aside.

193
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,990
Don't scare my horse.

194
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,470
Yushan, help...

195
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,080
She's killing her husband.

196
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,160
She's killing her husband.

197
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,500
(Harmonious Family)

198
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,520
Zhuang Shiyang,

199
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,990
did you ever think
you'd end up like this?

200
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,920
Stay calm.

201
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,000
Stay calm.

202
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,200
With ancestors here,

203
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,990
don't commit evil.

204
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,110
I calmly watched Yuchi die tragically,

205
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,350
calmly pushed Yushan into the fire pit,

206
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,590
and calmly watched

207
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,630
my husband suddenly accuse me
in court.

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,950
Don't worry.

209
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,670
I will still calmly leave you

210
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,440
with a whole corpse.

211
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,680
Can't you tell?

212
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,750
The reason why I accused you
in the court

213
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,320
was to buy us some time.

214
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,590
For over ten years,

215
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,870
I've humbled myself

216
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,990
and served you as a maid.

217
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,590
We've had children together.

218
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,350
I raised them,

219
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,480
loved you,

220
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,400
and respected you.

221
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,520
I only wanted to give you a warm home.

222
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,280
But you...

223
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,560
What have you done to me?

224
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,520
You've treated me like a fool,

225
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,680
abandoned me,

226
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,160
disfigured me,

227
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,720
and used my kids.

228
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,430
Zhuang Shiyang,

229
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,520
how can I ever let you go?

232
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,430
Xiwen, you're not dead?

(Seclusion)

235
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,590
Ms. Tan, how is it?

236
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,960
Mr. Fu's condition has stabilized,

237
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,080
but he's been poisoned for so long

238
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,040
that the toxins in his body
are hard to remove.

239
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,080
(Breeze Under Moonlight)
As for the future,

240
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,560
it's truly beyond the reach
of even immortals.

241
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,560
For me,

242
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,150
every extra day of my life

243
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,760
is a gift from heaven.

244
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,920
I dare not

245
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,150
be greedy.

246
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,040
Mr. Fu, please rest and recuperate.

247
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,030
I'll prepare more prescriptions for you.

248
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,950
Thank you.

249
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,160
Goodbye.

250
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,670
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

251
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,190
Though we aren't sure about the future,

252
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,760
at least for now,

253
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,590
we can be together.

254
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
In this way,

255
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,830
we will cherish

256
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,960
every day and every moment more.

257
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,040
Perhaps it's not a bad thing.

258
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,310
Shuhong,

259
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,800
take the food over there.

260
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,270
Yes.

261
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,000
Madam,

262
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,870
I was planning to go apologize
to my cousin

263
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
after cooking this bowl of noodles.

264
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,400
I've stayed here for so many years.

265
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,830
It's time for me to retire
in my hometown.

266
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,310
Aunt Kou, if you leave,

267
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,800
who will take care of Mother
and Lingzhi's daily life?

268
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,720
Let Qiuyue handle it.

269
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,560
That girl is very clever.

270
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,560
Then who will take over

271
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,350
the accounts in the accounting room,

272
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,910
which need to be checked daily

273
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,430
and reconciled monthly?

274
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,110
You are the madam.

275
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,960
Of course, you'll take over.

276
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,760
I was confused before.

277
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,960
You were never confused.

278
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,190
Over the years,

279
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,320
Mother's been in poor health.

280
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,240
It's you who's been taking care of her

281
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,400
and managing the household.

282
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,560
You must've been exhausted

283
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,070
and wronged

284
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,590
and put a lot of effort into this,

285
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,350
so the household could be
what it is now.

286
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,960
Outsiders may not know that,

287
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,280
but I'm sure

288
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,870
you know very well.

289
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,190
I...

290
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,800
Aunt Kou,

291
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,840
I know

292
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,380
that the servants often speak ill of you
behind your back,

293
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,910
and you're aware of it,

294
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,670
but you still punish them
when you have to.

295
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,400
I know

296
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,190
that to manage such a large household

297
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,810
with dozens of people under its roof,

298
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,910
someone has to stand up
and be the villain.

299
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,800
Others don't know your grievances,

300
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,240
but Mother does,

301
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,760
Yunxi does, and so do I.

302
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,600
Aunt Kou,

303
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,670
you were never a villain.

304
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,710
No,

305
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,560
I am the villain.

306
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,070
I always make things hard for you.

307
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,390
I always pick on you.

308
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,920
I...

309
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,430
Aunt Kou,

310
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,830
you've lived your life alone

311
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,520
with no one to rely on,
no home, and no children,

312
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,030
so you treat this family

313
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,110
as a shelter from the storm

314
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,720
and cherish and love

315
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,480
Yunxi and Lingzhi as if they were

316
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,560
your own flesh and blood.

317
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
I was an outsider
who just married Yunxi,

318
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,960
so you feared I'd take them all away.

319
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,910
It's natural to think that way.

320
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,670
I understand that.

321
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,480
I've never truly blamed you.

322
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,920
Hanyan...

323
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,280
Aunt Kou, rest assured.

324
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,960
No matter when,

325
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,110
this place will always be your home.

326
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,870
We will always be your family.

327
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,830
When you grow old,

328
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,480
Yunxi and I will be loyal

329
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,110
and filial to you

330
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,560
just like you were our own mother.

331
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,630
I've failed my cousin.

332
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,390
I've failed Yunxi.

333
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,070
I've failed you even more, Hanyan.

334
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,990
Aunt Kou...

335
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,160
I...

336
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,760
- Aunt.
- I deserve to die.

337
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm ungrateful.

338
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,920
Don't cry anymore.

339
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,670
Hanyan, I'm sorry.

340
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,630
How about putting on the silver hairpin?

341
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,070
Shuhong, with the huadian

342
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,430
and the silver hairpin on,

343
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,910
am I a noble lady now?

344
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,960
Lingzhi wants to be a noble lady too?

345
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,350
I heard

346
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,560
Grandmother was a noble lady,

347
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,830
and Mother was also a noble lady.

348
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,390
So, I want to be a noble lady too.

349
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,870
What exactly makes a noble lady?

350
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,350
I'm too clumsy

351
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,630
to explain it.

352
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,590
If I have

353
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,720
a lot of money, treasure,

354
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,590
and beautiful jewelry,

355
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,080
and others bow to me when they see me,

356
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,760
would that make me a noble lady?

357
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,080
Maybe.

358
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,830
No matter when,

359
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,040
there surely are many women

360
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,150
who want to become
so-called noble ladies.

361
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,910
But those grand life lessons

362
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,830
always come through taking many detours.

363
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,590
Only after hitting the wall

364
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,560
can one truly understand.

365
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,270
Yes.

366
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,800
Perhaps what we can do now

367
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,430
is protect her

368
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,110
when she's in despair.

369
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,740
(Naming me Hanyan)

370
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,400
Madam,

371
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,590
this is from the Zhuang Residence.

372
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
It's the obituary

373
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,920
of your father.

374
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,740
(Obituary)

375
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,670
Afraid of punishment,

376
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,630
he committed suicide at home?

377
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,480
What a surprise that the one

378
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,670
who's afraid of death the most

379
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,150
I've seen in my life committed suicide.

380
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,000
Shall we go and take a look?

381
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,190
