00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,260
=The Glory=

2
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,100
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,620
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

4
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,490
(A few days later)

5
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,330
Lingzhi.

6
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,950
Here. Have some candied fruit.

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,040
And try

8
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
the plum blossom cake.

9
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
Also,

10
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,230
the sweet lotus root.

11
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,710
Try them all.

12
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,640
See which flavor you like best.

13
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,280
Thank you, Aunt Yushan.

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,710
I like them all.

15
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,640
Good girl. If you like them,

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
I'll bring you more next time.

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
Is that alright?

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Alright.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
Miss Yushan, you came uninvited.

20
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,360
So you're no longer grounded?

21
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,150
Yunxi, you underestimate me.

22
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,470
How could the ancestral hall confine me?

23
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,470
It's been days since I last saw Miss Hanyan.

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,630
I wonder if she's doing well.

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,630
She's currently recovering.

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,750
Smallpox is dangerous.

27
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,400
Even after recovery,

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,750
it leaves the face covered in scars.

29
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,870
It's better for her not to go out anymore,

30
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,990
so as not to frighten others.

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Father, is Aunt Hanyan ill?

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,080
Lingzhi, don't worry.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Aunt Yushan

34
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,310
is jealous of Aunt Hanyan's beauty

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
and spoke rudely.

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,130
I…

37
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,750
You mean I'm jealous?

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,680
Yunxi…

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Sir,

40
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,710
she's here.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
Who's here?

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,590
Oh my heavens.

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,960
How could you leave the ancestral hall?

44
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,990
Come on.

45
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,150
Come back with me now

46
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,590
before Madam and Master notice.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,630
Yunxi,

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
did you call her here?

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,760
Miss Yushan has broken the family rules.

50
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,800
If Mr. Zhuang finds out, punishment awaits.

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm doing this for your own good.

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
You…

53
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,560
You don't trust me?

54
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,870
I had nothing to do with the cloak.

55
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,030
It was Zhuang Hanyan.

56
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,520
She framed me and set me up.

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,120
I thought you were busy with duties today,

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,710
so I helped take care of Lingzhi.

59
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,680
I'll ask my mother

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,080
to take care of Lingzhi these days.

61
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,990
Don't bother, Miss Yushan.

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,030
I don't mind, Yunxi.

63
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,960
Miss Yushan, please stop talking.

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,120
Hurry up and leave.

65
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,550
Go quickly.

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
Let go.

67
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,710
Who told you to come?

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,900
It was you, right?

69
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,840
Take care, Miss Yushan.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,310
Take care, Aunt Yushan.

71
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,680
Lingzhi, have some soup.

72
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,920
My Lord.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,710
It seems ordinary,

74
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,720
but once steamed, it fills the air
with fragrance.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,470
Cook it with dried fish, and it turns

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
appetizing.

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,950
Yushan loves
the smoked cured meat you make.

78
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,560
Every year, she'd enjoy a big bowl of it.

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,830
Sadly, she can't have it this year.

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,000
Any news on Cuiyun?

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Yushan is kind and honest.

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,950
She was deceived and provoked by Cuiyun

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,190
and did some foolish things.

84
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,040
Yet she values their bond

85
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,600
and refuses to reveal the whereabouts of her.

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,040
Let's wait a bit longer.

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
Wait until Mother calms her anger

88
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,070
and releases her from the ancestral hall.

89
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,480
I will make sure she is not mistreated.

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,720
You must remain fair to all.

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,480
Miss Hanyan has

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,950
been quiet for days.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,360
Smallpox is dangerous.
I wonder how it goes.

94
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,560
Don't worry.
Her mother is taking care of her.

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,270
She should've recovered by now.

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,390
You brat,

97
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,000
I called you here,

98
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,800
but you don't speak.

99
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,920
Please forgive me.

100
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,510
If you'd like to know
Miss Hanyan's condition,

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
let Madam come and ask her.

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,510
We, as servants, should follow our duties.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,040
We mustn't gossip.

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
You…

105
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,190
Forget it.

106
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,790
Go back now.

107
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,470
Yes.

108
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,870
The maids of Jianjia Chamber

109
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,510
keep their mouths shut.

110
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,870
Ma'am, please take care.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,630
It's better not to overthink.

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,560
Hanyan's mother is relentless.

113
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,120
How can I not be worried?

114
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,500
(Jianjia Chamber)

115
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,340
(Jianjia Chamber)

116
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,680
Miss Hanyan,

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,950
today's meal is here.

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
The two gentlemen from yesterday

119
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,630
didn't suit your taste,

120
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,680
so your mother selected
three more suitors for you to consider.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,390
Please have a look.

122
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,190
This is Mr. Tao,

123
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,160
a native of Yuzhong's northern border.

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,070
His family's been in the tea and horse trade

125
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,720
and is fairly well-off.

126
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,680
This is a scribe from Yazhou.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
He cared for his gravely ill wife
for eight years.

128
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,750
With such devotion,

129
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,000
being his successor wife
wouldn't be a bad choice.

130
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,120
And this is Deputy Shen

131
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,920
from a military household of Bashu.

132
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,630
He is known for being gentle
and protective.

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,510
If you marry him,

134
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,000
you'll surely

135
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,000
live a comfortable life.

136
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,720
Porridge again?

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
You've just recovered

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,310
and should avoid greasy food.

139
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,430
I wonder if these gentlemen

140
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,600
are to your liking today.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,510
Mother has truly been put to great effort

142
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,160
find these suitors from a remote corner.

143
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,430
It must've taken quite a bit of trouble.

144
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,560
Is there anyone else?

145
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,390
Besides these choices,

146
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,000
anyone from more distant places?

147
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,360
These men are all from upright families.

148
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,930
Their birth charts have been matched.

149
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,510
You should make a decision soon.

150
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,830
Do I even have a choice?

151
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
Madam said,

152
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,360
no matter whom you choose,

153
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,360
it's better than getting involved
in this mess.

154
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,720
For years,

155
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
I have failed to serve my parents

156
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,750
as a filial daughter should.

157
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
Today, I swear,

158
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
I will never marry.

159
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,510
I will dedicate my life to my parents

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,870
to make up for the regret.

161
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,910
It seems

162
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,030
none of these suitors

163
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,030
are to your liking.

164
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,800
Take them down.

165
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,630
Miss Hanyan, I'll take my leave.

166
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,710
Wait.

167
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,720
Have you changed your mind?

168
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,320
Take the porridge away.

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,750
I want food.

170
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
Wait.

171
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
Stop.

172
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,960
Nanny Chen.

173
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
The kitchen prepared some snacks.

174
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,630
Grandmother instructed
to send some to Miss Hanyan.

175
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,080
Please open the door.

176
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,440
Nanny Chen…

177
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,350
Nanny Chen.

178
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,960
These are for Miss Hanyan…

179
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,150
We appreciate it.

180
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,230
You may return now.

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Give it to me.

182
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
Give it to me.

183
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,750
It's better to present it to Madam first.

184
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,240
If anything goes wrong after you eat it,

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,150
I can't afford to take the blame.

186
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,230
Give it to me.

187
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,080
What's the fuss?

188
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,230
What?

189
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,310
It's only been days,

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,890
and you're fighting with the servants?

191
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,670
I dare not.

192
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,630
Hungry, huh?

193
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,320
A bowl of thin porridge each day

194
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,480
doesn't fill the stomach.

195
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,360
Indeed, you're a bit thinner.

196
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,150
Why not settle on a marriage soon?

197
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,360
Find a husband who cares for you.

198
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,320
Even a simple life with plain meals

199
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,960
is better than suffering before me.

200
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,670
Ms. Zhou considers family status

201
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,240
when choosing a husband for me,

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,840
yet you only seek to send me

203
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,550
to some remote, desolate place

204
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,510
to marry a man I've never met

205
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,790
and spend my life with him.

206
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,670
What have I done wrong

207
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,750
for Mother to reject me so?

208
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,200
I may have failed you as a mother,

209
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,840
but in this vast Zhuang household,

210
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,960
no one will stand up for you,

211
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,840
and no one can save you.

212
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,360
You might as well accept your fate.

213
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,870
If I had accepted my fate,

214
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,510
I would've died in Danzhou long ago.

215
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,630
You blame me?

216
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,390
Why shouldn't I blame you?

217
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,750
Even if it was giving birth to me

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,960
that caused your legs to be crippled,

219
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,840
what does that have to do with me?

220
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,390
Do you truly believe

221
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm willing to have come to this world?

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,500
When you gave birth to me,

223
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,240
did you ever ask for my consent?

224
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,750
All these years,

225
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,270
Father would occasionally

226
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,880
send some silver and pastries to Danzhou,

227
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,080
write a few letters to show his concern.

228
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,270
But you?

229
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,630
What have you ever done for me?

230
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,270
Truly your father's dutiful child.

231
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,320
Zhuang's perfect daughter.

232
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,470
Fine.

233
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,840
From today,

234
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,910
there is no bond between us.

235
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,720
Take her to the side room.

236
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,310
Lock all the doors and windows.

237
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,390
Without my orders,
she cannot leave the room.

(Justice Without Mercy)

264
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,600
Yuwen Chang'an?

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,890
Yes.

266
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,200
He seems quite intrigued by Pei Dafu lately.

267
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,740
He used the pretext of review

268
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,440
to uncover the entire case file,

269
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,030
and privately investigated

270
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,150
Pei Dafu's adopted son.

271
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,680
Although he's the Left Imperial Censor,

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,550
the Zuohang Gang case

273
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,080
is not under his jurisdiction.

274
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
Thus, I believe

275
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,380
there must be something unusual.

276
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,800
By the way,

277
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,150
he arranged a meeting

278
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,320
with some officials from Yinan

279
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,390
at Chaling Tavern.

280
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,670
Go inform Mr. Jiang

281
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,720
to host them in Hongyun Hall
on the second floor.

282
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,180
(Chaling Tavern)

284
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,320
Gentlemen,

285
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,660
they say Jianxi's tea is unmatched.

286
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,480
Please have a taste.

287
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,600
Alright.

288
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,390
Mr. Yuwen,

289
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,670
you've never been one for crowds
or hosting banquets.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,550
It isn't just about tasting tea, is it?

291
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,850
You may not be aware of this.

292
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,600
The Emperor tasked me
with drafting the Trade Law.

293
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,710
While I understand legal statutes,

294
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,790
I'm unfamiliar with commerce.

295
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,320
Both of you are from Yinan

296
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,150
and likely have
merchant friends or relatives.

297
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,270
Could you inquire for me?

298
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,150
If we can establish contact

299
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,270
with Danzhou Chamber of Commerce,

300
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,480
it would be perfect.

301
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,600
Though my kin includes merchants,

302
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,720
none have achieved prominence.

303
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,870
I'm afraid they won't be of much help.

304
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,910
However, there is someone in the Capital,

305
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,000
who commands great influence there.

306
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,510
But he's already...

307
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Pei Dafu?

308
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
Mr. Yuwen,

309
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,120
mind your words.

310
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,200
That name must not be mentioned.

311
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,390
Indeed.

312
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,870
If these words reach

313
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,800
the ears of that official
at the Judicial Review,

314
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,870
we'll be branded as remnants,

315
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,960
then we're doomed.

316
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,320
Mr. Sun.

317
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,430
Mr. Yuwen,

318
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,910
I have family matters to attend to,

319
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,270
so I must take my leave.

320
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,910
Please forgive me.

321
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,390
I'm tied up with official duties,
so I'll take my leave.

322
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,030
We are just having tea and chatting.

323
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,360
There's no need to be so overly cautious.

324
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,200
Well…

325
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,910
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

326
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,150
Hold on. Please.

327
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,790
Keep a close watch on Yuwen Chang'an.

328
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,080
Yes, sir.

329
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,070
Miss Hanyan?

330
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,920
Miss Hanyan?

331
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
You…

332
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,680
Looking at your features,

333
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,200
you resemble your mother in her youth,

334
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,070
with her grace and charm.

335
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,400
Xiwen was both talented and beautiful,

336
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,630
renowned in the Capital.

337
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,590
Among the young scholars of Hanlin Academy,

338
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,270
at least half admire her deeply.

339
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,900
(Flying Swan on Snow)

340
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,110
Xiwen, perhaps we should

341
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,400
communicate by letter in the future.

342
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,390
It's not safe.

343
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
It's better to discuss it in person.

344
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,400
I've heard rumors

345
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,440
spreading in the Capital
about Pei Dafu's adopted son.

346
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,310
If that's the case,

347
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,750
we have no choice but to take a risk.

348
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,920
Miss Hanyan, what are you doing?

349
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,630
Stop right there.

350
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,030
What are you doing?

351
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,720
- Stop it.
- Let me go.

352
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
Let me go!

353
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
What's going on?

354
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,240
Mr. Yuwen, please go inside.

355
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,400
What did you hear?

356
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,070
Everything.

357
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,830
Let me hear it.

358
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,310
You secretly met a man at night.

359
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,550
What else do you want me to say?

360
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,480
Such a stubborn nature.

361
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,640
Only Deputy Shen from Bashu

362
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,750
can handle you.

363
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,720
Nanny Chen,

364
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,390
deliver the proposal to the Shens.

365
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,590
Then tie her up

366
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,040
and send her to the manor outskirt.

367
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
Keep a close watch on her

368
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,270
until the wedding day.

369
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,920
Where else do you think you're going?

370
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,960
Let go of me.

371
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,830
I will not marry.

372
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,000
It's not up to you.

373
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,070
I will not marry.

374
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,910
Try me.

375
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,430
Hold on a moment.

376
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,160
Mr. Fu.

377
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,110
You trespassed into the ladies' at night.

378
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,590
I expect a proper explanation.

379
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,570
Miss Hanyan cannot marry.

380
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,150
Fu Yunxi,

381
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,510
the Zhuangs allow you
to stay temporarily.

382
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,960
Yet you even meddle
in the family matters now?

383
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,030
I'm not here as Zhuang's son-in-law,

384
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,220
but the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review.

385
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,250
It's about the Danzhou bandit case.

386
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,920
We have uncovered new evidence.

387
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,270
Miss Hanyan is the sole eyewitness.

388
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,590
Every detail must be verified with her.

389
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,030
It was an emergency, so I had to rush in.

390
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,550
Please understand.

391
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,270
What evidence?

392
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,960
It's not to disclose for now.

393
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,200
Miss Hanyan,
please come with me to the Judicial Review.

394
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,340
What if I refuse to let her go?

395
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,270
If you interfere,

396
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,550
don't blame me for being rude.

397
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,480
Take her.

398
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,440
Before the case is fully resolved,

399
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,880
Miss Hanyan is forbidden
to leave the Capital.

400
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,680
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

401
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,820
(Judicial Review)

402
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,910
Hungry?

403
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,640
Trying to scare me, are you?

404
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,590
Most women who end up in the prison

405
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,070
either wail for mercy or faint outright.

406
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,440
Even men like Mu Feng,

407
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,590
spent days retching

408
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,750
from the stench of blood
when he first arrived.

409
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,030
But you seem completely unfazed.

410
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,070
I grew up in the countryside.

411
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,400
I've seen animals being slaughtered.

412
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,160
You get used to the smell after a while.

413
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,240
Good to hear.

414
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,100
I wouldn't want to upset your stomach.

415
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,310
Why aren't you eating?

416
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,030
Is the food not to your liking?

417
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,510
Quite the opposite.

418
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,350
It's absolutely to my liking.

419
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,350
Glutinous rice.

420
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,590
Dongpo pork.

421
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,070
Three-crisp delicacies.

422
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,110
They're all my favorite.

423
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,440
You're quite attentive.

424
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,040
It's a habit.

425
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,760
A habit

426
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,960
of observing others' preferences.

427
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,080
Yes.

428
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,110
Why?

429
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Makes it easier

430
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,960
when poisoning someone.

431
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,030
Aren't you afraid?

432
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,440
You won't poison me.

433
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,880
Why are you so certain?

434
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,590
You went through so much trouble
to save me.

435
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,440
Was it just to poison me?

436
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,670
I didn't save you.

437
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm interrogating you.

438
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,110
Go ahead.

439
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,110
What did Yuwen Chang'an and your mother

440
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,350
talk about?

441
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,790
How do you know about that?

442
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,030
Answer my question.

443
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,070
The two met secretly tonight.

444
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,480
What did they discuss?

445
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,000
What exactly

446
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,720
are you trying to do?

447
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,200
Answer my question.

448
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,310
Too far away.

449
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,510
I couldn't hear clearly.

450
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,440
I only heard them recite a few poems.

451
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,830
Just ancient tales.

452
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,030
I could have you tortured.

453
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,310
Believe it or not.

454
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,070
Aren't you curious

455
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,510
about the connection between your father,

456
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,880
your mother, and Yuwen Chang'an?

457
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,750
What kind of connection do they share?

458
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,550
What connection?

459
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,270
It's an old story.

460
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,200
Your mother's father,

461
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,160
your grandfather,

462
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,820
was once a Grand Scholar
of the Hanlin Academy,

463
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,300
and a mentor to many scholars.

464
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,700
(Young Yuwen Chang'an)

465
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,270
Zhuang Shiyang and Yuwen Chang'an

466
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,110
(Young Ruan Xiwen)
were both his students.

467
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,980
(Young Zhuang Shiyang)

468
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,060
(Ruan Manor)

469
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,790
Later, the Ruans incurred imperial wrath

470
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,260
and fell into ruin overnight.

471
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,350
Yuwen was sent
to Qingzhou on official duty.

472
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,210
By the time he rushed back

473
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,590
to the Capital,

474
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,640
(Zhuang Residence)

475
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,030
(Wedding Procession)
it was too late.

476
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,220
(Happiness)

477
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,640
From that day forward,

478
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,200
Yuwen became Zhuang's sworn rival,

479
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,680
constantly at odds in court.

480
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,480
Though his career flourished,

481
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,350
he never married.

482
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
Rumors have long suggested

483
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,720
that he still has feelings for Ruan Xiwen.

484
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,040
He

485
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,680
still loves my mother?

486
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,830
What caused the Ruans' downfall?

487
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,830
I have no interest in your mother's past

488
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,670
with Yuwen.

489
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,960
I must find out

490
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,550
what they are plotting.

491
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,650
Now, only you

492
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,400
can help me uncover the truth.

493
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,270
You overestimate me.

494
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,920
I can barely protect myself.
Let alone helping you.

495
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,640
With the edict from the Judicial Review,

496
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,830
no one would dare force you into marriage.

497
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,040
Besides,

498
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,270
aren't you even a little curious

499
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,260
about what they're scheming?

500
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,150
Miss Hanyan,

501
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,030
where is your hairpin?

502
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,110
Today,

503
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
why didn't I see you wearing it?

504
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,350
What do you want me to do?

505
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,480
How you investigate is your concern.

506
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,880
You startled the Jianjia Chamber tonight.

507
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,400
They won't meet again anytime soon.

508
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,070
Go back and rest.

509
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,510
I will devise a plan

510
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,000
to make them meet again.

511
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
I'll let you know in advance.

512
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,880
I can't act freely in Jianjia Chamber.

513
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,040
How will you get word to me?

514
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,110
Through music.

515
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,760
Sir,

516
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,750
a Zhuang's nanny's here to take her back.

517
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,190
Did you get enough?

518
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,590
I lost my appetite.

519
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,400
Thank you for the meal. I'll take my leave.

520
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,590
I'll see you off.

521
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,520
Go ahead.

522
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,250
Make sure to look miserable.

523
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,070
You're good at that.

524
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,800
Miss Hanyan,

525
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,110
this way, please.

526
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,020
(Seclusion)

527
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,140
(Zhuang Residence)

528
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,460
(Jianjia Chamber)

529
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,680
Tonight's curfew. Watch over the servants.

530
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,350
Without my orders,

531
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,590
no one steps outside.

532
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,760
Understood.

533
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,720
Xiwen.

534
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,070
What's so urgent

535
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,720
that we must meet tonight?

536
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,360
It's too dangerous.

537
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,180
An emergency.

538
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,360
(To Yuwen Chang'an)
I received a letter today.

539
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,350
Take a look.

540
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,820
(I'm Zhao Wangshan,
Head of Danzhou Chamber of Commerce.)

541
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,200
(I request an audience.)
Head of Danzhou Chamber of Commerce?

542
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,400
Didn't you meet him last year?

543
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,510
Didn't he refuse to reveal anything?

544
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,360
That's what puzzles me.

545
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,880
But this letter contains only one line.

546
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,430
It's vague and incomplete.

547
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,960
(To Yuwen Chang'an)
Where did it come from?

548
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,900
I haven't found out yet.

549
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,230
Someone left it

550
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,070
on my desk.

551
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,150
Feels like a test.

552
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,440
If he's truly willing to testify,

553
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,710
with the irrefutable evidence I hold,

554
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,400
we can bring him down for good.

555
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,920
The situation is treacherous lately.

556
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,000
We must proceed with caution.

557
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,590
It's of great importance

558
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,280
and requires deliberation.

559
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,030
You know I've been

560
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,230
gathering evidence for years.

561
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,360
Maybe we should wait longer.

562
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,070
- Perhaps…
- There's no perhaps.

563
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,110
I've planned for years,

564
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,360
considered every angle.

565
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,590
There's no need to persuade me further.

566
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,430
However,

567
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,030
my daughter returned unexpectedly.

568
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,630
I must get her out of here at once.

569
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,400
She's still a teenager.

570
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,150
She's suffered enough.

571
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,480
I don't want her to be involved anymore.

572
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,400
I only hope her life from now on

573
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,500
can be filled with happiness and peace.

574
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,070
Ms. Zhou.

575
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,070
Why are you so flustered?

576
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,190
Just now Nanny Chen brought a man

577
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,840
to the backyard.

578
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,400
He seemed suspicious

579
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,670
and headed toward Jianjia Chamber.

580
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,840
Did you see his face?

581
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,150
The night is too dark to see clearly.

582
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,370
But it's definitely not someone
from our household.

583
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,230
Prepare my outfit.

584
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,070
The crimson one.

585
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,480
I need to look my best.

586
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,400
Let's go.

587
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,560
I brought some night snacks

588
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,880
and came to keep you company.

589
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,070
But I found the door open,

590
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,190
and the room in disarray.

591
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,960
Someone must've rummaged through.

592
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,360
I took a quick look.

593
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,920
The only thing missing is your official seal.

594
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,880
This is a disaster.

595
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,110
Who could have stolen it?

596
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,550
There's been a theft.

597
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,190
Should we report it?

598
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,340
Relay my orders

599
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,150
to lock down the residence tightly.

600
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,470
Conduct a thorough search.

601
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,110
Perhaps the thief hasn't gone far.

602
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,880
- Yes.
- Move quickly.

603
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,260
(Seclusion)

604
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,440
Search every room thoroughly.

605
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,920
- Move.
- Go.

606
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,920
Shiyang,

607
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,400
what happened?

608
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,760
Mother, we've been robbed at home.

609
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,650
My official seal has been stolen.

610
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,550
Did you hear anything unusual?

611
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,360
Oh heavens. I had just gone to bed.

612
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,960
Make sure to search thoroughly.

613
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,070
Don't let the thief escape.

614
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,910
Yes, yes.

615
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,670
Thankfully, you're safe.

616
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,150
But as for Madam...

617
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,960
I'll keep an eye here.

618
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,150
Take more people with you

619
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,360
and check the Jianjia Chamber.

620
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,510
Yes.

621
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,350
Be careful.

622
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,000
Come with me, quickly.

623
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,700
(Jade and Bamboo)

624
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,440
Why are you here?

625
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,430
Forgive us, sir.

626
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,960
The Master has ordered
every courtyard to be locked.

627
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,880
Search each courtyard thoroughly.

628
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,190
No one is allowed to leave.

629
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,710
- I think she…
- Madam, something's wrong.

630
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,000
Ms. Zhou said
there's been a thief here.

631
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,460
Master's official seal's been stolen.

632
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,030
The entire household is now surrounded.

633
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,590
Madam, we must get Mr. Yuwen out of here.

634
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,710
At least have him leave our courtyard first.

635
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,840
Otherwise, it will be hard to explain.

636
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,320
Xiwen,

637
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,190
perhaps I should leave now.

638
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,230
This is clearly aimed at us.

639
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,670
It's already too late.

640
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,840
Mother.

641
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,280
Zhuang Hanyan?

642
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,000
You tipped off Zhou Ruyin, didn't you?

643
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,760
I knew you'd suspect me,

644
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,960
but it has nothing to do with me.

645
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,840
I just want to know

646
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,230
what did you mean?

647
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,670
What are you plotting together?

648
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,590
Over these past days,

649
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,840
you have humiliated me time and again,

650
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,710
determined to drive me out of this house.

651
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,320
Are you afraid I might get implicated?

652
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,480
What did you overhear?

653
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:47,020
(Jianjia Chamber)

654
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,070
- Bust it open.
- Yes.

655
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,070
Madam, they're forcing their way in.

656
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,280
You must decide now.

657
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,630
We'll talk about this later.

658
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,630
Mr. Yuwen, go to my room for now.

659
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,550
How can I go to your room?

660
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,190
Ms. Zhou is coming in aggressively.

661
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,070
Clearly, they aim to tarnish Mother's name.

662
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,830
She is the Madam of the Zhuangs.

663
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,680
Her reputation must remain untarnished.

664
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,470
But I am not afraid.

665
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,630
Why are you not afraid?

666
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,760
You're an unmarried young lady.

667
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,880
How can you say that?

668
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,550
A few rumors mean nothing.

669
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,190
Compared to being called a barefoot ghost,

670
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,110
what does it matter?

671
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,840
As long as Mother is secure,

672
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,450
I'll have nothing to fear.

673
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,400
If Mother loses power, all will be ruined.

674
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,960
Where did you learn such schemes?

675
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,460
At this point,

676
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,190
there's no need for us to doubt each other.

677
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,030
I know you have secrets,

678
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,000
but I trust you won't hurt me.

679
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,320
Why are you so sure?

680
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,670
Let me warn you again.

681
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,230
Stop using your talents

682
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,670
on trivial household matters.

683
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,190
Now is not the time to discuss this.

684
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,440
Mr. Yuwen, come with me.

685
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,840
Nanny Chen,

686
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,120
take her.

687
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,030
Miss Hanyan.

688
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,280
Miss Hanyan.

689
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,510
Mother.

690
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,360
Even if I lose everything today,

691
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,620
it has nothing to do with you.

692
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,030
It's all my own matter.

693
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,600
Jilan,

694
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,800
push me outside.

695
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,430
- Mother.
- Miss Hanyan.

696
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,320
It's…

697
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,510
Xiwen, don't go out.

698
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,350
Mr. Yuwen,

699
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,920
no matter what happens out there,

700
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,760
do not step out.

701
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,440
Nanny Chen, close the door.

702
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,950
Let's go.
