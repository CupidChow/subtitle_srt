00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Tyrannosaurus

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It smells disgusting.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It smells disgusting.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Father, there is a danger in the Yinan valley.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
The communication is only a word.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,840
No wonder the Pei master will ask for you.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
What do you call that traitor?

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Pei master!

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Father, you misunderstood.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
That traitor is a cunning man.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,340
He is just a scapegoat.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,540
I'm just worried...

42
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,340
He is the one who should be worried.

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,840
I have warned him.

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Tonight, I will write the memorial.

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Tomorrow morning, I will go to the heaven.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,680
I will see if this is a crime that is a mess.

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,180
Can he bear it?

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Father, don't be ridiculous.

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,180
Pei master is a big man.

50
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,180
He is as cunning as a rat.

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,180
You want me to be a scapegoat?

52
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,180
You want to kill the people?

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
I don't dare.

54
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,180
I want to take my father to ask for Pei master.

55
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
I want to apologize to him.

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,180
Maybe there is a chance to return the favor.

57
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,180
Father, don't let the family die.

58
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,180
I will kill them all.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
You are a traitor!

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
You want to die?

61
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Kneel down!

62
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
You want to kill them all?

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
You are a shameless man.

64
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
You have no shame.

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You have gone to the dogs.

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
I will kill you today.

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
I will kill you!

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Zhong Han Liang is guilty of Pei master.

69
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
But I don't want to die.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
You are responsible for this.

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
I have been ordered by the master.

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I will kill him.

73
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
I will kill him.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
From now on,

75
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
I will be the master and father of all the people.

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
I will kill them all.

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
I will hide and hide from them.

78
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
I will hide and hide from them.

79
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
I will use Yinan Shang to help Pei master

80
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
to clean the funeral house.

81
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
I will only replace Tianzhai.

82
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
He is the most favored one.

83
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,860
He will also take the property

84
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,860
and the property to be my master.

85
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
I have been worried about him every day.

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,860
I am sick and afraid of the cold.

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
I am afraid of the cold.

88
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,860
I am afraid of the family's resurrection.

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I will be safe for a night.

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Later,

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I will have the trust of Pei master

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
to be poisoned.

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
But after Pei master is dead,

94
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
I will be the only one who can escape.

95
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I have a life of fear.

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I will be punished for it.

97
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
I don't believe anyone.

98
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Including my family.

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I will not die.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
You promised me

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
that if I sent you a message

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
you would tell me the truth.

103
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Tell me,

104
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Pei master is your son.

105
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Is it you?

106
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
It's me.

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I am your son.

108
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
You have been begging me

109
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,540
to marry me.

110
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,540
But you didn't tell me this.

111
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,540
Do you want me to pull out

112
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,540
from a fire pit

113
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,540
and throw it into another fire pit?

114
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,540
A Yan, you are still trying to marry him.

115
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
He has caused our family to be in trouble.

116
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,540
He is a little bit of a murderer.

117
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,540
If it wasn't for my time in prison,

118
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,540
he would have been killed without any help.

119
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
How could you

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
make yourself so dangerous?

121
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
You are so dangerous.

122
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
I will kill you

123
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
and kill you without any help.

124
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
You will not go back.

125
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
The sky is about to fall.

126
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
I can't let you go.

127
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Let Yu Zu and Huan Fu Yun Xi

128
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
come to meet me in prison.

129
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Mr. Zhuang,

130
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
you are coming to me.

131
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
You are going to admit it?

132
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
I told Yu Zu that

133
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,220
he was going to investigate his background.

134
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,220
So he was in a hurry

135
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,220
and disappeared.

136
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
You must have known where he was.

137
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
You killed him.

138
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
I didn't have the chance to do it.

139
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
I admit it.

140
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,220
I am a traitor.

141
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
Then I will bring it to you.

142
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,220
I will pretend to be a traitor.

143
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Wait.

144
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,220
Wait.

145
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
You are back.

146
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
What?

147
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
I haven't finished my words.

148
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I have not been a traitor.

149
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I have some hidden secrets

150
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
to report to Mr. Fu.

151
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
The man who killed the man

152
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
told me in person

153
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
that there is another person

154
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
besides me.

155
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
You don't want to know

156
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
who he is?

157
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
You can tell me.

158
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
I will tell you.

159
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Forget it.

160
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
From the beginning,

161
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
he died.

162
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
He is not dead.

163
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
He is dead.

164
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
We all have family blood.

165
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
We have family blood.

166
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Once we are gone,

167
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
they will be buried.

168
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
They will be buried.

169
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
I will keep the secret for him.

170
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
I don't know

171
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
if he wants to let me go.

172
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
You have to get him out.

173
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
You have to get some evidence.

174
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
If it is the right time,

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
who wants to kill

176
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
the person who saved the man?

177
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Mr. Fu knows me.

178
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Zhuang Shiyang

179
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
will not

180
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
let my family

181
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
do it.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Really?

183
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Yes.

184
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
So

185
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
you let me take away

186
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
the corpse

187
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,580
and then

188
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,580
you were killed

189
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
for the sake of your life.

190
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,580
I was in the South Hill Hospital

191
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
that day.

192
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
Could it be

193
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
you knew I was hiding outside the window?

194
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
You were telling me

195
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,580
all those things.

196
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,580
I saw you in the Immortal's Palace.

197
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I was waiting for you outside the window.

198
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
I did receive

199
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Zhuang Shiyang's body in the prison.

200
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
But before that, I had already made up my mind

201
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
and gave you the body of Wu Youzhi

202
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
to save your family.

203
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
How do you want me to believe you?

204
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
I said I would never hurt you.

205
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
No matter who I am,

206
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
I will never change.

207
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
You are so stubborn

208
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,260
and you are so stubborn.

209
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Now it seems

210
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,260
that it's just that the world is wrong

211
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,260
and you think that there is only one person

212
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
who is stubborn.

213
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
As long as you arrest Zhuang Shiyang,

214
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,260
you will be fine.

215
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Since I entered the capital,

216
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,260
you have been helping me

217
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
for the sake of my life

218
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
and helping me

219
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
to be a pawn

220
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
who will take me

221
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
to the bottom of the valley

222
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
and to save my family.

223
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
At the beginning,

224
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
it was indeed like this.

225
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Has it changed now?

226
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
You want to tell me

227
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
that you have truly fallen for me?

228
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
If I say yes,

229
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Han Yan,

230
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
don't say that I am stubborn.

231
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
You are going to arrest Zhuang Shiyang!

232
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
You think you are a good person?

233
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
You don't think you are a good person.

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Why?

235
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
I am doing this

236
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
to save Zhuang family.

237
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,940
I have been

238
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
trying to save my family

239
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
and I am alone in the house.

240
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,940
I am going to be trapped

241
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
and I will not be found

242
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,940
by anyone.

243
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Now, I am going to kill my family.

244
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
Han Yan,

245
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
what else can I do?

246
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
Stop pretending to be a liar

247
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
and keep your mouth shut.

248
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
You really think that

249
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
I didn't tell you everything?

250
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
You killed my grandfather

251
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
but you have

252
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
a reason to be punished by me.

253
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
I have been a traitor for many years.

254
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
I have been a traitor for many years.

255
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
I have been a traitor for many years.

256
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You might tell me everything

257
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
and I will not tell you clearly.

258
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Your grandfather was a traitor.

259
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
He was a traitor.

260
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
He was a traitor.

261
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
I am sure that he is the reason

262
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
why he killed my grandfather.

263
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,620
I am just a traitor

264
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,620
who killed my grandfather.

265
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,620
I am just a traitor.

266
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,620
But I have no intention

267
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
to kill you.

268
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
You are my own daughter.

269
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
You don't have to be a liar.

270
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
What you said

271
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
is not your reason to be a traitor.

272
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,620
There is one more thing.

273
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,620
I have told you all.

274
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
Mr. Zhuang likes to be friendly

275
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
and familiar with the medical field.

276
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,620
He died of poisoning.

277
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
You can't get away from this.

278
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
When the accident happened,

279
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
I checked the clues of Pei Da Fu's death.

280
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
But the informant

281
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
was poisoned by you

282
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
during the night.

283
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
I was afraid that I would find out your whereabouts.

284
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
You wanted to poison me

285
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
but you didn't want to kill me.

286
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
I poisoned Yu Jin.

287
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I guess you are right.

288
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Yu Jin was killed by me.

289
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
But the murderer is his father.

290
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
The murderer is his father.

291
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
It's you.

292
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
If you hadn't been killed by me,

293
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
I wouldn't have died.

294
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Feiyu Xie.

295
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Zhang Shiyang.

296
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
No wonder

297
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Pei Da Fu of the Qing Dynasty

298
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
chose you as his concubines.

299
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
The capital is really

300
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
a place where no one can live.

301
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
No wonder

302
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
he wanted me to stay away from this place.

303
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
No wonder

304
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Fu Shaoqing told me

305
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
on the day I first met him.

306
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
He told me

307
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
that he didn't want me to regret.

308
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Now I tell you

309
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I am

310
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,980
regretting it.

311
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
I shouldn't have

312
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,980
been a hidden enemy

313
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
from the beginning.

314
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

315
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
been so jealous

316
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,980
and jealous of you.

317
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,480
I can't understand any words from you.

319
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,640
I wouldn't be

320
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
sorrowful.

321
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,500
You did this safely.

322
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm美味.

323
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Quickly get up.

324
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Xiao Ye.

325
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Are you on leave?

326
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,060
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,860
I shouldn't have hurt you.

328
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,380
If someone lied to me,

329
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,620
I would only want to kill him.

330
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,020
Only if you lied to me,

331
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,500
would I be sad.

332
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,180
You just want to say

333
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,420
that I've given him the truth.

334
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,540
But the flower water is not as good as the moon.

335
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,660
Now that the illusion is broken,

336
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,500
everything is back to its original state.

337
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,940
Do you still remember

338
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,940
what you wanted to get

339
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,820
when you first came here?

340
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,180
I remember.

341
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,180
There was a home,

342
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,700
a place to live,

343
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,500
a place to return to.

344
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,220
Have you ever thought about

345
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,540
how you've been in the hospital?

346
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,740
You have a mother

347
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,900
who is no longer a precious orphan.

348
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,380
Taikun,

349
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,860
follow me.

350
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,980
From now on,

351
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,860
my home

352
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,660
is your home.

353
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,500
Where are you going?

354
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,340
We'll follow mother

355
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,180
and never leave this place.

356
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,260
Never come back.

357
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,420
Why did you make this mistake?

358
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,700
I've decided.

359
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,060
Mother, you don't have to ask.

360
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
But

361
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,940
I used to be friends with a friend in Danzhou.

362
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
He is a orphan who is famous for his family background.

363
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,580
Now he is alone in the capital.

364
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,420
I want to take him with me.

365
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,740
As long as everything is with you,

366
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,300
I'll be happy.

367
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,100
Then I'll get the divorce letter tomorrow.

368
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,980
What are you waiting for?

369
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,220
Oh, check out my book.

370
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,140
T этого...

371
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,300
How do I read?

372
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,700
It'sorar.

373
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,940
Why didn't you read the document?

374
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,620
Yes.

375
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,500
What are you reading?

376
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,300
An reading document.

377
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,260
The document was shown

378
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,540
by Uncle Zangvang.

379
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
I'm a bad person.

380
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
Why did you lie to me?

381
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
At first, I was just to protect myself.

382
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,060
I didn't expect to hurt him.

383
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
I was wrong.

384
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
Then you just admit you're wrong.

385
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,060
It's not that simple to be a man.

386
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
I'm afraid he won't forgive me.

387
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
Uncle Feng is also a good boy.

388
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,060
Then he brought the peach path to apologize.

389
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm afraid he will be a little dog on the ground.

390
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
He just forgave him.

391
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
I don't even want to try.

392
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,060
But I don't have sincerity at all.

393
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
And you still know what sincerity is?

394
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
Of course I know.

395
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,060
Father, do you believe in the soul of the British?

396
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
The earth has a long and short life.

397
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,060
There are many things in the world.

398
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Whether you believe it or not, what is the solution?

399
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,060
If you don't believe it,

400
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
why do you keep on smelling it?

401
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
I'll kill you.

402
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
If I can choose,

403
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,060
I'll choose the soul of the British.

404
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,060
I don't want to touch the soul of the world.

405
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
But if there is a soul of the world,

406
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
I'll live.

407
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,060
Even if you think I'm the biggest evil spirit,

408
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
I'll kill you first.

409
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,060
That's just because I want to live.

410
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
Since that's the case,

411
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
write the divorce letter.

412
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,060
It's your mother's idea.

413
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
You only write the divorce letter.

414
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,060
I'll leave the capital with my mother.

415
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
You're the most important person in the party.

416
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
All of us are the same.

417
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,060
We have no brother.

418
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
You're the son and daughter.

419
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
How can you leave your parents?

420
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
Mother has been begging for a life in the Zhuang family.

421
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
You still don't want to let her go?

422
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
We Zhuang family

423
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,060
have been in a bad situation.

424
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
We've been together since then.

425
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,060
It's not good.

426
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,060
Don't be so selfish.

427
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,060
You've been ruined by your family.

428
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,060
I know your mother's death.

429
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,060
She's blaming me for my death.

430
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
She's blaming me for my family.

431
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,060
She's blaming me for my family.

432
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,060
We'll die together in the future.

433
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
Why do you have to do this?

434
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
You're going to kill your parents.

435
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
You...

436
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
Don't talk nonsense with her.

437
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
You're wrong.

438
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,060
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

439
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Are you happy for me?

440
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,060
I'm happy for you.

441
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,060
You want Yu Yi to get better.

442
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
It's for your own good.

443
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
I'm afraid you're worried.

444
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
From now on,

445
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,060
you can't put me in this house again.

446
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,060
This is the only place you can't choose.

447
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Xi Lan.

448
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
You're here for the next 20 days.

449
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
You have to make up for it.

450
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Make up for it?

451
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
I'll keep it a secret.

452
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,060
I'll help you to make up for it.

453
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
The family was in a mess.

454
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Yuwen Chang'an suddenly got rid of the gold.

455
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
We're married.

456
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060
You're the one who's been making up for it.

457
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
You know that?

458
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:09,060
The emperor ordered my father to make up for it.

459
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,060
But you broke the record of Hanlin Garden.

460
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,060
He let my father die because of the heavy punishment.

461
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,060
He only let me be forced by you.

462
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,060
That's why I'm in this bad situation.

463
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,060
Now the court has a family.

464
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
If you make up for it,

465
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,060
you can't find a good wife.

466
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,060
You're a traitor.

467
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,060
How can you kill your own son?

468
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,060
It's because I love you.

469
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,060
I don't want to be a traitor.

470
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
I forgive you.

471
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
I can't blame you.

472
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
As long as it's not reasonable,

473
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:00,060
I'll promise you whatever you wish.

474
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,060
I'll kill you if I'm guilty.

475
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
No.

476
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,060
We were in love for years.

477
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
We were in a fight.

478
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,060
I said I was wrong.

479
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
You killed my father.

480
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,060
You even made me a Yunni Su.

481
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Have you forgotten?

482
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Do you know why I'm the best at making Yunni Su?

483
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,060
Because that's the most valuable thing in Yuwen Chang'an.

484
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Let's go.

485
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Let's go.

486
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Master.

487
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Master.

488
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
We've been together for years.

489
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
We've been sisters.

490
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
Why don't you say goodbye?

491
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,060
I'm not your mother.

492
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
Don't call me that.

493
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Sister, are you really leaving?

494
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
You still want to keep me?

495
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
I've thought it through.

496
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
You left the capital after you left the mansion.

497
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
You're not a good person.

498
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,060
Yuwen Chang'an is out of his position.

499
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
You're out of your identity.

500
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,060
You can't enter the high school in the future.

501
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
What are you planning?

502
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,060
If you knew what I was planning,

503
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,060
you wouldn't have fought with me for a lifetime.

504
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,060
You can still say that.

505
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,060
I don't have to talk to you.

506
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:15,060
Sister, I didn't expect you to let go of those grudges.

507
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
I've never hated you.

508
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,060
Do you believe it?

509
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,060
I'm just sorry.

510
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
I've wasted my time in the mansion

511
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,060
and I've been fooled by others.

512
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,060
I'm so happy to be a wife.

513
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
Even if you're leaving,

514
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,060
you still want to mess with my relationship with Master.

515
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,060
You're really heartless.

516
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,060
I'm not going to see you again.

517
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,060
Sister said I was heartless.

518
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,060
But I don't know what caused the disease.

519
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,060
Please don't bother me.

520
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
Zhou Ruying,

521
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,060
you're a agent of the Dai Temple.

522
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,060
You're the one who's been protecting the history.

523
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,060
But you're so selfish.

524
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,060
You're willing to be a person who can only betray your children.

525
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,060
You even want to hurt your daughter.

526
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,060
You're so pitiful.

527
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Besides, you're a betrayer.

528
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,060
You've been so blinded by the evil spirit of being a hostage.

529
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,060
You're so blinded by the evil spirit of being a hostage.

530
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
You're not even a traitor.

531
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,060
But you never believed

532
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,060
that you had the power to grow up alone.

533
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,060
You're not the one who's helpless.

534
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,060
You should be the one who's responsible for this.

535
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
Aunt Chen,

536
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,060
see you off.

537
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Miss San,

538
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
I'm looking for you at home.

539
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,060
What else do you want to say?

540
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,060
Not much.

541
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,060
There are only two words I want to say.

542
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
I'm sorry.

543
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
I'm sorry.

544
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,060
If you're done, please go back.

545
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
It's about the will and the will.

546
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
I have a few words to explain to you.

547
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,060
Mr. Fu is a senior official of the capital.

548
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
I'm just a maid now.

549
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Moreover,

550
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,060
I have no other choice but to explain this to you.

551
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,060
Why do you have to explain it to me?

552
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,060
I don't want you to get it wrong.

553
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
I'm sorry.

554
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
I'm sorry.

555
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,060
I'm sorry.

556
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,060
I don't want to ask for your understanding.

557
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,060
I just don't want you to take the misunderstanding away.

558
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,060
It doesn't matter if you misunderstand or not.

559
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,060
We know each other.

560
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,060
No matter what you're hiding from me,

561
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,060
I'll always be grateful to you.

562
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,060
But the murder case and the arrest case

563
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
were all your help.

564
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,060
I didn't know the worst result would come.

565
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,060
We've been together for a long time.

566
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
We have no grudge left.

567
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
Zhuang Heye.

568
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Do you remember

569
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,060
I gave you a windmill in the first night?

570
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
Yes, I do.

571
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,060
I only made a windmill and didn't give you a private letter.

572
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
I didn't want to be in your shoes.

573
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
If I had to give you a private letter,

574
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
I would have a high-ranking consort.

575
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,060
I'd rather be a maid than a maid.

576
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,060
I only want to stay in Changyang for a long time.

577
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,060
This is not the only freedom.

578
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,060
This is what I want to do in my life.

579
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
I think

580
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,060
you might have forgotten it today.

581
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,060
I'm afraid that we'll never see each other again.

582
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,060
I wish you a safe journey.

583
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,060
No need to be a maid in the north in winter.

584
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Thank you.

585
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,060
Let's say goodbye today.

586
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,060
We'll take care of each other.

587
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,060
I came here twenty years ago.

588
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,060
I didn't expect to be so lonely today.

589
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:32,060
I didn't expect to be able to come back to my family

590
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,060
when I was in the Han family.

591
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,060
I didn't expect to be able to come back

592
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,060
to my mother's place one day.

593
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,060
Second Freshmen thanks enacted by her mother.

594
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,060
You are welcome again.

595
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,560
Rest assured.

596
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,420
Uncle Yuwen putting you through life

597
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,060
would as well give us a safe journey.

598
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,060
Please take the audience

599
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,060
and remind us to re-inảng out of the match.

600
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Okay.

601
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
Uncle Yuwen

602
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,360
me and Mother

603
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,060
pay close attention.

604
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,560
Don't earninsky

605
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,860
I'm leaving.

606
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
A little water.

607
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:01,740
Hey?

608
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:03,980
Miss,

609
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,620
the苦horse is not so comfortable.

610
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,820
Wait for a while.

611
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,340
I'll clean it later.

612
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,460
You'll say that.

613
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,700
Really?

614
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,740
No.

615
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,020
You should be ashamed,

616
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,900
to try to do everything secretly

617
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,900
Master,

618
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,940
I don't go to unless you find someone

619
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,860
Maybe it's this

620
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,420
It should be the sixth lady in the manor.

621
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,620
She's going out today.

622
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,860
What's wrong, Miss?

623
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,980
Master.

624
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,820
I want to borrow you a piece of paper.

625
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,260
Wait for me here.

626
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,380
The quantities on the board...

627
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,380
In this day and age and ages from my longing

628
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,580
I know I'm done for twenty years.

629
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,260
It made me desperately wait for my end.

630
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,300
For some reason,

631
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,420
I've always felt Normally, I can't look desperate in my heart.

632
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
After all, I feel an Ambition.

633
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,420
I'm afraid that when I wake up,

634
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,420
I'll lose everything I have.

635
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,420
Life is not a dream.

636
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,420
I only want to be able to have a moment of happiness in my dreams.

637
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,420
My dream is to be born in Wuhan.

638
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Mr. Yuwen, thank you for waiting for me for so many years.

639
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,420
You still call me Mr. Yuwen.

640
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:14,420
I should have changed my life to be in peace.

641
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
In peace?

642
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
Don't worry.

643
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
I'm not a father of Hanye.

644
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,420
But I can bear the responsibility of a father.

645
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,420
I'll try my best to make up for my mistakes.

646
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
I'm sorry.

647
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,420
You shouldn't do this.

648
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:46,420
Xiwen, I'm willing to be your guide.

649
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:55,420
When the snow comes, I'll be with you in peace.

650
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
I'll be with you in the sea.

651
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,420
I'll see the beautiful scenery in the world.

652
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Okay, I won't say so much.

653
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
I'll do my best to make up for my mistakes.

654
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,420
I know you're not good at this.

655
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
But you're my favorite.

656
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,420
I think the legs are different from the legs.

657
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
Try it.

658
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Different?

659
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,420
I've tried it.

660
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,420
It's the best taste I've ever tasted.

661
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
Are you feeling unwell?

662
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,420
Don't be late.

663
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,420
There's poison.

664
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,420
There's poison.

666
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
It's him.

667
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,420
I'm sorry.

668
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,420
We've been in a lot of trouble.

669
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
It's okay.

670
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,420
Xiwen.

671
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,420
Xiwen.

672
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,420
Today is our wedding.

673
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,420
How can we stop this?

674
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Come.

675
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,420
Eat.

676
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,420
Come.

677
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,420
Xiwen.

678
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Xiwen.

679
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
Are you okay?

680
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,420
I'm fine.

681
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,420
I just want to see you.

682
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
Okay.

683
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,420
You've spent a lot of time on these things.

684
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
I like them.

685
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,420
You like them.

686
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,420
I'm happy to be with you for the rest of my life.

687
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,420
I'm happy to spend some time with you.

688
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
What do you think?

689
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,420
I'll let you see the moon.

690
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
What?

691
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,420
We should bow to him now.

692
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,420
After we bow to him, he'll be my father.

693
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,420
No matter how deep his heart is,

694
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,420
even if he's on the way to the throne,

695
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,420
he'll be able to take care of it.

696
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Good.

697
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Good.

698
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,420
Today, I, Yuwen Chang'an,

699
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,420
and Xiwen, are married.

700
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,420
The world is beautiful.

701
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,420
Today, I, Yuwen Chang'an, and Xiwen, are married.

702
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Can you cherish the moon?

703
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
I bow to the world.

704
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,420
I bow to the world.

705
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,420
I bow to the world.

706
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,420
I bow to the world.

707
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,420
I bow to the world.

708
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
I bow to the world.

709
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
Chang'an.

710
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
Chang'an.

711
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
I'm the one who's connected to you.

712
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,420
Chang'an.

713
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Xiwen.

714
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,420
Today,

715
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
you and I are married.

716
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Even if we're connected,

717
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,420
we'll always be together.

718
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,420
I'm not afraid.

719
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,420
You don't have to be afraid.

720
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
I'm not afraid.

721
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,420
Chang'an.

722
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
Chang'an.

723
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,420
Chang'an.

724
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,420
Zai.

725
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,420
You've been drinking with me.

726
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,420
You've been drinking with me.

727
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,420
You've been drinking with me.

728
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,420
You've been drinking with me.

729
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,420
You've been asking me

730
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
if I have any feelings for you.

731
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,420
I'm telling you,

732
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
we're like two-sided lovers.

733
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,420
No matter how much time passes,

734
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
you'll never recognize me.

735
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,420
The thing I regret the most is

736
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,420
that he's the one who's not my soul.

737
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Chang'an.

738
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
I thought

739
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,420
that this is my only wish.

740
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
Today,

741
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,420
I've understood everything.

742
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,420
I'm really so happy.

743
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,420
I'm in Wuhan.

744
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,420
I'm in Wuhan, too.

745
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,420
I'm in Wuhan, too.

746
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
Chang'an.

747
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,420
Chang'an.

748
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
Chang'an.

749
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Chang'an.

750
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Chang'an.

751
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
Zhang Xingyang.

752
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,420
I know you're here.

753
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Zhang Xingyang, I know you're here.

754
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,420
Why don't you dare to come out?

755
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,420
Come out!

756
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Come out!

757
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,420
Qiwen.

758
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,420
Does it hurt?

759
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,420
It's you.

760
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,420
It's you!

761
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,420
In my life,

762
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,420
my father was violent and loyal.

763
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,420
My mother was furious and selfish.

764
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,420
No one has ever loved me.

765
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,420
I've been in the Hanling Garden

766
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,420
and I've been in the Jin family.

767
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,420
I've been in the Hanling Garden

768
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,420
and I've been in theут

769
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:23,080
due to respect for or

770
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,100
it was for casuality.

771
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,700
You are the one I love the most.

772
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
I'd rather sacrifice everything for you.

773
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,700
But why am I so afraid of you?

774
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,700
I'm just going to die.

775
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Lian Shiyang,

776
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,700
I'm afraid you don't understand

777
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,500
what love is.

778
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,500
I don't understand.

779
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
But you don't understand me.

780
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
You are my parents.

781
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
You are my wife.

782
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Who do you love?

783
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
You shouldn't blame me.

784
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
I'm sincere.

785
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
But I never replied.

786
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
You married me.

787
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
You were my only daughter.

788
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,500
I know you love Yuwen Chang'an.

789
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,500
If you didn't have a broken leg and a broken muscles,

790
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
I'm afraid you would have died

791
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,500
after a long time.

792
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
You don't deserve her.

793
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,500
She is a gentleman.

794
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
You are a shameless woman.

795
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
You will never be like her.

796
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Is it painful to live

797
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,500
when she is pregnant?

798
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Is it painful to live

799
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
when she is pregnant?

800
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
You don't like the smell of ginger.

801
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,500
You don't like Yuwen Chang'an.

802
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,500
She has been in a search for the criminal.

803
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
She tried to kill me.

804
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
How could I let her go?

805
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,500
After she ate the ginger,

806
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,500
she died of a broken leg.

807
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,500
She was killed by me.

808
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Yuwen, you know too much.

809
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
I let her go.

810
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
How could I let her go?

811
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
You love me.

812
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Go back with me.

813
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,500
I'll take the medicine for you.

814
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
You must be careful.

815
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
I'll kill you.

816
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,500
You still want to kill me?

817
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
You are so cruel.

818
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
You really want to kill me?

819
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Xiwen.

820
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,500
You don't want to

821
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
kill me?

822
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
I'm the most cruel one.

823
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,500
I'm the one who killed you.

824
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,500
Xiwen, I'll take care of you.

825
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,500
As long as you fall in love with me,

826
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,500
I'll take the medicine for you.

827
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:44,500
I'll kill you.

828
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
No.

829
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,500
It's not true.

830
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Tell me.

831
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
You love me.

832
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,500
You're the one who killed Yuwen Chang'an.

833
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Tell me.

834
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,500
You love me.

835
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,500
You're so cruel.

836
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,500
I love you.

837
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
I love you.

838
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,500
Don't run away.

839
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
I love you.

840
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,500
You're so cruel.

841
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,500
I love you.

842
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,500
I love you.

843
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
I love you.

844
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,500
I love you.

845
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Mother.

846
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Mother, wake up.

847
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,500
Mother, wake up.

848
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Mother.

849
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Wake up.

850
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Wake up, mother.

851
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,500
I'll take you to the doctor.

852
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
I'll take you to the doctor.

853
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Mother.

854
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Mother.

855
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,500
You're so cruel.

856
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,500
I can save you.

857
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,500
I can still marry you.

858
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
I'll take you to the doctor.

859
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,500
Mother.

860
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,500
I can't take it anymore.

861
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
I can't take it anymore.

862
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Mother, listen to me.

863
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:55,500
I'll take you to the doctor.

864
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,500
You've been with me for two years.

865
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:06,500
We've been together for so long.

866
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,500
That's all.

867
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,500
I've been with you for so long.

868
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
I've been with you for so long.

869
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
But after you came back,

870
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,500
you've lost your mother.

871
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,500
She might have found a daughter.

872
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,500
I feel her warmth and love.

873
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,500
I feel her warmth and love.

874
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
I feel her warmth and love.

875
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,500
You're leaving.

876
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Mother.

877
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,500
You can't die.

878
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
Don't leave me alone.

879
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
You can't die.

880
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,500
I'll take you to the doctor.

881
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
I'm so sorry

882
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,500
that I can't grow up with my daughter.

883
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,500
I hope that one day,

884
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:25,500
we can write down all the family names and comforts.

885
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,500
Although I can't see her anymore,

886
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,500
I believe that one day,

887
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,500
we'll finally meet again.

888
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,500
I've been with you for so long.

889
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,500
I feel her warmth and love.

890
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:55,500
I feel her warmth and love.

891
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,500
Who's the one who's crying?

892
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,500
I'm so sorry that I can't see her anymore.

893
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
I've been with you for so long.

894
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
I've been with you for so long.

895
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
I've been with you for so long.

896
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,500
I've been with you for so long.

897
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,500
Maybe we're destined to be together.

898
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,500
We can't let go of each other.

899
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:01,500
But Kurt and other companions

900
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,500
permitted us to be together

901
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:11,500
without a TWOever Dü immigrant.

902
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,500
Jiyang is an ideal hero,

903
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
where we leave no foundation.

904
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,480
...a powerful and powerful police force

905
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,040
of Tamg离

906
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,960
...and making Steward stops our murder

907
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,380
will continuer to suffer

908
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,680
поддерж老怀

909
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,140
the deficit

910
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,080
very depressing

911
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,760
Gulf andМы

912
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,940
I roam the ring

913
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,640
not 어욜

914
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,160
With his plot,

915
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,760
knowledge was fading

916
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,200
I will apologise.

917
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:04,580
I this

918
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,180
ask Your Majesty stay semaine.

919
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,640
I'm afraid I'll die.

920
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,640
But I remember that Mo Xie Chongzhu

921
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,640
is a great emperor.

922
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,640
He's the one who killed all the people.

923
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,640
I'm so bold.

924
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,640
I'm willing to ask His Majesty to give me a hand

925
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,640
because I'm so proud of him.

926
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,640
I'm afraid I'll die.

927
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,640
Do you have any choice?

928
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,640
I'm a man of the world.

929
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,640
I'm a man of the world.

930
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,640
I'm a man of the world.

931
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,640
