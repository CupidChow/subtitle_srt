25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,100
(Mother, Liu Yumei.)

26
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:54,528
Mom.

27
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,460
You are Mu Yumou?

28
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,660
Yes.

29
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,620
What's wrong, Miss Wan?

30
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,460
In that case,

31
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,380
we can try using psychodrama.

32
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,340
What's that?

33
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,660
It's creating a

34
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,660
predetermined scenario

35
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,900
identical to the past.

36
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,540
In that predetermined scenario,

37
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,820
the patients may

38
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,500
remember some things from the past.

39
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,460
During this process,

40
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,940
they can achieve self-redemption.

41
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,100
But, you see,

42
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,940
this method only applies to cases

43
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,740
where the patients understand

44
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,380
the cause of their illness very well.

45
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,660
For example,

46
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,660
psychological trauma

47
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,420
like a car accident.

48
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
Have you used

49
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,940
this method on her before?

50
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,260
Of course I have.

51
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,580
The predetermined scenario

52
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,740
I created for her

53
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,140
was her mother's
accidental fall from a building.

54
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,420
But the effect wasn't good.

55
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,780
This indicates that

56
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,340
what happened back then

57
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,620
was not as simple as it seems.

58
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,660
We can only

59
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,060
investigate what happened back then

60
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,500
and only after that

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,300
can we better help her

62
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,780
and unlock the knots in her heart.

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,700
Coming out for a walk

64
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,420
will improve your mood.

65
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,300
Always staying at home

66
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,260
can make anyone sick.

67
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,940
You really don't have to

68
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,180
waste your energy on me.

69
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,180
I already told you.

70
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,540
I've resigned

71
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,060
as the literary director.

72
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580
From now on, I'll focus on

73
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,660
writing at home.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,700
I'll spend the day with you

75
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,180
and write scripts at night.

76
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,860
It's good like that.

77
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,260
You really don't have to.

78
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,740
Just focus on your work.

79
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,580
Being with you is also my job.

80
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
I'm happy.

81
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,700
Qi Lianshan.

82
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,660
Let's break up.

83
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,380
What are you saying?

84
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm saying let's break up.

85
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,820
I'm really in a bad state right now.

86
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,860
I feel like

87
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,980
I'm not suitable for a relationship.

88
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,380
I have no control over my emotions.

89
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,500
I don't know what I'll be like

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,460
in the next second.

91
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,220
No matter what happens,

92
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,780
I won't leave you.

93
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,060
Since we're inevitably

94
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,140
going to part ways,

95
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,740
let's make it short and quick.

96
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,500
You have better options.

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,180
Coco came to see me before.

98
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,420
She said she really likes you.

99
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,620
I can tell that she's genuine.

100
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,980
Since the beginning,

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,820
the only person I have liked is you.

102
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,340
You really know
nothing about my illness.

103
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,100
Not everyone

104
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,380
can overcome this illness.

105
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,300
I've been
struggling with it for 10 years.

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,060
Nothing works.

107
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Liu Xia.

108
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,940
Whether or not you can overcome it,

109
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
I'll be with you.

110
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,780
Okay?

111
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,500
I'm not discussing it with you.

112
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,220
I've already made up my mind.

113
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,980
You can continue living here.

114
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,540
I'll move out as soon as possible.

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,380
Get out.

173
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,540
What's your name?

174
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,540
My name is Zhang Shun.

175
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,980
You're suspected of

176
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,940
committing
the crime of illegal detention.

177
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,140
We're now arresting you.

178
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,380
Aren't you arresting the wrong person?

179
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,020
Behave yourself.

180
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,460
Behave. Don't move.

181
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,580
Don't worry about my matters anymore.

182
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,660
Fine, I won't.

183
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,860
But why are you
throwing a tantrum at Shan?

184
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,980
He's a nice guy.

185
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,500
Can't you

186
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,540
stop being so stubborn?

187
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,140
None of you can help me.

188
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,260
You're always here every day,

189
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,420
and it puts so much pressure on me.

190
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm your brother.

191
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,020
You're sick now.

192
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,220
If I don't take care of you, who will?

193
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,500
Don't treat me like a patient.

194
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,740
I am not a patient!

195
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,340
Just leave.

196
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,820
Wait, Xia. Don't cry.

197
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,220
Go.

198
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,780
Xia.

199
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,620
Xia.

200
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,660
Xia.

201
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,980
Open the door, Xia.

202
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,820
Xia.

203
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,340
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,460
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

205
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,220
If there's anything bothering you,

206
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,460
tell me about it.

207
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,740
Don't carry it all by yourself.

208
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,340
And if you have any temper,

209
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,140
direct it at me.

210
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,940
Don't take it out on Shan.

211
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,660
He's really nice.

212
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,060
Can you hear me, Xia?

213
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,820
Xia.

214
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,620
Don't feel pressured.

215
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,860
With your current condition,

216
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,540
he won't possibly ignore you.

217
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,980
Okay, worst case scenario,

218
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,580
if he ignores you,

219
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,620
don't you still have me?

220
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,820
Yes.

221
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,060
I'm not all that amazing,

222
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,180
but at least I can
still cook for you, right?

223
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,020
You love eating it too.

224
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,940
If worse comes to worst,
I will cook for you forever.

225
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,740
Okay?

226
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,940
Can you give me

227
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
a little more time, okay?

228
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,540
I promise

229
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,300
I'll settle you down in Su City.

230
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,780
Didn't I tell you?

231
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,300
As long as I'm here,

232
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,140
home is here,

233
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,580
and there will be
no insurmountable obstacles.

234
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,940
Did you hear me?

235
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,220
Xia, did you hear me?

236
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,340
Xia.

237
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,740
Let her have some peace for a while.

238
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,660
This is their own matter.

239
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,980
They can handle it on their own.

240
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,540
Let's go.

241
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,100
I can't leave.

242
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,620
My dear.

243
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
It's me.

244
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,180
I'll take your brother away.

245
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,020
Call me if anything happens.

246
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,460
Let's go.

247
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,260
Xia.

248
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,860
Call me once you've calmed down.

249
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,980
Let her have some peace for a while.

250
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,140
(Those debt collectors are all thugs,)

251
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,860
(without any sense of morality.)

252
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,100
(Debt will only grow like a snowball,)

253
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,340
(getting bigger and bigger.)

254
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,140
(I suggest)

255
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,940
(that you resolve
your family's debt issues)

256
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,780
(through legal means, if possible.)

257
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,380
(You can call 12348.)

258
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,460
(It's a legal consultation hotline)

259
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,140
(for the general public.)

260
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,220
(I'll also contact them)

261
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,340
(in the next few days.)

262
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,100
(They will definitely)

263
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,260
(provide us with legal assistance.)

264
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,140
(Mu Yumou, thank you.)

265
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,900
(Thank you for bringing light)

266
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,500
(into my darkness.)

267
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
(Su City Orphanage)

268
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,260
(It isn't entirely true that)

269
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,300
(we have a moment of happiness in vain.)

270
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,460
(At least we know)

271
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,980
(how to avoid risks)

272
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,260
(and not fall into scams again.)

273
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,380
(Drop by drop,)

274
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
(sand gathers to form a tower.)

275
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,500
(No matter how much debt there is,)

276
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,980
(there will always be a day)

277
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,900
(when it's paid off.)

278
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,660
(I don't know)

279
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,260
(if I can hold on)

280
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,660
(until the day it's paid off.)

281
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,660
(Our teacher said yesterday that)

282
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,980
(if you don't study during the holiday,)

283
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,020
(you'll see tears
when the school starts.)

284
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,860
(Your teacher is really funny.)

285
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,300
(I went to the sanatorium today.)

286
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,580
(An old man at the sanatorium)

287
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,620
(was bitten by a spider.)

288
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,900
(He looked very disheartened,)

289
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,900
(so I thought of)

290
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,500
(buying him some ointment.)

291
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,300
(But he said,)

292
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,100
("At my age,")

293
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,300
("I can't bear the responsibility")

294
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,340
("of being Spider Man anymore".)

295
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,820
(Hua Li.)

296
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,780
(How are your family's debts?)

297
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,620
(Have those people)

298
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,020
(been harassing you again?)

299
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,420
(Hua Li.)

300
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,580
(If you're reading this,)

301
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,700
(please reply to me.)

302
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,900
(I'm really worried about you.)

303
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,420
(Hua Li.)

304
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,500
(Are you okay?)

305
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,860
(Hua Li.)

306
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,780
(Are you there?)

307
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,220
(Are you there?)

308
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,900
Qi Lianshan.

309
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,940
The high school
entrance exam is coming soon.

310
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,500
You must study hard

311
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,860
and strive to
go to college in the future.

312
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,620
Set a good example
for our brothers and sisters

313
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,500
at the orphanage.

314
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,260
I understand, Miss.

315
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,060
Do your best.

316
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,700
(Hua Li)

317
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,790
(Hua Li, are you there?)

318
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
(Mu Yumou.)

319
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,580
(I can't hold on anymore.)

320
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,340
(I'm sorry.)

321
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,860
(Hua Li.)

322
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,380
(Are you there?)

323
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,820
(I'm done with the
high school entrance exam.)

324
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,820
(I'm sorry.)

325
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,900
(I've been busy studying lately)

326
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,580
(and didn't have time to go online.)

327
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,820
(Mu Yumou.)

328
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,980
(I can't hold on anymore.)

329
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,940
(I'm sorry.)

330
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,060
That incident back then

331
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,900
happened at night,

332
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,260
and there was thunder in the sky.

333
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,540
So initially,

334
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,300
no one heard any movement upstairs.

335
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,340
Do you still remember

336
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,300
who made the call
to the police back then?

337
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,340
The girl let out a scream,

338
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,740
and the neighbors downstairs heard it

339
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,660
and ran upstairs to call the police.

340
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,460
It's been several years now.

341
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,220
I'm not quite sure

342
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,980
about the specifics of the case.

343
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,980
Alright.

344
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,980
Thank you.

345
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,940
Okay.

346
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,100
Be careful upstairs.

347
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,100
I have something
to attend to downstairs.

348
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,620
I'll go now.

349
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,140
Okay.

350
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,540
Hello, bro.

351
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,260
(Hello, Shan.)

352
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,140
(Listen to me.)

353
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,860
(My dad just called me)

354
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,540
(and said he found)

355
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,220
(the phone number
of the detective who handled the case.)

356
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,580
(I'll send it to you right now.)

357
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,940
Alright.

358
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,780
(Okay.)

359
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,860
You're back.

360
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,860
I was planning to make

361
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,740
braised pork for you,

362
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,020
but the pork isn't very fresh today.

363
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,380
But this fish is good.

364
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,620
So I bought two of them.

365
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,740
I steamed one of them

366
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,220
and made soup with the other.

367
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,060
I've already scheduled a moving company.

368
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,580
I can move out within this week.

369
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,660
This is your home.

370
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,780
Where are you planning to move?

371
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,100
Have a seat first.

372
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,380
Let me show you something.

373
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,580
Come, take a look at this.

374
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,540
(Real Estate Ownership Certificate
of the People's Republic of China)

375
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,220
(You want to buy the house?)

376
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,940
(You mean both
the upstairs and downstairs?)

377
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,540
Yes.

378
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,740
(I need to contact my friend)

379
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,420
(about this matter.)

380
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,900
(But she mentioned recently)

381
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,860
(that she wants to sell the place.)

382
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,900
Lai.

383
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,620
Could you please

384
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
not tell Liu Xia about this?

385
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,740
(Why?)

386
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,300
(You want to surprise her?)

387
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,700
Yes.

388
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,340
(Wait.)

389
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,540
(If you want to buy a marital home,)

390
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,260
(why don't you go)

391
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,460
(and look at other places?)

392
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,180
(This place is by the street,)

393
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,300
(noisy and bustling.)

394
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,140
But this place

395
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,500
holds a different meaning

396
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,100
for me and Liu Xia.

397
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,220
(Alright.)

398
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,540
(In that case, leave it to me.)

399
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,380
(Let me handle
all the procedures for you two.)

400
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,060
(I will treat your matters)

401
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,020
(as my own.)

402
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,820
Thank you, Lai.

403
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,620
(You don't have to be so polite.)

409
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,300
You mentioned before

410
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,060
about breaking up with me.

411
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,100
But I didn't agree.

412
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,940
Whether you're healthy

413
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,060
or sick,

414
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,980
I won't leave you.

415
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,060
You don't need to do these things.

416
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,380
I need to.

417
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,740
In the darkest period

418
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,460
of my life,

419
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
as you know,

420
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,420
I was deceived

421
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,460
and abandoned

422
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,380
by the people closest to me.

423
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,540
So my principle is

424
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,460
not to deceive

425
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,500
and not to abandon.

426
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,700
You didn't abandon me.

427
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,020
It was me
who wanted to break up with you.

428
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,900
Let's not talk about

429
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
these unhappy matters.

430
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,940
We will get better day by day.

431
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,460
Look at us now.

432
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
I have achieved my dreams

433
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,860
and have the ability

434
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,860
to fulfill my mother's dreams.

435
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,340
I bought a house

436
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,060
with a large balcony.

437
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,460
And this house

438
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,420
is where we met

439
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,980
and fell in love.

440
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,900
It will also be our future home.

441
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,860
And all of this

442
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,740
is because of you

443
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,500
that it has become more meaningful.

444
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,660
So, Liu Xia.

445
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,220
Let's not be apart in our lifetime.

446
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,820

(your mother fell off the building?)

(Wrongdoings come with consequences.)

460

(Mom.)

461
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,420
(I really can't hold on anymore.)

462
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,820
(Really.)

463
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,820
(I know.)

464
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,980
(I know.)

465
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,620
You can't help me at all.

466
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,900
You can't help me.

467
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,300
Because I'm the one who killed her.

468
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,700
I killed her!

469
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,780
I am guilty.

470
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,220
I am a sinner!

471
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,140
(Liu Xia.)

472
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,300
I am not a good person.

473
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,820
Are you saying that little girl

474
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,460
intentionally let go
and caused her mother's death?

475
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,660
I'm not the one saying it.

476
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,420
She herself thinks so.

477
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,420
When we investigate, we rely on evidence

478
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,580
and we need to use logic.

479
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,260
It has to conform to
basic common sense, right?

480
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,740
Let alone an adult,

481
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,580
do you think you can hold onto

482
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,980
a bag of rice

483
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,460
or a bag of noodles

484
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,500
with bare hands?

485
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,460
Furthermore,

486
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,820
she was just a teenage girl.

487
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,580
No matter what,

488
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,340
she couldn't possibly

489
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,700
grab her mother with bare hands.

490
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,540
So, there's no such assumption

491
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,660
of whether
she wanted to save her or not.

492
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,700
Officer.

493
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,980
Can you help me check

494
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,260
the files from back then?

495
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,620
That little girl back then

496
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,220
is now my beloved.

497
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,540
She is trapped

498
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,940
in guilt toward her mother

499
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,140
and can't escape from it.

500
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,180
She suffers from a severe

501
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,100
mental illness.

502
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,460
I hope to

503
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,980
understand the truth of that year.

504
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
So, I hope

505
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,980
you can help me investigate.

506
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,660
Sure, I can do that.

507
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,300
Just wait for a moment.

508
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,020
Thank you.

509
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,580
No problem.

510
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,260
Hua.

511
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,660
Have you seen Liu Xia?

512
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,420
No, I haven't.

513
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,660
She went out at noon.

514
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,580
What?

515
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,500
What happened?

516
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,260
It's nothing.

517
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,300
(Mom, when will this kind of life)

518
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,580
(come to an end?)

519
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,980
(I can't stand this home.)

520
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,780
(Go and die.)

521
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,420
(Why don't you die?)

522
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,620
(Go die.)

523
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,340
(Mom.)

524
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,500
What are you doing, Liu Xia?

525
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,420
Don't come any closer.

526
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,100
Don't come closer.

527
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,380
Stay away.

528
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,940
Stand there.

529
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,140
Stay away.

530
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,460
I'm sorry.

531
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,220
I'm sorry, Qi Lianshan.

532
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,900
I can't hold on anymore.

533
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,300
I'm so tired.

534
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,300
I can't sleep at night.

535
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,100
I have nightmares every day.

536
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,620
I dreamed that my mom

537
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,220
falls from here.

538
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
But I couldn't do anything.

539
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,500
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,140
I can't hold on anymore. I'm so tired.

541
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,060
Just let me end it all.

542
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,860
Please.

543
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,860
I'm the one who should have died.

544
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,740
Liu Xia.

545
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,300
The truth is not what you think.

546
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,140
When your mother fell ill

547
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,620
and after your father left,

548
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,540
she suffered

549
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,940
from severe depression.

550
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,980
You always thought

551
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,420
that the person
on the brink of collapse was you.

552
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,020
But the one who had already collapsed

553
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,460
was your mother.

554
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,300
Your mother...

555
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,020
She wasn't killed by you.

556
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,980
She couldn't hold on long ago.

557
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,300
She tried many times,

558
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,060
time and time again,

559
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,380
to leave this world.

560
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,940
But it was her love for you

561
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,340
that kept her going for so long.

562
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,140
No, it's not true.

563
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,940
No.

564
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,060
If I had tried harder,

565
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,300
if I had just pulled her

566
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,100
a little harder,

567
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,500
she might not have fallen.

568
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,980
You've already exerted

569
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
every ounce of your energy,

570
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,620
but no one,

571
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,340
no one could have

572
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,900
pulled your mother up with bare hands.

573
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,220
Liu Xia.

574
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,060
Don't come any closer, Mom.

575
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,140
I won't go closer.

576
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,220
Don't move.

577
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,260
Mom, I can't hold on anymore.

578
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,660
I don't want to see you in so much pain.

579
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,540
Let me go die.

580
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,380
It's all mom and dad's fault.

581
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,540
We shouldn't have let you bear all this.

582
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,380
It's our fault.

583
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,140
Come here.

584
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,380
Come to me.

585
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,500
Don't be afraid.

586
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,740
Don't be afraid.

587
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,700
It's all our fault.

588
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,300
Mom.

589
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,980
Even in the last second

590
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,700
before she left this world,

591
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,380
she used up

592
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,460
her last ounce of strength

593
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,700
to wish for your freedom,

594
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,460
to live happily.

595
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,780
(Mom.)

596
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,660
Xia.

597
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,500
I won't let you

598
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,900
bear all this anymore.

599
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,140
I'm ill.

600
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
I'm seriously,

601
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,780
seriously ill.

602
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,420
If it weren't for you,

603
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,780
I wouldn't have been able to hold on.

604
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,140
But I couldn't bear to let you go.

605
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,700
I was afraid you would suffer.

606
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,780
I was also
afraid of others bullying you.

607
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,900
But now,

608
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,500
I no longer
have the ability to protect you.

609
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,540
Xia.

610
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,460
Please forgive me

611
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,980
for being selfish once.

612
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,500
Let me end everything

613
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,820
in my own way.

614
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
Okay?

615
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,900
Mom, what are you talking about?

616
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,700
You have to live well.

617
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,780
Mom, what do you mean?

618
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,500
You must remember

619
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,100
that I love you.

620
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,460
I am not a good person.

621
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,580
I'm sorry.

622
