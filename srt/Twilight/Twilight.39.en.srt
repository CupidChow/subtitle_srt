are compensation for you.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,820
I've always been clear
about one's merits and demerits.

28
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,900
You helped me,

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,020
so naturally, I will thank you.

30
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,180
That being said,

31
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,420
you've already succeeded in
getting Liu Xia?

The demon has long been in her heart.

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,020
It will slowly consume her

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,740
until there's nothing left.

35
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,300

I feel like I may not be able
to control my illness anymore.

I can't be with Qi Lianshan anymore.

39
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,460
I don't know how much longer
will it take for me to move on.

40
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,300
I can't hold him back anymore.

41
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,220
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,660
I'm so scared.

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,140
I don't want to lose him.

45
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,580
Mr. Jia.

46
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,260
First of all, I want to apologize to you

47
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,220
for all the disrespect
I showed you before.

48
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,780
Don't worry about it.

49
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,980
Since I'm a few years older than you,

50
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,700
I won't dwell on such trivial matters.

51
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,140
Let's skip the small talk,

52
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,300
and talk about our future cooperation.

53
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,300
I apologize to you because
I underestimated a certain emotion.

54
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,540
When Qi Lianshan told me that
he was willing to write "Twilight" well,

55
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,660
and give you the credit and royalties,

56
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,940
I have nothing to say to you anymore.

57
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,820
I respect his choice and him.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,340
You're lucky to have someone like him.

- Get down from there!

67
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,260
(Prosper Like a Tree)
Don't get near me!

68
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,860
Get down!

69
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,620
Let go of me.

70
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,100
Get down.

71
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,340
Let go of me.

72
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,340
What are you two doing?

73
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,220
Bro!

74
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,500
Look. I caught a thief!

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,780
What thief?

76
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,820
She's the thief.

77
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,940
I was sleeping here just now,

78
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,780
and when I opened my eyes,

79
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,860
I saw her going through your things.

80
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,380
She was looking our contracts!

81
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,780
Let go of her first.

82
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,180
Shanshan.

83
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,900
Let go first.

84
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,180
Let go, and I'll explain.

85
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,620
Let go first.

86
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,140
Look.

88
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,180
This man is crazy.

89
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,100
Just now, he took out his phone,
wanting to report me to the authorities.

90
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,940
He scared me.

91
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,900
He's crazy.

92
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,180
Um, let me introduce you.

93
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,260
Shanshan.

94
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,900
He's the screenwriter I just hired.

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,260
He's amazing and incredibly talented.

96
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,580
This is Yuan Yuan.

97
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,500
She's my junior.

98
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,980
From now on, we are a team.

99
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,660
Shanshan.

100
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,900
Yuan Yuan will be

101
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,780
the Vice President of
our studio, Prosperous Films and Media.

102
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Silly little brother.

103
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,780
Go home and sleep.

104
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,860
There is something wrong with your brain.

105
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
I can't go back.

106
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
Jia Zhen needs me.

107
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,700
Immersive writing.

108
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,820
That's how he revises scripts.

109
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,620
Get us two cups of coffee.

110
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,140
Go away.

111
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,340
What are you writing?

112
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,060
I want to see it too.

113
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,260
Maybe I should get the coffee.

114
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
No need, brother.

115
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,780
You go.

116
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,980
Go pour the coffee.

117
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,900
I want to see what you've written.

118
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
What?

119
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,460
Bro.

120
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,980
I suddenly had an idea.

121
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,780
I want to kill off
the female character just now.

122
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Which one?

123
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,100
Yuan Yuan.

124
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,540
I'll go pour the coffee.

125
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,380
We all want it iced!

126
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,620
She's left.

127
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,260
Shall we sit more comfortably?

128
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,780
It's fine, brother.

129
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,420
I'm feeling it now.

130
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,540
Are you comfortable?

131
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,340
Alright, as long as you're comfortable.

132
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,500
Jia Zhen, here's your coffee.

133
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,660
No sugar.

134
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,020
What about mine?

135
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,340
Don't fight.

136
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,180
Alright, you drink first.

137
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,100
Have it.

138
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,700
He's writing so well.

139
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,060
Slow down.

140
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,380
Drink, brother.

141
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,300
Drink it.

142
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,420
Actually, there are
more cups in our studio.

143
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,500
It's not just this one cup.

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,460
Why not make more?

145
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,380
No, I don't want to.

146
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,380
Bro, I want to make her death
even more tragic in the story.

147
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,460
Yuan Yuan.

148
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
Don't play.

149
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,740
We're working here.

150
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,700
Look, he's writing something great.

151
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,340
Yuan Yuan, take a look.

152
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,980
What do you think?

153
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,380
You registered the copyright
for Shanshan's new project?

154
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,100
Jia Zhen, what are you thinking?

155
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,540
Lately, whenever
Shanshan reaches out to you,

156
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,180
you avoid him,

157
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,300
or you just brush him off.

158
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,940
What exactly are you thinking?

159
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,580
Give Qi Lianshan
a call and tell him that

160
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,740
I registered the copyright for "Twilight".

161
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,820
It's no longer his project.

162
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,780
From now on, it's ours.

163
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,700
We're a family.

164
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,500
Shanshan is your brother!

165
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,180
We're doing better and better now.

166
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,460
Why do you have to do this?

167
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,740
Who is doing better?

168
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,340
You,

169
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,700
or is it me?

170
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,780
No, it's Qi Lianshan who's doing better!

171
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,260
He's the one whose career gets better.

172
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,060
Who is he?

173
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,500
He's just a ghostwriter I hired!

174
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
And now?

175
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,940
He's a literary director!

176
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,540
Screenwriter Qi!

177
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,180
Why is he doing well?

178
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,420
Let me tell you, Yuan Yuan.

179
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,900
Yes, I'm jealous of him!

180
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,060
I can't stand him being better than me!

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,300
Since when did he become superior to me?

182
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,820
You said we're a family!

183
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,260
He's your brother!

184
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,740
After all these things,
do you think we'll still see him?

185
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,100
Why would I keep
someone like him around?

186
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,620
I have plenty of other friends now!

187
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,700
He's nothing to me!

188
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,100
Now that the situation
has escalated to this point,

189
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,380
I take some responsibility for it.

190
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,180
Jia Zhen.

191
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,580
Your cruelty toward Shanshan...

192
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,100
Will it be used against me
in the future too?

193
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,780
This was the first gift you gave me

194
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,420
when I joined the studio.

195
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,980
It says sample on it.

196
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,300
I willingly entered into this game,

197
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,620
and I lost.

198
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,580
Maybe I was wrong.

199
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,740
It took me a decade
to see who you really are.

200
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,860
Or perhaps it was you who transformed
into someone else over these ten years.

201
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,220
Of course, you wouldn't remember.

202
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,940
Hey, you're awake.

203
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,500
Breakfast is ready.

204
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,140
Qi Lianshan.

205
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,780
Don't just stand there.

206
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,340
Hurry up.

207
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,300
Come over.

208
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,180
Liu Xia.

209
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,140
Actually, I want to take this opportunity
to apologize to you.

210
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,980
Apologize to me?

211
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,300
Shouldn't it be me apologizing to you?

212
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,140
I didn't understand
the situation before,

213
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,220
and kept asking you
all sorts of questions.

214
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,460
It's my fault.

215
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,340
But now I've known everything.

216
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,140
I talked to Miss Wan.

217
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,860
She told me about your situation.

218
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,420
So, if you want to say something,

219
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,500
just go ahead.

220
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,460
I can be your listener anytime.

221
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,740
I know it's difficult
to recover from this.

222
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,580
Miss Wan also told me.

223
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,940
But didn't some people recover from it?

224
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,140
So let's take it slow.

225
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,020
No need to rush.

226
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,020
Let's work it out, okay?

227
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,060
I'll serve some rice for you.

228
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,220
Yang Youli deceived you...

229
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,260
Don't blame yourself too much.

230
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,660
The law will
punish him for his mistakes.

231
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,900
Liu Xia is in a very bad state
right now.

232
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,300
She entrusted you
to me to treat you.

233
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,420
How is Miss Liu Xia doing now?

234
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,500
Is she okay?

235
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,380
Whether she can move on
depends on herself.

236
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,780
The same goes for you.

237
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,100
It's all my fault.

238
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,020
Don't cry.

239
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,060
She won't blame you.

240
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,460
What's your name?

241
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,060
Tiantian.

242
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,220
Okay.

243
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,380
How old are you?

244
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,780
Six years old.

245
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,300
Here, I'll give you the ball.

246
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,980
You're so pretty.

247
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,380
Here's a lollipop for you.

248
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,140
Thank you, mister.

249
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,180
Go and play now.

250
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,900
There's a tiger on the mountain.

251
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,020
There's a hunter down the hill.

252
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,900
The little girl is so cute.

253
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,620
Yes, she is.

254
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,900
Little doggy.

255
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,740
What are you doing here?

256
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,980
Are you hurt?

257
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,900
Don't be afraid.

258
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,980
I won't harm you.

259
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,460
Look.

260
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,620
There's also a little bunny here.

261
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,500
Let me sing you a song.

262
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,300
Go to sleep.

263
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,740
My dear baby.

264
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Go to sleep.

265
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,420
Let me go.

266
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,420
Let me go.

267
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,020

271
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,820
Ouch.

272
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,500
Let go.

273
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,420
You let go.

274
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,900
Let me go!

275

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,100
Your daughter would never know

340
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,540
that her father
became a murderer one day.

341
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,900
No child wants to see
their father become a murderer!

342
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,220
All of that doesn't matter anymore.

343
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,100
You've been asking me

344
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,260
why I always wear gloves.

345
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,980
Daddy!

346
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,820
Tiantian was afraid
of the dark since little.

347
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,780
Every night when she went to sleep,

348
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,020
her mother has to
accompany her and comfort her.

349
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,260
Therefore,

350
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,300
the prince chooses her as his wife,

351
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,540
because he knows
he has found a true princess.

352
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,500
The pea is then sent to a museum.

353
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,460
If no one had taken it away,

354
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,620
people could have
still seen it there today.

355
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,620
The end.

356
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,940
Can we go to sleep now?

357
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,700
Daddy.

358
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,660
Don't turn off the lights.
I'm afraid of the dark.

359
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,980
Alright.

360
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,540
We won't turn off the lights.

361
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,940
Can you close your eyes and sleep?

362
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,660
Daddy.

363
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,140
You will protect me, right?

364
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,540
Yes, of course.

365
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,740
Daddy will always protect you.

366
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,780
When you need Daddy,

367
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,940
just call out loud for Daddy.

368
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,540
Daddy will appear
in front of you right away.

369
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,420
Alright, go to sleep.

370
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,100
You have to wake up early tomorrow.

371
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,700
Do you have to leave tonight?

372
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,700
They're going
out of town to capture a criminal.

373
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,020
I don't feel at ease
if I don't go with them.

374
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,540
Take care of yourself and the child.

375
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
When have I ever let you worry about me?

376
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,660
Alright.

377
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,540
Hurry up and go.

378
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,420
Take care and stay safe.

379
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,100
Go on then.

380
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,140
Can you imagine

381
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,980
how much Tiantian wanted to come out?

382
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,260
I can now understand
how helpless she must be back then.

383
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,060
Can you understand?

384
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,900
Daddy.

385
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,180
Daddy.

386
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,220
Daddy.

387
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,420
At that time, she must have
been wondering where Daddy was.

388
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,740
Why wasn't Daddy going to rescue her?

389
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,340
Indeed.

390
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,260
Why couldn't I save her?

391
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,100
Right.

392
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,500
Weren't you searching for the truth?

393
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,380
The truth is right in front of you now.

394
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,780
I am the murderer
you've been looking for.

395
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,820
Perhaps only when your loved one

396
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,220
dies in front of you,

397
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,340
will you understand

398
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,580
the pain in my heart!

399
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,820
(Actually, Jia Zhen hasn't read
Qi Lianshan's script for a long time.)

400
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,740
(Putting away the script,)

401
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,340
(he wants to call and ask Qi Lianshan)

402
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,460
(who fired the shot in the end.)

403
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,220
(Jia Zhen knows that in real life,)

404
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,580
(it was he who fired the shot.)

405
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,460
(He wants to know
whether Qi Lianshan resents him.)

406
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,140
I already made it clear
that the content is the priority.

407
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,980
There's no problem
focusing on the content.

408
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,220
But the contract explicitly states

409
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,060
that each episode
must have no less than 40 scenes,

410
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,780
and no less than 14,000 words.

411
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,420
Look.

412
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,540
Your Episode 3 is
still over a 1,000 words short.

413
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,140
(Prosperous Like a Tree)
How can I submit it like this?

414
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,300
If you want me to write
the additional 1,000 words,

415
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,420
they'll all be filler scenes.

416
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,380
What's the point?

417
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,780
Don't write filler scenes then.

418
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,380
Write another scene seriously.

419
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,740
Didn't I say it already?

420
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,940
If I write further, they'll turn into
filler scenes and affect the pacing.

421
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,060
This version has the best pacing.

422
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,620
The male lead has quite a temper.

423
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,500
Shanshan.

424
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,860
When we submit these scripts,

425
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,580
it's the image of our entire team.

426
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Can't you consider that for us?

427
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,860
Don't always write about your male lead.

428
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Give more scenes
to your other roles too.

429
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,460
Hey, listen to me!

430
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,980
Alright.

431
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,860
Stop arguing.

432
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,020
Come.

433
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,100
Look.

434
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,860
Just a moment ago,

435
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,940
when I saw you two arguing,

436
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,900
my heart was incredibly warm.

437
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,940
I immediately thought of
that moment of inspiration,

438
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,620
when I wrote down these four characters.

439
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,660
Prosper like a tree.

440
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,300
I feel that in the midst of it all,

441
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,860
it's a kind of destiny.

442
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,460
Now, I finally have a team too.

443
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,820
Right?

444
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,340
Come.

445
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,260
Shanshan, give me your hand.

446
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,220
Hand?

447
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,020
Let's close our eyes together,

448
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,820
and feel this moment.

449
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,500
The power from a team.

450
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,140
Follow me.

451
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,340
Be in the character.

452
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,460
I love you all.

453
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,060
I love you too.

454
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,940
Love you too, bro.

455
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,020
Shanshan.

456
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,540
This is the birthday gift
that I had prepared for you.

457
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,940
It's called Dual Purpose.

458
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,940
Here is the reason.

459
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,580
Take a look.

460
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,620
This is a pen.

461
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,220
Since you enjoy
writing and taking notes,

462
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,700
I bought you a good pen.

463
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,660
And on other hand...

464
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,060
It's a voice recorder.

465
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,540
Look.

466
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,180
When someone speaks fast,

467
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,900
and you can't write it down in time,

468
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,500
you can use this voice recorder.

469
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,300
Just press the button,

470
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,060
and it will record it.

471
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,500
Thank you, bro.

472
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,220
No problem.

473
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,380
Let's cut the cake for everyone.

474
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
The fork. Give it to the birthday boy.

475
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,660
Birthday boy, use this to cut it.

476
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,300
Alright.

477
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,500
They're here today
specifically to celebrate your birthday.

478
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:48,700
Alright.

479
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,860
I'll...

480
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,100
Just make the first cut.

481
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,460
Okay.

482
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,180
Let me tell you.

483
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,900
Qi Lianshan is really kind.

484
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,940
He's very talented.

485
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,780
For smaller projects,

486
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,140
I don't even bother to ask him.

487
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:57,780
Done.

488
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,540
Good.

489
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,420
Just the first cut.

490
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,100
Take this.

491
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,580
I'll cut the cake.

492
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,300
Yes.

493
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,020
Let's divide the cake.

494
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,340
Let's divide it up.

495
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,020
I'll do it.

496
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,380
So,

497
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
do you like it?

498
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,140
Of course, I love it.

499
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,940
Shanshan.

500
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,340
From now on, I'll always
be there for your birthday.

501
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,900
Thank you, bro.

502
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,140
(Jia Zhen feels ashamed of himself.)

503
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,980
(He deceives his best friend
to achieve his goals.)

504
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,700
(In the end, he ends up with nothing.)

505
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,980
Got it.

506
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,980
Shanshan's dream is to
become a great screenwriter.

507
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,220
You see.

508
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,300
Once we become successful,

509
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,140
I'll be a big boss,

510
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,260
a big producer.

511
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,340
And Miss Yuan Yuan will be
a renowned executive producer.

512
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,260
We won't mistreat you, right?

513
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,260
At that time,

514
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,060
let's get a big villa
by the seaside as our company.

515
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,980
It'll have constant indoor
temperature, humidity, and oxygen.

516
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,020
And it's the type

517
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,260
in which you push open the doors
and see the sea.

518
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,500
Bro.

519
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,300
Count on me.

520
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,420
I'll make it happen.

521
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,420
Let's toast.

522
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,300
Sure.

523
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,140
Cheers.

524
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,580
Cheers!

525
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,220
I'll go first.

526
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,420
You go first.

527
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,300
Bro.

528
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,660
Don't you know how to swim?

529
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,940
So what?

530
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,620
You can teach me.

531
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,340
I won't teach you.

532
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,420
Just hold on to me.

533
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,420
(Memories of the past
vividly come to his mind,)

534
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,100
(even though the pain is now gone.)

535
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,140
(Everyone is
responsible for their own lives.)

536
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,780
(Jia Zhen ultimately lacked
the courage to call Qi Lianshan again.)

537
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,620
(Without saying goodbye,)

538
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,780
(they left each other's lives.)

539
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,140
(Script)

540
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,700
Over here.

541
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,860
Why are we eating hot pot?

542
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,060
I just washed my hair.

543
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,980
You forgot?

544
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,140
Back then, you became my disciple here.

545
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,220
Our story also began here.

546
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,940
We should finish
where we started, right?

547
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,540
So the same goes for a relationship.

548
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,860
By the way, actually,

549
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,340
I heard what you said that day.

550
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,300
I felt quite ashamed.

551
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,500
I even wished to find a hole to hide in.

552
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,620
Later, I told everyone that
I went out to explore opportunities.

553
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,180
But in reality, I started
driving for a ride-hailing company.

554
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,300
So you never left Su City?

555
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,580
No, I did.

556
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,300
I went to Guangzhou later.

557
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,940
I worked in animation with a classmate.

558
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,100
You know I like reading manga, right?

559
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,460
You always scolded me for it.

560
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,540
Anyway, after all these years,

561
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,380
I finally found my strength.

562
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,860
Anyway, my current state is like...

563
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,300
How should I put it?

564
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,020
It's like a dragon plunges into the sea,

565
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,140
soaring freely.

566
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,300
You still have that habit of bragging.

567
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,100
Well, it's not that easy to change.

568
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,820
That's just how people are.

569
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,140
Just like loving someone.

570
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,060
It won't change after three years,
five years, or perhaps even a decade.

571
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,620
And I'm a bit stubborn,

572
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,980
sometimes to the point of being foolish.

573
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,780
Jin Ran, to be honest.

574
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,260
Actually,

575
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:01,060
deep down, I know I'm not worthy of you.

576
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,900
Really.

577
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,300
I feel like I'm not good enough,

578
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,420
so sometimes I get
worked up in front of you.

579
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,900
It's all a sign of inferiority.

580
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,980
I lack confidence.

581
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,260
And also,

582
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,180
we were impulsive when we got married,

583
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,700
so I never really prepared myself

584
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,780
for how to be a husband,

585
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,500
and how to
take responsibility for a family.

586
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,620
So I...

587
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,940
Let's not talk about it. Eat first.

588
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,500
Let me finish, okay?

589
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,260
At least, our break-up
shouldn't end hastily like last time.

590
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,780
During this time,

591
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,300
I really pondered about it
for a long time.

592
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,540
I reflected on it.

593
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,780
I have to admit that I did
some things that were really wrong.

594
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,980
I'm sorry.

595
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,940
Slow down.

596
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,180
Marriage is a
shared responsibility between the two.

597
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,100
It can't be just one person's fault.

598
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,620
I was at fault too.

599
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,820
When I took you
to get married back then,

600
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,900
actually, looking back now,

601
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,260
I made a hasty decision too.

602
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,700
I just thought

603
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:48,260
if two people get along well,
they should get married.

604
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,180
But the truth is,
no one really knows what marriage is.

605
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,540
Well,

606
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,060
I mean, if...

607
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,660
If we both know now,

608
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,380
would you still accept me?

609
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,300
Would you give me another chance?

610
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,980
Would you marry me again?

611
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,220
Marry him!

612
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,900
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

613
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,260
Marry him!

614
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,060
Marry him!

615
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,660
Yes, marry him!

616
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,980
Say yes!

617
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,060
I don't want to.

618
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,260
Listen, I...

619
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,420
I don't want to get married.

620
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,540
But,

621
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,580
as for dating,

622
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,260
I can give it a thought.
