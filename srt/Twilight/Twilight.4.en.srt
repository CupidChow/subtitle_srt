(Su Cheng TV Station)

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,350
Jing, you are back.

28
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,350
Yes, yes.

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,030
Jing.

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,430
You're back.

31
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,270
I'm back, I'm back.

32
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,790
Jing.

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,350
Jing.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,310
What special local product
did you bring back this time?

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,950
What special local product?

36
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,750
Do you think I went on a trip?

37
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,910
Give me the documents.

38
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,910
I'll sign them first.

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,790
Here it is. Take a look.

40
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,830
Alright.

41
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,670
Jing.

42
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,760
I will send the videos
and pictures to you later.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,320
Okay.

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,280
- Hi, Jing.
- Hi.

45
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,950
Miss Zhao.

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,710
Here are the materials for this meeting.

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,270
Keep them safe.

48
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,870
Alright.

49
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,910
Jing, you're back.

50
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,070
You didn't even rest after coming back.

51
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,350
You are so busy
with photography work again.

52
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,830
Are you free?

53
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,910
Can you deal with this for me?

54
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,910
Jing, please don't.

55
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,830
I'm just passing on a message.

56
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,430
Boss wants you to go to his office.

57
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,190
This show is starting
strong but declining now.

58
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,910
The ratings are dropping rapidly.

59
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,830
Even online
popularity is decreasing.

60
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,270
If this continues,

61
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,990
it's not that I don't want
to protect you,

62
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,310
but others will have comments.

63
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,070
Alright, Mr. Wu, I got it.

64
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,070
I also want the following programs

65
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,510
to have more
popularity and more highlights.

66
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,390
Otherwise,

67
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,310
why would I go on a field trip
after finishing the training in Hangzhou?

68
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,110
I'm thinking, why not
make the coming programs

69
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,670
an outdoor one?

70
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,230
Increase the interaction
between the contestants.

71
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,310
That way, it will be more exciting.

72
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,230
Outdoor?

73
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,230
You want me to increase costs?

74
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,950
You've already changed two sponsors.

75
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,990
Which program frequently changes sponsors

76
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,550
during the recording process?

77
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,470
Fine, forget about it.

78
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,270
Just forget I said anything.

79
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,070
It would become a joke if it spread.

80
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,390
To say you're not working hard enough,

81
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,950
you seem busier than anyone else.

82
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,470
Look at those young people outside.

83
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,430
Which one of them
isn't as ambitious as a wolf?

84
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,510
In terms of creativity,

85
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,230
you said you're getting old.

86
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,990
Your thoughts can't
keep up with the trends.

87
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,030
What about management?

88
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,190
You can't let go of your pride.

89
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,990
You will be holding a walkie-talkie
and shouting at the scene.

90
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,670
I'm the director. How can you...

91
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,190
Can you stop acting like a swindler?

92
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,760
Alright, that's enough.

93
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,000
Just say a few words, alright?

94
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,830
Then what do you want me to do?

95
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,430
Should I die?

96
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,910
Look at you.

97
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,590
I just said a few
words and you react like this.

98
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,190
Do you know what's the latest requirement
from the station?

99
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,470
Elimination of the bottom.

100
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,070
If your mindset becomes lax,

101
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,510
you won't last long.

102
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,110
Taking medicine again. You're so weak.

103
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,870
Who's weak? You're the weak one.

104
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,980
Your whole family is weak.

105
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,070
What kind of joke is this?

106
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,750
Do you know what you look like now?

107
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,550
Like an old cow.

108
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,870
Can't eat or move.

109
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,510
It's a waste to kill it.
But it's expensive to feed it.

110
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,270
And the most important thing is,
it has a bad temper.

111
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,510
And do you know what you look like?

112
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,830
I don't know.

113
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,230
You look like an old hen in the village.

114
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,390
It never lays eggs properly.

115
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,630
It just keeps clucking.

116
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,670
You!

117
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,190
Wake up.

118
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,270
Wake up.

119
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,590
Wake up.

120
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,630
That's right.

121
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,910
Shanshan.

122
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,990
You should have written it
like this long ago.

123
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,710
Bro.

124
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,590
Do you think this version
of the script is good?

125
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,430
Good.

126
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,310
Well, not exactly.

127
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,710
But it's not bad either.

128
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,230
At least I can smell the scent of love.

129
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,030
I'll quickly send it to the client.

130
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,590
Let them take a look.

131
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,830
Don't rush into the next step.

132
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,550
Wait for the news.

133
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,230
Alright.

134
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,670
So, can I take a rest now?

135
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,830
That's great.

136
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,990
By the way, bro.

137
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,350
About my payment,

138
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,790
when can you give it to me?

139
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,430
As soon as I mentioned the payment,

140
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,590
you stopped replying.

141
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,030
There are so many typos in your script.

142
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,030
Next time you send it,

143
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,550
make sure to proofread it yourself.

144
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,350
If people see a lot of typos,

145
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,520
they'll think we're unprofessional.

146
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,880
How could there be typos?

147
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,960
Try taking off your glasses.

148
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
Maybe you'll see a different world.

149
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,760
You're blabbering again, aren't you?

150
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,270
Alright,

151
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,830
what did you just say?

152
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,750
Payment.

153
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,830
When can I receive my payment?

154
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,150
I've reminded them.

155
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,670
They said they'll arrange it immediately.

156
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,430
Once the money is received,

157
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,270
I'll have Yuan Yuan transfer it to you.

158
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,150
Wasn't it already arranged last month?

159
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,990
Their accountant went on vacation again?

160
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,470
Went on vacation?

161
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,310
I knew it.

162
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,270
Who told you?

163
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,430
The accountant
from the previous project.

164
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,550
Isn't their accountant
always on vacation?

165
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,670
I feel like that accountant

166
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,030
is even more idle than the boss.

167
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,590
You don't have money left to spend?

168
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,750
I have some.

169
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,070
Enough to get by.

170
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,630
Bro.

171
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,070
You don't have
to give me money every time.

172
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,790
Have one.

173
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,270
I don't need it this time.

174
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,350
Shanshan.

175
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,790
If we have no money,

176
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,750
we have to find a way to make money.

177
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,390
The current situation is tough.

178
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,790
The winter of the
film and television industry.

179
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,190
Don't mention those small companies.

180
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,550
Even if listed big companies

181
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,230
delay your payment for months,

182
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,190
it's very normal.

183
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,110
What can we do?

184
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,950
Sue them?

185
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,950
We are both in vulnerable groups.

186
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,350
Lower-class people.

187
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,470
We can't win if we sue them.

188
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,230
What did I say earlier?

189
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,270
Eggs

190
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,350
definitely can't be put in one basket.

191
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,590
So we

192
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,830
have to start a new project again?

193
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,190
Why did you say "again"?

194
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,150
Where did the new one come from?

195
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,390
Don't act like you don't know.

196
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,750
You know about this matter.

197
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,910
You even went for field research.

198
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,110
Have you forgotten
about experiencing life?

199
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,710
That youth drama?

200
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,070
No, no, no.

201
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,910
Why not?

202
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,030
You don't have
any professionalism at all.

203
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,230
Don't you want to broaden
your creative horizons?

204
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,510
The client sends me messages every day,

205
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,710
I can show you.

206
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,910
The contract has already
been delivered to the company.

207
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,790
I've been holding off on signing it.

208
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,750
Why?

209
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,790
Because I didn't
want you to be too tired.

210
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,950
Now you have time,

211
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,430
you have to write something for them.

212
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,870
Keep it simple.

213
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,350
Just write a 10,000-word outline.

214
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,510
To reassure them.

215
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,300
Like this,

216
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I'll give you two days.

217
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,910
Two days?

218
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,820
How can you come up with it in two days?

219
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,510
Two days?

220
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,700
Two days are simply impossible.

221
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,750
How can you complete it in two days?

222
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,510
Then how many days do you want?

223
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,990
The key is not how many days.

224
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,990
The key is

225
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,750
I don't know

226
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,870
what they want.

227
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,030
You don't know what they want?

228
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,230
This is simple.

229
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,350
About this project,

230
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,750
they assigned us an editor.

231
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,630
Don't speak.

232
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,870
Miss Ting.

233
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,670
I need to tell you something.

234
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,550
Our screenwriting team
wants to communicate

235
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,310
with your managing editor

236
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,950
about the creative direction
of this project.

237
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,710
Let's find a time
that's convenient for both parties.

238
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,470
And arrange a meeting, okay?

239
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,710
Thank you. Thank you.

240
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,950
Problem solved.

241
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,070
Now, you won't keep saying
I won't let you meet the client.

242
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,310
It's a good opportunity.

243
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,790
Actions speak louder than words.

244
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,630
No, it's not suitable for me
to go and meet them.

245
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,790
I haven't met any clients before.

246
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,310
And I have no experience.

247
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,270
Tomorrow afternoon,

248
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,790
See. The response is quick.

249
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,510
Considering the current situation,

250
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,910
where can we find such a reliable client?

251
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,990
Have some cake.

252
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,150
No, brother.

253
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,150
You made the decision quickly.

254
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,390
All of a sudden...

255
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,550
This cake is so delicious.

256
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,510
Try a bite.

257
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,590
No, it's okay.

258
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,470
I need to digest.

259
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,990
What?

260
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,510
You want to share the apartment?

261
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,710
Yes.

262
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,430
The apartment there is quite big,

263
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,230
so I can rent out one room.

264
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,430
It wouldn't affect anything.

265
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,800
And the person can
help share the rent with me.

266
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,100
So what does the person
you share the apartment with do?

267
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,860
He's a screenwriter.

268
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,630
A screenwriter?

269
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,550
What about his social dynamics?

270
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,990
Is it complicated?

271
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,310
So far, I've only met two people

272
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,790
who helped him with renting the room.

273
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,430
His social dynamics are okay.

274
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,350
But the problem is he's a guy

275
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,750
and he works late at night

276
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,270
which affects my sleep a bit.

277
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,430
What?

278
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,630
It's a guy?

279
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,230
Are you in need of money right now?

280
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,230
That you have to find someone

281
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,790
to share the rent with you?

282
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,590
I don't need money.

283
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,590
But living alone
requires careful budgeting,

284
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,110
and my apartment is quite big.

285
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,510
So I feel a bit afraid of staying alone.

286
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,390
At first, I thought it would be a girl.

287
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,110
You should ask him to move out quickly.

288
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,350
First of all, a girl

289
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,030
sharing an apartment with a guy

290
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,390
is very inconvenient.

291
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,830
Secondly, didn't you decide
to create your own studio?

292
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,750
The environment is really important.

293
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,550
Yes, I've already talked to him.

294
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,950
He will move out

295
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,870
once he found a suitable place.

296
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,110
How about this?

297
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,830
You can move
into my old house and live there.

298
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,350
And use it as your studio.

299
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,550
Miss Wan.

300
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,270
I can take care of myself.

301
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,750
Don't worry about me.

302
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,710
If I move to your place,

303
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,590
I'll have to go back and forth between
two places every day.

304
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,710
It's quite troublesome.

305
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,550
Do you know
why I want to rent my current place?

306
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,150
My place is quite similar to your place.

307
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,190
If you have time next time,

308
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,070
you can go and take a look.

309
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,230
Alright.

310
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,510
Fine, for now.

311
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,270
I can't persuade you anymore.

312
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,670
Do as you please.

313
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,270
After spending so much money,

314
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,150
and so much time,

315
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,190
do you know how hard
it's to restore its original state?

316
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,630
Can you guys handle it or not?

317
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,350
If not, just get out of here!

318
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,600
(How to Lead a Team)

319
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,790
Take a break.

320
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,910
Oh my goodness.

321
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,910
I'm so exhausted.

322
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,950
Where should I put this?

323
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,430
For now, let's just put it there
and take a break.

324
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,590
Take a break.

325
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,270
Comfortable. Oh my.

326
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,310
The car is new.

327
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,070
The house is new.

328
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,230
Your ideals have been achieved.

329
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,630
Are you satisfied now?

330
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,110
This is just the beginning.

331
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,950
Didn't I say before?

332
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,230
This is just the beginning.

333
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,670
If we continue like this,

334
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,670
it won't just drive you crazy,

335
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,390
you will overwork Shanshan.

336
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,630
If you two are gone,

337
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,510
the unluckiest one will be me.

338
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,470
Can't we take it easy?

339
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,550
Take it easy?

340
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,710
How can we take it easy?

341
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,710
Look.

342
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,870
I calculated it.

343
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,670
At the pace we're going now,

344
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,630
we'll only make one film a year.

345
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,430
It is enough to
support our current living.

346
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,190
But what about the rest of the time?

347
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,400
We can go travel, have fun,

348
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,680
enjoy ourselves, and relax.

349
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,510
Relax?

350
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,510
But if we relax too much, we'll sink.

351
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,670
Yuan Yuan.

352
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,270
I have a few questions for you.

353
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,830
First,

354
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,990
what if our project fails?

355
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,310
Second,

356
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,310
what if next year, the rent increases?

357
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,510
Third,

358
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,630
what if the companies
we collaborate with go bankrupt?

359
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,710
What am I saying?

360
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,510
It's too ominous.

361
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,630
I've been in this industry
for so many years,

362
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,870
and I've never seen anyone

363
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,190
who stops when things are going well.

364
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,630
Everyone is striving hard,

365
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,350
trying to climb up.

366
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,390
It's either moving forward or falling back.

367
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,070
No progress means regression.

368
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,550
I just feel that

369
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,990
you two look tired.

370
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,550
Yes, we are a bit tired.

371
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,790
But I can't stop.

372
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,910
Because I'm not alone.

373
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,830
I have you and Shanshan.

374
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,480
If we only make one project a year,

375
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,400
I can't guarantee that it will succeed.

376
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,710
So,

377
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,670
not for a day,

378
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,390
not an hour,

379
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,870
not even a second,

380
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,020
I can't stop.

381
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,950
When will it end?

382
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,310
Are we going to live like this forever?

383
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,550
I can't see the end right now.

384
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,950
When I see it,

385
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,470
then only we can stop.

386
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,510
Yuan Yuan.

387
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,230
Are you willing to accompany me

388
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,030
and be with me?

389
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,990
Yes, I am.

390
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,230
Okay, where should we place the sofa?

391
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,710
Let's start.

392
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,790
Here, this is for you.

393
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,030
Thank you.

394
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,230
The coffee here is quite good.

395
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,230
Whenever you have free time,

396
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,590
you can come here often.

397
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,590
Isn't this your flash drive?

398
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,230
It's mine.

399
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,030
Do you need help?

400
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,630
It's okay, it's okay.

401
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,950
Alright.

402
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,270
Hello, I'm Qi Lianshan.

403
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,990
You can call me Qi.

404
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,550
Lian, or Shan.

405
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,470
If you like it,

406
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,990
you can also call me Shanshan.

407
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,790
Okay.

408
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,870
By the way, may I know your last name?

409
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,190
My last name is Bai,
and you can call me Bai.

410
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,630
Bai, huh?

411
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,750
Mr. Qi,

412
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,190
let's discuss about the script first.

413
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,830
Okay?

414
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,430
Okay, okay.

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,400
(Slam Dunk)

416
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,550
Brother.

417
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,710
When did you come back?

418
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,190
I came back today.

419
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,430
This trip wore me out.

420
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:17,870
Come on.

421
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,870
It's time to have a chat.

422
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,470
What do you want me to say?

423
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,550
You resigned.

424
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,950
And you started a studio.

425
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,150
Two big events in life,

426
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,030
and you didn't discuss one with me.

427
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,830
Well done.

428
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,550
Aren't you on a business trip?

429
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,670
You weren't here.

430
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,270
If I told you, you will be worried.

431
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,750
No, what did you think?

432
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,070
Come on, let me interview you.

433
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,440
Is Borman widely
recognized in your industry?

434
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,040
Yes.

435
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,430
Yang Youli.

436
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,590
He's been quite helpful to you too.

437
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,830
So why did you have to leave?

438
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,470
I can't just depend on others
for the rest of my life.

439
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,750
Xia, I'm telling you.

440
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,070
You're not a kid anymore.

441
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,910
You can't just act on impulse.

442
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,190
Brother,

443
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,990
Mr. Yang has been quite helpful to me.

444
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,720
But I have differences with him
in terms of work philosophy.

445
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,800
If things continue like this,
we'll eventually part ways.

446
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,880
So it's better...

447
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,800
I have one question for you.

448
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,350
Is there any chance
to change this situation?

449
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,110
You know me well.

450
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,680
I always think things through
before I do something.

451
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,960
You think things through, huh?

452
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,180
Alright, let me ask you now.

453
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,830
This studio you started,

454
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,190
it will be great if you have a business.

455
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,310
What if there's no business?

456
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,150
Have you thought about it?

457
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,680
Being a boss comes with costs, sister.

458
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,180
I'm telling you.

459
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,120
If you keep going like this,

460
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,080
the money you've saved all these years

461
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,800
will be gone in no time.

462
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,910
No.

463
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,870
I've come this far,

464
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,230
and you're saying this to me?

465
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,110
I know.

466
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,270
I know you're worried about me.

467
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,030
You're the only child?

468
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,870
An only child.

469
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,870
Alright, thank you.

470
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,350
It's fine. Please continue.

471
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,910
Mr. Qi.

472
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,480
What we want is actually quite simple.

473
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,220
We don't want to make those

474
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,920
overly brainless sweet romance dramas.

475
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,120
Because our leader comes from
a serious drama background.

476
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,780
He doesn't like those very cliché things.

477
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,400
So, do you think these

478
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,820
brainless sweet romance dramas
are cliché?

479
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,120
Quite.

480
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,790
Do you watch them regularly?

481
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,230
Or do you never watch them?

482
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,590
I occasionally watch them.

483
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,560
Then what kind of drama
do you usually like to watch?

484
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,680
Can you give an example?

485
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,280
I like...

486
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,270
It doesn't matter
what kind of dramas I like.

487
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,630
Let's talk about the script.

488
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,160
Yes, yes, of course.

489
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,440
(She isn't good
at dealing with awkward scene,)

490
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,760
(and is weak in seeking for solutions.)

491
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,470
What kind of drama

492
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,710
do you want us to write?

493
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,830
We want a drama

494
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,350
that is emotionally authentic.

495
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,830
With some realism.

496
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,830
Realism.

497
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,790
But not completely.

498
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,350
It should be realistic.

499
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,750
Have to be relatable.

500
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,350
Got it. Relatable.

501
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,030
Do you believe in feng shui?

502
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,830
Feng shui?

503
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,310
Feng shui.

504
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,630
Let's take me as an example.

505
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,550
I work in this field,
and it's a stable income.

506
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,310
I can pay my mortgage every month.

507
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,670
But it's just
enough for necessities.

508
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,510
If there's a wedding or funeral,

509
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,510
I have to avoid them.

510
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,270
You are self-employed now.

511
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,870
How can I not be worried?

512
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,240
I can take
responsibility for my decisions.

513
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,780
Don't worry about me.

514
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,680
Alright.

515
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,910
But what about you?

516
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,640
You're busy with
this and that every day.

517
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,120
What have you achieved?

518
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,640
You don't understand.

519
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,910
This is a society based
on personal connections.

520
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,110
I have to

521
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,550
move around more, right?

522
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,790
A society based on personal connections.

523
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,070
And what can you achieve

524
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,630
by moving around so much?

525
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,560
You even messed

526
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,640
- your program up completely.
- Stop, stop, stop.

527
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,110
I came to talk about your matters.

528
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,670
And now you're scolding me?

529
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,910
I am not scolding you,

530
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,030
I'm just concerned about you.

531
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,430
Alright, alright.

532
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,310
You're all outstanding,

533
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,830
except me, who's a disappointment.

534
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,710
Only you can worry about me,

535
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,030
but I can't worry about you?

536
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,470
Why, are you angry?

537
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,030
Alright then, you can
stay here and be angry.

538
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,190
I'm going upstairs.

539
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,270
Okay, okay, okay.

540
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,350
I can't afford to provoke you, okay?

541
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:32,790
I was wrong,

542
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,710
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

543
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,190
My attitude was bad just now, okay?

544
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,030
I'll remember what you said.

545
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,840
I'll take it to heart, okay?

546
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,720
Don't be angry anymore.

547
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,260
I'm telling you, Ranran is...

548
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,750
Stop.

549
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,030
Don't mention her.

550
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,670
If you mention her,
I'll leave immediately.

551
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,110
Alright, I won't mention it.

552
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,470
I just wanted to say
she really cares about you.

553
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,910
Okay, okay, forget it.

554
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,150
She cares about me?

555
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,150
Alright, alright.

556
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,440
I took it to heart,

557
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,400
I'll think it over carefully,
is that okay?

558
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,510
You don't have to
worry about me anymore,

559
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,950
just take care of yourself.

560
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,070
Since you started this business,
do it well.

561
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,910
I can't support you financially,

562
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,350
but I can definitely support
you physically and mentally.

563
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,910
Is that okay?

564
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,870
That's what you said, right?

565
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,630
Of course, it was me who said it.

566
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,270
If I have any physically
demanding tasks in the future,

567
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,150
I'll come to you first.

568
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,630
I'll handle everything, it's all on me.

569
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,310
Is that okay?

570
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,990
Reliable. Let me
treat you to this coffee.

571
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,390
Alright, let's do it.

572
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,310
Just this time, okay?

573
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,670
Next time, you'll have to
pay for yourself.

574
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,910
Got it, got it.

575
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,270
If there's nothing else,

576
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,630
I'll take my leave.

577
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,510
Let me escort you.

578
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,870
Why aren't you saying anything?

579
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,990
It's nothing.
I'm thinking about something.

580
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,230
So when you're thinking,

581
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,430
is it difficult to focus, right?

582
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,710
Is it difficult to focus when thinking?

583
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,630
It's not...

584
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,550
Is there a communication barrier?

585
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,510
It's difficult for you
to communicate with others.

586
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,550
It's difficult.

587
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,030
During communication, I feel a bit...

588
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,830
I feel that our communication
has some obstacles.

589
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,510
Are you going to the restroom?

590
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,230
Just go outside and turn right.

591
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,430
Turn left.

592
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,710
Hello, Miss Ting.

593
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,310
I'm not talking nonsense.

594
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,550
Well. Didn't Mr. Jia say he would

595
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,430
introduce us to a screenwriter
with extensive experience?

596
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,670
What's going on?

597
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,990
He has been asking
some utterly nonsensical questions.

598
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,550
I mean,

599
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,550
I really doubt if he...

600
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,310
I'm sorry.

601
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,430
has some serious illness.

602
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,470
I'm sorry, you go on.

603
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,920
I really think
that I have conveyed my meaning.

604
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,760
But he just can't communicate properly.

605
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,630
So do you think is it okay for us
to waste our time on him?

606
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,790
Aren't you usually
quite talkative with me?

607
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:42,790
Wait.

608
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,990
Brother, didn't you tell me
not to talk nonsense outside?

609
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,190
Talking too much leads to failure.

610
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,070
Moreover,

611
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,750
this is my first
time meeting the client.

612
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,030
I'm not familiar with them.

613
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,950
So, I kept asking her question.

614
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,750
I wrote a character background for her.

615
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,910
Based on these questions,

616
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,190
I think she should be someone...

617
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm not interested in that.

618
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,160
Come on.

619
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,260
I asked him to have
a meeting with the client.

620
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,040
He wrote a character background for her.

621
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,920
Is there something wrong with him?

622
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,110
No, brother. I'm used to it.

623
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,590
Although I haven't met many people,

624
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,910
whenever I meet a stranger,

625
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,600
I write a character background for them.

626
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,480
Sicko, sicko, sicko.

627
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,270
Not just that editor.

628
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,350
You and Yuan Yuan too.

629
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,350
Don't believe it?

630
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,710
I'll read it to you.

631
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,590
I have it backed up on my phone.

632
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,870
Look, brother.

633
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,470
Jia Zhen.

634
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,590
Dreams of becoming
a top screenwriter in China,

635
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,670
but is currently a 39th-tier writer...

636
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,880
This was written before.

637
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,680
Maybe you're like 19th-tier now.

638
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
The catchphrase.

639
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,120
A writer who can't act
isn't a good director.

640
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,280
He claims to be born for this industry.

641
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,040
Whenever he looks in the mirror,

642
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,440
he fantasizes about
standing on the podium,

643
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,760
delivering an acceptance speech.

644
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
Sounds similar.

645
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,960
Listen to this.

646
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,000
Others think he's
dedicated to his career.

647
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,720
But in reality,

648
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,480
he has an interesting private life.

649
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,920
He has a secret underground romance.

650
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,280
Always claiming he lacks...

651
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,960
Enough!

652
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,300
But, he's just...

653
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,720
Your phone sure has a lot of storage.

654
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,960
Delete it.

655
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,560
Nonsense!

656
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,560
But I think writing
this is quite useful.

657
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,120
It's because I wrote
this character sketch.

658
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
So I have a better
understanding of that editor.

659
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,280
Why don't you help me
set up another meeting with her?

660
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,520
This time I can
have a good talk with her.

661
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,840
You lost that chance.

662
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,840
You had a meeting.

663
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
But you messed it up!

664
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,120
I've texted her boss.

665
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,320
The day after tomorrow,

666
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
you must submit a complete outline.

667
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm notifying you.

668
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,960
I'm not discussing it with you, ok?

669
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
But I haven't planned my plot yet.

670
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,400
How...

671
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,120
Plan what?

672
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,080
Just write about your life.

673
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,240
Oh, your life is too boring?

674
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,360
You don't have any materials, do you?

675
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,120
Go study a film.

676
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,440
Copying always works.

677
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,240
Yuan Yuan, find him a film.

678
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,920
I'll find a place to relax.

679
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,960
This won't work.

680
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,320
Shanshan.

681
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,840
You have me.

682
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,840
For character's sketch?

683
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,500
Alright.

684
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
Read it to me.

685
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,200
We're already so familiar.

686
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,640
Do we still need to
do character sketches?

687
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,560
Yours is the same.

688
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Everyone thinks you're
devoted to your career,

689
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
but your private life is quite rich.

690
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,920
You have a secret underground romance.

691
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,520
I have something to do.

692
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,120
I have a romantic storyline too?

693
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,720
Why aren't you turning on the sound?

694
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,320
Aren't you planning to sleep?

695
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,960
I don't wanna disturb you.

696
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,040
What are you doing?

697
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,700
I'm studying films.

698
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Studying films?

699
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,500
It's about memorizing lines,

700
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,840
recalling scenes,
and getting into the mood.

701
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,080
You screenwriters
watch movies like this?

702
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,600
What's the fun in it?

703
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,400
It's not entirely like that.

704
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,120
It depends on the
situation and the film.

705
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,080
What film is this?

706
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
Why haven't I seen it?

707
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,080
Since you're not gonna sleep,

708
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,240
I'll turn on the sound.

709
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
Go ahead.

710
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,960
The fansub group
nowadays are less artistic.

711
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,680
Go back a bit.

712
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,960
Go back and re-watch.

713
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,700
Some of us are mediocre and shallow,

714
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,720
beautiful on the surface,

715
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,680
but empty inside.

716
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,760
However,

717
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,400
every once in a while,

718
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,220
you find someone who's iridescent.

719
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,740
And when you do,

720
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,260
nothing will ever compare.

721
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,920
You're amazing!

722
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,060
It's more artistic now, isn't it?

723
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,820
Yes, it is.

724
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,560
You can turn up the volume more.

725
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,780
I did.

726
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,880
Next time, you can turn up
the volume a bit more.

727
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,600
Don't worry about disturbing me.

728
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,840
Alright.

729
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,160
What's the name of this film?

730
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,120

Qi Lianshan.

752
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Qi Lianshan, it's time
to get up for dinner.

753
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,380
He's not in any trouble, is he?

754
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,080
Why isn't he up yet?

755
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,680
He's not in the toilet?

756
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't hear him there.

757
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,760
Is he moving out?

758
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,160
He did say he's found a place.

759
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,680
But he hasn't moved yet. It's soon.

760
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,600
Why are you talking about this?

761
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,580
I'm worried that
something happened to him.

762
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,000
That's what I meant.

763
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,120
He's a screenwriter.

764
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,700
What if he's gone off the deep end,

765
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,220
and used himself as material,

766
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,800
committing murder and dismemberment?

767
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,160
Wouldn't that be disastrous?

768
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,480
Don't scare me like that.

769
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,560
I'm not! I'm serious.

770
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,760
What if something really happened?

771
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,260
Qi Lianshan.

772
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,100
Wake up! Qi Lianshan.

773
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,160
Wake up.

774
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,160
Oh no, no sound.

775
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,720
See, I'm not scaring you.

776
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,720
An adult stays locked
in a room for so long,

777
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,640
with no sound at all.

778
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,040
Does that seem okay?

779
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,560
I'll go look for the spare key.

780
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,720
Qi Lianshan?

781
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,020
No sound at all!

782
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,120
Oh no!

783
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,960
I must be right. Something's wrong!

784
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,440
Screenwriter Qi!

785
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,120
Qi Lianshan!

786
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,760
It's open!

787
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,280
Where is he?

788
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,240
Right here.

789
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,120
Qi Lianshan!

790
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,200
Wake up! Qi Lianshan.

791
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,960
Look!

792
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,160
Did he take the pills?

793
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,760
I don't wanna live. Annoying.

794
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,400
He must be thinking of suicide.
What should we do?

795
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,480
Such a grown man,
why would he have such thoughts?

796
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,200
What should we do?

797
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,720
Why he chose to commit suicide?

798
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
- I can hear his heartbeat.
- I...

799
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,600
There's a heartbeat.

800
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,800
For real? I...

801
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,440
I'll call an ambulance!

802
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,640
You give him artificial respiration!

803
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,280
How do I do that?

804
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,080
Mouth to mouth!

805
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,840
Mouth to mouth?

806
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,000
One, two, three, four.

807
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,430
Are you okay?

808
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,160
Hello, sir.

809
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,960
Hello.

810
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,900
Is Liu Xia here?

811
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,040
Owner of the newly opened
psychological counseling studio.

812
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,800
Come in.

813
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,880
I'm Fu Lai.

814
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,800
Her landlord.

815
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,340
Her studio is just upstairs.

816
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,440
Come.

817
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,640
Second floor and turn right.

818
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,840
Thank you.

819
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
Long legs, long eyelashes.

820
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,920
Mr. Yang.

821
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Why are you here?

822
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,540
Shouldn't you invite me in?

823
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,360
Please.

824
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,780
This is my new studio.

825
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,320
Not bad.

826
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,640
What's this?

827
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,300
Aren't you curious about
what I brought for you?

828
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,120
I saw you at the furniture store
watching something for a long time.

829
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Slaip's lamp.

830
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,720
No, no. Mr. Yang.

831
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,120
This is too valuable.

832
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,840
I don't need anything here.

833
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,960
You don't have to be so polite.

834
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,800
I have a patient coming later.

835
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,380
How about I treat
you to a meal next time?

836
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,960
It's ok. I'll wait for you downstairs.

837
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,340
Just now when I came up,

838
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,300
I saw there's a bookstore downstairs.

839
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,420
It seems quite nice.

840
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,940
But I don't know how long I'll be busy.

841
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,640
Xia.

842
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,860
Miss Liu.

843
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,600
I made an appointment at half past ten.

844
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I came a little early.

845
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,480
I hope I didn't disturb you.

846
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,560
- No.
- No, no, it's fine.

847
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,880
I was just about to go downstairs.

848
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,440
Miss Liu, you go ahead.

849
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,240
I'll wait for you downstairs.

850
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,020
Mr. Zhao, right?

851
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,380
Come, this way, please.

852
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,160
Xia.

853
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,200
Mr. Zhao, this way.

854
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,940
(Screams and cheers.
The basketball hits the ground.)

855
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,200
Hey, Yuan Yuan.

856
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,640
(Shanshan, how are you doing?)

857
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,320
I'm a bit overwhelmed.

858
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,840
I feel like my heart
is about to jump out.

859
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,960
Did you drink too much coffee again?

860
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,040
Wait for me.

861
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,960
I'll come over now.

862
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:10,840
Don't worry.

863
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,280
Just a bit.

864
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,000
Just a little bit longer,
and I'll almost finish writing.

865
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,180
Shanshan, listen.

866
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,480
It doesn't matter.

867
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,640
Take care of your body.

868
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,040
And drink less coffee.

869
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,520
Alright, bye.

870
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,840
Sir.

871
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
Is Miss Liu not at home?

872
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
She's busy now.

873
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,960
I'm waiting for her here.

874
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,880
What would you like to drink?

875
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,280
Americano, please.

876
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,880
Iced?

877
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,560
Hot, please.

878
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,920
Sure.

879
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,940
(Family tree)

880
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,520
Miss Liu, stop writing.

881
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,000
Hurry up and tell me
the actual situation.

882
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,800
Mr. Zhao.

883
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,540
I believe psychological counseling
can only be used as an auxiliary method.

884
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,840
I suggest you go to
a specialized psychiatric hospital

885
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,400
or see a doctor at
a hospital's psychiatric department.

886
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,640
Why are you telling me this now?

887
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,160
I came to you for treatment.

888
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,240
This is a counseling studio.

889
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,680
I can only provide
psychological counseling.

890
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,040
But what you need now
is to go to a hospital,

891
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,180
and let the doctor
develop a treatment plan for you.

892
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,060
Doctor?

893
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
When you charged me, you didn't say that!

894
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,300
Didn't you claim to be
the best counselor in Su City?

895
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,160
Mr. Zhao.

896
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
You still don't understand what I said.

897
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,400
What you need now is a combination
of medication and instrument therapy,

898
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,600
to alleviate your symptoms.

899
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,360
Do I need medication?

900
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,720
Just based on these forms,

901
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,720
sand trays,

902
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,200
and your scribbles on the whiteboard.

903
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,480
You say I'm sick.

904
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,560
I need medication.

905
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,360
Mr. Zhao, calm down.

906
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,440
Do you know what
mental illness could mean?

907
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,700
I could lose my job.

908
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,260
What about my family?

909
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,100
Have you ever considered that?

910
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,120
I suggest you go to a
psychiatric hospital to see a doctor.

911
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,420
What you're saying is irresponsible!

912
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,180
As a psychological counselor,

913
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,200
you should take
responsibility for your words.

914
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I came to you because I trusted you.

915
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,280
But you're sending me to the hospital!

916
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,720
You've disappointed me greatly!

917
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,120
The best solution for you
now is to go to the hospital,

918
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,320
and cooperate with
the doctor's treatment.

919
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,120
Impossible!

920
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,880
I won't go to the hospital.

921
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,840
Mr. Zhao.

922
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,520
Mr. Zhao.

923
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,920
Mr. Zhao.

924
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,720
- Liu Xia.
- Mr. Zhao.

925
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,360
Liu Xia.

926
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,400
I can't hold it in anymore.

927
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,200
Here for counseling?

928
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,560
Don't touch things here
or throw things around.

929
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,600
Otherwise, even if I'm sleeping,

930
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,040
Liu Xia can still wake me up.

931
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,640
And I won't be able to explain.

932
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,740
Don't touch anything.

933
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,400
No way.

934
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,740
No way!

935
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,420
I'm doomed.
