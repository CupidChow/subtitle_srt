I'm coming down.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,280
I just arrived.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,320
Hello, hello.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,760
Jin Ran.

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,720
Hello, hello.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
I'm here to see the house.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,760
The house is upstairs.

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,440
Now the first floor is a café.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,280
Quite comfortable.

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,960
Let me take you upstairs.

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,080
Okay.

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,720
I have something urgent.

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,400
I'll take a call.

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,480
You go up and have a look first.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
I'll be there in a moment.

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:03,960
Okay, okay.

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,560
Sorry, sorry.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,080
It's okay, no problem.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,320
Mr. Wu.

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,920
Shanshan, what are you doing?

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,720
Why aren't you here yet?

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm already inside.

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520
Come to the second floor of the café,

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,880
then turn to the right side.

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,720
Not giving it to him again?

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
Every year it's the newcomers.

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,840
What about him?

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,720
No, Chao hasn't arrived.

55
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,680
Why are you rushing me?

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,400
Giving opportunities for what?

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,480
Giving...

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,040
You, go ahead.

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,480
What are you looking at?

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,880
It's nothing, it's nothing.

61
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,480
Looks pretty good.

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,840
I didn't mean you.

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
Someone bumped into me.

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
It's only after
I carefully read the rental information

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
that I realized it's a shared rental.

67
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,440
This time it's my carelessness, okay?

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,480
Don't be mad at me.

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm not mad.

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,000
I just don't like shared rentals.

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,960
But...

72
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
Isn't the environment nice here?

73
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,200
And look,

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,520
your room and this room

75
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,880
are quite far apart.

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
There are many
houses with nice environments.

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,480
Right, Yuan Yuan?

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,600
Let's keep looking.

79
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,560
I don't agree with shared rentals.

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,320
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

81
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,800
Bro, why did you come?

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,560
You're renting this place,

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,360
and I'm here to give you advice.

84
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Let's not advise on this.

85
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,480
Go somewhere else.

86
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,560
What's wrong with this one?

87
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,440
This is a shared rental,
and he doesn't want it.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,040
Come here.

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
This house is so nice.

90
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,720
Why doesn't he want it?

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
How much is it?

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,120
The rent for the whole place
is 15,000 yuan.

93
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,560
There are two rooms in total.

94
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,600
His room faces south,

95
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,680
and it's only 4,000 yuan.

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,840
Only 4,000 yuan?

97
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,840
That's very affordable.

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,080
Right?

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,880
But he doesn't agree,

100
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,800
and I can't do anything about it.

101
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,600
Come here, come here.

102
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
You go talk to the landlord.

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll talk to him. Hurry up.

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,360
Not happy?

105
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,840
No, I'm not unhappy.

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,040
Not unhappy yet your face
is full of unwillingness?

107
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,040
Bro,

108
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
you know me well.

109
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,240
When I'm writing,

110
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,840
I dislike being disturbed the most.

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,880
And my schedule is very irregular.

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm not used
to someone walking around outside.

113
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
It's weird.

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,720
Nonsense.

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,720
When you were at my place,

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,640
I was also walking around outside.

117
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,880
You didn't feel weird, did you?

118
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,710
You are you,

119
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,520
that person is a stranger.

120
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,400
Be more objective and tell me,

121
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,360
what do you think
of the environment in this house?

122
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,360
Objectively, both the inside and outside

123
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,840
are quite good in terms of the environment.

124
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,720
I know, right?

125
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,880
I also think the environment is great.

126
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,000
Let me tell you, it's just a place
for writing and sleeping.

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
Once you put on your
headphones and close the door,

128
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,520
no one can disturb you.

129
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,640
When I first started in this industry,

130
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,960
I lived in a basement.

131
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,640
There were all kinds of noises
that affected my writing.

132
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,440
This compared to what I had
is so much better.

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
No, this...

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,080
I understand what you mean.

135
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,320
No, you don't understand.

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,880
I do.

137
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,200
You just want a place

138
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,840
where you can be by yourself, right?

139
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,600
Then you have to work even harder.

140
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Alright?

141
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,480
Bro,

142
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
I think the best solution right now

143
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,320
is to go sleep in the studio.

144
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,040
That's not feasible.

145
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,840
If you sleep there,
where do I sleep then?

146
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,880
And my place is so small.

147
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,640
If you come along,
it'll be two guys living there.

148
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,960
That's inconvenient.

149
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,080
You can't always stay in a hotel either.

150
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,720
A hotel is also an option,
as long as not here.

151
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,100
But you'll have
to spend money on a hotel.

152
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,460
Well...

153
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,140
Money is not
the biggest problem, of course.

154
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,100
But as a screenwriter like you,
you can't always live in a hotel.

155
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,980
That's not feasible.

156
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,500
So if you...

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,080
Come on.

158
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,440
Get up, come on.

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,520
Tell me, which room you're staying in?

160
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,760
-That one, right?
-Yes.

161
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,520
Come on.

162
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,600
Go inside that room properly,
experience it, alright?

163
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,960
I think this place is really nice.

164
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
Look at the high shelves,

165
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
it gives such a creative atmosphere.

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Yuan Yuan and I are going to

167
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
negotiate with the landlord.

168
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,440
If they insist on sharing the place,

169
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,960
and you still refuse,

170
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,440
well, it's no big deal.

171
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,280
We'll find another place for you. Alright?

172
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,660
But you have to promise me
to experience it properly.

173
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,840
Listen, observe, and feel it.

174
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,360
Go on.

175
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Don't stand here.
Hurry inside and take a look.

176
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,440
Hurry.

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
What a nice house, look!

178
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,240
Nice house.

179
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:02,720
Go on!

180
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,840
What's there to see?

181
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,920
What listen, observe, and feel.

182
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,760
What's now?

183
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,200
Are we writing a story about a bedroom?

184
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,160
What's this?

185
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,000
You're back.

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
You got so many things.

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,320
Yeah, got some fruit.

188
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,960
Are you tired?

189
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Not tired.

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,520
Where's our son?

191
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
Qi Lianshan!

192
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,000
Daddy's back.

193
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,760
Son!

194
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,360
Daddy!

195
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,200
Come here.

196
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,640
Let me ask you.

197
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,880
Do you listen to Mommy at home?

198
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,800
Do you? Do you?

199
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,640
Guess what Daddy bought for you?

200
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
I don't know, a water gun?

201
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
- A water gun!
- A water gun!

202
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
Do you like it? Come here.

203
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,800
(Shanshan.)

204
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
(Today is Mommy's birthday.)

205
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,280
(Did you ask
what's Mommy's birthday wish?)

206
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,320
(Mommy said)

207
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,400
(she wants a home with a terrace)

208
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,560
(filled with all kinds of flowers.)

209
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
No sugar added.

210
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
Be careful, it's hot.

211
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
What's going on?

212
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,640
I just asked.

213
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,800
She's a sub-landlord.

214
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,080
She's looking for
someone to share the rent.

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,440
I think...

216
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,600
Let's forget about it.

217
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,920
There are plenty of houses.

218
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,880
I'll find another one.

219
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
There are plenty of houses.

220
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
But time is running out.

221
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,360
The client keeps urging me every day.

222
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,680
How about this?

223
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,600
He can come to my place
and stay for a few days.

224
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
I'll go to your place and handle it.

225
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
He's uncertain,
and his mind is unsettled.

226
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,560
How can he work properly?

227
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,920
Look at him now.

228
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,120
Not even a stable place to live.

229
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,080
Can his writing be any good?

230
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,760
It would be a mess.

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
What can we do?

232
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,360
The room is for sublet only.

233
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,750
And Shanshan doesn't want that.

234
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,440
How about you
endure a little more hardship?

235
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Come on.

236
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,240
You don't need to explain to me.

237
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,680
From last night until now,
how many words has he written?

238
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,800
If work gets delayed,
and the project fails,

239
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,560
how can I pay you salaries?

240
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,400
Yuan Yuan.

241
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,320
Didn't I tell you from the beginning

242
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,600
to prioritize important things?

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,720
Now the client is urging for the script.

244
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
How should I respond to that message?

245
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,800
Teach me. How should I reply?

246
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
Didn't I tell you before?

247
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,320
As screenwriters, we need
a conducive creative atmosphere.

248
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
I asked you to
pay more attention to Shanshan

249
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,400
no matter how small the matter.

250
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,480
You never take my words to heart.

251
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,360
What's wrong with you?

252
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,040
Stop it.

253
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
This isn't Yuan Yuan's fault.

254
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
I've already made up my mind.

255
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,520
I'll live here.

256
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
No, no, Shanshan.

257
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,960
No.

258
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
You're not used to living with others.

259
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,080
No, don't force yourself.

260
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,160
It's okay, it's decided then.

261
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,160
Shanshan.

262
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,280
Have you thought it through?

263
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,200
I've thought it through.

264
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,200
Are you sure?

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
I told you, Yuan Yuan.

266
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,880
It's all your fault!

267
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
You messed up this whole thing!

268
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,400
Shanshan clearly doesn't want
to live with others,

269
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,080
but now, just for the sake

270
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,400
of making things easier for us,

271
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,720
he has to live with someone else.

272
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,440
He's forcing himself!

273
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,840
Whatever he produces
is going to be awkward.

274
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,760
Do you know?

275
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Let's stop acting. Let's stop.

276
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,080
He's...

277
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,840
If his work ends up bad,

278
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,600
how am I supposed to submit it later?

279
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,600
It's all your fault!

280
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
He is gone.

281
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,520
Let's stop.

282
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
When we act, we should act properly.

283
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,640
You don't understand.

284
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,160
He knows.

285
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,920
Does he?

286
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,880
Using a borrowed knife to kill someone...

287
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,560
I hope he understands
my sincere intentions.

288
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,680
I spoke from my heart just now.

289
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
Help tidy up his things.

290
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Hurry and move them over here.

291
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,920
Come over tonight.

292
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,720
I'll treat him to a meal.

293
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,960
Alright.

294
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
Shanshan.

295
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,760
Shanshan.

296
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,320
(Homonym of "to act for real")

297
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,280
What are you doing, Zhang Shun?

298
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,520
Liu Xia.

299
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,040
Why didn't you tell me
that you resigned?

300
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,220
Were you purposely avoiding me?

301
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,080
What does it have to do with you?

302
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
I am your creditor!

303
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Until you repay me,

304
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,840
I have the right
to know your whereabouts!

305
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,360
I transfer your money to you every month.

306
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,320
You don't have to
worry about anything else.

307
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,720
Stop talking nonsense with me.

308
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,280
Wait.

309
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,800
What are you doing?

310
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,480
This is it?

311
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,200
I already gave you
money for this month.

312
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,680
What exactly do you want?

313
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,560
Did you see this?

314
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
I lost a bet.

315
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,120
I'm being chased for money.

316
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,800
Give me your phone.

317
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,680
Transfer 10 thousand to me right now.

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,400
Hurry up!

319
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,800
I'll transfer it, alright?

320
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,680
What are you doing?

321
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,200
Let go of me!

322
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,640
Hey!

323
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,800
What are you doing?

324
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
Are you okay?

325
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm fine.

326
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
I know you.

327
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,760
Aren't you the one
who saved someone on the rooftop?

328
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
You're amazing!

329
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Was he bothering you?

330
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,680
I'll call the police for you.

331
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,360
I can't stand people like him.

332
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,960
No, don't.

333
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,280
Don't meddle in my affairs.

334
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Thank you.

335
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,520
Oh, well.

336
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
It's not always that I gather the courage

337
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,640
to be a hero and save a damsel,

338
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,880
but I don't even get a chance.

339
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,200
Oh my, there's so much stuff.

340
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,800
What is all this?

341
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,520
It's so late.

342
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's do it another day.

343
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,560
Moving sucks.

344
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,560
I'm home.

345
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,800
Bro.

346
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,960
Xia.

347
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,880
You have rented the
house for your studio?

348
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,600
I've already moved in.

349
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
You've already moved in?

350
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,960
Did you finish sorting?

351
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,200
I moved in first.
And then I did the sorting.

352
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,680
Xia. I realized something about you.

353
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
You always report
good news but not bad news.

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
Don't always
carry everything by yourself.

355
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,960
Okay?

356
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,280
Don't worry.

357
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:56,960
By the way,

358
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,560
I'll come back in a couple of days.

359
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,200
Whatever difficult
tasks you have, leave them to me.

360
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,100
I can do it for you.

361
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,120
You should rest early.
I can do it for you.

362
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,690
You should rest early.

363
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,360
Okay.

364
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,520
You should also rest early.

365
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,320
Then I'll hang up. Goodbye.

366
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,480
Goodbye.

367
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
How do we move this body?

368
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,840
It's heavier than the body
of the little boy from before.

369
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,700
Should I dismember it?

370
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
After dismembering it,

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,480
I can throw the pieces
into different trash bins.

372
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,520
That way, the police won't know
the exact location of the crime.

373
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,640
This is great!

374
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,440
Okay, shall I use an axe or saw?

375
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
A saw would be suitable.

376
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,960
Yes, a saw, a saw.

377
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
I have a kitchen knife at home.

378
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,040
A kitchen knife could work too.

379
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,880
Let's try the kitchen knife at home.

380
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,960
Just wait.

381
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,880
This could work.

382
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,520
But when I dismember it,

383
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,000
there will be blood everywhere.

384
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
I'll have to clean it up.

385
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,720
If the police come
to check the water meter,

386
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,080
they'll discover our flaw.

387
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,100
This won't work.

388
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,680
How about using drugs
to make them unconscious?

389
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
It's you!

390
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
I already called the police.

391
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,800
It's a misunderstanding.

392
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,680
Look!

393
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,600
It's all just a misunderstanding, right?

394
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
It's our fault.

395
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,440
We should have
informed both of you in advance.

396
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,320
I don't care whether
this is a misunderstanding or not.

397
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,840
It was the three
of us who discussed this.

398
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,720
I thought Miss Yuan would be moving in,

399
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,320
but you didn't
communicate with us in advance.

400
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,600
As soon as we arrived, Mr. Qi moved in.

401
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,640
Do you think that's appropriate?

402
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
And you should also understand

403
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,120
that as single women,

404
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,160
we can't accept cohabitation with a man.

405
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,120
Now, we plan that
we can refund you the money,

406
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,600
and you should find a new place quickly.

407
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,560
No need, no need.

408
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,000
Why would you return the rent to me?

409
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,520
We've already paid for it.

410
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,120
The contract has been signed,

411
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,400
and we've already moved in.

412
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,800
It's not easy to find a place to live.

413
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,920
Let's try to understand each other.

414
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,000
He has finally settled down here
to write his work.

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,960
He needs to work.

416
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,840
If you make him move out now,

417
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,920
what will happen to his work?

418
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,240
He doesn't sleep at night.

419
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,800
Do you know what it means to not sleep?

420
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Late at night,

421
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,600
he's in the room talking to himself.

422
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
He even comes out to the living room

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,160
talking about killing and dismemberment

424
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
like a murderer,

425
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,640
which scared my friend

426
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,000
and she couldn't sleep all night.

427
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,120
He has work.

428
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,080
What about her?

429
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,800
What about my friend?

430
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,040
What will happen to her work?

431
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,840
She's not willing.

432
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,160
I won't rent it anymore.

433
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
No, no, no.

434
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,520
Uh, well,

435
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,240
You still have a deadline to meet.

436
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,120
Just endure a little longer.

437
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,040
I can't endure it.

438
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Please, bro!

439
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,760
Just think about Jia Zhen.

440
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,080
He is working so hard.

441
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,400
If you miss the deadline by a day,

442
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
your brother will be scolded for a day.

443
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,160
It's my brother again?

444
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,280
Come on.

445
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,200
Well, well, you write first.

446
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
I won't disturb you anymore.

447
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,520
I said I won't rent it.

448
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,720
Look!

449
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,040
This is causing so much trouble.

450
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,920
You don't need to argue so loudly.

451
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,460
He's a screenwriter, right?

452
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,080
When a screenwriter writes,
he needs to immerse himself in it.

453
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,000
That's called immersive creation.

454
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
If you guys find his voice too loud,

455
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,160
I'll tell him to lower his voice.

456
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,920
If he doesn't come out and walk around,

457
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,680
it should be all good right?

458
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,320
There's no need to terminate the lease.

459
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,520
- And besides...
- It's definitely impossible!

460
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,340
- Lower your voice.
- I won't talk to you anymore.

461
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,400
I won't talk to you, okay?

462
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,920
Miss Liu.

463
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,680
Can you say something?

464
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,720
You're the landlord, right?

465
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,320
And you, are you a psychologist?

466
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,600
A screenwriter is immersed
in creative writing.

467
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,720
This is immersive writing.

468
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,800
You can understand that, right?

469
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,560
Isn't that right?

470
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,280
I understand,

471
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,160
but I'm sorry.

472
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
I still hope he can move out today.

473
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,200
After all this talk,
you still insist on this?

474
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,040
The contract has been signed,

475
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,680
and he has already moved in.

476
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,520
- Where do you expect him to move now?
- You cant...

477
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:14,880
Stop arguing.

478
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,320
You can't

479
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,560
- just make us understand, right?
- Stop arguing.

480
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,840
Who can go without sleep?

481
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,360
Come, come, come.

482
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,120
You tell her.

483
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,920
I really can't argue with this person.

484
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,240
Come, come.

485
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
What's with this person's attitude?

486
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,880
No, no.

487
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,200
It's like this.

488
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,720
I just re-read our contract.

489
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,540
And on it,

490
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,820
it's written clearly

491
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,820
that during the lease term,

492
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,520
if either party violates the contract,

493
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,320
they will have
to pay liquidated damages.

494
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,780
Although these damages are not much,

495
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,000
it's still not good.

496
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,320
There's also another clause,

497
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,560
that if a dispute
arises between the parties,

498
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,740
either party has the right to go to

499
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,020
the Su City People's Court
to file a lawsuit.

500
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,560
Once a lawsuit starts,

501
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,180
it won't be resolved in a day or two.

502
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,380
You see,

503
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,680
you still have work to do,

504
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,880
and we're all busy too.

505
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,440
(Tenancy Agreement)
This will go on and on.

506
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,860
Isn't that right?

507
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,260
Mr. Jia.

508
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,160
Let me take a look at the contract.

509
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
This lawsuit,

510
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,840
will be at least half a year, right?

511
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm also a woman,

512
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,960
so I can understand very well that

513
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,040
both of you don't want to share
the apartment with the opposite sex.

514
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,800
Then...

515
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,720
What do you think about this?

516
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,760
Let our screenwriter

517
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,040
stay here for now.

518
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,880
I'll go find a house
as soon as possible.

519
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,200
And once I find one,

520
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,560
we'll move out immediately

521
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,360
without affecting
your search for new tenants.

522
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,880
How about this?

523
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,360
I have a condition.

524
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,200
From 9 am to 6 pm,

525
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,240
this living room
will be my private space.

526
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,640
I need to work here.

527
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,720
Don't worry,

528
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,080
there won't be any problems.

529
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,120
Our screenwriter

530
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,800
never gets up during the day.

531
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,320
Alright, then.

532
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,520
In that case,

533
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,600
I need a copy of
all three of your ID cards.

534
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,860
It's best if we have no problems.

535
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
But if any issues arise,
we can hold someone accountable.

536
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,360
What do you want?

537
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,080
Our ID cards?

538
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,640
For all three of us?

539
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,360
Do you want my
company's business license too?

540
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,800
Sure, if you want to
make copies of them too.

541
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,820
You can make copies of your
marriage and divorce certificates,

542
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,540
and even birth certificates too.

543
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm not married.

544
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What's this?

545
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,440
What does he mean by this?

546
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
- No, it's not...
- Did he scoff at me?

547
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,160
No, no, no.

548
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,960
- We all agreed that...
- More like you're scoffing at me.

549
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,320
Shanshan,

550
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,320
here's some fruit for you.

551
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,840
Sorry, Miss Jin.

552
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
(Tenancy Agreement)

553
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,840
Run him over!

554
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,360
Why is it you?

555
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,640
How could it be her?

556
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,000
Qi Lianshan!

557
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,880
You've really gone crazy!

558
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,400
Qi Lianshan!

559
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,440
Cheer up!

560
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,360
Cheer up!

561
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,640
There's no one else.

562
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,080
Let's leave it as it is for now.

563
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,960
Ouch, it hurts, it hurts.

564
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,040
Ouch, it hurts, it hurts.

565
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,360
Can you please be quieter?

566
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,960
Female lead.

567
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,480
Appears for only one second.

568
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,520
Not one second.

569
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,280
It's longer than one second.

570
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,560
Alright.

571
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,160
Let me ask you.

572
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,000
When the bag on her head

573
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,520
is finally taken off

574
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,120
and her face is revealed,

575
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,120
why do you put it back on her?

576
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,400
Bro,

577
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,360
there's scientific evidence for this.

578
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,480
Alright, come on.

579
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,800
What scientific evidence
are you talking about?

580
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,400
When a person's eyes

581
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,480
are in the darkness for a long time,

582
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
the pupils will dilate.

583
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,360
And when you suddenly
see this bright light,

584
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,120
the pupils won't have time to contract.

585
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,960
This intense light

586
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
will cause the retina to be irritated,

587
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,760
resulting in eye burns.

588
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,040
Where did you learn all these from?

589
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,080
Just from

590
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,160
searching online.

591
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,400
What do you think?

592
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,560
Why are you still a bit doubtful?

593
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,200
I really can't believe you.

594
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,720
I asked you to immerse yourself
in the characters

595
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,640
to help you with the script,

596
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
but now you tell me you can't write.

597
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,360
Just go onto the streets,

598
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
there are so many women.

599
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,480
Just imagine yourself
as one of them, okay?

600
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,560
This one would work.

601
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,240
What are you looking at?

602
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,080
What are you looking for?

603
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,360
No, no.

604
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm thinking this house

605
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,280
looks really good, doesn't it?

606
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,960
Yup.

607
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,880
Sure.

608
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,240
What a house.

609
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,960
Looks great over there, darling.

610
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,240
Let's go over there for photos.

611
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,600
Forget it, forget it.

612
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,680
(Borman Counseling Center)

613
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,680
Mr. Yang, Miss Liu.

614
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,000
You finally came back.

615
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
A female guest just arrived,

616
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
saying she had made an appointment

617
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,040
and insisted to wait here.

618
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,000
I have no choice

619
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,640
but to let her go to your office.

620
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:53,980
What's her last name?

621
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,800
Her last name is Jiang. Ms. Jiang.

622
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,480
No problem, I know her.

623
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,640
You get ready.

624
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,320
I'll go up.

625
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,800
Okay.

626
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,800
Miss Liu.

627
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,440
She seems to be a female boss.

628
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,360
Looks like the kind

629
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,400
that's particularly
difficult to deal with.

630
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,480
Just be careful, okay?

631
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,080
Thanks.

632
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,640
Ms. Jiang.

633
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,200
Could you wait a little longer?

634
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,360
The consultant will be here soon.

635
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,640
Mr. Yang.

636
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,240
Ms. Jiang.

637
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,600
Liu Xia.

638
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
This is the one I just told you about,

639
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,200
the most capable
consultant in our business.

640
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,920
She just gave a
speech at Su City University.

641
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,960
She is excellent.

642
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,000
So young.

643
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,600
Is she married?

644
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,840
Are you sure she can handle my problem?

645
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,640
Hello, I'm Liu Xia.

646
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,120
Please have a seat.

647
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,680
Have you seen enough?

648
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,600
I came here

649
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,440
not to be an animal show.

650
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,240
If you have this kind of attitude,

651
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
how can I trust

652
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,240
the professional competence of Borman?

653
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,840
Ms. Jiang.

654
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
Allow me to give you an introduction.

655
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,600
This person

656
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
is our gold medal consultant at Borman.

657
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,200
Gold, silver, it doesn't matter.

658
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
Whether she can solve my problem or not,

659
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,000
I can tell at a glance.

660
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,440
Alright.

661
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,360
Consider it a trip wasted.

662
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,640
Borman looks impressive

663
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,000
but lacks real worth.

664
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,360
Ms. Jiang.

665
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,160
How long have you
been suffering from insomnia?

666
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,880
I noticed you

667
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,200
moving your shoulders and
neck several times.

668
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
You must have shoulder muscle soreness

669
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,880
which may be caused by insomnia.

670
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,520
Also,

671
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,720
you came to Borman

672
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,280
because you want to find
a psychological consultant

673
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,400
to help you solve your problems.

674
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,880
Since you're already here,

675
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,720
and have been waiting
for Mr. Yang and me for so long.

676
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Why don't you sit down

677
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,120
and have a proper conversation?

678
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Otherwise, your wait here
would be in vain.

679
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,440
Liu Xia.

680
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,760
I don't have time today.

681
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,480
Ms. Jiang.

682
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,480
Ms. Jiang.

683
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,600
You've handled
those difficult clients before.

684
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,760
Why didn't you
put in more effort for Ms. Jiang?

685
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,900
Ms. Jiang's guard is strong.

686
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,160
The more anxious you are,

687
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,600
the harder it is to gain her trust.

688
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,080
You're right.

689
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,320
Hello?

690
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,680
Hello, Mr. Jia.

691
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,160
I saw online that you want to buy a car.

692
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,800
How about

693
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
coming to our store to take a look?

694
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,960
You got the wrong number.

695
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,120
Hello?

696
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,120
What was that about?

697
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,840
Hello? Who is it again?

698
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,280
Hello, Mr. Jia. How are you?

699
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,000
We have the latest model of the SUV.

700
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,080
Would you like to come to our store

701
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,320
and experience a test drive?

702
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,840
No!

703
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,080
Wrong number.

704
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
Mr. Jia.

705
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,800
(Human Weakness)

706
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,840
How is this car?

707
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,760
You've been looking at it for two days.

708
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,880
Are you really going to get a new car?

709
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,280
Yes, why not?

710
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,880
Look.

711
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,440
It's around one million.

712
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,760
Don't worry.

713
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,160
This brand
has a partnership with the bank.

714
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,520
The down payment is
about 400-500 thousand.

715
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,800
And there's zero
interest for monthly installments.

716
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
The monthly installment is
about less than 30 thousand RMB.

717
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,920
Just grit your teeth,
and the car is yours.

718
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,660
(Qi Lianshan)

719
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,920
These car sales and service stores

720
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,360
keep calling me, calling me Mr. Jia.

721
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,760
Whenever I take a nap,
I get a phone call.

722
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,360
As soon as I fall asleep
a phone call comes in again.

723
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,640
It's you, isn't it?

724
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,680
I know what's going on now.

725
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,160
When I have free time in the studio,

726
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,800
I often check out the news
and the advertisements.

727
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,680
(I usually click on them.)

728
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,080
(I'm interested in those cars.)

729
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,000
(Whenever I see these cars,)

730
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,200
(I'll definitely click in.)

731
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
(And,)

732
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,120
I used your personal information

733
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,920
to log into the shopping apps.

734
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,840
I guess these two apps

735
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,560
are developed by the same developer.

736
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,960
The information is linked.

737
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,160
Hey man, you can't put my phone number

738
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,600
in the shopping app.

739
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,520
I'm often not in the studio.

740
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,120
Sometimes, when a delivery person comes,

741
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,440
they need to find someone, right?

742
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,840
So they can call your number.

743
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,600
Change it now.

744
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,720
If you don't change it, I can't sleep.

745
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,760
They were bothering you?

746
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,200
Okay, okay,

747
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,120
I got it, Shanshan.

748
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,560
So,

749
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,360
I'll change your number to my own number.

750
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,640
Shanshan,

751
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,960
you sound a bit tired.

752
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,530
Did you not rest well?

753
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,730
Listen to me.

754
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,190
Don't do anything now.

755
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,150
Go take a nap.

756
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,070
Get some shuteye.

757
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,920
Then, when you wake up, continue.

758
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,680
Okay?

759
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,120
Okay.

760
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,080
If you don't call me,

761
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,240
I'll be able to get a good sleep.

762
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,080
Okay, goodbye.

763
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,360
If you want to
get a new car, just do it.

764
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,160
Why didn't you tell him?

765
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,640
It's not like that.

766
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,200
It's just that
there are two aspects to consider.

767
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,080
On one hand,

768
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,480
if I tell Shanshan now

769
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,760
that I want to buy a car,

770
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,640
this brother of mine,

771
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,920
he'll definitely give me advice

772
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,790
on which brand to buy,

773
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,870
and which one
has better cost performance.

774
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,200
And that would affect his work.

775
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,640
On the other hand,

776
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,280
people's hearts can't bear scrutiny.

777
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,350
It would affect his state of mind.

778
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,280
Do you know it would

779
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,000
affect his state of mind?

780
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,760
Yuan Yuan.

781
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,790
No, listen.

782
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,960
If I buy a car,

783
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,680
am I buying it for myself?

784
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,600
I'm buying it for our studio.

785
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,520
It's for all of us to use.

786
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,470
When I am on business appointments,

787
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,360
discuss projects,

788
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,640
I need to have a car
that gives us a good image.

789
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,960
If the car is of poor quality,

790
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,600
it will undermine our credibility.

791
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,910
And it will be hard to strike a deal.

792
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,000
Then, why don't you tell him?

793
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,560
You should explain this to him.

794
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,650
He should understand.

795
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
I know, I will tell him.

796
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,160
But you can't tell him, okay?

797
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,520
You have to keep it a secret for me.

798
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,120
Okay?

799
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,440
Once you tell him,
it will make things more complicated.

800
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,960
Until when should I keep it a secret?

801
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,080
Until I'm ready to talk to him about it.

802
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,440
So...

803
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,400
Yuan Yuan.

804
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,600
A customer has arrived.

805
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,400
Quickly.

806
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,920
I'm coming.

807
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,800
Wake up!

808
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,160
Wake up!

809
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,280
Wake up!

810
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,640
Wake up!

811
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,600
What are you doing?

812
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,120
What...

813
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,240
What are you doing?

814
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,920
I realized that

815
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,360
we're really not
suitable to live together.

816
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,820
I almost lost my life there.

817
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,480
I didn't know you had asthma.

818
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,220
I just told you, didn't I?

819
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,960
(Borman Counseling Center)

820
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,700
Psychological counseling.

821
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,580
Currently, there are
several different approaches.

822
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
(Psychological counselor, Liu Xia)
One is called psychoanalysis.

823
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,100
Psychoanalysis

824
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,300
mainly explores the unconscious

825
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,830
and brings the unconscious
into consciousness

826
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,620
while working with the patient
to resolve their issues.

827
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,660
The second one is

828
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,380
cognitive-behavioral therapy.

829
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,260
Cognitive-behavioral therapy

830
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,980
mainly focuses on changing beliefs

831
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:05,670
and behavior patterns of the patient
to adjust their cognition.

832
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,270
After changing these patterns,

833
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,390
the patient's psychological problems

834
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,630
will naturally be resolved.

835
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,870
And then there's another popular one,

836
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,960
called family therapy.

837
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,220
In family therapy,

838
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,100
no family member is innocent,

839
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,060
and the symptoms

840
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,300
are the result of the problem,

841
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,440
not the problem itself.

842
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,130
For example,

843
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,080
if a couple has a bad relationship,

844
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,760
that's a symptom,

845
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,770
not the problem itself.

846
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,270
Why the couple has a bad relationship,

847
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,600
we don't know,
and we don't delve into it.

848
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,170
So how do we treat it?

849
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,050
By facilitating
communication among family members.

850
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,270
- In this way...
- Mr. Yang.

851
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,670
They can adjust
within an interactive relationship.

852
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,410
For example, sometimes

853
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,290
the man is always dominant

854
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:48,850
Mr. Yang?

855
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,490
and the woman is submissive,

856
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,050
resulting in an unequal relationship.

857
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,800
I can take over
the case Liu Xia didn't want.

858
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,210
Sometimes, the man
appropriately showing vulnerability

859
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,170
can give the woman...

860
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,090
In terms of expertise,

861
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,400
indeed, I'm not as capable as her,

862
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,830
but at least

863
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,150
I am loyal to Borman.

864
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,840
What do you mean?

865
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,030
I heard that

866
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,950
Liu Xia doesn't
plan to renew her contract.

867
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,080
Don't you know, Mr. Yang?

868
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,440
If you have any more
questions, just ask me anytime.

869
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,080
Okay.

870
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,840
- See you, Miss Liu.
- Okay.

871
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,350
Miss Liu.

872
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,550
An elderly lady
gave you a thank-you note.

873
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,030
She waited for you all morning.

874
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,950
I thought she waited for too long,

875
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,190
so I told her to leave first.

876
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,510
I hope you are not upset.

877
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,350
Another short-term
focused counseling session

878
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,270
that solved the problem.

879
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,270
Such efficiency is
worth all of us learning.

880
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,030
But you always do this.

881
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,750
Acting all special
and breaking the rules.

882
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,280
It doesn't look good, does it?

883
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,470
Did I break
the rules for psychological counselors,

884
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,150
or Borman's rules?

885
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,950
I didn't expect you
to look down on Borman like this.

886
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,470
Liu Xia, come up for a moment.

887
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,280
Don't worry about it.

888
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,080
You are the reputation of Borman.

889
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,080
You're different from them.

890
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,550
You know,

891
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,070
I have always been skeptical
about the company's decision

892
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,870
to set a 20-session
consultation as one course.

893
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,390
This is a company.

894
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,070
And there should be standards.

895
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,470
Otherwise, it will be chaotic.

896
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,320
I've finished reading this.

897
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,280
The feedback for the classes is good.

898
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,120
According to this progress,

899
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,440
by the end of the year, these interns

900
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,450
can start to try
dealing with some cases.

901
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Mr. Yang.

902
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,920
I've almost finished my work here.

903
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,450
I actually wanted to tell you

904
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,800
that I've rented my own studio.

905
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,560
I'm busy moving these days.

906
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,760
So I would like to
take a long vacation.

907
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,520
During my resignation period,

908
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,960
you can stop my salary payment.

909
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,800
If there's anything at Borman
that needs my assistance,

910
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,080
I can come back anytime.

911
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,360
