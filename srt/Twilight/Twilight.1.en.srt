Hey, watch out! What's going on with you?

69

What do I do with this stain?

70
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
It's ok, Director Yan.

71

I'm already downstairs.

- Why aren't you watching your steps?!

73
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
Look at what you did to my clothes!

74
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,600
What should I do?

75
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,240
Say something! How to deal with this?

76
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,330
Apologize to me!

77

It's a terrace restaurant.

to jump off the building.

Are you planning to jump off from here?

113

What if I am?

114

You've already made up
your mind to jump off from here.

a lot of resentment, right?

That's why I should die.

Seems like a guy
is about to jump off the roof.

Who's the woman with him?

Seems like a psychological counselor.

Can a psychological counselor
save someone?

150

I'll be there right away!

154

Do you think that by jumping off,
you're just killing yourself?

155
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,620
No, you're ruining an entire family.

156

at least say goodbye to your family.

At least call your kid.

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,640
He won't have a dad to rely on.

173
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,440
No dad to comfort and guide
him through the difficulties.

174
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,040
In future,

175
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,280
he'll have to rely on himself.

176
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,200
No, I can't do it!

177
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,600
I might just be a coward.

178
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm an unfitting father.

179
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,360
I can't face them.

180
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,400
Let them forget about me!

181
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,680
They won't forget about you.

182
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,920
They won't hate you either.

183
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,560
No child would admit
that his father is a coward.

184
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,800
He'll only find various excuses
for your selfishness today.

185
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,600
He might even think
it's because he's too weak

186
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
to protect his father.

187
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,600
He'll spend his future blaming himself.

188
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,920
He'll have countless nightmares.

189
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
All about you.

190
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,680
Maybe it'll never get better for him.

191
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,320
How do you know?

(College Psychological Association)
Now, let's welcome

193
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,220
Borman's best psychologist.

194
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,240
Ms. Liu Xia.

(College Psychological Association
21st Annual Academic Conference)

196
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,160
Hello, everyone.

197
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm Liu Xia.

198
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,480
A psychological counselor.

199
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,360
It's been six years
since I graduated and work at Borman.

200
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
Since its establishment,

201
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,760
we've been active in society,

202
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,120
and on campuses,

203
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
and we collaborate with enterprises.

204
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,440
We hope to promote
psychological counseling step by step.

205
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,000
Along this journey,

206
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
we've encountered many doubts.

207
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,960
But fortunately,

208
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,480
we have persevered.

209
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,420
We've seen our clients' lives
being improved after finishing counseling.

210
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,720
We're more confident that
what we do is meaningful.

211
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,200
(There's hope. Call me if you need.
I'm a counselor.)

212
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,200
We hope that counseling can slowly
become a part of social development.

213
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,150
And for everyone to normalize it.

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,680
Alright.

215
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,740
So that's our topic today.

216
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,760
Psychological problems are not difficult.

217
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,980
- Well said.
- Well said!

(Yuan Yuan)

221
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,280
Hey, Yuan Yuan.

222
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,720
(Shanshan.)

223
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,920
(Where are you?)

224
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
I'm almost there.

225
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,720
(I just checked
the live traffic on the map.)

226
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,760
(It's not busy.)

227
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
(Didn't you say you were
on your way half an hour ago?)

228
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,680
Something occurred when I got the cab.

229
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,900
The road was blocked by a crowd

230
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,680
so it took me a while.

231
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
(What happened?)

232
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,880
A counselor seemed to save some guy
from killing himself.

233
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,640
But I don't know much about it.

234
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,760
(Alright.)

235
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,560
(We're waiting for you.)

236
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,160
(Jia Zhen is here.)

237
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,120
(Hurry up.)

238
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,400
I'll be there soon.

239
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,640
(I'll hang up now.)

240
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Ok, bye.

241
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,400
Why is he still not answering?
What's going on?

242
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,600
Yuan Yuan!

243
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,100
I called you. Why did you just arrive?

244
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
Who decided to meet here?

245
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,360
Jia Zhen.

246
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,680
He's been waiting inside for you.

247
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,600
Oh my goodness.

248
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,280
Hurry up.

249
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,920
Are you reading
the script I wrote for you?

250
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,600
Yep.

251
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,920
If you have any suggestions,
just tell me.

252
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,080
Don't worry about it.

253
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,320
I won't get mad.

254
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,880
Nothing.

255
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,680
It's great.

256
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,440
Right?

257
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,480
- I just told you about a scene...
- There's one issue.

258
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,520
There's one issue.

259
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,720
Listen.

260
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,080
This female lead.

261
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,320
When will she appear?

262
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,160
She's there.

263
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,400
Really?

264
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,240
You mean the woman with head covered?

265
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
She's the lead?

266
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,520
Yep.

267
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Okay.

268
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,280
But why did you make
her wear a head covering?

269
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,600
The kidnappers wouldn't want the hostage
to know the route, right?

270
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,760
So, it makes much more sense
to cover her, right?

271
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,760
Right. Hostage.

272
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,960
But the male lead has
never seen her before.

273
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,320
What if he makes a mistake?

274
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,040
Um...

275
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,800
Don't bother with the logic.

276
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,320
I have great logic.

277
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,800
Another thing.

278
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,540
When do you plan for the two
to have a romantic encounter?

279
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,560
Wait. I don't understand.

280
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Why do I have to include
a romantic relationship in my script?

281
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,480
Why does he have
to be in a relationship?

282
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,400
I believe Luo Cheng
has many things to do.

283
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,160
He doesn't want to be in a relationship!

284
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,600
It's not what you believe!

285
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,760
Qi Lianshan.

286
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,760
It's not what you think.

287
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,800
It's not me.

288
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,600
It's what the client thinks!

289
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,640
Here's an extreme example.

290
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,600
If the client suddenly decides to
make the female a male lead,

291
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,320
it has to be changed.

292
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,640
Be more professional.

293
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,600
Every story and character
has to have emotions.

294
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,640
You taught me that.

295
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Right?

296
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,200
Fine, fine.

297
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,680
Just tell me.

298
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,520
Will you change it or not?

299
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,600
I won't.

300
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,080
Let's eat first.

301
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
We'll talk later.

302
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,160
No!

303
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,520
He's losing our client now!

304
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,400
Just tell me honestly.

305
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Is this female lead
difficult to deal with?

306
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,840
Right?

307
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,760
I'm right, aren't I?

308
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm telling you. This is a crime action.

309
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
It's to showcase male charm.

310
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,020
It has nothing to do
with this female lead.

311
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,660
But after she came in, you kept
requesting for changes.

312
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,040
And a romantic plot.

313
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,480
Please.

314
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
This isn't a romance.

315
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,760
If she wants a romance,
pick something else!

316
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,440
She picked the wrong script.

317
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,360
And she kept making requests,
making my script a mess now!

318
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,080
Your script?

319
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,880
This script belongs to the client!

320
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Look at you! You have
little skills but quite a temper!

321
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
Tell me now.

322
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,720
Will you change it or not?

323
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,280
I won't!

324
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,600
I said I won't, so I won't!

325
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,520
Fine! Don't change it then!

326
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,080
Don't change it?

327
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,360
What do you mean?

328
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,480
Are you planning to fire me?

329
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,720
Alright!

330
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,480
I'll leave.

331
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,240
Hey!

332
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,000
How dare you?

333
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,480
Where are you going?

334
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,320
Shanshan!

335
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
He didn't mean that.

336
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,040
Stop right there!

337
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,160
Stay there!

338
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,440
Are you getting angry at me?

339
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes, I'm angry at you. So what?

340
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,680
Why are you so upset?

341
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm just asking you
to change the script.

342
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,360
Why do you have to
make a scene in public?

343
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,000
Every time out there,
I have to please the clients.

344
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,640
Who should I vent that anger on?

345
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,080
What?

346
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,100
Are you speaking up for him?

347
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,680
Shanshan didn't say
he wouldn't change it.

348
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,760
Don't play a peacemaker.

349
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,960
We have to clarify things today.

350
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,480
Great. I almost get it.

351
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,760
You almost get what?

352
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Bro.

353
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:01,920
Go away!

354
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,920
Calm down. Calm down.

355
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,440
Listen.

356
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,120
Isn't there this plot about Luo Cheng
turning against his brother?

357
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,840
I just can't grasp that feeling

358
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,400
so I've been wanting
to know what it's like.

359
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,860
And I just experienced it!

360
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,120
I can accurately grasp that feeling now.

361
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
You're crazy!

362
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,400
Bro.

363
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,700
- Don't take it to heart.
- Go away!

364
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
This is for the sake of the plot.

365
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,040
Right?

366
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,440
You guys eat.

367
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,280
I'll hurry back and write
while I still have that feeling.

368
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,360
I'll give you the finished work.

369
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,840
Shanshan.

370
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Finish the meal before leaving.

371
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,560
It's okay.

372
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,000
Jia Zhen.

373
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,320
Don't take it to heart!

374
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,100
Immersive writing.

375
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,220
That's how Shanshan is, you know?

376
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,700
You are protecting him, right?

377
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,020
Someday, I'll die out of anger
because of him.

378
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,540
No, no, no.

379
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,260
Let me accompany you for dinner, okay?

380
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,740
No need.

381
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,900
I can eat well on my own.

382
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,620
Alright, alright.

383
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,980
Go ahead and order some food.

384
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,460
Why did you come back?

385
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm afraid the feeling
will be gone after I go back,

386
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,300
so I want to take advantage
of being in the zone

387
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,340
to quickly finish writing here.

388
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,120
Fine.

389
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,280
I saw you on stage earlier,
talking non-stop,

390
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,040
which reminded me of many years ago,

391
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,280
when Borman was just established.

392
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,720
Back then, you were just

393
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,160
a freshly graduated college student.

394
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,800
Now you can handle an academic forum
on your own.

395
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,480
Alright, Mr. Yang.

396
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,560
You don't have to praise me.

397
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,040
It's not all praise.

398
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,800
There's also criticism.

399
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,200
Just now on the rooftop,

400
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,440
it was quite dangerous.

401
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,520
You were too impulsive.

402
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,240
First of all,

403
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
you don't know who the other person is.

404
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,400
What if he was a dangerous criminal?

405
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,920
Secondly,

406
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,440
rescuing someone is good.

407
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,560
But what if he jumped off?

408
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,280
Then we would be in trouble.

409
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,800
I admit I didn't think much,

410
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
but in that situation,

411
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,880
no one would think about it
so carefully, right?

412
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,760
After all, life is at stake.

413
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,280
Just a well-intentioned reminder.

414
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,040
Don't be angry.

415
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,640
Let's go.

416
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,240
By the way,

417
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,260
I was just thinking about
making an endorsement for the center,

418
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,080
so help me arrange a meeting
with Director Yan from your department.

419
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,580
Sure.

420
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,680
Director Yan is
on a business trip this week,

421
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,860
so let's schedule it for next week.

422
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,160
(Borman Counseling Center)

423
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,680
Oh, by the way,

424
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,700
what did you decide
about that matter earlier?

425
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,140
Which matter?

426
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,660
The hypnosis case.

427
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,300
That case involved

428
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,300
the violation of
psychological regulations.

429
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,540
I can't take the case.

430
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,280
But the person asked for help.

431
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,370
Just consider it as helping.

432
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,690
Mr. Yang,

433
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,090
it's not just about helping out.

434
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,050
No matter how much money they offer,

435
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,410
I can't help with this favor.

436
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,290
Well...

437
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,730
I won't reject them right away.

438
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,810
Take some time to think about it.

439
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,410
Mr. Yang.

440
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,890
There's something I want to tell you.

441
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,290
My contract is about to expire.

442
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,930
I'm going to submit
my resignation letter later.

443
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,250
I'll finish all my tasks

444
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,920
in the coming month and hand them over.

445
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,450
Xiaoxia.

446
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,930
Why are you bringing up
resignation again?

447
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,370
Every time I mention it,

448
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,610
you say you will think about it.

449
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,930
This matter has been delayed...

450
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,010
I still have an important task to discuss.

451
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,760
How about we talk about it another day?

452
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,000
I'll leave now.

453
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,450
Why do you come at such a late time?

454
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,130
According to the rules,

455
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,540
we shouldn't disturb you so late.

456
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,720
We came today

457
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,760
to inform you about something.

458
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,210
We need to reclaim this house.

459
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,220
This house was purchased for my son,

460
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,850
and now he's going to come back.

461
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,090
We can only take back the house.

462
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,170
You see,

463
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,930
he didn't even inform us
he is coming back in advance.

464
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,490
Yeah.

465
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,130
He told us right
before boarding the plane.

466
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,490
Right.

467
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,450
And now it's come to this.

468
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,530
What should we do?

469
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,250
Yeah.

470
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,930
This...

471
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,610
Qi,

472
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,250
please help us.

473
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,010
We're really out of options.

474
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:49,810
This is

475
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,170
the deposit.

476
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,450
And the rent you paid me.

477
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,170
It's all in here.

478
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,610
Please check.

479
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,930
It's not about the money.

480
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,490
It's about the suddenness.

481
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,050
I need time to find another place.

482
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,490
I have a lot of work to do.

483
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,650
Qi.

484
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,610
We are out of options.

485
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,740
We have no other choice.

486
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,520
Please help us out.

487
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,160
Consider our situation.

488
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,120
My son is coming back.

489
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,860
If he finds out
that we rented this house to you,

490
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,400
he won't let us off easily.

491
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,520
It's tough being parents.

492
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,080
Yeah.

493
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,120
Please help us out.

494
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,360
Jin Ran.

495
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,200
How was it?

496
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,680
We didn't reach an agreement again.

497
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,200
Every time I bring up this matter,

498
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,960
he will say let's talk later.

499
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,240
Borman just got famous.

500
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,840
How could they bear to let you go?

501
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,120
So why do you want to leave?

502
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,630
Starting your own business
is tiring, right?

503
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,060
Starting my own business is a bit tiring,

504
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,920
but I can make
my own decisions about everything.

505
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,080
You know that nowadays Borman's brand

506
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,170
is getting bigger and bigger,

507
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,610
but the fees are also getting higher.

508
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,770
Isn't that like excluding

509
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,700
those who really need help?

510
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,920
I discussed this
issue with Mr. Yang before.

511
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,640
But he's standing

512
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,700
from a businessman's perspective

513
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,860
to think about this matter.

514
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,820
I understand it's fine
that running a company

515
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,420
from a business perspective.

516
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,020
But...

517
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,620
If we continue to cooperate like this,

518
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,580
I'll completely go against

519
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,140
my original intention
of being a psychotherapist.

520
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,820
I understand.

521
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,752
You just want to help
more people in need, right?

522
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,060
Anyway, no matter what,

523
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,500
I will support you.

524
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,140
That is all I need.

525
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,300
Let's go. Let's go eat dinner.

526
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,100
I'll treat you.

527
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,540
I've been staying at your place
for a week now.

528
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
I feel shy about it.

529
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,500
Don't be polite to me.

530
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,980
Nonsense.

531
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,180
Besides, this is also my way
of showing support.

532
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,700
It takes money to set up a studio, too.

533
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,060
Save some, okay?

534
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,980
By the way, do you have time tomorrow?

535
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,860
Accompany me to check out that house
I found on the Internet.

536
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,460
If the on-site visit goes well,

537
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,420
I'll rent it.

538
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,580
Anyway, there's still a month left.

539
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,020
We can do both at the same time.

540
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,820
Anyway, I'll accompany you.

541
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,180
I definitely have time for you.

542
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
I'm part of the founding team, after all.

543
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,020
Let's go. What do you want to eat?

544
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,900
I'll treat.

545
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,780
No, I'll treat.

546
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,000
Qi Lianshan. Aren't you a smart person?

547
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Why are you so obedient?

548
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,900
At least ask them
to let you stay for the night.

549
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,740
Where should I find a house for you
in the middle of the night?

550
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,260
The old couple
can't do anything about it.

551
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,500
They're doing this for their child.

552
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,340
Otherwise, they wouldn't come
looking for me at such a late time.

553
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,660
You only think for others.

554
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,140
Who thinks for you then?

555
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,800
You.

556
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,560
And my brother.

557
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,280
It's enough as long as
I have the two of you.

558
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,540
Today's situation is my fault.

559
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,060
I should've let you find a house
on your own.

560
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,500
You could've chosen one yourself
and lived comfortably.

561
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,580
Your brother was
worried it would distract you from writing,

562
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,060
so he insisted I choose.

563
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,180
I understand.

564
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,420
My brother just doesn't want me

565
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,700
to waste too much energy
on finding a house.

566
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,580
He just wants me to move in directly.

567
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,320
Exactly.

568
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,200
Your brother is a sharp-tongue
but kind person.

569
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,860
When he knew
that you got kicked out of the place.

570
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,580
He called me several times
in the middle of night.

571
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,860
and told me to come quickly.

572
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,420
If he wasn't in a hurry,

573
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,020
he would've come himself.

574
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:31,740
No.

575
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,260
Where are you going?

576
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,500
Aren't we going to my brother's place?

577
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,380
We don't know
when he will be done drinking.

578
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,860
He might drink until midnight.

579
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,380
He will affect
your scriptwriting at night.

580
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,460
You can go to my place for the night.

581
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,980
I understand.

582
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,860
I stay at your place.

583
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,940
So you can go
to my brother's place, right?

584
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,220
I understand.

585
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,820
No.

586
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,700
Why are you doing this?

587
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,060
Will you go pick up my brother
after you drop me off?

588
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
What else would I do?

589
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:10,880
Qi Lianshan.

590
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,520
Do you have to do this?

591
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Why did you make it so clear?

592
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,880
Shanshan.

593
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,560
I already changed the bed sheets
and covers for you.

594
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,800
You can sleep in the room later.

595
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,760
I told you.

596
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,120
I won't sleep.

597
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,520
You haven't slept for two days.

598
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,040
How can you not sleep?

599
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,080
If I feel tired,
I'll just take a quick nap.

600
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,160
I just boiled this hot water
before I left.

601
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,680
Let me bring the cup for you.

602
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,240
I got it. I got it.

603
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,720
Fruits.

604
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,800
Eat more fruits.

605
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
They look so delicious.

606
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,480
Do you need any help here?

607
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,600
I don't need you here.

608
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,480
I think my brother needs you more.

609
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,240
Then I'll go first.

610
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,520
Sure, go ahead.

611
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,160
Remember to sleep early.

612
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,040
Okay.

613
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,720
Go quickly.

614
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,480
I did a good deed.

615
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,480
Keep it up, Yuanyuan.

616
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,080
(Man's Suicide Attempt Thwarted
by Female Psychologist and Rescue Team)

00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,960
(No child will admit
that their father is a coward.)

618
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,240
(He will only find various excuses)

619
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,560
(for his selfishness today.)

620
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,240
(He might even think
it's because he's too weak)

621
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,280
(and couldn't protect his father.)

622
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,200
His future life

623
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,520
will be lived
in the shadow of self-blame.

624
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,400
He will have countless nights
filled with nightmares.

625
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
He will dream about you.

626
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,000
How do you know?

627
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Because I'm also someone

628
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,440
who was abandoned by my father

629
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,520
and grew up alone.

You don't want to tell,

638
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,920
and I don't want to know.

639
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,600
I have my reasons.

640
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,880
So what?

641
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,920
I am a police officer.

642
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,120
Let me go.

643
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm sorry.

644
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Between you and me,

645
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,360
there should be an answer now.

646
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,680
You acted pretty well.

647
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,360
Okay.

648
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,480
That's it.

649
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm touched.

650
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,920
Qi Lianshan,

651
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,880
you're amazing.

652
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,120
This is talent.

653
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,840
It's done.

654
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm sorry.

655
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,400
I'm sorry.

656
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,320
Talent.

658
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,720
You have no idea about my talent. Bro.

659
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,600
I'm sorry.

660
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,480
Okay, okay.

661
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

662
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,840
Don't listen to it anymore.

663
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,400
Focus on the character.

664
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,080
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,800
The café downstairs is also a bookstore.

666
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,160
And this French window

667
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,600
is large and bright.

668
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,680
I estimate that the sun can shine
through the whole room

669
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,040
around seven or eight in the morning.

670
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,600
It's refreshing, right?

671
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,000
Yes.

672
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,880
The coffee downstairs,

673
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,520
combined with the aroma of books,

674
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,600
as soon as I enter,

675
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,720
I can feel relaxation
in my mind and body.

676
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,880
And the location is good.

677
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
The transportation is convenient.

678
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,800
But,

679
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,480
isn't it a bit noisy?

680
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,920
Not noisy.

681
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,880
Let me tell you, I've figured it out.

682
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Look, here.

683
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,880
If I just put two sofas here,
along with a coffee table,

684
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,280
it would be a very private
consultation space.

685
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,080
You see this glass.

686
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,120
The sunlight will be coming in.

687
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
It will make me feel comfortable.

688
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,040
Indeed, it's quite nice.

689
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,880
And this floor. When I step on it,

690
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,440
I can feel that it must be solid wood.

691
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,880
When I come in,

692
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,840
I take a deep breath and sniff,

693
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,240
it doesn't have any smell.

694
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,360
It proves that the materials
used in this house are of high quality.

695
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,760
What do you say about this house?

696
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,200
It's definitely made for us.

697
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,000
Come, stop looking around.

698
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,960
There's one thing

699
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,040
I have to tell you clearly.

700
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,720
What is it?

701
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,760
Come here.

702
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,800
This big bedroom is spacious,

703
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,200
and well-lit,
especially this Venetian blind,

704
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,160
it has a lot of styles.

705
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,240
But the problem is,

706
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,960
there's no bathroom.

707
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,760
The small bedroom next to it
has a bathroom.

708
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,960
You can live in the smaller one.

709
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,000
Why can't I live in the small room?

710
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,360
Then what about this big one?

711
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,320
Don't worry about it.

712
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,800
Let's go, let's talk to the landlord.

713
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,360
This room is big.

714
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,320
I plan to rent out this room.

715
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,440
Rent it out?

716
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,720
You woke up so early.

717
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,200
I bought breakfast for you.

718
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,560
Eat while it's hot.

719
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,360
Okay.

720
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,880
Such a hearty breakfast.

721
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,960
You really didn't sleep all night, huh?

722
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,320
I did sleep.

723
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,040
I sat here and slept for about

724
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,960
two minutes.

725
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,120
No, you can't do this.

726
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,920
You can't stay up all night like this.

727
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,600
It's nothing.

728
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,280
You're ruining your health.

729
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,200
It looks like I really
need to find a house for you.

730
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,840
Tell me.

731
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,820
What are your requirements for a house?

732
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,800
Let me check it out now.

733
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,200
Let's stick with
the previous requirements.

734
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,240
This house is not bad.

735
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,720
Take a look, it's for the whole unit.

736
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,640
One bedroom and one living room.

737
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,640
This won't do.

738
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,960
It's too dirty inside.

739
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,480
It's hard to clean it.

740
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,640
I can find a cleaner for you.

741
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,280
It really can't be cleaned properly.

742
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,280
Really.

743
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,520
What about this one? Take a look.

744
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,200
This one is not bad.

745
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,160
The wallpaper, cabinets, and the bed,

746
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,280
everything is pink.

747
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
How can I live in that?

748
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,360
What's wrong with pink?

749
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,920
There are a lot of men
who wear pink clothes.

750
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,720
I'm not that kind of man.

751
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,040
I don't like pink.

752
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,000
I like it.

753
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,560
This one.

754
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,840
This should work.

755
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,840
The location, price,
and environment are all good.

756
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,640
It's pretty good, but...

757
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,440
6,500 yuan per month is too expensive.

758
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,320
Please try to find something

759
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,480
within 5,000 yuan or below.

760
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,600
4,000 yuan or less, okay?

761
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,840
4,000 or less.

762
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,400
Where can I find a house for 4,000?
It will be in the suburbs.

763
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,040
That's fine.

764
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,240
A house for 4,000 yuan
with your requirements.

765
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,280
Where can you find that?

766
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,720
There's actually one for 4,000 yuan.

767
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,080
Good location, and a good environment.

768
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,200
Take a look at this.

769
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,440
This one.

770
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,240
Does this work?

771
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
(House For Rent)

772
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,360
4,000 yuan. In the old city area.

773
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,800
With such good decoration.

774
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,200
It must be fake, right?

775
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,680
Just tell me if you like it or not.

776
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,280
This one.

777
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,160
I like it.

778
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,560
But.

779
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,520
This must be...

780
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,680
As long as you like it.

781
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,920
I'll make a call to confirm first.

782
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
This is a showroom.

783
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,220
This is a fake listing.

784
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,560
- Don't you believe it?
- I'll confirm it and find out.

785
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
Hello.

786
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Hi there.

787
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,200
Is this Miss Liu from Sky City No. 66?

788
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:00,880
Yes, that's me.

789
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,540
I just saw your rental listing online.

790
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,780
I wanted to confirm something with you.

791
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,300
Is the picture real?

792
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,640
Of course it's real.

793
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,710
What about the price?

794
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,080
Isn't it written online?

795
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,440
But let's meet and talk about it.

796
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,600
We can meet each other.

797
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,920
And you can also check the place

798
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,360
to see if it's really like the pictures.

799
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,450
Alright, alright.

800
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,250
Are you available now?

801
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,250
If you come now,

802
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,890
I can only have my friend to meet you.

803
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,210
She can represent me.

804
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,290
Okay. See you soon.

805
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,450
It's a genuine listing?

806
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,250
Yeah.

807
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,370
We're here, we're here.

808
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,690
Look, right here.

809
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,210
Such a charming place.

810
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,010
Here it is.

811
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,730
Isn't this a café?

812
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,210
Doesn't it say so here?

813
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,890
The second floor of a street-front café.

814
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,410
That should be it.

815
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,570
The second floor, huh?

816
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,170
Oh my goodness.

817
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,530
It's quite spacious.

818
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,970
It should be the landlord.

819
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,650
Go and take a look around.

820
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,770
I'll answer her call.

821
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,770
Don't go too far.

822
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,570
Hello.

823
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,690
I'm at the café.

824
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,050
Should I go in?

825
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,370
- Oh my.
- Okay.
