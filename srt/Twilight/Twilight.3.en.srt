I don't have an opportunity to inquire.

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,640
But what is causing your dissatisfaction?

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,560
Is it the salary

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,320
or the benefits?

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,440
If you're feeling dissatisfied,

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,320
please feel free to inform me.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,680
I'll make every effort,
within reasonable boundaries,

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,680
to address your concerns.

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,280
We can arrange a further discussion

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,480
if I cannot meet your expectations.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,280
No.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,640
Mr. Yang.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,000
Salary and benefits
are not the issue here.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,700
The shareholders set the pricing.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,700
Nowadays, many things require
a market-oriented approach.

41
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,390
Borman caters
to a high-end customer base.

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
And they have specific demands.

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,000
These customers value unique services.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,880
I believe visitors should be categorized

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,660
based on their problems

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,800
rather than their financial status.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,600
However,

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,850
I also acknowledge
Borman's precise positioning.

49
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,200
Nonetheless, I have my own perspective.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,920
Idealism doesn't work.

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
Even if that is so,

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,480
I still want to try it.

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,240
Mr. Yang.

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,840
I would like to take my leave

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,400
if there's nothing else.

56
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,320
Automatic seats!

57
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Cool, right?

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,040
I can't believe it!

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
It's genuine leather.

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
Of course.

61
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,960
Do you remember our old, worn-out car?

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
Do you smell anything in this new car?

63
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
Does it smell strong to you?

64
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
It smells delightful.

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
Unlike our old car,

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,920
which would become so stuffy

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,840
when the sun beamed.

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
I couldn't even fit inside.

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,800
Money is truly a great thing.

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,600
What do you think about this car?

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
Does it feel sturdy to you?

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,440
It's so high up.

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,360
The view is incredible.

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
I always feel like

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,560
moments as joyful as this

76
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,480
should be experienced
together, the three of us.

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,120
Don't worry, Yuan Yuan.

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,440
We're getting better now.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,440
Exciting moments like these

80
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,200
will keep coming,

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,000
one after another.

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,080
Shanshan, you and I,

83
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,680
we make a great team.

84
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,320
How could I ever forget about him?

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,800
My father has changed a lot.

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,680
Unlike when we first moved here,

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,880
he frequently turned
on the TV late at night,

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,080
disturbing everyone's sleep.

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,080
However,
I still struggle to fall asleep,

90
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,240
no matter what I try.

91
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,760
Miss Liu.

92
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,240
As you know,
I suffer from neurasthenia.

93
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,000
I need proper rest
to accomplish anything.

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,440
Are you still sensitive to sounds now?

95
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,840
It has improved somewhat,

96
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,360
but there's still
some sensitivity lingering.

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,720
Being sensitive is normal.

98
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,520
So you should accept

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,640
rather than resist it.

100
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,160
Listen to
this familiar ticking sound again.

101
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,160
You will synchronize
your breathing with its rhythm.

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,400
Inhale.

103
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Exhale.

104
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
Inhale.

105
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
Exhale.

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,160
Picture yourself

107
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,400
standing in front of a plum orchard.

108
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,040
A gentle breeze brushes,

109
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,200
and you feel surrounded
by a blooming sea of flowers.

110
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,960
Follow the rhythm of your breath.

111
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,960
Now, I will count down from three.

112
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,800
And together, we will enter
a deeper state of relaxation.

113
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Three.

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,520
Two.

115
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,120
One.

116
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,320
You mentioned a vast plum orchard

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,120
behind your childhood house.

118
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,840
Now, imagine yourself
within that very orchard.

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,200
How do you feel?

120
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,200
It's truly a beautiful place.

121
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,320
Every winter,

122
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,720
when the plum blossoms bloomed,

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,240
I stood near the balcony window.

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,400
The wind

125
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,000
would sweep in,

126
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
delicately caressing my face.

127
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,560
It was freezing,

128
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,640
almost like ice,

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,720
and felt as sharp as a knife.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,240
I once asked my mother

131
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,200
why it was so cold outside

132
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
while the plum blossoms

133
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,440
continued to bloom, petal by petal.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
As you continue walking inside,

135
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
you come across a door

136
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,240
that belongs to your home.

137
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,640
Please take a moment

138
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,760
to consider its location.

139
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,200
I remember

140
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,960
it is

141
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,840
my father's study room.

142
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,880
What lies beyond

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,920
this study room?

144
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Try to open the door.

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,760
Don't worry.

146
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,400
It's a safe place

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
where no harm can come to you.

148
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,760
I'm not sure.

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,200
I...

150
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,480
Approach the door slowly

151
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,760
and attempt to open it.

152
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm still determining.

153
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,920
No one can harm you here.

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
What is that?

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
It's alright.

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
Let's keep moving forward.

157
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,320
Miss Liu.

158
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
What was that sound?

159
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,300
There's some
construction happening nearby.

160
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,960
So there might be
occasional low-frequency noise.

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,400
Don't worry. Please have a seat.

162
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Let's continue our session.

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,240
You mentioned that

164
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,400
your insomnia symptoms

165
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,640
started after your father
moved to live with you.

166
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
It could be related to

167
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,960
your relationship with him.

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,480
When you mentioned
your father's study room earlier,

169
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,720
it triggered a clear sense of resistance.

170
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,160
Did you experience
any significant conflicts

171
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,750
with your father during your childhood?

172
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Well...

173
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,840
I don't have any conflicts

174
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,240
with my father.

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Let me explain.

176
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,720
Our psychological troubles

177
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,200
often have deeper underlying causes.

178
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,280
Some may be rooted in our upbringing,

179
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
family background,

180
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,880
or even psychological traumas.

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,920
So, we need to explore

182
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,080
the core reasons behind them gradually.

183
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
There's no need to rush.

184
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,320
We can take our time to uncover them.

185
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
Take a deep breath

186
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,720
and close your eyes.

187
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,120
Inhale

188
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,560
and prepare yourself.

189
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,040
Miss Liu.

190
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
Sorry about that.

191
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
I apologize.

192
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,240
Are you awake?

193
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,520
Don't pretend to be asleep in there!

194
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,720
Your snoring was so loud

195
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
when someone was present,

196
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
but it ceased as soon as she left.

197
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,760
Could you wake up and join me outside?

198
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
I must talk with you today,

199
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,280
as we have to find a solution.

200
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
I am working here!

201
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,040
What do you mean by this?

202
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
Say something!

203
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,080
Hello.

204
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,000
(Hi.)

205
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,160
(Is this Miss Liu Xia?)

206
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,880
Yes.

207
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,720
Who am I speaking to?

208
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,680
(This is Amy from the Auran Group.)

209
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,040
(Ms. Jiang asked
me to contact you regarding)

210
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,420
(the details of
psychological counseling services.)

211
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,400
(Do you have time today?)

212
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,440
(I'd like to meet and talk with you
if it's convenient.)

213
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,880
Sure, I can make time.

214
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,680
(Alright.)

215
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,120
(I'll send you the address shortly.)

216
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Great.

217
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Goodbye.

218
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,480
What is it with this machine?

219
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
- It's jammed again.
- What's wrong?

220
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Come on.

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,240
Take a look and see what's wrong with it.

222
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

223
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,640
Where's the character
relationship diagram I drew?

224
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,760
What relationship diagram?

225
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,080
The one I worked on a few days ago.

226
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
No, I don't understand.

227
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,760
Our studio is so small.

228
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,460
Why can't I ever find anything
that I need?

229
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,200
Don't worry.

230
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,960
I'll help you to find it.

231
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,680
Oh my goodness!

232
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,760
Yuan Yuan.

233
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,520
I've made up my mind.

234
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,640
Our current place is too cramped

235
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,840
and suffocating.

236
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,440
We need a larger space.

237
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,000
No, I don't see the need for it.

238
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,160
It's just the three of us.

239
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,080
Why are you wasting money?

240
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
The studio serves as our business image.

241
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
I don't know what a business image is.

242
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,640
I only know that you shouldn't
believe everything you hear.

243
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,920
Why doesn't Wang Yang move

244
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,240
if the business image is so essential?

245
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
What does it have to do with him?

246
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,920
I have my own needs.

247
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,720
Besides, he's an intermediary.

248
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,760
He doesn't need a business image.

249
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
His talent speaks for itself.

250
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,640
And please, stop constantly
talking about money.

251
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,360
It annoys me.

252
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,920
Alright. I won't mention it anymore.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,680
I won't bother you anymore.

254
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
Do whatever you want.

255
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,240
Yuan Yuan.

256
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,080
Everything I do
is for the better future of our studio.

257
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
I don't need someone
dampening my spirits now.

258
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,520
I need someone

259
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,880
who unconditionally supports me
by my side.

260
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,120
I wasn't trying to dampen your spirits.

261
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,320
We are screenwriters.

262
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,320
Our focus should be on

263
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,320
creating quality content and works.

264
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Don't get caught up
in superficial matters.

265
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,880
Moving to a slightly larger place

266
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,720
doesn't conflict with our creative work.

267
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,400
A better space will undoubtedly
result in better writing.

268
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,200
I understand what you want.

269
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,760
As long as we work hard,

270
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
we'll achieve it sooner or later.

271
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
But now is not the right time,

272
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,640
listen to me.

273
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,320
No.

274
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,160
You have to listen to me.

275
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,320
Yuan Yuan.

276
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,360
Everything I'm planning
is for our future.

277
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,040
You have to support me.

278
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,880
But...

279
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,600
Could you not give me that look?

280
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,880
Fine.

281
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,440
I can't control you.

282
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,000
Do what you want.

283
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,160
Hello.

284
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Are you Miss Liu Xia?

285
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Hi.

286
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,080
Allow me to introduce myself.

287
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm Amy, Ms. Jiang's assistant.

288
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,680
Please have a seat.

289
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,800
I've got some coffee for you.

290
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Thank you.

291
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,040
Thank you.

292
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,000
You're welcome.

293
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,880
So, here's the situation.

294
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,640
According to Ms. Jiang,

295
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,760
you made a lasting impression
on her during your last interaction.

296
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,440
As a result,

297
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,080
she wants to invite you
as her exclusive psychological counselor

298
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
and deepen our collaboration.

299
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,000
She expressed her desire for you

300
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,520
to become our company's
internal psychological counselor.

301
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,600
You will work
alongside the HR department

302
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
to establish a
counseling channel for our employees.

303
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,920
Please take a look at this.

304
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,380
(Psychological Counselor
Hiring Agreement)

305
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,360
It's a standardized contract

306
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
that clearly outlines the responsibilities
and rights of both parties.

307
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,960
Of course,

308
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,960
it's based on the
principles of fairness and impartiality.

309
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,220
We've learned that

310
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,960
your service fees at
Borman are paid per session.

311
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Additionally, there is
corporate-level collaboration.

312
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,640
Our company proposes

313
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,880
a one-year renewable contract.

314
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,200
Since we're just
starting to work together,

315
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,240
mutual adjustment
will be needed between both parties.

316
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,880
For the first year,
the remuneration is set at 600 thousand.

317
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,360
What are your thoughts on this?

318
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm excited to collaborate
with Ms. Jiang, no doubt.

319
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,200
However, there are still pending
procedures for my current studio.

320
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,800
I can't sign the contract now.

321
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,120
That's alright.

322
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,480
Let's start by discussing the details.

323
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,360
If you have any specific requirements,

324
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,920
please let me know.

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,160
I'll report them to the company

326
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,000
and apply on your behalf.

327
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,920
Okay, sounds good.

328
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,920
I'll take the contract home

329
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,240
and review it thoroughly.

330
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,400
We can stay in touch through phone call

331
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,360
if there are any further needs.

332
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
No problem.

333
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,760
Then, I'll go and
report to Ms. Jiang now.

334
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,060
Okay.

335
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's keep in touch.

336
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,960
Sure. Thank you.

337
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,800
Looking forward to working with you.

338
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,640
Thank you.

339
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Hey, sweetheart.

340
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
Once you're done with
work tonight, keep your schedule clear.

341
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm treating you to a lavish dinner.

342
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,280
See you tonight.

343
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,960
She's arrived at the Financial Tower.

344
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,880
Most likely been
to Jiang Siyan's company.

345
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,920
No way!

346
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
Very capable of you.

347
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
You can handle
the business tycoon, Jiang Siyan.

348
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,280
You've got something.

349
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,920
You must be kidding.

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,320
The first time I met her,
she didn't even spare me a glance.

351
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,960
But later, she trusted me a bit

352
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,320
after I diagnosed her illness correctly.

353
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,000
You are too modest.

354
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,240
She must have been won over

355
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,120
by your professional abilities.

356
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,440
Let's not reveal it openly.

357
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,640
Stay humble.

358
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,200
I must say, my darling,
you're incredible.

359
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,680
You know about Jiang Siyan too?

360
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Who doesn't know Jiang Siyan?

361
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
The renowned female entrepreneur.

362
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,000
She's been on numerous TV shows.

363
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,920
Aoran Group.

364
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
One of the co-founders of Aoran Group.

365
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,600
Our channel has invited her
to financial programs.

366
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
But, well,

367
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
our colleagues say
she's not easy to handle.

368
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,920
Be careful.

369
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,080
Please don't scare me.

370
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,840
I have yet to start working with her.

371
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,960
Why would I scare you?

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,760
It's true.

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
But the first time I met her,

374
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,480
she was pretty assertive
in her actions and words.

375
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,840
So, what's the deal with Jiang Siyan?

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm just curious.

377
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,440
She's one of those strong women.

378
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,040
What challenges could she face?

379
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,840
I really can't say anything.

380
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,240
Come on.

381
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,200
I'm just curious.

382
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,240
I didn't ask you to spill everything.

383
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,680
Just give me a hint
to satisfy my curiosity.

384
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,680
I really can't say.

385
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,160
It's a matter of professional ethics.

386
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,160
Alright then.

387
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,200
Since you won't reveal anything,

388
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,280
then bring me under your wing

389
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,760
if you need someone.

390
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
I can talk in front of the camera

391
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,160
as well as when facing people.

392
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,960
I can earn 600 thousand a year
by talking to people.

393
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,760
We're best friends, you know.

394
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,600
Please give it some thought.

395
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,520
I will.

396
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,200
I do have some professional abilities.

397
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,960
I'll consider it.

398
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,360
But your professional skills
lie in finance.

399
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,400
And I'm a psychological counselor.

400
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,680
It is not easy money.

401
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm working as a consultant
for an entire company at this time.

402
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
I have to take care of
over a hundred people.

403
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,420
Honestly, I can't handle it alone.

404
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,000
I have to hire more people.

405
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
And I have to pay their salaries too.

406
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,300
But it's alright.

407
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
This is a promising start.

408
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,680
Once we get started,
things may be smoother later on.

409
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,880
I hope so.

410
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,960
You mentioned treating me to lobster.

411
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,720
Where can we find it?

412
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,120
The small lobster
restaurant is up ahead.

413
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,240
It's small lobsters.

414
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,280
What's the matter?

415
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,440
Small lobsters are
still lobsters, aren't they?

416
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,400
Let's go.

417
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,720
Why else would I bring you here, then?

418
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,560
For lobsters!

419
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,800
Young man, try this. It's new.

420
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,600
No need.

421
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,560
Thank you.

422
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,200
Thank you.

423
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,920
Weigh it.

424
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,720
Make it a little cheaper.

425
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,240
Alright.

426
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
Weigh it.

427
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,480
It's not good.

428
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,400
How about this?

429
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,160
Today, buy three Chinese cabbages,

430
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,680
two small chili peppers,

431
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,200
half a radish, and a bit of cauliflower.

432
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,920
Here.

433
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,800
Give me some coriander too.

434
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,720
Coming right up.

435
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,560
Not so much.

436
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,560
Just a little bit is enough.

437
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,400
Just...

438
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,200
Just a little bit of this.

439
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,720
Just this.

440
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,840
Just this little bit is enough.

441
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,440
Young man.

442
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,720
You always come right when

443
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,840
I'm about to close, don't you?

444
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,600
You know I won't be able

445
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
to sell this tomorrow.

446
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Don't do that.

447
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,120
How am I supposed to
weigh such a small quantity?

448
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,600
I won't make any profit from it.

449
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,320
You're pretty clever. Young man.

450
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,160
You've got your calculations down pat,

451
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
haven't you?

452
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
What's that?

453
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,840
You old lady.

454
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,280
I haven't done anything to you,

455
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,280
why are you scolding me?

456
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Who's an old lady?

457
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,600
I'll take these.

458
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,920
I want to ask you,

459
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,040
how do you eat
such a small amount of vegetables?

460
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,120
I have a habit.

461
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
I do grocery shopping every day,

462
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,520
and I only buy the
amount needed for a day.

463
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,200
Take a look.

464
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,080
This scale doesn't budge at all.

465
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,680
This won't do.

466
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,280
You can't sell these?

467
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,080
Well, I'll go buy it from someone else.

468
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,040
Sure, go ahead.

469
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,920
Go, go, go.

470
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,160
Let's see who will sell.

471
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,000
Fine.

472
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,640
Young man,

473
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,440
the radishes today are especially cheap.

474
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,480
- Really?
- You're getting a good deal.

475
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,120
Give me a bag.

476
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,400
Alright, here's a bag for you.

477
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,160
Okay, thanks.

478
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,720
- Let me put it in.
- It's okay. No need to pack it.

479
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,680
Do you have a smaller one?

480
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,280
A smaller one? Okay.

481
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,560
- Just this small.
- Let me tell you about these radishes.

482
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,560
They're grown in our own garden,
sweet and crunchy.

483
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,360
Sure, they look perfect for me.

484
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,280
- Perfect.
- You came at the right time today.

485
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,800
Perfect.

486
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,720
They'll make delicious fried rice.

487
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,400
Take some.

488
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,240
Alright, alright.

489
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,560
Take a look.

490
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,320
Bean sprouts, bean sprouts.

491
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
- We have some bean sprouts as well.
- Bean sprouts.

492
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,440
Can I have a little bit?

493
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,040
Sure, sure.

494
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,200
See, I can just buy a little bit.

495
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,440
- Even this little is fine.
- You can stir-fry the bean sprouts.

496
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,720
I'll weigh it. Put them together.

497
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,840
Okay. Here.

498
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,080
Why are you only arriving now?

499
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,760
I'm sorry, dear. I'm late.

500
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
I got caught up for a while.

501
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,480
It took so long. You're really...

502
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,280
In my opinion,

503
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,320
(Notice on Miss Liu's Resignation)
Mr. Yang is really good to you.

504
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,520
You're leaving,

505
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
and yet he still wishes you the best.

506
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,840
Even through the screen,
I can sense the pleasure

507
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,240
of having such a great boss.

508
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,240
I told you, right?

509
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,360
Resigning is completely normal
in any industry.

510
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,360
It's just that you worry too much.

511
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,160
Always hesitating
and worrying about others getting hurt.

512
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,520
I told you. You were overthinking.

513
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,800
I hope that it's just me overthinking.

514
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,080
Let's go.

(Borman Counseling Center)

519
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,240
Excuse me, may
I know if you're Miss Tan?

520
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes, I am.

521
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,040
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yang.

522
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,080
Mr. Yang.

523
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,450
I've brought my best students to you.

524
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,000
Please introduce yourselves.

525
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,920
Good afternoon. My name is Zhang Ling.

526
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,920
Good afternoon. My name is Ding Enjun.

527
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,200
My name is Liu Xia.

528
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,000
Greetings, everyone. I'm Yang Youli.

529
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
Welcome to your internship.

530
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,920
Ranran, I'm home.

531
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,240
We'll chat again another time.

532
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,600
Go to bed early. Love you.

533
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
Since you're here,

534
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,440
there's something
I want to talk to you about it.

535
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,560
What is it?

536
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,560
Give me a minute.

537
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,920
For us to have an
enjoyable flat-sharing experience,

538
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,080
I think there's a need

539
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
to sign a supplementary
co-rental agreement with you.

540
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,280
Alright.

541
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,360
You also know
that it is a counseling center here.

542
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,320
During the day,

543
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,920
I'll be using it for work.

544
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,480
No problem.

545
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,040
I'm mostly asleep during the day.

546
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,040
Feel free to use it.

547
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
With your snoring,

548
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,080
do you think it
sounds like you're sleeping?

549
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,320
It sounds like you're renovating.

550
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,920
Renovating?

551
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,960
Your snoring...

552
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,280
Never mind, never mind.

553
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,440
I suggest

554
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,320
that you change your pillow

555
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
or go to the hospital
and see a pulmonologist.

556
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,800
Also,

557
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,880
when I sleep at night,

558
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,840
I often hear strange sounds
coming from your room.

559
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,720
I hope when you're writing at night,

560
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,080
you can try to keep quiet.

561
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,400
I have a very regular daily routine.

562
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,640
I go to sleep at 11:30 pm,

563
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,960
and I have to wake up at 7:30 am.

564
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,720
I can't accommodate that.

565
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,480
Can you guarantee
that you won't make any noise

566
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,680
when you're working here during the day?

567
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,080
Fine, I'll try my best.

568
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
For the water,
electricity, and internet bill,

569
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,360
we'll split them evenly.

570
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,120
I bought all these condiments
in the kitchen.

571
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,120
But if you want to use them,

572
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,000
we can split the cost as well.

573
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,840
I'll use my own condiments.

574
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,160
By the way,

575
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,560
I have to tell you.

576
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,200
I have the habit of cooking every day.

577
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,560
Sometimes I may
wake up at four or five o'clock,

578
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
so I need to use the kitchen.

579
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
If I'm not having any clients, it's fine.

580
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,800
But if I'm having
a consultation with someone,

581
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,920
I hope you can wait
in the room for a while.

582
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,240
How long do you
mean by waiting for a while?

583
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,040
I finish work
at the latest by six o'clock.

584
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,200
Six o'clock.

585
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,760
So, what you mean is,

586
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,840
I have to wait for two hours in my room

587
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,400
from four o'clock until six o'clock?

588
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,520
When we signed the co-rental agreement,

589
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,240
it was clearly stated
that from 9 am to 6 pm,

590
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,440
this living room is for my personal use.

591
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,040
So you mean that

592
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,160
if I wake up at four o'clock,

593
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,120
I can only go to the
bathroom during those two hours, right?

594
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,800
You can say it that way.

595
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,400
Fine.

596
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,040
Then let's talk about the bathroom.

597
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,160
Will your clients be using this toilet?

598
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,600
They probably will.

599
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,440
Alright.

600
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,700
Since we're discussing
this agreement now,

601
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,040
let's discuss it thoroughly.

602
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,800
One thing at a time.

603
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,560
What do you mean by "probably?"

604
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,600
That means your customers

605
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,080
will definitely use this bathroom, right?

606
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,880
If it gets dirty,
who will be cleaning it?

607
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,760
Me?

608
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,880
Are you a clean freak?

609
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,000
Well, I'm the type of person
who takes hygiene very seriously.

610
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,960
But...

611
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,840
but there are
no other bathrooms downstairs.

612
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay, you can
set this problem aside first.

613
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,320
Let's talk about other issues.

614
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,760
Regarding laundry,

615
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,280
it's just a matter of

616
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,080
who's hanging the clothes on the balcony

617
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,920
and who's hanging them indoors.

618
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Since you're a girl,

619
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,360
you can use
it first, and then I'll use it.

620
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,080
Is that okay?

621
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Do you think there's any other issue
we should pay attention to?

622
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,320
Nope.

623
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,520
Do you have anything else to add?

624
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,800
Nope.

625
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,040
Alright.

626
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll finalize the contract
and print it out.

627
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,480
Then, let's have it signed.

628
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,040
Okay.

629
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,640
I hope that during this brief period,

630
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,000
we can enjoy a pleasant collaboration.

631
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,040
Likewise.

632
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,040
This...

633
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,120
Mr. Yang.

634
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,040
Mr. Yang.

635
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,320
Are you free to

636
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,920
listen to last month's report?

637
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,920
Go ahead.

638
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,320
The number of visitors this month

639
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,040
has increased by 8%
compared to last month.

640
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,400
While the repeat visit rate

641
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,120
has increased by
12% compared to last month.

642
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,320
These two points indicate

643
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,920
that our center's social recognition
is increasing.

644
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,880
However, the customer attrition rate

645
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,720
has also been
increasing since last month.

646
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,400
I heard that

647
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Liu Xia has informed
some important clients

648
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,080
regarding her resignation in advance.

649
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,800
As for Jiang Siyan's side,

650
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,000
I heard that

651
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
they are planning
to sign a contract with Liu Xia.

652
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,400
When did this happen?

653
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,000
This afternoon.

654
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,880
Alright, you may leave first.

655
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,360
(Miss Liu)

656
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,280
(Repayment amount: 12,400
Principle owed: 2,168,350)

657
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,640
(Interest owed: 620,125)

658
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,200
Mom.

659
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,080
Darling.

660
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,200
My darling, why are you being
such a good girl today?

661
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,360
Even washing the vegetables.

662
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,840
Mom. I'm going to cook
a very delicious dish for you tonight.

663
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,840
Really?

664
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,680
Yes.

665
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,240
Thank you, darling.

666
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,960
Should I reward you?

667
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,200
It's okay, Mom.

668
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Stop washing for a while.

669
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,720
Come on.

670
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,080
Close your eyes.

671
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,720
It's so beautiful.

672
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,600
What is this?

673
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,040
This is a lucky bag that I got for you.

674
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,640
It's full of blessings inside.

675
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,440
Is it beautiful?

676
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,400
It's so pretty,

677
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,120
and it's pink.

678
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,280
Here. Let me put it on for you.

679
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,000
From now on, my darling,

680
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,560
wear this bracelet every day,

681
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,680
so it'll be like I'm by your side.

682
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,720
Blessings will surround you always.

683
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,240
Do you like it?

684
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,320
Yes.

685
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,120
Then, what should you say?

686
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,240
Thank you, Mom.

687
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,600
Shanshan.

688
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,080
Have a meal with me.

689
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,870
At my favorite noodle shop.

690
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm going out now.

691
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,160
We'll meet there, alright?

692
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
(Dongguan Noodle House)

693
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,680
What's wrong, bro?

694
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,600
Why did you call me out
at this late hour?

695
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,600
Eating alone is boring.

696
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,870
I called you to keep me company.

697
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,040
Do you want some?

698
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I've eaten.

699
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,430
How is your script writing coming along?

700
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,390
Not bad.

701
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm starting to get a hang of it.

702
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,080
Shanshan.

703
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,360
Don't make life difficult for yourself.

704
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,440
Listen to what the client wants.

705
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,280
Writing a script
is a very joyful activity.

706
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,840
The more you maintain a calm mindset,

707
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
the more you can handle it effortlessly.

708
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,800
In that case, why did you

709
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,400
give up on having that joy?

710
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,280
I'm an Aquarius.

711
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,440
Aquarius finds
joy in many aspects of life.

712
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,400
So, I entrusted the simplest way of
receiving joy in my life to you.

713
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Then, please enlighten me on

714
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,160
the other aspects
of life where you find joy.

715
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,400
Take a step at a time.

716
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:36,960
Why?

717
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,400
Do you want to
achieve everything all at once?

718
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,400
You will have a
heavy responsibility in the future.

719
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,360
Right now, I'm handing
all these things to you

720
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,560
because I want to train you.

721
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,520
Do you understand?

722
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,440
Yes.

723
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,960
It's all for my own good, right?

724
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,480
Exactly.

725
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,400
Once our script is written,

726
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,040
filmed, and broadcasted,

727
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,120
our studio will definitely
take a big step forward.

728
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,800
Look at those

729
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,120
screenwriters who debuted later than us.

730
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,680
Now, they are all successful.

731
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,480
Are we any less hardworking than them?

732
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,200
In terms of talents,

733
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,150
how many are
gifted enough to be geniuses?

734
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,880
Right?

735
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,160
We are all the same.

736
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,360
As you've said before.

737
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,640
Hard work pays.

738
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,240
Did I say that?

739
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,440
Yeah.

740
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,320
Hard work alone is not enough.

741
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,520
You also need to make
wise decisions and seize opportunities.

742
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,360
Let's go.

743
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,080
I'll show you a place.

744
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Where are we going?

745
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,720
Another type of joy.

746
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,400
Come on.

747
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,080
Oh my goodness.

748
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
Another type of joy.

749
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,740
(White House)

750
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,160
Bro.

751
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,640
Is this the place
that you wanted to show me?

752
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,240
Yeah.

753
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
What is this place?

754
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,020
It doesn't matter what place it is.

755
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,520
Take out your phone.

756
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,240
Take out your phone.

757
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,280
What for?

758
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,280
Turn on the flashlight.

759
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,840
Flashlight?

760
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Take a look.

761
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,600
This elevation.

762
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,240
The highest part there.

763
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,680
I plan to make it a common area.

764
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,200
It can be used as a working area
or a meeting room.

765
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Both are possible, right?

766
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,280
Look over there.

767
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,400
That side, do you see it?

768
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,720
That side

769
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,000
can be a conference room

770
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,160
or even a multimedia room.

771
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
We can use it for film analysis.

772
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,680
Look over there.

773
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,080
There's a spiral staircase.

774
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,360
Going up the stairs,

775
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:38,920
it'll be the second floor.

776
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,640
The second floor is also quite spacious.

777
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,720
On one side,

778
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,760
I'll make it my bedroom,

779
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,200
and on the other side, it'll be yours.

780
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,040
Then, we can

781
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,840
take a break upstairs
when we get tired from writing.

782
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,200
Fantastic, right?

783
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,080
We can stay in this building forever.

784
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,720
Truly achieving work-life balance.

785
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,520
How's my plan?

786
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,360
Hey, bro.

787
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,520
What are you doing here

788
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,240
dreaming in front of
someone else's studio  at this late hour?

789
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,360
That's true.

790
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,160
True, true.

791
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,200
I'm just imagining wildly.

792
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,640
Who knows when fortune will

793
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,560
smile upon us one day?

794
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,160
Right?

795
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,000
Let's go.

796
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,880
What's this?

797
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,120
Where did it come from?

798
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,480
I can't see it clearly.

799
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,800
Take a look,
and see what's written on it.

800
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,080
Why can't you even see clearly now?

801
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,760
Take a look.

802
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,120
House lease contract.

803
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,360
What's this?

804
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,200
(White House)

805
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,240
Isn't it here?

806
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,160
White House. No. 6-107.

807
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,040
Really?

808
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,080
Is it here?

809
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,800
What does this mean?

810
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,480
What is this?

811
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,960
You're so dumb.

812
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,000
I rented this place.

813
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,240
What?

814
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
How much does it cost?

815
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,600
Don't care about the price.

816
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,240
Yuan Yuan has paid all the money.

817
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,520
Has she paid the annual rental?

818
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,520
Why would she pay so much?

819
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,240
Are you stupid?

820
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,960
She paid quarterly.

821
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,760
But I signed a three-year contract.

822
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,960
Three years.

823
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,560
Oh my goodness.

824
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,840
Are you happy?

825
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,720
Oh, yes.

826
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,960
Wait, look at this.

827
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
The key to this place?

828
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,160
You're right!

829
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,000
You can move in at any time.

830
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,320
You don't have to
live with that woman anymore.

831
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
I don't have to live
with that woman anymore!

832
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,200
Exactly!

833
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:43,880
Bro.

834
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,760
Really?

835
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,320
Really.

836
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,320
Hurry, go inside.

837
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,080
Come, come, come.

838
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,240
You even have the key already.

839
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,280
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

840
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,880
You're so slow to understand
what I was hinting at.

841
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,960
Instantly, I felt
my mood changed completely.

842
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,600
It's completely different.

843
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,880
You're even short on words now.

844
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,560
It's so dark here.

845
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,560
I don't know
where the lights are as well.

846
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,640
Where are the lights?

847
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,800
Is this your first time here too?

848
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,800
I came here during the day.

849
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,600
Why will I come here at night?

850
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,520
I brought you here specifically

851
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,200
to let you have a look at this place
and be happy.

852
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,080
This is our place from now on.

853
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,680
Um...

854
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,360
I bought some fruit for you.

855
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,600
Thanks for your generosity.

856
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,640
I have something to tell you.

857
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,600
I've found a place to stay,

858
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,680
and I'll move out as soon as possible.

859
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,000
That's great news.

860
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,840
Yeah.

861
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,080
The mountains and rivers always meet.

862
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,320
We'll see each
other again in the future.

863
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,440
Continue your work.

864
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,060
(Prosper Like a Tree)

865
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,640
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

866
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,800
You scared me.

867
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
You're finally here.

868
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,760
Come on.

869
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,720
Hurry up.

870
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,280
Help me to keep these things.

871
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,520
We're moving.

872
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,320
We're moving tomorrow morning.

873
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,800
Moving? Where are we moving to?

874
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,920
To our new company, of course.

875
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,560
Hurry up.

876
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,840
Our new company?

877
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,200
(Prosper Like a Tree)
Isn't there a 30-day rent-free period?

878
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,000
What's the rush?

879
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
The 30-day rent-free period

880
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
is meant for productive work,

881
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,360
not to be wasted.

882
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,400
The unit was just renovated
and needs some ventilation.

883
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,240
There's such a strong smell.
It's not healthy.

884
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,160
It's okay.

885
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,960
I'll call more friends over
for a housewarming when the time comes.

886
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,920
They're all strong guys.
They inhale and the smell will be gone.

887
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,000
I think from now on,

888
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,440
you should change
your name from Jia Zhen

889
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,160
to Penny-pincher Jia.

890
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,680
You're really good at calculating.

891
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,760
Penny-pincher Jia?

892
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,520
Such a cute name.

893
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,280
Come.

894
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,160
Come.

895
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,760
Help me to wipe it clean.

896
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,200
What are you doing?

897
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,680
I need to use the bathroom.

898
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,080
I've been holding it for a while.

899
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,080
Pack all the trophies for me.

900
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,240
Not only are you Penny-pincher Jia,

901
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,480
you're also Lazy Jia.

902
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,360
You're really good at slacking off.

903
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,160
Does he have a grudge
against the keyboard?

904
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,400
One, two, three, four, five.

905
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,920
He must have gone crazy.
