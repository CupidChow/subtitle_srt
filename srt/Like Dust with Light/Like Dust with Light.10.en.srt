1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,240
Welcome

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,439
Please come in

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,760
These are our latest products.

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,480
You can try them on.

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,080
Welcome to my shop.

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,200
What would you like to buy?

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,560
You speak English?

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,560
I went to many places

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,640
and went to many places.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,280
There's more than one.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,880
I've heard about it before.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
I've long heard that

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,600
Ms. Qiao of the beauty store in Liyang is extraordinary.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,440
It's really unique.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
What is this?

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,920
I made this specially.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,440
a misty fragrance.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,200
It not only extends incense for a long time,

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,160
but not greasy at all.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,320
It tastes good.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,520
Can I spray it on you?

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,600
Of course.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,720
Not only can you spray it on your body,

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,080
you can also wear it.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,280
And the sweetfruit fragrance for women

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,960
and men's special wood fragrance.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
I have

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,200
special body scents.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,960
And...

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,360
This

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,240
It can keep fragrance on your hair for a long time.

32
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,840
Really?

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,560
Wang Lu, I want it too.

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,320
Mr. Qiao.

35
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,920
I'll buy 300,000 sets of perfume.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,240
Can I?

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,080
Of course.

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,759
You're really generous.

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Oh no!

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,240
The granary is on fire!

41
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,200
Guards!

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,479
Put out the fire!

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,880
The provisions in Changping Pass were burned.

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,759
What should we do?

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,880
Your Majesty.

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,200
Didn't Duke Zhou marry the Qiao family?

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,840
But he asked the Qiao family

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,600
Qiao Mansion has invested 100,000 taels of gold

49
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,320
to marry Duke Zhou.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,000
If I want it again,

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Your Majesty.

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
I have to say something.

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
Duke Zhou has already found out the Liusilver case

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
has something to do with Princess Consort.

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,760
but she's always covering up for her.

56
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,520
Hu...

57
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,520
[Defending]

58
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,920
and ignored the law of Liyang.

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,560
And Qiao Jiu

60
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
with Duke Zhou every day.

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,160
and stay by his side.

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,680
If this goes on,

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,800
Duke Zhou may lose his mind.

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,960
Silver chestnut

65
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,720
will not be able to get it back.

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Your Majesty.

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Now the provisions in Changping Pass are burnt.

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,360
They are surrounded by tigers and wolves.

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,240
How dare you!

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
Let Duke Zhou see me.

71
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
Father.

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,560
The Liusilver case is still unclear.

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,960
It’s my fault.

74
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,240
It has nothing to do with Qiao Jiu.

75
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,520
You are indeed bewitched by that witch.

76
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,360
Please investigate, Father.

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,320
I'm willing to vouch for Qiao Jiu as the Duke.

78
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,720
You're so stubborn.

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,960
What's the use of me taking your position?

80
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,040
Changping Pass lacks food.

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,280
It's military pay.

82
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,440
Your Majesty.

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,680
Qiao Qiao's beauty shop.

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,560
I heard you made a lot of money recently.

85
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,840
I heard you're close to the rich merchants of the Carl Clan.

86
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,280
A beauty shop.

87
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,640
and traded with foreign barbarians.

88
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,200
to close the beauty shop.

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,240
All the money you get will be confiscated.

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Definitely not.

91
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,920
Leave.

92
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,840
Let's go.

93
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,440
Let’s go.

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
What should I tell Qiao Jiu?

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,800
You can’t disobey the emperor’s order.

96
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,120
For example, this fragrance.

97
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,040
Its front and back tune are completely different.

98
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Under the order of Duke Zhou,

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
to close this shop.

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,880
Sell it.

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,880
Duke Zhou closed my shop.

102
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,280
Who does he think he is to close my shop?

103
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,000
No one can stop me.

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,680
Put it away.

105
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,200
Put it away quickly

106
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,880
Sister

107
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,800
My family

108
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Something happened at home too.

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,079
Let's go. Okay.

110
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,200
Put it down.

111
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
Zhou Yunfeng.

112
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,720
Who are you to close my beauty shop?

113
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,080
Jiu'er.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,720
The provisions in Changping Pass were burned.

115
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,200
Father...

116
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,640
What does that have to do with me?

117
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,600
The Qiao family has been

118
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,079
for the sake of Liyang State,

119
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,240
for the sake of Liyang State.

120
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,320
After I married you,

121
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
I gave you 100,000 taels of gold

122
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
I gave you another 50,000.

123
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,720
Isn't that enough?

124
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,280
Jiu'er.

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,360
Watch your mouth.

126
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,920
Soldiers of Changping Pass

127
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,960
risked their lives for Liyang State.

128
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,560
We are all people of Liyang State.

129
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
There are so many people in Liyang State.

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
Why does your father

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,200
on the Qiao family?

132
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,400
Zhou Yunfeng.

133
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,960
Let me tell you.

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,840
I...

135
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,560
Hugh.

136
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,840
Jiu'er.

137
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,080
Why did you divorce me?

138
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
You easily denied

139
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,440
are easily denied by you.

140
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
Why do I need you?

141
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,080
This is an ancient novel.

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,120
The love between a man and a woman needs twists and turns.

143
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,480
After all,

144
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,240
you don't like me being a beauty blogger.

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
In your opinion,

146
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,560
only men protect their country.

147
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,960
And my career should be sacrificed for you.

148
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
What do you mean by understanding?

149
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,320
I'm just saying.

150
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,520
You didn't support my work.

151
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,080
You've been changing my novel.

152
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,040
We have different paths. We don't plan for anything.

153
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,080
Okay.

154
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,400
Since you think so,

155
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
I'll teach you

156
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,880
what a husband is.

157
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,920
After His Majesty found out about this,

158
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
His Majesty was furious.

159
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,200
Husband?

160
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,120
How can she trample on the royal family's dignity?

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,280
Everyone in the Qiao family will be exiled to the border.

162
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,000
Father.

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,880
Please don't.

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,200
I have delivered the provisions in Changping Pass.

165
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,960
Qiao Jiu,

166
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,080
It was just a slip of the tongue.

167
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,720
You just need to send a court lady to teach her a lesson.

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,800
I

169
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,720
I will make Qiao Jiu repent.

170
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,200
Princess.

171
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm Mr. Virtuous sent by Duke Zhou.

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,600
From today onwards,

173
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,640
I will discipline your behavior and words.

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,600
Mr. Virtuous.

175
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,400
This guy...

176
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,200
Life is precious.

177
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
Love is more expensive.

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
If it's for freedom,

179
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,640
you can throw them away.

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,960
This mansion

181
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,520
Goodbye.

182
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,720
Where are you going?

183
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,280
Where am I going?

184
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,000
It's none of your business.

185
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Why can't I?

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,600
Who are you to control me?

187
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
Why do you restrict my freedom?

188
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
Because I'm your husband.

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,520
That won't do.

190
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,960
Unless...

191
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
I want it.

192
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
