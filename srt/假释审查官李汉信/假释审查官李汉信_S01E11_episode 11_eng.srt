1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,260
   

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,970
   

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,200
   

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,780
   

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,000
   

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,020
   

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,190
   

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,140
   

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,170
   

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,590
Turn off the video, turn it off!

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,130
What the... What's this?

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,400
Ji Myeong Seob!

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,350
Ji Myeong Seob, you are under emergency arrest for the murder of An Da Yun.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,390
Son Eung Jun!

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,160
You are arrested for the murder of An Da Yun.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,690
♫  No way, I know what you're going to do  ♫

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,810
♫  Whatever you’re scheming, it won’t go your way   ♫

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,940
♫  No matter where you go, you’re in the palm of my hand  ♫

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,760
♫  Like I’m putting everything  ♫

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,180
♫  You’ll have to place everything on the line  ♫

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,900
With two qualified opinions and one disqualified opinion,

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,630
Candidate 655 is granted parole.

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,890
♫  I don’t care, will you just come at me?  ♫

24
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,220
♫  I'm a megalomaniac  ♫

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,190
Yes, Seonbae.

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,570
Everything went well.

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,470
The Chief's parole was approved.

28
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,330
♫  I'm a megalomaniac. You’re going to lose so many, uh  ♫

29
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,780
Hyeong...

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,260
you passed.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,860
Hyeong, you can leave now!

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,940
- Are you sure he went in this way?
 - Yes.

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,260
When is he coming out?

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,170
There he comes.

35
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,550
You're Park Jin Cheol, right?

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,350
Yes.

37
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,820
You are under arrest for distributing drugs in a prison.

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,690
Wh-What do you mean, distributing drugs? M-Me?

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,760
Yes, we've already gathered the evidence

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,000
and we can discuss the details at the station.

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:41,020


42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,970
You're Lee Han Sin, right?

43
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,170
Oh, yes.

44
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,970
Hello, I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.

45
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,400
You'll have to come with us.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay, let's go. What is this about?

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,220
Lee Han Sin, you are under arrest for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,240
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,300
   

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,780
   

51
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,440
Man, I'm craving a drink. A strong one.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry. I came so late. I tried to rush over. I'm sorry!

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
- Why is your face so puffy?
 - Pardon?

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,880
There was a bit of a situation.

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,310
But more importantly, the chairman asked for you to visit him in prison.

56
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,180
How can he call me to prison as soon as I leave the detention center?

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,500
- Right? 
 - This is so messed up.

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,950
Let's go.

59
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,370
Gosh, damn it!

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,210
We're here for a tax evasion investigation from the Division 4 of the National Tax Service.

61
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,220
You guys were sent by Ojeong Group, right?

62
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,810
It won't be good if you act so stubbornly.

63
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,670
- Let's go.
 - Stop them from coming in!

64
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,430
Move, move!

65
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,570
A special tax audit at this timing?

66
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,840
What a joke.

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,180
They came with a purpose. They'll find fault with anything they can find.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,360
- Assistant Baek.
 - Yes.

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,910
Buy as much time as we can,

70
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,810
and tell the guys to move all of our important documents.

71
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,440
Okay.

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,470
Gosh, Ji Dong Man is trying to be clever.

73
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,670
   

74
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,910
It's impressive.

75
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,680
You don't have a single mark on your record,

76
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,460
and a clean past without a single fine or ticket issued.

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,580
I guess you managed to weasel out of it through Ojeong Group's support.

78
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,310
But that will be difficult this time.

79
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,970
What's your next step?

80
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,180
You think I would have put on a show of arresting you

81
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,240
on live TV without a next step?

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,400
Especially against Ojeong Group?

83
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,930
Yesterday was just the beginning.

84
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,080
An Da Yun,

85
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,610
Choi Jeong Hak, and maybe even Im Jeong Gyeon...

86
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,290
I'm only getting started with my investigation of Ji Myeong Seob's serial killing spree.

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,510
   

88
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,880
Seonbae, did you get anything out of him?

89
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,790
I'm sure he just insisted he doesn't remember or doesn't know anything.

90
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,510
It's obvious he won't even utter a syllable of Ji Myeong Seob's name.

91
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,410
Will you be all right?

92
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,280
All it takes to break a levee is a small hole.

93
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,270
Son Eung Jun, who's handled all of Ojeong Group's dirty work, will most likely become that hole.

94
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,200
I have to keep hitting him like today.

95
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,380
Did she hit him?

96
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,950
Attorney Lee!

97
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,010
Wait, why are you here, Attorney Lee?

98
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,610
I'll explain everything later.

99
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,370
Don't worry too much.

100
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,200
Detective Pyeon, what are his charges?

101
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,370
I can't tell you because it's Narcotics jurisdiction.

102
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,690
Narcotics? Are you saying it's a drug offense?

103
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,190
I can't tell you that.

104
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,120
Hey, Inspector An.

105
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,710
Mind your own business.

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,500
- What are you doing? Take him in.
 - Yes, sir.

107
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,260
Follow me.

108
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,450
Are you saying Attorney Lee was arrested on drug charges?

109
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,420
Ojeong Group laid the same trap as they did three years ago.

110
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,640
I'm suspended?

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,850
Are you doing this because I arrested the son of the Ojeong Group and their chief secretary?

112
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,590
Are we supposed to just sit and watch when we have the evidence?

113
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,780
If you're all that, why did you do such a thing?

114
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,850
What are you talking about─

115
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,360
Choi Hwa Ran of Smile Cash.

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,210
She's an infamous loan shark who's essentially a mob boss.

117
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,490
Do you think I don't know that you've partnered with her?

118
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,010
And what's your relationship with Attorney Lee Han Sin, who was just arrested?

119
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,260
This is a clear violation of police integrity.

120
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,460
Especially since you're currently being sued by Ojeong Group for defamation,

121
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,010
you should be grateful that

122
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,020
suspension is the only price you're paying.

123
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,820
Do you understand?

124
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,130
I've got a long way to go to catch up to you, Dad.

125
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,770
You brought up the old drug case and took care of Lee Han Sin,

126
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,420
and you took care of his helpers as well.

127
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,910
You're really the best, Dad.

128
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,660
- Do you have anything else? 
 - Pardon?

129
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,850
I'm asking if you've done anything else to get you arrested by the police like yesterday!

130
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,640
I haven't.

131
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,780
Are you sure you didn't kill Im Jeong Gyeon?

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,170
Why would I do anything to Jeong Gyeon when you said you'd take care of him, Dad?

133
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,330
Since you dug your own grave and shamed yourself publicly,

134
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,870
resign your position and leave the country immediately.

135
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,720
Dad, I really, really don't want to go overseas!

136
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I can resign, but I really don't want to go!

137
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,070
All because of you, the company's image was totally ruined,

138
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,910
and Director Son is still detained!

139
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,210
Are you still having trouble reading the room?

140
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,220
- Dad...
 - Don't complain and

141
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,750
go live there quietly until I call you back.

142
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,750
If you don't, even if you're my son, I'll─

143
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,150
Dad, Dad! I really don't want to leave!

144
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,150
I just came back!

145
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,190
I'm always alone when I leave!

146
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,350
Do you know how lonely it is?

147
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,130
I don't even have my mom!

148
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,190
I'm your son, Dad!

149
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,130
Please treat me like your son for once!

150
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,730
I don't have a single day when I'm laughing. I'm always crying!

151
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,160
How could you...

152
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,700
Mom... I don't even have a mom...

153
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,250
 How could Ji Dong Man's son be so unhappy? 

154
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,630
 How could you! 

155
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,250
Wow, what a tearjerker.

156
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,340
What screwed up the father and son duo!

157
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,110
Gosh, goodness.

158
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,880
Jeong Wuk. Why is this guy calling me constantly?

159
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,300
   

160
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,100
- I know.
 - Oh, my God!

161
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,410
You scared me!

162
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,150
How could you suddenly appear like that!

163
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,730
I made some noise.

164
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,130
I guess he keeps calling you because he's afraid he'll get arrested.

165
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,960
Arrested for what?

166
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,500
Chairman Ji heard about how Cheon Su Beom passed his parole review

167
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,850
because Director Jeong gave him a qualified opinion.

168
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,550
As soon as he heard that, he started making calls to the police station.

169
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,840
You know, there are so many reasons to put away Director Jeong.

170
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,010
By this time, he's probably been arrested.

171
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,780
Will I get caught, too?

172
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,440
"Will I get caught, too?" Doing what?

173
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,970
Did you do something wrong?

174
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,480
No, no, that's not it.

175
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,300
Your eyes are shaking.

176
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,200
Where are you going? Where are you going?

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,000
- I'm heading inside.
 - No, no.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,710
- Why?
 - It's a mess in there right now!

179
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,730
They're crying and... don't go. Don't go in there right now.

180
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,810
- Why are they crying and all?
 - Don't go in there.

181
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,970
   

182
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,900
Please don't let me lose out on the deal, if possible.

183
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,530
Have a good day.

184
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,290
Honey, it's me.

185
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,890
I put the Sammyeong-dong building up for urgent sale.

186
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,100
You take care of the property in Ilcheon.

187
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,700
No!

188
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,290
I'm telling you, we need to liquidate everything we can into cash!

189
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,980
Who are you guys?

190
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,810
Let's go.

191
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,110
No!

192
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,670
Lee Han Sin, you've been arrested for violating the Narcotics Control Act

193
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,530
and abuse of authority in connection with the

194
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,120
2022 Sangbu Prison drug smuggling case.

195
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,990
- You know that, right?
 - Yes.

196
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,000
In addition to Cheon Su Beom, who is already serving time for it,

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,120
we've gathered evidence that you and Park Jin Cheol were also involved in this case.

198
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,370
Since the statute of limitations hasn't expired yet, the warrants for your arrest were issued.

199
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,650
You understand that, right?

200
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,270
Yes.

201
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,850
Hey, Inspector An.

202
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,850
Why are you still here when you've been suspended?

203
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,330
Get out.

204
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,800
We're back!

205
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
- Great work.
 - Yes, sir.

206
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,290
Sit down.

207
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,920
Hurry up and leave.

208
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,880
Name?

209
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,370
You're Park Jin Cheol, right?

210
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,630
Aren't these all illegal documents, President Choi?

211
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,660
Shut up! They're all legal!

212
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,880
They're all legal! Legal!

213
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,930
Gosh, the more I think about it, I realize how despicable they are.

214
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,360
They're the ones who committed crimes. Why are they taking it out on us for pointing it out?

215
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,330
- Is this everything, Assistant Baek?
 - Yes.

216
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,620
- Great work.
 - Okay.

217
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,630
Oh... wait... President Choi?

218
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,980
I said, it's legal.

219
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,250
- Look...
  - Attorney Lee, who was also working as a parole examiner, 

220
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,920
 has been arrested for violating the Narcotics Control Act. 

221
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,940
 According to investigating authorities, Mr. Lee was involved 

222
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,070
 in the 2022 Sangbu Prison drug smuggling case. 

223
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,620
 After pinning all the blame on Correction Officer Cheon, 

224
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,220
 his co-worker at the prison at the time, 

225
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,000
 Lee became an attorney and also worked as a parole examiner. 

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,510
 The growing public opinion is that Mr. Lee should be fired as a parole examiner 

227
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,870
-  but also lose his attorney license. 
 - What a witch-hunt. Absurd.

228
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,900
- Ojeong Group is determined to bury him.
  - Beyond breaking the law, 

229
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,750
 many people are shocked by this breach of trust in the justice system. 

230
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,180
Corrupt and drug dealing correction officers, be gone!

231
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,620
 Be gone, be gone! 

232
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,150
Severely punish the fraud attorney who deceived the people!

233
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,850
 Punish him severely, punish him severely! 

234
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,710
Corrupt and drug dealing correction officers, be gone!

235
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,340
 Be gone, be gone! 

236
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,000
Severely punish the fraud attorney who deceived the people!

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,730
 Punish him severely, punish him severely! 

238
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,660
Punish him severely, punish him severely!

239
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,340
 Punish him severely, punish him severely! 

240
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,420
Punish him severely, punish him severely!

241
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,900
 Punish him severely, punish him severely! 

242
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,440
- Assistant Baek.
 - Yes?

243
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,760
Those guys are doing that and getting paid by Ojeong Group, right?

244
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,860
The organization leading the protest is famous for staging protests for money.

245
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,660
Inspector An, Ojeong Group is responsible for Attorney Lee's arrest, right?

246
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,110
Yes. They dug up the evidence they had fabricated three years ago to frame Chief Cheon

247
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,720
and unleashed it all at once in a media offensive.

248
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,440
Is Attorney Lee allowed to have visitors?

249
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,070
No. I believe he'll be stuck in the interrogation room all day today.

250
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,600
Punish him severely, punish him severely!

251
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,480
Punish him severely, punish him severely! Punish him severely!

252
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,500
   

253
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,130
   

254
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,720
Geez, I've got a lot on my mind! Why do you keep calling me!

255
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,250
Video?

256
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,860
He told me to find out everywhere you went after you came back.

257
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,010
 Also, he said to check your phone for any audio recordings─ 

258
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,620
Oh, hello. Good to see you.

259
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,780
And he told me to get the videos.

260
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:23,000
I've looked for video evidence of cheating while handling divorce cases, but I've never...

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,680
I changed my phone recently, so there's nothing on it.

262
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,670
If you don't believe me, come and get it!

263
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,540
Gosh, so annoying.

264
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,340
This asshole says what he wants and hangs up when I'm not done!

265
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,840
This crazy bastard! He's just like his dad!

266
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,610
 I've looked for video evidence of cheating while handling divorce cases, but I've never... 

267
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,810
 Hey, stop being a nuisance 

268
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,270
 and drink your alcohol without causing trouble. 

269
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:04,050
 If you keep this up, things could all go downhill in an instant, like in the past. 

270
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,130
 You crazy bastard! How could you kill someone? 

271
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,390
 It's not a big deal. 

272
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,290
 I was just a bit unlucky. 

273
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,120
 It's not a big deal? 

274
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,490
 Director Son is going through hell trying to clean up your mess! 

275
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,430
 So, he just needs to clean it up properly! 

276
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,870
 You still haven't come to your senses yet? 

277
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,300
 Damn it! 

278
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,280
 Geez, this bastard! 

279
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,500
The day I took this video...

280
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,680
was the day Myeong Seob committed murder.

281
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,260
Myeong Seob is wearing the same clothes!

282
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,380
Why are you here!

283
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,680
 Open the door. 

284
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,320
Hey, go away!

285
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,710
Open the door!

286
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,420
Should I cause a fuss here?

287
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,420
Open the door.

288
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,560
Go away!

289
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,680
 I said, open the door! 

290
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,390
What do you have to say? Say it from there and leave.

291
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,190
Why would you go in there?

292
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,480
Wow, it's fancy here.

293
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,660
Is this your reward for putting up with an old man for a year?

294
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,530
Alimony investment?

295
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,350
I didn't receive a single penny of alimony.

296
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,230
Really? You must feel wronged, then.

297
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,360
I told you we should get revenge together!

298
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,860
Why should I trust you?

299
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,520
You don't have to trust me.

300
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,090
Just hand over the video.

301
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,170
Video? What video?

302
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,740
The videos you took every time Dad beat you, to use against him for divorce.

303
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,280
Oh, I see.

304
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,410
Is that the reason why you kept coming over?

305
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,660
You took a video that day, too, right?

306
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,780
Give me the video.

307
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,930
I really don't know what you're talking about.

308
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,750
I really don't have it! I mean it.

309
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,870
- I don't have it.
 - What? No, no, no.

310
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,850
- I'll check for myself.
 - I don't have it!

311
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,800
- I'll check for myself.
 - Who says you can check?

312
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,060
You said you don't have it.

313
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,950
- Fine, check for yourself.
 - I will.

314
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,130
"Don't ever erase this file."

315
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,910
I'll just check this file titled "Don't ever erase this file."

316
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,620
 Leo, what are you doing? 

317
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,090
 Gosh, Leo, you just peed! Great job! 

318
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,680
 Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo. Good job! 

319
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,930
Where's the video?

320
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,450
I really don't have it!

321
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,620
Where is the video?

322
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,570
I don't have it! I really don't have it!

323
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,190
Where is the video?

324
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,460
Yeah, I recorded those videos to get a divorce.

325
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,320
I erased them all after I got my divorce.

326
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,280
You mean that?

327
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,480
It makes me so mad just thinking about it.

328
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,190
Why would I keep stuff like that?

329
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,910
You better have erased it.

330
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,630
You know I kill people, right?

331
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,240
Hey, get out of here now.

332
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Get out!

333
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,450
Choi Won Mi... whoa.

334
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,100
Your acting is awesome.

335
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,700
I really thought I was getting caught.

336
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,770
Wow, if I acted like this, I would have gone to the Academy Awards. Right?

337
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,940
I'm so scared.

338
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,640
Leo. Your mom thought she was going to die.

339
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,190
I'm sick of pork.

340
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,370
Aren't you going to eat?

341
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,090
I ate already.

342
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,330
Seonbae, come out now.

343
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,930
Thank you.

344
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,330
   

345
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,630
Attorney Lee.

346
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,880
Yes, Inspector.

347
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,140
Do you need anything?

348
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,810
I don't.

349
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,430
Oh, how's Jin Cheol?

350
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,000
   

351
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,590
Park Jin Cheol, you admit to all the charges now, right?

352
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,300
Keeping silent won't resolve this situation, you know.

353
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,880
How's the situation outside?

354
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,810
It seemed like there was something on the news earlier.

355
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:06,930
They are launching a massive media campaign to divert public attention away from Ji Myeong Seob's murder case.

356
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,150
They are vilifying you with provocative keywords

357
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:17,200
such as "drug dealing correction officer" and "fraud attorney."

358
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,670
In a few days, both of you will be moved to a detention center.

359
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,540
We have President Choi, and Chief Cheon should be released soon.

360
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,370
So we'll look for a way.

361
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,430
Don't overdo it.

362
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,600
Chairman Ji may try to harm you.

363
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,160
 I'm always alone overseas! 

364
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,340
 Do you know how lonely it is? 

365
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,170
 I don't even have my mom! 

366
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,040
 I'm your son, Dad! 

367
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,630
 Please treat me like your son for once! 

368
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,900
 How could Ji Dong Man's son be so unhappy? 

369
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,130
 - Goodbye.
 - Bye now. 

370
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,730
 Please go in. 

371
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,920
 Myeong Seob, stand tall. 

372
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,800
 You didn't do anything wrong. 

373
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,700
 They were overreacting over a little fistfight between boys. 

374
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,340
 - Dad.
 - Yeah? 

375
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,640
 What if I go to prison? 

376
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,730
 Prison is where people with no money or power go. 

377
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,780
 I'll give you everything for your future, Myeong Seob. 

378
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,810
 Don't worry about anything and do whatever you want. It's okay. 

379
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,080
 Dad! 

380
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,500
 Yeah, yeah. 

381
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,830
 Let's go. I'll buy you your favorite tonkatsu, Myeong Seob. 

382
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,880
 Let's go. Get inside. 

383
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,440
 Cheon Su Beom. 

384
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,310
 You're doing this because you're angry about Cheon Su Beom. 

385
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,980
 It's all in the past. 

386
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,730
 Nothing is more foolish than ruining your life over the past─ 

387
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,630
 So, you know. 

388
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,820
 That's why I'll see it 

389
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,860
 to the end. 

390
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,280
   

391
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,700
   

392
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:21,720
   

393
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,410
Father.

394
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,160
Chief Cheon Su Beom.

395
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,470
I came at the request of Attorney Lee Han Sin.

396
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,710
I'm Inspector An Seo Yun.

397
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,320
Drug dealer!

398
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,290
   

399
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,070
I guess people came by.

400
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,300
Mr. Hwang.

401
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,430
Oh, you're here, Inspector An.

402
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,980
Chief Cheon Su Beom, you've gone through a lot.

403
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,110
I definitely cleaned up everything before I went home last night,

404
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,300
but I guess people came by early this morning.

405
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,480
Gosh, you should look where you're going.

406
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,560
Both your eyes and legs are loose.

407
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,820
Did you take drugs?

408
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,820
Hey, I heard you're a drug-dealing correction officer.

409
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,390
Do you have any drugs on you?

410
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,080
Give me some.

411
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
- Give me some.
 - Share some with us.

412
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,300
- I said, give me some!
 - Give me.

413
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,270
Article 6 of the Correction Officer's Duty Regulations!

414
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,910
Restraining acts that undermine the purpose of detention

415
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,030
such as the escape of detainees, disturbances, and assaults

416
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,620
must take precedence over all other duties!

417
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,200
You guys are currently neglecting your duties.

418
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,390
Honestly, we're also human, so we do have negative feelings toward you.

419
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,800
That's why we turned a blind eye.

420
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,310
You brought shame to your hubaes with this incident.

421
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,240
I can't even tell anyone I'm a correction officer anymore.

422
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,590
Correction Officer Kim Hyeong Sik. At the very least,

423
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,870
you shouldn't have prejudices against detainees waiting for trial.

424
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,710
Also, don't be swayed by your emotions.

425
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,050
A correction officer who is swayed by emotions

426
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,000
needs to quit his job.

427
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,340
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

428
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,060
Don't be.

429
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,330
I'm paying for my crime like this.

430
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,430
You know I can't be free from incidents relevant to Ojeong Group.

431
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,650
Also, considering Hae Seong's surgery from way back then.

432
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,480
Chief Cheon is probably out by now, right?

433
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,500
Yes, Inspector An said she was going to pick him up.

434
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,940
Because of the Ojeong Group bastards,

435
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,190
I worry about him even when he's released.

436
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,180
It's the other way around.

437
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,990
Ojeong Group is the one who should worry about Chief Cheon's release.

438
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,640
I will proactively seek a retrial.

439
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,110
The reason Chairman Ji Dong Man kept me isolated in prison

440
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,660
was to prevent a retrial.

441
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,280
Oh, that's why Attorney Lee rushed to apply for a retrial.

442
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,630
If Chief Cheon seeks a retrial while the statute of limitations is still valid,

443
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,040
there is a higher chance of a re-investigation in the Sangbu Prison drug case.

444
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,470
That would shake up the Ojeong Group greatly

445
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,050
and increase the likelihood of Attorney Lee and Chief Park's release.

446
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:29,200
Isn't public opinion a major factor in a retrial?

447
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,180
We're up against a bad public opinion right now.

448
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,090
We'll have to fight fire with fire.

449
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,740
With a large flame that's extremely hot and bright.

450
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,870
If I step into the forefront of the media battle,

451
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,720
it would be the most uncomfortable scenario for Ojeong Group.

452
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,380
Of course, they'll try their best to stop me.

453
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,260
Then how about we get rid of them quickly?

454
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,070
Let's make a plan while Ji Dong Man is still in prison,

455
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,460
and quickly flip the public opinion to our side, no?

456
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,200
But...

457
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,260
they were both released today.

458
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,340
Ji Dong Man and Son Eung Jun.

459
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,600
Both of them.

460
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,440
What?

461
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,150
Pardon?

462
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,760
Director Son!

463
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,440
Aigoo, your face has gotten so gaunt in just a few days.

464
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,930
Did you suffer a lot while you were detained? What?

465
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,850
Why don't you respond when I'm talking to you?

466
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,980
Aigoo, do you know how much trouble my legal team and I went through

467
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,400
because your face was caught clearly

468
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,820
in that video that was played at the press conference, Director Son?

469
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,150
We barely got you released by posting bail and having a surety.

470
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,920
You have to lie low for now because you're under noncustodial investigation status.

471
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,470
You have to be careful.

472
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,500
If I say something to you, you should respond.

473
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,080
How's Chairman?

474
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,220
Chairman has already been released

475
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,020
early this morning while it was still dark.

476
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,270
Everything was taken care of right away when he contacted the higher-ups.

477
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,150
Maybe it's because it's the election season.

478
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,830
South Korea is a good place to live as long as you have money.

479
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,480
No, it's a good place to live for only those with money.

480
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,220
 The presidential office revealed that there was a special pardon. 

481
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,110
 The working class and small business owners are candidates for this special pardon. 

482
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,240
 Several financial offenders, including Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man... 

483
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,310
 Four businessmen, including Chairman Ji Dong Man... 

484
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:40,530
 Government officials said that this pardon was granted to promote societal integration and harmony. 

485
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:45,890
 They emphasized the hopes that they will contribute to an economic revival after their release. 

486
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,850
   

487
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:24,270
I guess you moved the higher-ups in power because you couldn't get out by parole.

488
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,280
But I had no idea you would leave by special pardon.

489
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,180
Attorney Lee.

490
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,050
Do you know what's all the way up on top?

491
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,380
Above the law, above people, there's money.

492
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,650
It's an unchanging fact that you can do anything you want,

493
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,290
as long as you have money.

494
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:52,300
So, you're staging a witch hunt after buying

495
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,400
the media with your money?

496
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,110
If it was up to me,

497
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:02,320
I would hang you in the middle of Gwanghwamun* and set you on fire. 
 (Main gate of Gyeonbok Palace.) 

498
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:09,370
Attorney Lee, did you know that Inspector An was suspended?

499
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:14,390
It seems that you didn't know that loan shark Choi Hwa Ran

500
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,960
was hit with a tax investigation and closed her business.

501
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,760
I hear that these pathetic losers are

502
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,480
gathering in your office, including Cheon Su Beom, who was released.

503
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,820
Now that I'm out of prison,

504
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,710
you will never be able to leave this place.

505
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:39,110
Cheon Su Beom won't succeed in his retrial, either.

506
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,850
I hope you realize

507
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,970
how insignificant you are while you are rotting in prison.

508
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,200
Who knows?

509
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,590
Maybe I'll have you released on parole

510
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,040
for old-time's sake.

511
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,990
Seeing you act like this, I think getting arrested was a good thing.

512
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,760
The upcoming events won't go as you want it to.

513
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,040
Absolutely not.

514
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,200
   

515
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,030
To tell you the truth, Han Sin already expected all this.

516
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,630
 Chairman Ji Dong Man may end up leaving prison through a special pardon. 

517
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,700
 Ji Dong Man will leave through a special pardon? 

518
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,250
 Yes. Since I keep stopping his parole release, 

519
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,490
 he'll try to move the higher-ups instead of the Correctional Services. 

520
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,750
 But I don't know if that's possible... 

521
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,190
 We live in a world where anything is possible with money and power. 

522
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,760
 Also, Chairman Ji Dong Man will try to immobilize me by having me arrested. 

523
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,410
 What do you mean, have you arrested? For what crime? 

524
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,580
 If he wanted to, he could probably find something to charge me with. 

525
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,450
 But if that's the case, I hope I end up getting framed for the same thing as you, Chief. 

526
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,590
 So, Ji Dong Man traps himself. 

527
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,170
Now, we must make Ji Dong Man pay for the disaster he has brought upon himself.

528
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,600
To do so, you would have to stand before the public, Chief Cheon.

529
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,770
Are you okay with that?

530
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,810
I'm fine.

531
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:40,530
It's my turn to speak up for Han Sin and Jin Cheol.

532
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,880
Still, Chief, you have your family. Will you be okay?

533
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,480
They'll probably understand my convictions.

534
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,560
Then, can we finally fight back against Ojeong Group?

535
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,950
We, eggs, can finally get together and throw ourselves*. 
  (Referring to a Korean adage) 

536
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,700
Yes, let's give it a go!

537
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,870
Gosh, it's been a while since I felt such a rush.

538
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,050
Yes, Chief. I'm Choi Hwa Ran.

539
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,040
You don't need to worry about your family.

540
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,720
I'll place men on them to protect them.

541
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,200
Yes, I have faith in you.

542
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,430
Yes. Fighting!

543
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,060
Fighting, fighting!

544
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,790
Oh, Chief, you're handsome.

545
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,040
Let's go inside.

546
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,540
Yes?

547
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,420
Why did you suddenly hit me?

548
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,050
What were you doing while Myeong Seob was up to no good, like the press conference?

549
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,470
The executive director was so determined to do it, so─

550
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,790
Aigoo, you lazy bastard!

551
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,740
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.

552
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,500
Is Director Son not out yet?

553
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,190
No, we got him out, but he's under noncustodial investigation status.

554
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,690
I told him to avoid coming to the company for the time being.

555
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,970
How's the reaction to the news slandering Lee Han Sin, and the protests attacking him?

556
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,850
The public is reacting very passionately.

557
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,220
- But Chairman.
 - What?

558
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,380
It's just that if you keep digging into Lee Han Sin like this,

559
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:51,320
won't that case we barely managed to bury keep resurfacing

560
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,570
and negatively impact Executive Director?

561
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,570
The media, the prosecutors, the police,

562
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,760
and all of South Korea is under the influence of money from Ji Dong Man. Why worry?

563
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,870
- You're right.
 - Can't you tell by how I got out?

564
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,300
- Yes...
 - I can keep all that under control,

565
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,310
so just shut up and do your job.

566
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,620
Okay. Got it.

567
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,460
By the way, where is Myeong Seob right now?

568
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,230
Gosh, who is it!

569
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,250
Dad, why did you do that?

570
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,500
Seeing how wasted you are, you still haven't come to your senses.

571
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,090
Should I just send you to prison?

572
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:56,220
You wouldn't even let me go outside. What do you want from me?

573
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,410
Wake up.

574
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,740
The reason you're safe, even after killing someone,

575
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,660
is all thanks to the power I've amassed.

576
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,960
I told you before that prison is where powerless people go.

577
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,220
I'm saying you're a worthless bastard without me.

578
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:21,480
So, lie low and obey me while I give you the chance.

579
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,670
You got that?

580
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,380
Please sign the petition for a retrial.

581
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,000
Please help us clear a wrongly accused correction officer's name!

582
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Help us!

583
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,380
Please sign the petition for a retrial.

584
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,590
- The true culprit is in the Ojeong Group!
 - He's in Ojeong Group!

585
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:12,960
Do you remember the prison drug case involving Lee Han Sin,

586
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,270
who was blasted by the media as a drug dealing correction officer and fraud attorney?

587
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,160
I will announce the truth and the true culprit behind that case today.

588
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,340
Please help us clear a wrongly accused correction officer's name!

589
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,810
Suddenly, there are more people here.

590
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah, I'm surprised, too.

591
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,810
But supposedly, he's a star reporter with a fandom.

592
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,800
Reporter Wu? I think it's thanks to him.

593
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,470
Oh, he's handsome.

594
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,010
But it would be easier to gather people if he aired this

595
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:47,700
on TV news on major broadcasting channels instead of his YouTube channel.

596
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,440
I know.

597
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,750
But nearly all the media companies were paid off by the Ojeong Group,

598
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,110
and I heard that Reporter Wu's company also blocked it when he mentioned Ojeong Group.

599
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,190
I knew it.

600
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,240
Still, this grassroots approach to spreading info like wildfire

601
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,870
is an effective method as well.

602
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,490
Hey, what's that? Is that a refill of the petitions?

603
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,060
Pardon? Oh, yes.

604
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,190
Give it to me. I'll give it to them.

605
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,350
Will you be okay?

606
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,930
I'm Choi Hwa Ran! Come on!

607
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,420
- Pass it to me.
 - I don't think you'll be okay...

608
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,260
Hurry up and pass it to me.

609
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,530
Assistant Baek. Take this.

610
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,110
Eun Ji, your throat's getting dry, right? Have some candy.

611
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,260
Bear and rabbit couple!

612
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,800
Stop flirting and focus on the petitions! Okay?

613
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,000
Assistant Baek, smile. You're going to scare people away.

614
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,470
- Reporter Wu?
 - Yes?

615
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,960
Hello. I'm Choi Hwa Ran.

616
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,100
Oh, thank you.

617
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:58,270
Everyone! Please sign the petition for a re-investigation of the Sangbu Prison drug case!

618
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,860
Please come and sign it!

619
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:11,930
Do you remember the prison drug case involving Lee Han Sin, who was blasted

620
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,960
by the media as a drug dealing correction officer and fraud attorney?

621
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,640
 Someone to expose the truth and the true culprit of that case has requested an interview. 

622
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,390
 - Hello.
 - The ex-correction officer at Sangbu Prison... 

623
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:29,030
 I'm Cheon Su Beom, who was wrongly accused of smuggling drugs into Sangbu Prison. 

624
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,480
 Ojeong Group used their money and power 

625
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,990
 to fabricate all the circumstances of the case 

626
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,260
 - and framed an innocent man as a criminal.
- Correction Officer Cheon Su Beom declared his innocence... 

627
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,950
 and revealed Ojeong Group was behind the crime. 

628
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,570
 The one who actually did drugs in the prison at the time 

629
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,680
 was the heir to Ojeong Group, Ji Myeong Seob! 

630
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,540
 Why do you think Ojeong Group decided to frame you? 

631
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,220
-  Did they have a personal grudge against you? 
 - Will this do anything?

632
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,000
 It's because I stopped Ji Myeong Seob's parole release. 

633
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,500
 Ojeong─ 

634
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,120
Let's get drunk!

635
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,800
- She's here!
 - Oh, what's this?

636
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,900
- Yeah!
 - I wanted to talk to you.

637
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,640
How could you be drunk already?

638
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,110
I'm not drunk. I'm perfectly fine.

639
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,890
- You're absolutely drunk. As if.
 - I'm not, I'm not.

640
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,800
It's because you didn't have any food.

641
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,820
I don't deserve to eat it. Supposedly, I'm a lazy bastard.

642
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,360
- Who said that?
 - Who do you think?

643
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,600
- Chairman Ji?
 - Yes! That's right!

644
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,140
They say old habits die hard. I see he still speaks rudely.

645
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,500
Hey, he's worse than a dog, so just ignore him.

646
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,360
What the... Gosh, seriously.

647
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:02,170
So, what did you want to talk about that you asked to meet?

648
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,400
I asked to meet because...

649
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,890
You can tell me openly.

650
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,260
- Will my Attorney Lee...
 - "My Attorney Lee"?

651
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,280
be able to come out of prison?

652
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,930
- He will.
 - But Ji Dong Man will try to stop it.

653
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,040
Yeah, he will try to stop it.

654
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,890
Have you seen the movie "Titanic"?

655
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,120
I have.

656
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,050
You saw it? Then let me tell you this.

657
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:28,710
From what I can see, Ojeong Group is so similar to the sinking Titanic.

658
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,720
There are so many holes in the ship

659
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,350
that water is pouring in from the outside.

660
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,270
From what I can tell, it's very close to sinking.

661
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,050
As soon as another hole appears,

662
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:48,340
it's just going to sink.

663
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,450
- Just one more hole, I see.
 - Yeah.

664
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,850
As it sinks...

665
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,050
- You need to come.
 - I'm sorry...

666
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,390
You're not coming? You need to come to me.

667
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,570
Come.

668
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,120
- Just go over there.
 - Come.

669
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,140
- Go away.
 - Just give me a hug!

670
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,950
 We report him, we report him! 

671
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,650
 Corrupt Chairman Ji Dong Man! 

672
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,850
We report Ji Dong Man!

673
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,740
 We report him, we report him! 

674
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,440
We demand the truth regarding the drug case, Ojeong Group!

675
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,470
 We demand it, we demand it! 

676
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,530
We demand a re-investigation of the Sangbu Prison drug case!

677
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,700
 We demand it, we demand it! 

678
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,970
 Corrupt Chairman Ji Dong Man! We report Ji Dong Man! 

679
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:36,740
Chairman.

680
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,090
Why is it so noisy outside?

681
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,890
Do a better job of media control!

682
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,800
I'm sorry. I blocked all the mainstream media outlets,

683
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,760
but I wasn't able to stop this well after it started flaring up

684
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,480
from social media and internet news sites. I'm sorry.

685
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,250
What happened to Warden Bae and Jeong Wuk, who are helping Cheon Su Beom's retrial?

686
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,310
Well, I can't get in contact with Warden Bae all of a sudden.

687
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,400
What?

688
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,220
 Maybe he decided to betray you and side with Lee Han Sin. 

689
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,130
 He suddenly resigned right after your release 

690
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,530
 and went into hiding somewhere. 

691
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,690
 He even canceled his phone 

692
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,950
 and sent his family on a long-term trip abroad. 

693
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,400
 It appears he's determined to stay hidden. 

694
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,660
When is that guy coming?

695
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,240
What's there for us to talk about?

696
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,670
Warden Bae, that ungrateful bastard.

697
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:32,250
What about Director Jeong?

698
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,720
Did you call for me?

699
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,760
You'll keep your promise of cutting off contact with Ojeong Group

700
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,670
and helping Cheon Su Beom's retrial, right?

701
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,880
Yes, of course.

702
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,480
Of course, you will.

703
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,720
If you want your money back, you have no other choice.

704
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,860
Then, fill this sheet out with sincerity.

705
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,590
Okay.

706
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,930
With sincerity.

707
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,810
Okay. With sincerity.

708
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,270
These bastards dare betray me together?

709
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,870
It's a bit early to say for sure that they betrayed you.

710
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,800
I've got a bad feeling about this.

711
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,270
- Call the Captain of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.
 - Okay.

712
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,660
If Lee Han Sin's investigation goes wrong, we'll be in big trouble.

713
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,300
- What's this about?
 - We received a report.

714
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,480
We're from the inspection department.

715
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,930
Please cooperate with the inspection of your vehicle.

716
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,690
I don't know who reported that you're doing this.

717
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,310
Why are you doing this?

718
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,190
I said, there's nothing in my car!

719
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,700
I found it.

720
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,180
This watch was a birthday gift─

721
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,760
It's a watch that would be perfect as a bribe.

722
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,040
   

723
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,980
 Seonbae, I caught him red-handed. 

724
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,370
Accepting bribes and leaking info on investigations...

725
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,960
Isn't that what would really violate police integrity?

726
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,270
Hey, An Seo Yun! Do you have evidence?

727
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,210
Can you tell us where you got that watch from?

728
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,580
Can you guarantee that there are no traces of Ojeong Group

729
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,490
in your call history or your bank account details, Captain?

730
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:14,270
We'll find out everything once we investigate. Let's go inside and talk.

731
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,920
Hey, take him in.

732
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,770
Wait, wait! An Seo Yun!

733
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,110
Are you taking revenge on me for getting you suspended?

734
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:24,530
Hey, you bastard!

735
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,540
Gosh, it feels like a weight has been lifted from me.

736
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,300
When they investigate the captain, they'll find out the disciplinary action was unjust.

737
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,320
I think your suspension will be lifted soon, Seonbae.

738
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,460
It finally feels refreshing.

739
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,620
These are the documents that will prove that defendants Lee Han Sin and Park Jin Cheol

740
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,640
are innocent regarding the 2022 Sangbu Prison drug smuggling case.

741
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,910
 The prosecutor in charge of the case 

742
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,330
 submitted a handwritten confession, stating case manipulation and acceptance of bribes. 

743
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,770
We've already filed a motion for cancellation of detention with the court.

744
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,720
I'm sorry, but doing this won't work.

745
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,380
Hello. Oh, hello!

746
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,020
Oh, you're here!

747
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,160
Hello! Lee Han Sin, Lee Han Sin.

748
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,650
So, I am Jungbu Prison's warden,

749
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:19,840
no, ex-warden, Bae Han Seong.

750
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,060
 You wouldn't even know if someone kidnapped you! 

751
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,630
 How could you get so scared? It's not like I'm a ghost. 

752
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,240
 Gosh, you scared me. 

753
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,230
 Gosh, what's there to talk about that you'd come like this? 

754
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:37,540
 How did you betray the Chairman when you're such a scaredy-cat? 

755
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,520
 You can't sleep at night, right? 

756
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,630
 Did Ji Dong Man say something? 

757
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,230
 You traitor. 

758
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,560
 Since you're betraying him anyway, how about you betray him properly? 

759
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,400
 - Properly? 
- Yeah. 

760
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,640
 How about you make a huge hole, 

761
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,030
 so it completely sinks? 

762
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,300
So, Warden Bae was the actual accomplice to that drug case─

763
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,710
No, I wasn't! What do you mean, accomplice?

764
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,370
That's not it.

765
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:16,070
I was tricked by Ojeong Group into their trap. I'm a victim!

766
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,220
Oh, never mind. In any case,

767
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:22,310
I will testify to everything that took place

768
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,790
and receive the punishment I deserve for my crimes.

769
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,530
Hey, everyone! Breaking news!

770
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,590
The captain was taken to the Inspection Office.

771
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:33,630
What?

772
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:38,550
He supposedly leaked investigation info to Ojeong Group in exchange for bribes!

773
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,330
It's so embarrassing! How could he as a police officer?

774
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,170
It's Ojeong Group, it's Ojeong Group, right?

775
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,190
I told you, it's Ojeong Group!

776
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,690
Oh, no, what do we do?

777
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:53,050
Inspector An Seo Yun must be so upset!

778
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,520
Aigoo, "All of South Korea is under the money influence of Ji Dong Man. Why worry?"

779
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:02,680
Give me a break. That sleazy Captain of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit was taken in, too.

780
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,620
It feels like it's sinking slowly.

781
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,400
Titanic, you bastards!

782
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,880
Hello.

783
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,460
Slowly sinking,

784
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,090
slowly sinking.

785
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:26,170
- Chairman.
 - I put Lee Han Sin in prison as planned,

786
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,410
but the situation seems inauspicious.

787
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,580
I'll head straight to the company─

788
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,200
 No, you don't need to do that. 

789
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,980
You heard what Attorney Seo said, right?

790
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,680
You need to lie low because you're under noncustodial investigation status.

791
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,970
 It's best for you and Myeong Seob not to come near the company for the moment. 

792
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,010
Okay, Chairman.

793
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,690
   

794
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,430
Detainee 3321, you have a visitor.

795
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,960
This is unexpected.

796
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,540
The place and time, and the visitor.

797
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,420
What brings you here?

798
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,600
Why did you pick a fight with Ojeong Group with barely passable evidence

799
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,380
that Ojeong Group's legal team can easily flick away.

800
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,540
I was curious.

801
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,610
Are you confident you'll win?

802
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,390
I'm not fighting because I am confident of winning.

803
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:39,900
I'm fighting because I must bring Ojeong Group down.

804
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,930
Attorney Lee,

805
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:45,440
do you think Cheon Su Beom is worth

806
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,800
putting your own life on the line?

807
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,570
What about you, Director?

808
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,220
Is Ojeong Group worth that much?

809
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:00,300
Enough for you to take all the blame for its crimes?

810
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,510
   

811
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,000
Han Sin!

812
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,130
- You've gone through a lot.
 - Chief.

813
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,330
- Congratulations.
 - Congratulations.

814
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,610
- Oh, thank you.
 - Thank you.

815
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,490
You all must be busy. Why'd you come out all this way?

816
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,160
What are you saying? Of course, we should come.

817
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,760
But I think it's too early to let our guard down.

818
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,240
Though you were released on a cancellation of detention decision, the investigation isn't over yet.

819
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,330
Still, once Chief Cheon wins the retrial,

820
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,790
the case will close with them being declared innocent.

821
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,600
Right now, the public opinion is favorable, right?

822
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,140
Yes, that's right.

823
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,520
There's even an open chatroom with the name Ogyopa,

824
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,410
short for "Let's Expose the Correctional Services Corruption of Ojeong Group."

825
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,000
Attorney Lee.

826
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,190
- Attorney!
 - Attorney Lee Han Sin!

827
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,950
- Please give a statement. 
 - Say something.

828
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,460
Let me ask you a question.

829
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,290
Is it true that you're innocent regarding the Sangbu Prison drug smuggling case?

830
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,740
Is it true that Ojeong Group manipulated the case at the time?

831
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:19,500
- Please give us a statement.
 - Please!

832
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,260
Attorney Lee Han Sin, while you were a parole examiner,

833
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,250
you stopped Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole twice.

834
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:30,040
Do you think this was an act of retribution for that?

835
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,680
 Please give us a statement. Please give us a response. 

836
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,160
 Just one statement. Please look this way as well. 

837
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes. I was unjustly detained despite not committing any crimes.

838
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,020
Meanwhile, Chairman Ji Dong Man, who even committed jailbreak during his sentence,

839
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,490
was released on a special pardon.

840
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:54,000
However, it won't be long now.

841
00:58:55,350 --> 00:59:00,150
The truth that Ojeong Group covered up and buried with their money and power...

842
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:05,430
That truth will soon be exposed...

843
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,340
for all to see.

844
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,480
He's become a celebrity.

845
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,960


846
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,600
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

847
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,890
♫  You’re going to lose so many, uh  ♫

848
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:39,290
♫  Cover your eyes and hide  ♫

849
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,090
♫  I’ll show you  ♫

850
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,900
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

851
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,980
♫  You don’t deserve what you own now  ♫

852
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,450
♫  You can push me away and try to hold me off  ♫

853
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:53,840
♫  It won't work on me, Megalomaniac  ♫

854
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:59,280
♫  I'll give up anything. There’s only one thing I want  ♫

855
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,160
♫  Come on, bring it on, until the end  ♫

856
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,840
   

857
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,720
 Preview 
The public opinion has completely shifted. 

858
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,220
 Will you go to prison instead, Director Son? 

859
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:14,400
 I have something deadly and dangerous. 

860
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,780
 I'm going to lure Ji Dong Man. 

861
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,750
 No matter how much I think about it, this is too dangerous. 

862
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,200
 Hurry up and clear these guys. 

863
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,250
 I can't leave him alone anymore. I'll need to see to his end. 

864
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,690
 So, how does it feel? 

865
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,210
 Are you threatening me right now? 

866
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:28,350
 Eung Jun, I'm asking you this. 

867
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,110
 I'll take care of him and go to prison, Chairman. 

868
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,000
 I'm planning to go today for a final showdown 

869
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,180
 Aren't you curious how things will end?
