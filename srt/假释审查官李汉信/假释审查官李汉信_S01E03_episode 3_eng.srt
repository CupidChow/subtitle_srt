1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,210
   

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,960
   

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,110
   

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,790
   

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,930
   

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,950
   

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,030
   

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,970
   

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,010
   

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,820
 - Release him, release him!
 - We oppose, we oppose! 

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,070
We have decided to...

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,910
suspend Candidate 177's parole review.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,020
Hey, you bastard!

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,960
Are you crazy? You bastard!

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,190
Do you want to die?

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,140
Do you think you'll be safe after this?

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,960


18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,260
   

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Moving on to the next news.

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,930
Ojeong Group CEO Ji Dong Man's parole release was canceled.

21
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,360
 The Ministry of Justice's Parole Review Committee held a closed meeting at the Sangbu Government Complex in Seoul at 2 p.m. today. 

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,850
-  After an intense debate, they decided to  
- You go ahead.

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,650
 suspend CEO Ji's parole review. 

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,430
 The reason for suspending CEO Ji Dong Man's parole is not yet known. 

25
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,760
 CEO Ji Dong Man will be reexamined for parole next month and if he receives a qualified opinion, 

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,740
 - he will be released on December 31st.  
- This guy.

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,800
He really stopped him.

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,070
 Ojeong Group's spokesperson said he humbly accepts the Ministry of Justice's decision 

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,940
 and will wait for the next review. 

30
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,300
 Meanwhile, CEO Ji Dong Man... 

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,090
Hello? Did you call because you wanted to hear compliments?

32
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,410
It's too early for that.

33
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,070
This is just the start.

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,710
The start?

35
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,370
Han Sin, what are you planning?

36
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,280
We should pay back what we received.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,700
 Be careful. 

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,870
I'm afraid...

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,790
you'll get hurt, too.

40
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,340
I'm different from Chief Cheon.

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,700
Don't worry, Seonbae.

42
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,530
 ...is what is known so far. 

43
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,940
 The Ministry of Justice's Parole Review Committee met in private 

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,150
 and the reason for suspending CEO Ji Dong Man's parole isn't known yet. 

45
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,690
Gosh, seriously! 
    

46
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,590
Damn it!

47
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,030
So what exactly happened?

48
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,530
They're making a big deal about defamation charges.

49
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,080
Who could've imagined this would happen?

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,750
He got us really good, that's all.

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,660
Damn it.

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,780
You're telling me that this lackey attorney Lee Han Sin we looked down on stabbed us in the back.

53
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,970
You're saying he got us really good.

54
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,050
But that bastard!

55
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,540
When he met with the chairman,

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,500
he put on a smile like this for him

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,400
but secretly posted the hate comments.

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,480
Gosh, I really had no clue.

59
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
What's with him? Did you know, Hyeong?

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,410
- Do you have a plan?
 - Wh-What plan?

61
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,430
Do you have one?

62
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,080
Well, for now,

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,780
the plan is...

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,530
to aim for the next parole release.

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,830
Besides that, I don't think there's any other way.

66
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,060
To do that, I think we need the charges to be dropped.

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,100
Should we do that?

68
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,160
- Tell him directly.
 - Huh? What?

69
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,300
Everything you just babbled on about, tell the chairman directly.

70
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,720
Can't you─

71
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,830
Gosh, damn it!

72
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,390
They're coming out!

73
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,490
Oh, they're coming out!

74
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,790
Won Mi, Won Mi!

75
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,930
What's all this?

76
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,470
You didn't cause any trouble, right?

77
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,130
No, I didn't. I didn't do anything wrong.

78
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,840
Why are there so many reporters here?

79
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,160
Stay in the car for now. Let me figure out what's going on.

80
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,540
Wait, wait.

81
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,620
I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I hide?

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,280
Choi Won Mi, Choi Won Mi!

83
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,050
- Choi Won Mi! 
 - Choi Won Mi.

84
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,440
Oh, she's getting out.

85
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,160
Choi Won Mi, Choi Won Mi!

86
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,630
Choi Won Mi, please come here.

87
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,400
Choi Won Mi!

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,900
Please look over here!

89
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,500
Choi Won Mi!

90
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,790
Is it true that you sued your ex-husband, Chairman Ji Dong Man, for defamation?

91
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,220
Is this noise marketing for your movie "Heiress"?

92
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,300
No comment. Please go back.

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,480
Please give us a statement.

94
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,790
Please give us a statement!

95
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,660
Did you get angry at his comment, "Go away, you plastic surgery monster"?

96
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,810
Can we take it as a response to accusations of plastic surgery?

97
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,070
Could you open the gates, please?

98
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,370
They're opening the gates!

99
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,380
Please move back.

100
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,910
The gates are opening.

101
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,920
Move over a bit!

102
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,440
Please give us a statement!

103
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Please give us a statement!

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,740
Hey, quiet! Quiet! Please be quiet!

105
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,070
Over there! Be quiet.

106
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,490
Reporter.

107
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,640
Look at me. Where did I get plastic surgery?

108
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,390
It's all real!

109
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,080
Look at me.

110
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,310
Do you know how hard it is to be born like this?

111
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,640
Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole release was canceled because of your lawsuit.

112
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,230
Was that your goal?

113
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,820
Well, about that...

114
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,460
i-it was for justice...

115
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,880
- Justice?
 - What did you say?

116
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,480
- What did you say?
 - Could you repeat that?

117
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,650
Justice.

118
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,020
I did it for justice.

119
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,610
Nobody knows what that guy is really like.

120
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,880
Ji Dong Man is a really evil man

121
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,560
who should never... never be released on parole.

122
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,830
I know that better than anyone as his ex-wife.

123
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,860
That's why I sued him.

124
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,910
And...

125
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,370
no matter how rich he is,

126
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,640
he should serve the deserved sentence for his crimes!

127
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,820
Isn't that justice?

128
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,360
 You're right! 

129
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,460
 Choi Won Mi! Choi Won Mi! 

130
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,370
 Choi Won Mi! 

131
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,720
 Choi Won Mi! 

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,380
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

133
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,670
♫  You’re going to lose so many, uh  ♫

134
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,970
♫  Cover your eyes and hide  ♫

135
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,910
♫  I'll show you  ♫

136
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,620
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

137
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,760
♫  You don’t deserve what you own now  ♫

138
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,180
♫  You can push me away and try to hold me off   ♫

139
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,940
♫  It won't work on me, Megalomaniac  ♫

140
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,070
Stop!

141
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,860
Stop! Stop! Stop!

142
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,440
Open up, open the door!

143
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,100
Aigoo, aigoo, Chairman!

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,510
Aigoo, Chairman, aigoo, Chairman!

145
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,840
How could this happen? Goodness.

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
- Stop with the overreacting.
 - Chairman...

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,980
- Warden Bae.
 - Yes?

148
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,860
When is the next parole review?

149
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,160
Since your parole was suspended, Chairman,

150
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,750
you can be placed on the review list next month as long as the charges are withdrawn.

151
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,640
But sir, regarding the offer you made about my son's employment...

152
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,500
Never mind. It's nothing.

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,660
Let me bring you to the Prison Warden's office.

154
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,260
Let's go.

155
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,020
Please be careful.

156
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,840
Open the door!

157
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,330
Warden, stay outside.

158
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,110
Yes, sir!

159
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,580
You said the preparations were complete.

160
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,790
Must I stay locked up here longer?

161
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,100
Is this how you take care of business?

162
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,260
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,410
- Attorney Seo.
 - Yes!

164
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,820
Make sure the charges are withdrawn first.

165
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,860
H-H-How can I do that?

166
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,050
Do I have to tell you how to do that?

167
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,530
No, no, I'll look into it and take care of it myself.

168
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,320
- The phone. 
 - P-Pardon?

169
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,010
Give me my phone! Don't make me repeat myself!

170
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,980
 No, sir! 

171
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,810
Why are you buying me a drink?

172
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,070
Because you helped me stop Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole release, Inspector.

173
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,020
I always pay back what I receive.

174
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,920
I never imagined we could stop him in this way.

175
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,480
But will you be all right?

176
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,750
What do you mean?

177
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,160
The Chairman Ji Dong Man I know won't just let you be.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
   

179
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,580
Speaking of the devil.

180
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,780
Please excuse me. I need to take this call.

181
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,030
Yes, this is Lee Han Sin.

182
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,380
 Why did you do this? 

183
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,040
Why did you do this to me, you son of a bitch!

184
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,130
There must be a reason why you did this!

185
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,710
Chairman,

186
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,920
you showed no remorse whatsoever.

187
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,770
What? No remorse?

188
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,660
 Your daily average number of visitations was 1.7. 

189
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,600
You received skin treatments at the infirmary,

190
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,810
received daily massages in the visitation room,

191
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,940
and for every meal, you ate food brought in from the outside.

192
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,740
How could you have had time to repent?

193
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,630
Hey! All I did was spend my money and exercise my rights.

194
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,490
 What's the problem with that? 

195
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,650
The fact that you don't know that's a problem is your true problem.

196
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,370
How dare you nitpick at my words!

197
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,520
I made you a parole examiner so you can release me!

198
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,520
 You think you can get away with this? 

199
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,070
Are you done yelling at me?

200
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm in the middle of a team dinner, so I can't talk long.

201
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,110
Wh-What did you say? A team dinner?

202
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,140
 If that's all you have to say, I'll hang up now. 

203
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,800
 You scumbag! You dare to play with me? 

204
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,030
It's exactly as you predicted, Inspector.

205
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,220
I don't think he'll let this one go.

206
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,460
Ji Dong Man threatens to come for you,

207
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,860
and you're not worried, Attorney Lee?

208
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,270
Why did you come to the review room

209
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,460
when you knew it would be dangerous, Inspector?

210
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,800
It was the right thing to do.

211
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,650
I should do what needs to be done,

212
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,810
even if things get dangerous.

213
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,770
I agree with your sentiments.

214
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,860
Chairman Ji Dong Man won't give up like this.

215
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,610
He will aim for parole again,

216
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,640
and I will continue to stop him.

217
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,140
Perhaps, this may be a good opportunity for you, Inspector.

218
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,870
What opportunity?

219
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:03,210
To reveal that Chairman Ji Dong Man committed even worse crimes

220
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,800
than embezzlement and breach of trust.

221
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,490
Surprise!

222
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,560
Guys, it's not my birthday yet.

223
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,060
This cake is to celebrate your movie being the number one box office hit!

224
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,760
- All of a sudden?
 - It's making a comeback, all thanks to you!

225
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,040
Me?

226
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,470
Conscientious actress Choi Won Mi who carried out justice

227
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,000
by preventing Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole!

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,690
You dominated the real-time search rankings, and there's a dramatic surge in ticket sales and explosive responses online!

229
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,300
With comments supporting the Justice Girl!

230
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,880
Justice Girl.

231
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,170
And...

232
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,930
What, what, what is it?

233
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,500
You've got advertising offers!

234
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,460
Advertising offers?

235
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,770
 I'll give you a gift. 

236
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,070
 A gift? 

237
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,240
 What gift? 

238
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,410
 I'll make you 

239
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,860
 even more famous, Choi Won Mi. 

240
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,050
This really is a perfect gift.

241
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,220
- There's one more gift.
 - Wh-What is it?

242
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,130
CEO Jang released an article saying he will pay you the unsettled amount and renew your contract!

243
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,200
Amazing, right?

244
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,610
Oh, my gosh!

245
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,230
Eonni, let's continue smooth sailing from here on out.

246
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,360
Yes, let us keep up this momentum.

247
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,870
Gosh, how could this be!

248
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,470
 Goodness. 
   

249
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,750
- Good morning.
 - Hi.

250
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,310
Welcome.

251
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,690
Wow, the smell of coffee is filling up the hallway.

252
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,310
Who put this coffee here─

253
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,890
Mr. Hwang, could you please hand me my coffee...

254
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,220
That was mine.

255
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,300
You should've said so sooner.

256
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,910
But seriously, you're quite impressive, Attorney Lee.

257
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,800
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

258
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
I mean, if it's defamation,

259
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,210
isn't that only a million won fine at worst?

260
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,200
But you put a barricade in front of Chairman Ji, who has access

261
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,030
to billions and trillions of won with just a million won fine.

262
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,490
If it was a sturdy barricade,

263
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,570
he would be wary of it and avoid it.

264
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,390
Mr. Hwang, are you familiar with "knitting"?

265
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,640
Knitting?

266
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,570
When yarn gets knotted up once, it's impossible to undo it.

267
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,420
Your options are to cut the thread or start over.

268
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,320
Let's say I used a similar knitting strategy.

269
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,250
"Knitting strategy."

270
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,090
Wow, I'm seeing you in a different light now, Attorney Lee.

271
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,310
Thank you.

272
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,650
But what are you looking at?

273
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,940
Are you selling some used items?

274
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,530
Camping products? Or cycling goods?

275
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,380
 Hello, everyone, this is Daeguk Guest Seat. 

276
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,060
-  We have someone you all know in our studio today.  
- Wh-Who was that again?

277
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,810
 - We'll talk with CEO Park Hui Jun of Junbong Holdings.  
- Oh, right. That's Park Hui Jun, right?

278
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you know him?

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,710
- Of course. Isn't he the guy who went to prison for 
 - Welcome. 

280
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,320
the Junbong Holdings investment fraud?

281
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,310
My in-law's third cousin was also scammed by that bastard

282
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,000
and there was a major upheaval in their family.

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,750
But why are you watching this first thing in the morning?

284
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,700
There was an application for parole.

285
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,430
By whom? Park Hui Jun?

286
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,370
No. His accomplice, Kim Bong Su.

287
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,040
A reality instead of a dream 
    

288
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,630
for investors.
    

289
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,530
Your dream will be fulfilled right here.

290
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,670
An alchemist will be with us to make our dreams a reality.

291
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,950
Let me introduce you to the top alchemist of this age, CEO Park Hui Jun!

292
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,220
Please welcome him with a round of applause.

293
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,170
♪ Mother said she didn't like jjajangmyeon ♪

294
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,260
♪ Mother said she didn't like jjajangmyeon ♪

295
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Do you think mother really didn't like jjajangmyeon?

296
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,710
 No. 

297
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,900
Of course not.

298
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,510
Of course, mother wanted to eat jjajangmyeon, too.

299
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,380
However,

300
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,730
the mother felt happier and more satisfied from seeing her child

301
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,310
enjoying jjajangmyeon than eating it herself.

302
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,740
Everyone, isn't that what family is?

303
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,370
For your families,

304
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,630
I, Park Hui Jun, will give you all the information

305
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,130
to make money and wealth.

306
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,140
Please take it all.

307
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,770
All of it!

308
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,670
 Park Hui Jun, Park Hui Jun! 

309
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,350
 Park Hui Jun, Park Hui Jun, Park Hui Jun! 

310
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,660
- I was touched.
 - Really?

311
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,530
It was great.

312
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,810
Excuse me.

313
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,670
My dream is to make money and give my daughter her own room.

314
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,710
Thank you in advance.

315
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,650
Why do you have such a small dream?

316
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,240
Not only will your daughter have a pretty room to herself,

317
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,550
you will be able to live in a big house like a mansion.

318
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,330
Thank you. Thank you so much.

319
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,690
E-Excuse me, sir,

320
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,610
I invested my retirement fund and a mortgage loan on my house.

321
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,620
If things go wrong by chance, I'll really─

322
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,070
Sir, I'll make sure your original investment is safe.

323
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,200
Not only that, I'll multiply your retirement money several-fold.

324
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,860
- Thank you.
 - Don't worry.

325
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,140
Thank you.

326
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,500
It's my first time meeting you. Nice to meet you.

327
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,710
Just a moment.

328
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,830
CEO Kim, CEO Kim? Over here.

329
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,740
You saw him earlier, right? He is the Co-CEO of Junbong Holdings, CEO Kim Bong Su.

330
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,950
It's nice to meet you.

331
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,640
To increase your profit, you can first take...

332
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,980
Thank you.

333
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,340
Bong Su?

334
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,560
You made it, Nunim.

335
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,140
Everyone, may I have your attention, please.

336
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,200
Someone really important has come today to celebrate this occasion.

337
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,810
This is President Choi Hwa Ran of Smile Cash, who is a major supporter of Junbong Holdings.

338
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,900
A round of applause, please.

339
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,430
If you keep overreacting like that, you can go up in flames overnight.

340
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,590
One may think that overreacting is my charm.

341
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,340
Aigoo, Nunim, welcome.

342
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,270
- "Nunim"?
 - Oh, right.

343
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,250
President Choi.

344
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,440
All these people really aren't paid actors?

345
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,100
Come on, you're so distrustful, President Choi.

346
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,500
Just answer my question.

347
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,210
If you're that nervous, just take your investment funds back.

348
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,990
There's a line of people who want to invest more with us.

349
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,920
Wait, one billion won more?

350
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,850
Whoa, what am I to do when the Warren Buffet* of South Korea 
  (American businessman, investor, and philanthropist) 

351
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:56,240
keeps investing in Junbong Holdings like this?

352
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,360
Baek Jun Gi? It really is Baek Jun Gi!

353
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,390
If he's investing, this is a guaranteed success!

354
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,420
- Is he famous?
 - Yes!

355
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,810
Gosh, Baek Jun Gi. He certainly plays big.

356
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,430
Aigoo, things will get so crazy with all the investors rushing in.

357
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,570
President Choi, do you trust us a bit more now?

358
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,630
If you guys mess with my money, you'll die.

359
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,980
Of course.

360
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,950
 Parole is out of the question for such an evil bastard! 

361
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,070
These bastards squandered the victims'

362
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,000
hard-earned money on bars and shopping malls!

363
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,690
I agree with you.

364
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,540
Where are you going?

365
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,390
I saw someone I know from the article.

366
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,830
I-Isn't this President Choi of Smile Cash?

367
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,560
You remember.

368
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,690
H-How could I forget?

369
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,340
She threatened to kill us all when she lost her case because of you.

370
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,160
Do you know how scared I was?

371
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,670
 Do you have evidence that I collected my debt illegally? 

372
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,190
 Well, yes, I do. 

373
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,840
 It was definitely here somewhere... 

374
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,640
 Do you have it or not! 

375
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,100
 Gosh, you scared me! 

376
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,380
 Even an attorney like me is scared, 

377
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,880
 how much more fear must the debtors feel? 

378
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,970
 Here is the evidence. 

379
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,240
 Please take a look. 
   

380
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,140
 Attorney Lee! 

381
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,170
 When did you take a look at the dash cam? 

382
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,240
 Lee Han Sin! Lee Han Sin! 

383
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,640
 How much are you getting paid? 

384
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,250
 Since it's a civil case, maybe about 3 million won (~$3.000)? 

385
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,900
 Don't you think that's too low for the price of your life? 

386
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,590
 Listen up. 

387
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,610
 If you get in my way one more time, 

388
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,700
 you may end up dead without a trace. 

389
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,320
 You got that? 

390
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,240
B-But wh-why are you trying to meet President Choi?

391
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,480
To stop Kim Bong Su's parole, I need President Choi's help.

392
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,250
D-Do you think President Choi will help you?

393
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,530
Well, I'm a bit scared, but since she only cares about money,

394
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,850
things should work out somehow if I use money.

395
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,490
Pardon?

396
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,340
Mr. Hwang.

397
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,560
Please go to the Junbong Holdings Victim Support Committee

398
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,840
and bring a petition opposing Kim Bong Su's parole release.

399
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,190
Okay. Got it.

400
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,120
Parole.

401
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,830
Parole.

402
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,820
Die, you bastard!

403
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,870
What the hell!

404
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
Who are you?

405
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,710
What is this?

406
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,700
You were going to kill me with this?

407
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,810
My money... Where's my money!

408
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,070
I see. You were one of my company's investors.

409
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,610
 Thank you. Thank you so much. 

410
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:09,420
That money was my blood, sweat, and tears! I put my lifeline on my motorcycle earning that!

411
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,990
 We will conduct a search and seizure of Junbong Holdings. 

412
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,510
 Everyone, stop what you are doing and get up. 

413
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,340
 You there, take your hands off quickly! 

414
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,580
   

415
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,240
 Bong Su, if we hold on to it for just five years, we get 40 billion won (~$40 Mio.). 

416
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,510
 If you betray me, we're done! Hang up, all right? 

417
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,070
 - What? What is it?
 - Let's go, Park Hui Jun. 

418
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,940
 Wait! Give me a second! 

419
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,280
 Please look over here! Is it true?  

420
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,040
   

421
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,290
   

422
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,090
You bastard! My money!

423
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,360
Give me back my money!

424
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,310
It's always stupid guys like you who blame others.

425
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,740
Hey, you fell for such stupid words?

426
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,210
You stupid bastard.

427
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,210
You bastard!

428
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,670
Consider yourself lucky today.

429
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,450
I need to take care of myself.

430
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,810
How...

431
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:15,930
how could someone like you be released from here?

432
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,620
That's what you think.

433
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,150
Stab me.

434
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,350
You said you wanted to kill me. Stab me.

435
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,940
Hey, do you know when people fall for fraud?

436
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,870
When the con artist puts their life on the line.

437
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,880
Earnestly and desperately.

438
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,130
Too bad for you.

439
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,390
The correction officers will think you really stabbed me,

440
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,710
and you will get a longer sentence.

441
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,210
Do you get it now?

442
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,290
I just scammed you again, you stupid bastard!

443
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,130
I'm leaving.

444
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,940
You stay locked up here.

445
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,020
Correction Officers!

446
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,790
Correction Officers!

447
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,170
I came to meet President Choi.

448
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,280
Who are you?

449
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,890
President Choi's favorite person.

450
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,690
Someone to give her money.

451
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,920
President Choi.

452
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,710
I'm sorry.

453
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,680
Really. I deserve to die for what I've done!

454
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,820
T-Two more weeks!

455
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,340
N-No, if you just give me one more week,

456
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,900
I'll do whatever it takes to pay you back the original amount plus interest!

457
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,890
President Choi...

458
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,660
 I'm sorry. 

459
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,990
 One month, no, if you give me just two more weeks, 

460
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,720
 I'll do what it takes to pay you back. 

461
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,990
   

462
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,670
Life is all about timing.

463
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,090
It's my favorite saying in the world.

464
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,690
But you never get the right timing, Mr. Park.

465
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,770
That's why I really don't like you.

466
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,940
All right, open wide.

467
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,060
Not only are you bad at timing, you don't understand, either.

468
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,980
I said open your mouth.

469
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,050
Your mouth is about to be torn open

470
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:38,430
for spewing easy promises you can't keep.

471
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,680
Eat it.

472
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,800
Eat more! Say ah!

473
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,870
Ma'am.

474
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,700
What?

475
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,340
What is it?

476
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,410
Me? Attorney.

477
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,690
Mr. Park, did you hire an attorney?

478
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,530
He says he didn't.

479
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,780
No, I'm not Mr. Park's attorney.

480
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,980
My occupation is an attorney.

481
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,100
Mr. Park.

482
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,360
Are you really hot, or do you really like ice?

483
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,270
Why would an attorney come here when Mr. Park didn't hire you?

484
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,340
Aigoo. I told you last time,

485
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,170
if you handle your debt collection like this, it's disadvantageous in court.

486
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,420
Yet, your methods stay the same.

487
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,750
You're that attorney!

488
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,250
Aigoo, I forgot to bring my business card.

489
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,810
I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.

490
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,460
Han Sin. Lee Han Sin.

491
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,970
You're pretty gutsy

492
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,180
to come here fearlessly after screwing me over last time.

493
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,210
Why did you come?

494
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,170
I heard it hasn't been easy for lawyers these days. Is it really that tough?

495
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,590
Did you come here to ask me to kill you?

496
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,070
Well, not quite.

497
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,490
Let's make a deal.

498
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,070
A deal?

499
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,500
We already have many debt-collecting lawyers.

500
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,800
All right, let's eat one more.

501
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,730
I'm a little different from those lawyers

502
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,550
since I'm trying to get back the money you were scammed.

503
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,140
You were defrauded by Junbong Holdings, right?

504
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,060
I'll get that money back for you.

505
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,930
What do you mean by that?

506
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,850
What do you mean you can't do anything for us?
    

507
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,290
There are so many people who were scammed here! 
   

508
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,560
What do we do...

509
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,040
Move.

510
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,720
What the hell?

511
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,480
Open the door!

512
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,290
I said, open the door!

513
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,920
Open up!

514
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,810
Open the door!

515
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,200
Bong Su?

516
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,660
Nuna is here.

517
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,990
I warned you before.

518
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:39,210
Didn't I tell you that you would croak if you messed with my money?

519
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,450
Open the door.

520
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,160
Open the door, you asshole! Hurry up and open the door!

521
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,430
Open the door! Open the door!

522
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,390
 You better open the door, you bastard! 

523
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,150
 I said, open the door! Hey, open the door! 

524
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,400
That's a bulletproof door, you bitch.

525
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,000
 We need to leave before the police get here. 

526
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,800
What's taking the police so long?

527
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,690
This is why they get badmouthed as damn cops.

528
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,250
Okay! They're here.

529
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,600
This bastard called the cops.

530
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,330
Assistant Baek, bring me my coat.

531
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,580
That bastard laughed at me!

532
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,670
Ma'am, you can't.

533
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,260
Assistant Baek,

534
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,140
those bastards definitely hid the money somewhere.

535
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,050
Find it.

536
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,520
 You were defrauded by Junbong Holdings, right? 

537
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,240
 I'll get that money back for you. 

538
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,710
Interesting.

539
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,290
   

540
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,300
 Chairman Ji Dong Man won't give up like this. 

541
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,210
 He will aim for parole again, 

542
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,800
 and I will continue to stop him. 

543
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,440
 Perhaps, this may be a good opportunity for you, Inspector. 

544
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,870
 What opportunity? 

545
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:03,070
 To reveal that Chairman Ji Dong Man committed even worse crimes 

546
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,840
 than embezzlement and breach of trust. 

547
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,710
Opportunity...

548
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,500
Why?

549
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,110
- Surprise!
 - Geez, you scared me!

550
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,360
What is it?

551
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,240
It's Choi Jeong Hak's new girlfriend.

552
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,680
What?

553
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,450
Your stakeout paid off!

554
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,810
I worked hard.

555
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,810
And his current whereabouts?

556
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,480
For your righteous skin.

557
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,350
Everybody Mist.

558
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,190
Miss Justice.

559
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,100
Cut. Okay. That was good. That was great, Choi Won Mi.

560
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,950
Let's take a 10-minute break before starting the next cut.

561
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,820
Okay, thank you, Director.

562
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,730
- Aren't you tired?
 - This is my first ad shoot in a while.

563
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,820
I'm not tired at all.

564
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,930
Thanks, guys.

565
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,370
Gosh, so pretty!

566
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,950
Who sent this?

567
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,540
Who sent it?

568
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,030
I wonder.

569
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,670
You look like a goddess. You're so pretty.

570
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,250
"For your righteous skin."

571
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,220
What was it, Everybody Mist?

572
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,370
Read the note.

573
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,830
Take a look at the note.

574
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:27,450
 If you don't want to die, come visit me immediately. 

575
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:32,150
Is this concept supposed to be like a goddess from Greek mythology?

576
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,250
- Yes, that is true. 
- Right?

577
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,310
It says here that your plan

578
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,610
after release is to get a job

579
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,460
with the carpentry skills you learned in prison.

580
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,770
- Is that true? 
 - Yes.

581
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,790
They say people don't change easily.

582
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,240
I'm a bit worried that if you are released on parole,

583
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,410
you will scam people again and create

584
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,440
even more victims, Candidate 64.

585
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,350
No, that's definitely not true.

586
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,850
Honestly, I thought it was a bit strange.

587
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:15,210
I questioned if you actually deserve to be released on parole

588
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,950
when you haven't even come to a settlement

589
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,720
with your victims yet.

590
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,000
Unfortunately, I have a negative opinion

591
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,420
on your parole release, Candidate 64.

592
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,660
But you don't seem that worried.

593
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,640
No, it's not like that.

594
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,360
Well, you'll need to worry.

595
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,620
You know that Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole was canceled recently, right?

596
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,340
That was my doing.

597
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,390
According to Chapter 2 of the Parole Guidelines, 
    

598
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,420
economic offenders with unpaid amounts exceeding 2 billion won are classified as restricted offenders.

599
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,940
Reclassification to general offender status

600
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,300
is advantageous to qualify for parole eligibility. Therefore,

601
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,610
reparation for damages is the top priority.

602
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,960
You can go straight down this hallway.

603
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,360
Yes.

604
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,340
Chairman.

605
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,190
I'm busy. What do you want?

606
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,620
- Attorney Seo.
 - Yes?

607
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,720
Replace this massage chair immediately. It won't relax my knots.

608
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,970
I-Is that so? O-Okay, I'll take care of it.

609
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,480
Give me a massage. It's been a while.

610
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,800
You still talk to me carelessly.

611
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,040
I see you've lost all sense of fear.

612
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,880
Drop the charges.

613
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,140
Why don't you answer me?

614
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,670
- This is the first time... 
- What?

615
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:33,060
that you've been helpful in my life.

616
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,000
By suing you and preventing your parole,

617
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,450
I am really popular these days as Justice Girl.

618
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,730
Moreover, this is the first time you've asked me for a favor.

619
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,200
But too bad.

620
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,490
I can't do what you asked me to do.

621
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,680
Why are you refusing to drop the charges?

622
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,290
If I drop the charges now, I won't be the Justice Girl anymore.

623
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,620
So, I can't do it!

624
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,700
- Sit down.
 - This chair really sucks.

625
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,600
- It hurts my butt.
 - Hey, you!

626
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,620
You have no fear. Like old times, I should─

627
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,320
No, no, no, you shouldn't do this!

628
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,560
- What's the problem?
 - Mind your own business and get out!

629
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,720
Out, out, out.

630
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,570
This visitation is over.

631
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,050
You take care.

632
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,420
Okay, let's talk next time. Goodbye!

633
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,930
For now

634
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,690
take a deep breath.

635
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,090
You need to consider your health.

636
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:54,600
   

637
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,020
Hello.

638
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,370
Attorney Lee.

639
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:20,060
Attorney Lee, I feel so great!

640
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,980
Didn't you just meet Chairman Ji Dong Man?

641
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,270
- Weren't you scared?
 - Scared? Why would I be scared?

642
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,560
You know who I am.

643
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,270
I am Justice Girl Choi Won Mi. You know, right?

644
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,110
Gosh, it's so cold today.

645
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,900
- Attorney Lee. 
 - Yes?

646
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,330
- Come here. Quickly, quickly. 
- Yes?

647
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,050
My legs are trembling so much. What's wrong with me? What's going on?

648
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,480
- Are you okay? How? What?
 - What? What's wrong?

649
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,230
Do you want to hold onto me?

650
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,780
- Please let me hold you. 
 - Hold on tight.

651
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,650
What is this?

652
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,140
I can't believe it.

653
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,460
- You feel relief from tension.
 - I'm not faking it, okay?

654
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,230
Do you need to go to a hospital?

655
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,930
Gosh, it's hot!

656
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,310
Hey, Jin Suk, isn't this too hot?

657
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,760
CEO Park of Seocho-dong completed his deposit.

658
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,830
CEO Wu of Mapo says he will make the deposit in two days.

659
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,260
Also, Director Mun of Baekseung Commerce asked us about money laundering.

660
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,000
- You can let him know in two days.
 - Okay.

661
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,240
- Next?
 - That's it.

662
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,300
Did you look into what I asked you to?

663
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,250
Yes. Attorney Lee Han Sin has a unique resume.

664
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,010
He used to be a correction officer, and after he quit and became an attorney,

665
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,030
he worked mostly as a lackey attorney.

666
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,230
And recently, he was appointed as a parole examiner.

667
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:00,610
So, you're saying it's true that he was appointed as a parole examiner, right?

668
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,190
Yes.

669
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,540
What shall we do?

670
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,000
Since we've got nothing to lose, let's go.

671
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,090
- This is it?
 - Yes, let's go inside.

672
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:44,420
   

673
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,430
   

674
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,310
I don't bite.

675
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,200
P-Pardon?

676
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,670
I won't bite, so you don't have to be so nervous.

677
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,190
I'm not the type to hold grudges like that.

678
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,100
O-Oh, okay.

679
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,160
If you need money, come to me. I'll treat you well.

680
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,110
Okay. Thank you.

681
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,770
Well, you visited me sooner than I had expected.

682
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:37,510
Have you thought about my offer from last time?

683
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,760
I found it a quite interesting offer.

684
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,180
All right. So, tell me.

685
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,730
How will you get back the money I was defrauded?

686
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,680
   

687
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,910
Gap?

688
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:16,150
Junbong Holdings received more than 50 billion won (~$50 million) in investments.

689
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,690
No matter how lavishly Kim Bong Su and Park Hui Jun spent that money,

690
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,480
would they have been able to spend all that money in such a short time?

691
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,730
They obviously hid that money somewhere.

692
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,370
But I know guys like them.

693
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,810
They would never open their traps where they hid that money,

694
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,430
even if there's a knife to their throat.

695
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,180
Traps...

696
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,790
You're cute.

697
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:49,170
Even if the two of them don't talk,

698
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,480
if we can create a gap between the two,

699
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,200
we could find out where they hid their illegal proceeds.

700
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,460
   

701
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,500
 Lee Dong Myeong. 

702
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,210
 He's Park Hui Jun's fund manager. 

703
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,250
 Since he's a regular at adult arcades, he should be easy to find. 

704
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,540
Jackpot, jackpot! Right? It's a jackpot?

705
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,690
Luck follows those meant for success.

706
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,040
I haven't gotten one, even when I've been here for two days straight!

707
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,470
Yes, Hyeongnim.

708
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,700
Right now?

709
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,210
All right.

710
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,830
Where... Where did he go?

711
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,310
Gosh, that little rat!

712
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,160
- Damn it.
 - Goodbye.

713
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,570
Gosh, where can I buy a cigarette?

714
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,820
I don't have a cigarette.

715
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,190
Ahjeossi.

716
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,000
Sorry.

717
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,090
Jangju Restaurant?

718
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,550
He comes all the way here to eat?

719
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,400
Thank you.

720
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,600
- Are you Korean? 
- Yes.

721
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,530
You're handsome. Are you an actor?

722
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,420
   

723
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,470
What's the matter?

724
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:35,150
It tastes just like my mom's cooking.

725
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,920
You're saying it's good, right?

726
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,050
You know how I don't eat home food and just eat ramen.

727
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,190
It's clear that this is a restaurant on the verge of closing.

728
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,230
I'm here.

729
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,790
 Did you eat? Do you want food? 

730
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,290
Forget it. Who would eat your terrible food?

731
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,660
 - Why do you keep going into that storage?  
- Storage?

732
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,210
 Did you hide a jackpot in there? 

733
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,100
Geez, mind your own business!

734
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,580
No one weird came by recently, right?

735
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,660
- You mean guys like you?
 - Gosh, seriously!

736
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,910
Anyway, shut this place down tomorrow. Okay?

737
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,970
Gosh, look at how he talks to his mother.

738
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,720
He's so rude.

739
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,660
We're paying for this meal. What does that make us?

740
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,880
Excuse me, Mr. Hwang.

741
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,920
Excuse me, where's the bathroom?

742
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,610
 Go outside and go to your right. 

743
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,370
Outside?

744
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:47,620
Aigoo, ma'am, please give us more kimchi.

745
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,870
Wow, the kimchi is fermented perfectly.

746
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,390
The kimchi is just...

747
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,980
 It's been a long time since anyone asked for more kimchi. 

748
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,170
 You could sell it separately. 

749
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,910
 Really? 

750
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,360
   

751
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,310
   

752
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,220
What are you doing over there?

753
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,810
Gosh, I told you the bathroom was outside.

754
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,560
I'm sorry.

755
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,930
Gosh, he's not Korean.

756
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,940
   

757
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,800
Who is it?

758
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,930
Why don't they tell me?

759
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,580
Attorney Lee Han Sin.

760
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,240
Do you know me?

761
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,500
Aren't you Park Hui Jun?

762
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,390
- I am.
 - Yeah, that's you.

763
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:58,510
With a clean-cut face, eloquent speech, and excellent investment techniques,

764
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:02,760
you were once a mythical figure known as the Midas' hand of Hannam-dong.

765
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:08,240
Mythical figure? Gosh, that was such a long time ago.

766
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,600
You were doing well as a Hannam-dong investment rich man

767
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,800
before you plummeted after being arrested for the Junbong Holdings fraud incident.

768
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:23,390
I hear your accomplice Kim Bong Su is facing parole release soon.

769
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,250
Didn't you know?

770
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,920
He's on the parole review list,

771
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,010
and he's preparing to leave after paying damages to the victims.

772
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,590
Wait.

773
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,060
- He got on the list?
 - Yes.

774
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:44,140
Unless things suddenly change, he might be released on parole.

775
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,160
If Kim Bong Su is released,

776
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,440
he'll probably go

777
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,540
and get the illegal proceeds by himself, right?

778
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:02,360
I mean, Attorney, I don't know what you're talking about.

779
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,780
Attorney,

780
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,890
there is no hidden money.

781
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,770
Really?

782
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,220
I guess you have nothing to worry about, then.

783
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,050
Oh, well.

784
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,100
I assumed you had talked this through.

785
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,770
Alright then.

786
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,610
Hey, b-but...

787
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,230
i-is it really true that Bong Su...

788
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:41,750
is on the parole review list?

789
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,220
Would I come all the way here to lie to you?

790
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,640
What the heck.

791
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:57,280
Hyeong, do I really have to sell it?

792
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,150
If I sell it now, I'll only get a fraction of its worth!

793
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,540
Just sell it!

794
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,390
Sell it quickly and settle with the victims, bastard!

795
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,320
Watch it!

796
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,690
Listen carefully. I'll buy you a new car when I get out.

797
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,310
Sell the car and settle with the victims! Got it?

798
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:18,530
Go and make sure the items are all good.

799
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:22,450
- Also, there are rumors that Bong Su is leaving soon. 
 - Bong Su?

800
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,470
Check if that rumor is true and come see me.

801
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,250
I'll go to the store first and check on the goods.

802
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,200
Okay, hang up.

803
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:38,830
   

804
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,770
Yes, Attorney.

805
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:49,280
Yes, I think it's definitely at Jangju Restaurant.

806
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,320
Did you eat?

807
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,770
Mind your own business.

808
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,520
Gosh, that asshole.

809
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,610
He should starve to come to his senses.

810
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,830
Why did I pick up the same card?

811
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,650
Seonbae.

812
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,590
He's out, he's out!

813
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,780
Is that Choi Jeong Hak? Are you sure?

814
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,170
I'm telling you, it's him.

815
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,770
What did I tell you? I told you Choi Jeong Hak would be here!

816
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,950
I told you!

817
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,560
Keep your wits about you.

818
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,900
We can't lose him this time.

819
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,140
Make sure the girl doesn't get hurt.

820
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,480
Excuse me.

821
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,910
Yes?

822
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:18,160
I think you dropped your wallet.

823
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,990
It's not mine.

824
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,120
What is this? Did she change boyfriends already?

825
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,380
I wonder if Choi Jeong Hak knows his girlfriend is cheating on him.

826
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,480
Seeing how his phone is off and there is no trace of daily movements,

827
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,950
I think he's gone deep into hiding.

828
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,550
It's going to be tough to catch that Choi Jeong Hak.

829
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,790
Yes, Attorney Lee.

830
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,870
- Inspector.
 - Why do you keep asking me to come? I'm busy.

831
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:06,130
I have something to report.

832
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,330
It's really urgent. Could you help?

833
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,460
Am I the only cop?

834
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,020
Why do you keep calling me?

835
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:17,240
You're the only cop I can trust, Inspector.

836
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,340
Let me hear what it's about.

837
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,700
What is it that you need to report urgently?

838
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,930
I think that the restaurant is violating the origin labeling.

839
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,100
Violation of origin labeling?

840
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,150
Yes! My paralegal has very sensitive taste buds,

841
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:38,380
and he says they labeled their kimchi as domestic when it's actually from China.

842
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,920
Attorney Lee, I'm part of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

843
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,460
You can report to the district office─

844
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,940
You would know better than to do this.

845
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,760
There is a reason you're doing this, right?

846
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,110
Yes, you're right.

847
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:59,020
There may be illegal proceeds hidden in that restaurant,

848
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,760
but there's no way to check.

849
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,230
Illegal proceeds?

850
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:08,670
You've heard of the Junbong Holdings investment fraud, right?

851
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:13,150
About 40 billion won in illegal proceeds weren't recovered at the time.

852
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:17,170
I believe that money is hidden in that restaurant.

853
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:21,130
Did you just say 40 billion won?

854
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,030
Yes. Forty billion won.

855
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,020
I think you're pretty interested now.

856
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:35,710
So, do you want to go on a treasure hunt with me?

857
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,410
   

858
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,210
Welcome! Sit wherever you'd like.

859
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,040
Hello.

860
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,440
Oh! It's that handsome guy.

861
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,150
I'm a police officer.

862
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,610
You were a police officer? Why are you here?

863
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,110
I received a complaint about a violation of origin labeling.

864
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,670
A complaint? From whom?

865
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,750
Gosh, it's not true.

866
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,200
I personally make my own kimchi and I only use soybean paste, which I make myself.

867
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,110
I have to check because I received a complaint.

868
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,620
Pardon? Okay, you can head inside.

869
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,610
Why flip out after enjoying the food?

870
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,790
The door is open.

871
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,140
Did you find it?

872
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:32,090


873
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,630
♫  I'm a typhoon that will wipe away the unjust world  ♫

874
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,410
♫  The steps of these cowards busy running away  ♫

875
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:49,230
♫  Honestly, I'd recommend they give up  ♫

876
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:52,050
♫  Sadly, this wasted life is a fraudulent sale  ♫

877
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,580
♫  I'll seize opportunities, be wary when I go silent  ♫

878
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,780
♫  I zoom towards you with the last bullet of my life  ♫

879
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:02,880
♫  Back on the game  ♫

880
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,200
   

881
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,170
 Preview 
You bastard! 

882
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,400
 You should buy that building. 

883
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,730
 Will you sell your restaurant if I pay you this much? 

884
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:17,310
 I think it's time for CEO Kim to be released on parole. 

885
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:19,320
 He's trying to frame me as a school bully 

886
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,080
 - and have me ostracized for good.
 - Stop right there! 

887
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,870
 You still haven't found Choi Jeong Hak? 

888
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,160
 - Freeze!
 - Have you gone mad? 

889
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,130
 This bastard! 

890
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,170
 I don't work with criminals. 

891
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,060
 Forty billion! Recovery of illegal proceeds. 

892
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:36,160
 If you keep running wild without fear, you could end up dead.
