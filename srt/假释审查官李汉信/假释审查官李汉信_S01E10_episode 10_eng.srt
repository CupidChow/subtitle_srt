1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,140


2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,280
   

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,880
   

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,290
   

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,820
   

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,000
   

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,020
   

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,090
   

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,100
   

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,190
   

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,230
 Ojeong Group CEO Ji Dong Man, who left the prison for an external medical treatment due to bad health, 

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,840
 was involved in a car accident while riding alone in a taxi on the road near Jungbu Prison last night. 

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,160
 At first, I couldn't believe my eyes. 

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,600
 People were already saying he was living a luxurious life in prison like a king. 

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,870
 With all the controversy, who would've thought Chairman Ji would be in that taxi? 

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,190
 Gosh, I'm getting so thirsty. I can drink this, right? 

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,590
 Gosh, but when I looked carefully, it really was Chairman Ji Dong Man. 

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,070
 After Ji's AWOL (absent without leave) from the hospital was exposed by a citizen's report, 

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,670
 there is growing criticism for Ji Dong Man 

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,580
 as well as Jungbu Prison for their neglect in managing inmates. 

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,600
Lee Han Sin.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,410
All because of that damn Lee Han Sin!

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,440
 How does this make sense? 

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,920
 Isn't this the same as getting caught breaking out of prison? 

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,950
 Someone like Chairman Ji Dong Man released on parole? 

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,170
 That would be ridiculous! 

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,010
 Is prison a supermarket that he can come and go as he pleases? 

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,200
   

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,370
I know it was a last-minute report. Thank you. 
    

30
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,430
 I should be the one to thank you. 

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,350
 You gave me a hot story that topped the searches as soon as it was published. 

32
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,460
Could I count on you in the future as well?

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,810
Oh, yes, of course.

34
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,290
Okay.

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,380
   

36
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,120
Why are you standing there like that?

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,610
Come here and sit down.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,890
As you can tell,

39
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,470
I'm not okay.

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,460
Assistant Baek got injured pretty badly,

41
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,410
and my guys ended up like that, too.

42
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,930
And so...

43
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,520
I think I'll need to stop.

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,310
I ended up like this because I was helping you.

45
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,810
Yes.

46
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,530
You should do that.

47
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,840
Is that all you've got to say?

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,630
Even from my perspective, I think that's best.

49
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,530
Okay.

50
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,900
Attorney Lee, you should stop, too.

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,760
No matter how hard you try to smash a rock with an egg,

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,310
you can't even make a dent.

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,770
So, stop. You'll get hurt.

54
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,840
Hearing that makes me want to smash it even more.

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,340
President Choi, thank you...

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,910
for everything.

57
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,060
Attorney Lee!

58
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,290
Attorney Lee, what's wrong with you?

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Come on, you still don't know me?

60
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,890
I'm Choi Hwa Ran! Choi Hwa Ran!

61
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,680
Did you think I'd get scared from something like this?

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,820
"After his parole controversy, Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man

63
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,100
in another controversy for going AWOL."

64
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,850
I saw how you made a dent in that rock!

65
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,920
You'll do something this fun without me?

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,700
Come here! Hurry up and come here. Take a seat.

67
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,050
Gosh, President Choi, you scared me!

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,080
You totally got me! You should lie down again.

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,320
- I succeeded.
 - Please lie down.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,460
No, hurry up and tell me.

71
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,800
Hurry up and tell me how we can bring down Ojeong Group.

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,120
I need to show those bastards what kind of hell breaks loose when I unsheathe my claws.

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
You should recover first.

74
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,990
Gosh, you really are handsome when I look at you lying like this.

75
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,770
 At first, I couldn't believe my eyes. 

76
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,760
Gosh, looking good. Looking good.

77
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,120
He looks good on camera.

78
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,250
In any case, I need to go visit President Choi in the hospital.

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,730
What's this?

80
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,930
 I saw the news. 

81
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,350
 You look really good on camera. 

82
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,250
 But you look even better in person. 

83
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,840
Should I call her or not? Should I call her?

84
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,310
Gosh, should I call her?

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,790
Should I call her?

86
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,370
Gosh, I'm sick of this. I'm back here again.

87
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,490
Gives me the chills.

88
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,610
- It's been a while.
 - Yes, have you been well?

89
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,740
Yes. Bye now.

90
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,380
"It's not possible. There's no way."

91
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,410
Is that all you can say?

92
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,290
- Warden Bae.
 - Y-Yes!

94
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,200
The only evidence is just a hastily taken video.

95
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,610
Can't you just say I was on my way back to the prison?

96
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,330
B-But the public opinion is so heated that no excuses are working.

97
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,470
Public opinion? You want me to rot in prison longer because of that?

98
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,070
What those ridiculous people say doesn't matter!

99
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,460
But even if we force the issue and put you on the parole list,

100
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,810
the parole examiners are influenced greatly by public opinion, so─

101
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,400
Enough with the "public opinion" talk!

102
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,320
But you took the taxi by yourself without a correction officer.

103
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,160
If this keeps coming up, people will say to lengthen your sentence─

104
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,200
Damn!

105
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,420
Because of that Lee Han Sin, damn it!

106
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,900
Can I leave now?

107
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,210
What do you think?

108
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,180
Both of you, get lost right now!

109
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,630
- Okay.
 - Okay!

110
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,650
Why do you keep talking back to him?

111
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,210
- He keeps yelling at us after he did wrong, so I got mad!
 - Quietly, quietly.

112
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,530
Quietly, okay.

113
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,690
Geez.

114
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,310
In any case, you're leaving as soon as you get here?

115
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,370
Yes. It's nice to leave right away.

116
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,850
It's so hard because he keeps calling for me over something I can't do anything about.

117
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,910
You can go now.

118
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,010
- I can go?
 - Yeah.

119
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,550
- Fighting.
 - Okay.

120
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,300
Director Son, I feel like I'll end up getting sick with anger like this.

121
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:43,560
I must repay them several-fold for what I received.

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,390
I'm talking about Cheon Su Beom.

123
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,780
Gosh, I love it!

124
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,010
This is such good news!

125
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm so happy, guys!

126
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,630
Here, look.

127
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,030
His wrinkly face has gotten more crinkled.

128
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,990
Doesn't he look like a Hahoetal*?
  (Traditional Korean mask) 

129
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,590
Eonni, people are watching!

130
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,570
Who cares?

131
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,300
When will I ever get such a dopamine rush because of Ji Dong Man?

132
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,170
What if Chairman Ji gets mad and keeps blocking your path, Eonni?

133
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,750
Yeah, Eonni, he might try to hurt you.

134
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,050
Would he, really?

135
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,350
 I found it. 

136
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,490
 I'm going to start fighting back now. 

137
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,860
No, don't worry.

138
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,980
No matter what Ji Dong Man does from now on,

139
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,910
I won't just take it, okay?

140
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,310
Okay? Just enjoy it.

141
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,530
Hey, should I print this out?

142
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,510
   

143
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,910
Attorney Lee.

144
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,450
Oh, Inspector.

145
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,030
Did we have an appointment?

146
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,090
Well, no, but...

147
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,450
 You brought a car, right? 

148
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,660
 Give me the keys. 

149
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,610
 A person has died. 

150
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,240
 So what? 

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,360
 Isn't it your job to clean up after stuff like this? 

152
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,860
 Please go straight home. 

153
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,220
 Just clean up this mess properly. 

154
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,860
 I'm leaving. 

155
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,170
The more I look into them,

156
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,660
the clearer it becomes why I should bring them down.

157
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,340
Ji Myeong Seob's face isn't in the video frame

158
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,330
and it doesn't show Son Eung Jun cleaning up,

159
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,480
but it's clear the two are accomplices.

160
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,060
If you reveal it hastily, they will weasel out of it like before.

161
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,660
However, Attorney, this is a video that shows a crime scene.

162
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,950
I have to see how Ojeong Group falters

163
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,560
and what tricks they attempt to pull in the face of such evidence.

164
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,620
Do what you think is best.

165
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,270
I'll help you this time.

166
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,430
- No, don't lift the entire bed.
 - Let's see.

167
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,050
Yes, that one─ No,

168
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,560
- the other way, the other way. That's right.
 - Oh, my God!

169
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,260
Oh, my, President Choi!

170
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,200
- Aigoo, President Choi, this is pretty serious.
 - N-No.

171
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,600
You broke your leg and your neck, oh, no!

172
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,020
- They're not broken!
 - Oh, no.

173
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,560
These people! You act like I died or something!

174
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,000
Why are you crying and causing a scene? It's disturbing.

175
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,030
What are you guys doing?

176
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,910
- Pardon?
 - Why are you guys holding hands and holding each other and pulling apart?

177
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,740
I smell something fishy about you two.

178
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,820
It's probably just the smell of the disinfectant.

179
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,880
- Assistant Baek.
 - Yes?

180
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,200
Shall we give them a beating?

181
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,030
These two are on a date, using the hospital visit as an excuse.

182
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,610
Wow, you're rubbing salt into my wounds when I'm injured.

183
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,230
- No, President Choi.
 - It's not like that.

184
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,960
What do you mean, it's not like that? It obviously is.

185
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,450
Never mind.

186
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,250
Where is Attorney Lee today?

187
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,080
Attorney Lee is a bit busy preparing for Chief Cheon Su Beom's parole release.

188
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Cheon Su Beom?

189
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,220
Gosh, that Attorney Lee. I told him we should do this together.

190
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,000
He's the same as always.

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,510
Wh-What do you mean?

192
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm saying he really doesn't listen.

193
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,660
Ah! This...

194
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,110
Eun Ji, come over here.

195
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,000
Did you feed the kid before you came?

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,890
Oh, yes, I fed her.

197
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,800
Good.

198
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,240
By the way, you need to watch out for men.

199
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,390
Even if a guy looks warm, round, and easygoing,

200
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,880
there's a great chance that he's hiding claws underneath.

201
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,420
Especially watch out for guys close to you.

202
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,450
When they're nice to you as a friendly gesture...

203
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,790
Mr. Hwang, I'm not talking about you.

204
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,560
- It's not about you.
 - I thought you were referring to me.

205
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,880
   

206
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,990
Correction Officer Lee,

207
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,280
you really grabbed my dad by the collar and had him stay in prison.

208
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,230
What a mess is this!

209
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,680
Nobody takes any responsibility!

210
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,730
Attorney Seo, you're here.

211
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,880
Yes, I'm here.

212
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,410
How's my dad?

213
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,100
He seems very angry right now.

214
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,380
I'm sure he got furious.

215
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,460
But the crucial problem isn't his parole.

216
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,250
It's not? Th-Then what is it?

217
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,400
Because of him, the company's image is ruined, and the stock prices have plummeted.

218
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,560
Is there a greater owner risk than this?

219
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,680
You're right.

220
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,950
- Attorney Seo.
 - Yes?

221
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,400
Don't we need to do something about it?

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,530
Sure. I mean, you're right,

223
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,840
but it will be difficult to recover from this with just a minor solution.

224
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,370
A minor solution won't work. A minor solution won't do.

225
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,640
   

226
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,940
I think we'll need a sensational and eye-popping special event.

227
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,600
Sensational and eye-popping special event?

228
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,580
In the end, Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole is stopped, right?

229
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,360
He probably can't even fathom it, since the public's attention is on him.

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,350
Then, I'll need to shake up Ojeong Group with that video.

231
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,240
And I'll need to trap Director Jeong Wuk and

232
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,120
get Chief Cheon's parole approved.

233
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:16,380
But until then, I'll need to keep an eye on Jeoksong Prison.

234
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,680
 I just heard this while eavesdropping. 

235
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,880
 It seems Chairman Ji will do something to Chief Cheon. 

236
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,360
 What do we do? 

237
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,530
Ojeong Group isn't giving us any time to have a drink in peace.

238
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,530
 Hey, prop me up properly. Support me properly. 

239
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,660
Aigoo, why would he come to such a place?

240
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,690
Prop me up properly.

241
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,390
Wait, President Choi.

242
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,120
Did you already get started?

243
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,800
I mean, it sucks enough that I'm injured!

244
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,790
Aren't you two enjoying yourselves too much?

245
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm so tired. Give me a glass!

246
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,580
- Will you be all right?
 - Of course, of course.

247
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,070
I don't know if you should drink.

248
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,840
   

249
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,360
 Cheon Su Beom. 

250
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
 Inmate 2777. 

251
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,080
 Eliminate him properly. 

252
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,680
President Choi, isn't this too much?

253
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,030
I'm fine!

254
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,200
This glass is too small.

255
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,130
Attorney Lee, give me that large cup.

256
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,220
Let's all drink with the large cup.

257
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,980
President Choi, I think I'll need to leave now.

258
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,770
Why?

259
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,750
Because of that guy, Cheon Su Beom?

260
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,100
It's a beautiful night, Hyeongnim.

261
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,910
What's with you guys?

262
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,100
Did you eat?

263
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,650
- Yes. 
- Yes, we ate.

264
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,520
Okay. Aigoo, seriously.

265
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,270
Take it easy.

266
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,420
Guys,

267
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:29,030
you know that there's more of our gang here than your people, right?

268
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,190
I really like that model inmate hyeongnim, 2777.

269
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:39,380
So, don't even touch a hair of my hyeongnim until his parole release.

270
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,010
Can you guys do that?

271
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,190
 Yes. 

272
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,840
- Can you?
  - Yes! 

273
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,780
All right.

274
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,440
Then, as proof of your promise, let's take a photo together.

275
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,080
All right, gather together.

276
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,070
Hurry up and group up!

277
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,430
All right, smile big and make hearts!

278
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,920
Smile bigger!

279
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,160
All of the gang members in that prison?

280
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,990
I heard many Global Hammer Gang members are in Jeoksong Prison.

281
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,150
What can't you solve with money?

282
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,650
It just depends on how much.

283
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,700
I just got a message from them.

284
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,540
Here, I told them to send me a photo today.

285
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,950
Here.

286
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,340
Are you satisfied now?

287
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,050
I've taken over Jeoksong Prison,

288
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,680
so until Cheon Su Beom is released on parole, nothing will happen to him.

289
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,350
You suffered damages from Ojeong Group last time, and yet again─

290
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,520
Stop.

291
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,400
Attorney Lee, I'm Choi Hwa Ran.

292
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,710
My company won't falter over something like this.

293
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,490
So stop your useless worrying and accept my drink.

294
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,550
Wait, wait, this cup is too large.

295
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,470
Why are you acting like an amateur?

296
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,670
Then, here, Inspector An.

297
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,240
Will you be okay with that? You said you don't even eat with cops.

298
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,200
Gosh, Inspector An, you hold grudges, huh?

299
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,650
If you feel uncomfortable, just give it to me.

300
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,200
- No, it's okay.
 - You don't, right?

301
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,260
All right.

302
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,380
Let's shout this with a loud voice and drink this night away!

303
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,840
All right! Let's defeat Ojeong Group!

304
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:50,050
Come on! I couldn't sleep because I was so pissed after Ji Dong Man got me!

305
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,730
Attorney Lee, am I the only one getting angry? Am I the only one losing sleep?

306
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,120
Inspector An!

307
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,910
Am I... Am I the only one who's losing sleep from anger?

308
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,940
Are you like this because you think the rock won't break if we smash it with eggs?

309
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,330
Attorney Lee, wake up! You already made a dent in it!

310
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,090
It's possible to smash the rock with an egg if we try hard!

311
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,520
We can do it! Let's try that again.

312
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,150
You guys, lift your cups, too. Hurry.

313
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,690
Your cups are too small. Change your cups!

314
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,370
All right, one more time.

315
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,010
- Let's defeat...
  - Let's defeat... 

316
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,970
- Ojeong Group!
  - Ojeong Group! 

317
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,320
That's right! Let's go! Let's do it!

318
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,520
We'll defeat them!

319
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,820
   

320
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,270
Hello, welcome.

321
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,310
Gosh, the weather is nice.

322
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,400
Everything's prepared, right?

323
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,440
Yes, everything is being prepared spectacularly, as you've said.

324
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,870
All you need to do is head inside and check for yourself.

325
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,990
- Okay.
 - Yes.

326
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,560
- Why are you so excited?
 - No, no.

327
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,480
I raised my energy level so you would feel good.

328
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,930
What do you think?

329
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,990
Ojeong Group Public Apology Press Conference.

330
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,720
I made it huge like this.

331
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,610
What do you think? It grabs your attention, doesn't it?

332
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,330
How many reporters are coming?

333
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,620
I sent the press release to all three major broadcasting stations,

334
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,410
cable channels, news networks, and newspapers.

335
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,000
Since this involves Ojeong Group, which is being talked about by everyone right now─

336
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,810
I asked how many reporters were coming.

337
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,630
The number of reporters... well...

338
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,830
Just turn on the video.

339
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,540
Okay. Maybe 300?

340
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,580
Hey, support team, could you turn on the video we made?

341
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,020
Yes!

342
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,320
Cue!

343
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,590
   

344
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,760
-  A company of the people,  
 - A company of the people,

345
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,420
-  for the people,  
- for the people,

346
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,590
-  and by the people, Ojeong Group.  
- and by the people, Ojeong Group. That's great.

347
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,970
- That's nice.
  - However, we've disappointed the people... 

348
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,100
   

349
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,030
"We've done wrong, without a doubt."

350
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,600
   

351
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,100
 So, we bow our heads and ask for forgiveness without making any excuses. 

352
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,890
 We will be reborn as a true people's company. 

353
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,650
Nice.

354
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,820
   

355
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,830
 Ojeong Group's generational transition toward a new era begins! 

356
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,650
   

357
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,590
It's good.

358
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,820
Public apology, my foot.

359
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,650
He acts exactly like his father.

360
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,110
Isn't it too short?

361
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,470
Pardon? No, no!

362
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,160
Keeping it short has more impact.

363
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,260
If it's long, it gets boring. This is perfect.

364
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,550
 - Reporter Oh,
 - Yes. 

365
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,330
 I heard Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man, who recently sparked a controversy 

366
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,300
 also used the attorney consultation room every day while in prison. 

367
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,460
 Is that so? 

368
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,210
The timing is quite impeccable.

369
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,930
 He's used the attorney consultation room more than a thousand times already. 

370
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,450
 According to a Ministry of Justice spokesperson... 

371
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,410
Attorney Lee, this is Reporter Wu. Yes.

372
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,490
Today, I have something to report to you.

373
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,660
It's just that Ojeong Group sent me quite an interesting invitation for a press release.

374
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,390
So, are you interested?

375
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,280
   

376
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,230
   

377
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,850
Aigoo, seriously.

378
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,530
Aigoo. Congratulations.

379
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,210
All that's left is for Chief Cheon Su Beom to pass his parole review and leave prison.

380
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,870
It's still too early to relax.

381
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,170
Pardon? Wh-Why?

382
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,070
There are many people who don't want Chief Cheon's parole release.

383
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,230
Yes.

384
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,920
Please drink this as you have your conversation.

385
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,090
- Thanks, Warden Bae.
 - Sure.

386
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,470
He won't be approved anyway.

387
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,190
You have Chairman Yun, Attorney Seo, and me.

388
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,930
Three people with unwavering disqualified opinions.

389
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,570
Why would you worry?

390
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:31,380
I wanted to beat up Cheon Su Beom a bit in Jeoksong Prison before his parole review,

391
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,030
but that got stopped. So I'm just annoyed.

392
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,160
But you've already come up with another alternative plan.

393
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,650
Come on, Chairman.

394
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,230
Yeah, no matter how clever Lee Han Sin may be,

395
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,360
I'll catch and break him properly this time.

396
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,260
Make sure that the evidence you handed over is properly utilized, Director Jeong.

397
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,410
I'll compensate you generously again.

398
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,230
Yes, of course.

399
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,750
I'm back.

400
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,760
What? Did I do something wrong?

401
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,840
Where's the captain?

402
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,930
The captain went to the command unit workshop and won't be back for two days.

403
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,550
That's perfect.

404
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,540
It's good timing.

405
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,550
Talk to me for a minute.

406
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,500
Seonbae.

407
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,990
This is that video, right?

408
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,700
Kim Ju Mok...

409
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,260
Before the captain gets back, join me in causing some trouble.

410
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,900
Director.

411
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,790
Yes.

412
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,330
What, Warden Bae? Do you have something to say to me?

413
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,040
Yes, well...

414
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,630
That profitable prospect the chairman just mentioned...

415
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,940
I wanted to connect you to it.

416
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,680
Aigoo, Chairman, seriously.

417
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,970
This quickly?

418
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,490
Let's talk in the warden's office for a moment.

419
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,440
All right.

420
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,780
It looks like the baby whale will be captured soon.

421
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,950
Pardon? What baby whale?

422
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,010
Oh, is Director Jeong Wuk the baby whale?

423
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,510
So? What's the profitable prospect that the chairman promised me?

424
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,380
It's this.

425
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,950
Unlisted stocks whose value will skyrocket soon!

426
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,670
Oh, really?

427
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,360
I profited quite a bit from that strategic stock last time.

428
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,430
Which stock is it? No, no. How much and by when do I have to invest?

429
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,940
As you probably know, this is a guaranteed success,

430
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,900
so the requirements are a bit lofty.

431
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,800
This guy! This isn't our first go-around!

432
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,840
I understand, so just give me the info.

433
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,960
The investment must be at least two large bills.

434
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,260
Two large bills?

435
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,390
And the deadline is today.

436
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,620
What? By today?

437
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,360
Yes.

438
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,470
Gosh.

439
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,890
And I also have a place you can get funds from.

440
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,510
This guy!

441
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,560
Good.

442
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,240
You know, Jeong Wuk. The one who does the dirty dishes for Ojeong Group.

443
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,570
 I got all of his financial and personal info, 

444
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,450
 and sent him two large bills in loans.
   

445
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,490
 A hacker in my company started running the program, 

446
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,790
so just wait a little─ Wait.

447
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,270
You already finished?

448
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,820
Assistant Baek, give them a bonus.

449
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,870
Hey, Attorney Lee. We've caught the baby whale that he can't live without.

450
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,500
Okay, got it.

451
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,000
It's time for us to start pushing him into the trap.

452
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,770
I'll see you later.

453
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,980
Wow, President Choi has such a drive.

454
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,250
Mr. Hwang, while I'm capturing Director Jeong Wuk, the whale,

455
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,900
I need you to do something for me.

456
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,070
Me?

457
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,130
Yes, yes? Pardon?

458
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,380
   

459
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,700
Aigoo, thank you.

460
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,650
Thank you.

461
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,310
   

462
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,060
Yes, I've infiltrated the press conference hall.

463
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,720
 Only Attorney Seo Dong Hun is here. 

464
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,380
Supposedly, the press conference will begin at 8 p.m.

465
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,140
 They targeted the time when viewership is highest. 

466
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,220
I got it.

467
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,260
Please continue to do what you're doing.

468
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,140
Captain, you'll stick with us to the end, right?

469
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,870
Of course.

470
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,370
I'll get rid of the nuisance to the chairman.

471
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,300
Since the statute of limitations hasn't expired yet,

472
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,880
you have to take care of it immediately.

473
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,300
Since we have evidence from the prosecution, it should be pretty easy.

474
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,040
Why are you calling me at this hour?

475
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,930
Press conference?

476
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,150
 We will now start the press conference. 

477
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:13,430
 I want to thank everyone who attended on short notice despite your busy schedules. 

478
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,630
Recently, there was a scandal involving Ojeong Group.

479
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,560
Ojeong Group expresses deep remorse regarding this matter

480
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:29,950
and has decided to hold this space to apologize to the public.

481
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:35,970
Let's give a round of applause to Executive Director Ji Myeong Seob as he comes up.

482
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,460
I'm sorry! Let's not do the applause. Sorry about that.

483
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,980
All right, please come up.

484
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,960
   

485
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,870
Ji Myeong Seob, that bastard! In the end, he...

486
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:25,910
I'm Ji Myeong Seob, an executive director at Ojeong Group.

487
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,790
Recently, as a result of a scandal involving Chairman Ji Dong Man,

488
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:37,210
we've greatly disappointed the people,

489
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,080
who've supported and loved Ojeong Group.

490
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,710
We bow our heads in remorse and ask for forgiveness.

491
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:15,960
We will take your criticisms deeply to heart,

492
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,460
and work hard to become an Ojeong Group that you can trust again.

493
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,970
   

494
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,640
Hey, play the video.

495
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,560
Hey, I think you played the wrong video.

496
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,040
 Director Son, well, I... 

497
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,840
 I have a bit of an annoying situation. You need to come. 

498
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,470
 You're here? 

499
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,250
 She's dead, right? 

500
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,700
 Is she dead? 

501
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,890
 Damn it, this is so annoying. 

502
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,470
 You brought a car, right? Give me the keys. 

503
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,300
 A person has died. 

504
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,920
 So what? 

505
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,590
 Isn't it your job to clean up after stuff like this? 

506
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,670
 Hand over the car keys. 

507
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,550
What are you doing? Turn it off right now!

508
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,270
Hey, turn off the video! Turn it off!

509
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,470
I-I'm not involved in this!

510
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,690
This has nothing to do with me. Don't take photos of me!

511
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,050
D-Don't...

512
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,990
Turn off the video, turn it off!

513
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,340
Ji Myeong Seob!

514
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,290
Ji Myeong Seob, you are under emergency arrest for the murder of An Da Yun.

515
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,230
Son Eung Jun!

516
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,410
You are arrested for the murder of An Da Yun.

517
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,610
♫  No matter where you go, you’re in the palm of my hand  ♫

518
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,240
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

519
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,430
♫  You’re going to lose so many, uh  ♫

520
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,930
♫  You can push me away and try to hold me off  ♫

521
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,490
♫  It won't work on me, Megalomaniac  ♫

522
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,640
♫  It’s too late to stop me, so  ♫

523
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,840
What you just saw has nothing to do with Ojeong Group!

524
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,820
I have nothing to do with this incident.

525
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,870
Oppa, you're so cool!

526
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,690
Let's go for round two, round two!

527
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,930
Oppa, what's going on?

528
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm in a really good mood since I caught a big one for the first time in a while.

529
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,240
Really? That's so great, Oppa!

530
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
Just wait a few days.

531
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,950
I will reel up a golden whale

532
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,770
and bring it back on my shoulders!

533
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,680
Do you know how much I spent today?

534
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,080
I do, I do.

535
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,480
- Director?
 - What?

536
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,380
Today, it's this way.

537
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,390
He says it's that way today.

538
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,430
Oh, okay, okay. This place is expensive.

539
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,970
Let's go to the cheap place!

540
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,180
Tell me if you need anything.

541
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,960
- Can I really?
 - Of course!

542
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,300
I want to have a bag.

543
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,430
- Oh, Louis Vuitton?
 - Louis Vuitton!

544
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,860
I love it.

545
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,750
Louis Vuitton, my foot!

546
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,150
Come on, Oppa!

547
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,020
Okay, okay! It was just a joke.

548
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,350
Gosh, why am I getting pinged this late at night?

549
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,240
   

550
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,280
What the...

551
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,680
   

552
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,250
Hey, go away for a bit! 
   

553
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,980
No... 
   

554
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,680
Who's messing with my money? 
   

555
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,940
My money! 
   

556
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,860
My money! My money! Are these bastards crazy?

557
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,040
My money, my money!

558
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,360
My money, my money! Damn it!

559
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,300
These bastards!

560
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,330
Who are you guys?

561
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,780
Hey, what's going on?

562
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,200
Let go! Let go of me, you bastards!

563
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,980
Hey! Let go of me, you bastards!

564
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,940
Do you know who I am?

565
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,650
What are you saying?

566
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,570
You handed over your resident ID number, account number,

567
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,330
home address, and your government ID, hearing I would lend you money.

568
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,490
Then, are you guys...

569
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,750
Smile Cash?

570
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:12,730
Even if you were in a rush, you shouldn't give away such important info so hastily like that.

571
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,260
Especially in a world where clicking a link could lead to losing your entire fortune.

572
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:23,260
You dared to do a phishing scam on me, a prosecutor?

573
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,340
Do you know how I amassed that money?

574
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,840
Give me my money.

575
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,010
I said, give me my money, you bastards!

576
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,930
Quiet.

577
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,490
- Assistant Baek, you might rip it off at that rate.
 - Okay.

578
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,260
Let's take it easy.

579
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,290
As a prosecutor and Director of Correctional Services,

580
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,740
you used your high position to accept bribes

581
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,090
through your Hidden Bank slush fund account.

582
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,100
If you don't give me back my money,

583
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,220
I'll do whatever it takes to end you.

584
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,320
I'll end you all!

585
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,260
Give me my money! I'll end you, damn it!

586
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,390
Hey, asshole!

587
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,750
You've got the order wrong!

588
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,940
You lost all your money, and it's in my hands already.

589
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:22,490
So, right now is the time for you to do something

590
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,460
to get your money back.

591
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,650
Don't you think so?

592
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,010
You want me to...

593
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,660
do something?

594
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,440
Can you...

595
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,960
abandon your family?

596
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,310
When will you give me back my money?

597
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,680
Will you give it back right away today? Or tomorrow?

598
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,850
Wow, this guy is an absolute scumbag!

599
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,750
You bastard!

600
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,200
What, you would abandon your family?

601
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,170
Hey, hold him properly! He's moving.

602
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,860
Hey, you bastard! You would abandon your family?

603
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,000
Look at me in the face!

604
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,460
Look at me, you bastard!

605
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,040
Family? You would abandon your family?

606
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,650
You don't have any sense of duty!

607
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,940
Hey, lift your head. Lift your head, you bastard!

608
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,450
President Choi, please calm down a bit.

609
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,680
You're not fully recovered yet.

610
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Oh, right. I should calm down.

611
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,070
A-Attorney Lee.

612
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,370
Director, how about this?

613
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,870
If we give you back your slush fund,

614
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,270
will you betray him?

615
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,540
B-Betray who?

616
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,470
Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man.

617
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,350
 Shocking news! 

618
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:51,550
 Ji Myeong Seob, the son of Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man and an executive director, 

619
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,240
 was put under emergency arrest for murder at the press conference. 

620
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,900
 A video, presumed to have recorded the scene of a murder, 

621
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,600
 was released during the press conference, shocking the audience. 

622
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,760
 Though the validity of the video has not yet been verified, 

623
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,290
 the police authorities revealed that they performed a rare emergency arrest after finding important evidence. 

624
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,970
 This case was broadcast live on multiple stations─ 

625
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,250
So...

626
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,280
that night was...

627
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,920
 You crazy bastard! How could you kill someone? 

628
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,870
 Myeong Seob killed someone? 

629
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,870
 Why can't you behave, you bastard! 

630
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,130
That was the day.

631
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,430
   

632
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,170
Wow, I saw yesterday that Inspector An's drive is on par with that of President Choi.

633
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:12,230
She released the murder evidence at the press conference and immediately arrested Ji Myeong Seob.

634
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,780
Then, she immediately arrested Director Son Eung Jun, who was nearby.

635
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,380
I feel like I've fallen for Inspector An a bit.

636
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,880
Is this good?

637
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,060
It's perfect.

638
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,370
Weren't you yesterday's MVP (Most Valuable Player)?

639
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,130
Don't mention it.

640
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:39,050
It was TNS Reporter Wu who told us about the press conference and got us a press pass.

641
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,380
Oh, and I thought that I needed to wait

642
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,840
at least an hour in front of the control room to switch the videos...

643
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,410
 Hello? Yeah, yeah. 

644
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,840
 Give me a moment. 

645
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,870
but the staff happened to leave right at that moment.

646
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,380
 Please, please! Hurry up! 

647
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,130
Then, are you saying that the control room staff was the MVP?

648
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:10,400
Let's just say that my ancestors blessed me since things fell into place, and I was pretty fortunate overall.

649
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,820
With that said, I have a good feeling about today's parole review.

650
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,940
Yes, well...

651
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,210
I'm nervous.

652
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,020
In any case, thank you.

653
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,280
I'll be back.

654
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,260
See you.

655
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,200
I'll count on you today as well.

656
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,550
Yes, don't worry.

657
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,110
Gosh, should I start getting ready, too?

658
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,530
♫  I'm a typhoon that will wipe away the unjust world  ♫

659
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,400
♫  The steps of these cowards busy running away  ♫

660
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,200
♫  Honestly, I'd recommend they give up  ♫

661
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,740
♫  Sadly, this wasted life is a fraudulent sale  ♫

662
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,950
♫  You grabbed me by my collar and now you're in court for assault  ♫

663
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,700
♫  Those who were once beaten are beaten once again  ♫

664
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,490
♫  You can't see the light before you know the truth  ♫

665
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,600
Wow, that's refreshing!

666
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,730
That feels great! Whoa, nice!

667
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,540
♫  I have no one to lean on, so I fight alone  ♫

668
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,220
♫  The ground under my feet is shaky  ♫

669
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,220
♫  Full of oil, it could catch on fire  ♫

670
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,530
♫  No matter who I face. I won't give up even if I end up a loser  ♫

671
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,130
♫  I'll die an honorable death, I can hide in my grave after I die  ♫

672
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:37,190
- Aigoo, that's nice.
 - That's nice.

673
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,940
Aigoo, Mr. Hwang!

674
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,280
Aigoo, A-Attorney Seo!

675
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,100
You've lost so much weight after becoming Attorney Lee's sidekick.

676
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,630
Yes, I'm having a lot of fun, thanks to the attorney.

677
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,030
Oh, is that so?

678
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,860
Well, enjoy yourself.

679
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,940
Why are you snickering?

680
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,170
No, no.

681
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,070
- Didn't you snicker at me?
 - No, no.

682
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,250
But you're already leaving?

683
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,350
Yeah, I'm leaving because I'm done.

684
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,350
I mean, I guess you're lacking in stamina.

685
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,420
What? H-How am I lacking stamina? How?

686
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,220
Oh, it's okay. Lacking stamina isn't a crime.

687
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,860
Gosh, you're funny.

688
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,910
I'll do one more round, then!

689
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,100
I'm overflowing with stamina!

690
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,590
Let's break a sweat together.

691
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,870
I've done this about five times already.

692
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,480
I've also done it like 10 times.

693
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,430
Oh, okay, then let's do it.

694
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,190
Also, I'm not a sidekick. I'm a paralegal.

695
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,990
Yeah? Okay, sidekick.

696
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,090
Hello!

697
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,220
Continue working. Yeah, carry on.

698
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,710
Hyeongnim.

699
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,080
Oh! You're here.

700
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,530
You must feel nervous since today's your parole review.

701
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,120
When I was a correction officer, I didn't understand why candidates were nervous.

702
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,790
But now that I'm in their shoes, I understand.

703
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,470
Everything will go well. Don't worry too much.

704
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,390
Thanks.

705
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,650
I'll be going.

706
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,540
Hello!

707
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,220
  

708
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,770
 The review will start soon. 

709
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,030
 I'll make sure to bring you good news later today. 

710
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,930
And that's it! See!

711
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,960
I finished it, right?

712
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,390
I'm leaving.

713
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,670
Man, I'm still full of stamina.

714
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:50,190
I have to leave, so... Wait, wait.

715
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,440
I have to leave.

716
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,440
Gosh, it's nice.

717
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,150
Wow, the sauna is nice and warm.

718
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:08,170
The s-sauna is nice and warm, right?

719
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,240
Wow, it's nice.

720
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,690
I-I want to leave...

721
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,040
Hey, looking good. Have you been working out?

722
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,370
I'm working out diligently.

723
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,140
That's nice.

724
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,430
 The phone is turned off. 

725
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,330
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. There will be an additional charge. 

726
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,320
Have both Attorney Seo and Director Jeong lost their minds?

727
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,450
Why are they both not picking up?

728
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,160
You're late.

729
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,020
Oh, yes.

730
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,510
Administrative Secretary, have you heard from Attorney Seo?

731
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,160
No, I haven't.

732
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,760
Chairman, it's almost time.

733
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,750
How about we get started first?

734
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,420
Then, we'll start the parole review.

735
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,940
Administrative Secretary, please tell us what's on the agenda.

736
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,660
799 people applied for the monthly parole review for March 2025.

737
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,070
Wow, that was refreshing.

738
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,380
It's nice.

739
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,190
It was so hard.

740
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,660
What did I just go through in the sauna

741
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,250
because of that bastard, Hwang Ji Sun!

742
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:00,340
Finally, we will examine the case, which needs careful review.

743
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,790
Candidate 655 fulfilled his enforcement rate,

744
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,470
is a model inmate and has a low recidivism rating.

745
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,300
However, because of the nature of his crime of smuggling

746
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,150
and distributing drugs in a prison as a correction officer is severe,

747
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,540
he's been classified as needing careful review.

748
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,710
Please give us your opinion first, Examiner Oh Ban Seok.

749
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,730
I believe an inmate's attitude and the level of his remorse is more important

750
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,140
than what crime he committed in the past.

751
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,410
So, I give him a qualified opinion.

752
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,680
I give him a disqualified opinion.

753
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,630
Next,

754
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,110
it's Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin.

755
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,150
Okay.

756
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,770
My opinion on Candidate 655 is...

757
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,710
One moment, please.

758
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,290
   

759
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,750
Well, my opinion is─

760
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:25,660
I'm sorry, I just received an important report regarding Candidate 655.

761
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:30,870
I feel that Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin should be exempt from reviewing this case.

762
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,760
- Yes, Chairman.
  - What were you doing that you didn't pick up? 

763
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,840
Yes, Chairman! I'm on my way!

764
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,630
Where are you? Weren't you in the parole review room?

765
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,400
I'm sorry. I was dealing with an issue.

766
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,870
Issue? What issue?

767
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,220
What about the document that will fail Cheon Su Beom?

768
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,330
I sent it via courier as you instructed.

769
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:54,190
It should have arrived there by now.

770
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,280
   

771
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,420
In this document, I see that Candidate 655 and Examiner Lee Han Sin
    

772
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,530
worked together as correction officers in Sangbu Prison.

773
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,810
Is that correct, Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin?

774
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,220
Yes, that's correct.

775
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:13,620
Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin faces a conflict of interest regarding Candidate 655,

776
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,510
so his opinion will be excluded.

777
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,050
Next,

778
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,950
please tell us your opinion, Parole Examiner Jeong Wuk.

779
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,090
 Director, how about this? 

780
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,790
 If we give you back your slush fund, 

781
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,000
 will you betray him? 

782
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,990
 B-Betray who? 

783
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:48,360
 Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man. 

784
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:58,370
 He answered without hesitation when I asked him to abandon his family. 

785
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:03,730
 Hey, are you that afraid of Ojeong Group's Ji Dong Man? 

786
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,550
 It's not that you're scared. 

787
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,810
 Rather, you're hesitating in your response 

788
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,630
 because you're afraid of how much money you'll lose 

789
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,680
 when you betray Ojeong Group, right? 

790
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,740
 Hey. 

791
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,070
 I'll give you double. 

792
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,680
 What? 

793
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,500
 If it's double... 

794
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,390
 Ten billion won? 

795
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,060
 Yeah. 

796
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:46,690
 Though seeing your face light up at the sound of offering you double disgusts me, 

797
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:51,160
 if you do everything as Attorney Lee asks of you, 

798
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,770
 I'll send the money to your slush fund account right away. 

799
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,610
 Ten billion won. 

800
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,670
 What will you do? 

801
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,120
 Will you... 

802
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,970
 take our deal? 

803
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:19,640
It appears that the parole review result of Candidate 655 depends on your opinion.

804
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,650
Please tell us your opinion.

805
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:25,670
Q-Qualified opinion.

806
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,320
Pardon?

807
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,840
What did you say?

808
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,120
I said, my opinion is...

809
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,800
a qualified opinion!

810
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,050
Pardon?

811
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,130
How many times must I tell you that it's a qualified opinion?

812
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,680
Chairman, you should officially announce the results.

813
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,400
Yes, you're right.

814
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,030
With two qualified opinions and one disqualified opinion,

815
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,040
Candidate 655 is granted parole.

816
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,820
   

817
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,570
You're going to burn a hole in my face.

818
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,770
You've investigated me all night.

819
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,210
You're still not satisfied?

820
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,590
I still haven't heard anything from you.

821
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,510
The right to remain silent. You said that was my right.

822
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,700
You told me that while putting handcuffs on me.

823
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,610
Aigoo, I guess it's time for me to leave now.

824
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,000
It's taking so long.

825
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,200
I guess even my dad's influence is growing weaker.

826
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,080
You should stop now.

827
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:17,380
Inspector An. I'll pay you back for yesterday and today,

828
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,340
so look forward to it.

829
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,420
Sure.

830
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,070
And also,

831
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,130
that video...

832
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,660
Where did you get it?

833
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,040
I guess you are curious, after all.

834
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,970
Think carefully.

835
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,020
By chance, was it you?

836
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,500
Please stop.

837
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,230
I guess it wasn't.

838
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,980
Gosh, who could it be?

839
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,070
Yes, Seonbae. Everything went well.

840
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,170
The Chief's parole was approved.

841
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,450
- Great work.
  - Yes. 

842
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,800
You really did a great job.

843
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,470
 - I'll head over there. 
 - Okay.

844
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,160
Hyeong...

845
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,710
you passed.

846
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,050
Hyeong,

847
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,310
you can leave now!

848
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,840

849

856
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,510
You're Lee Han Sin, right?

857
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,520
Oh, yes.

858
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,370
Hello, I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.

859
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,730
You'll have to come with us.

860
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:03,930
Okay, let's go. What is this about?

861
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:08,620
Lee Han Sin, you are under arrest for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

862
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,620
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

863
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:15,000
W-Wait, what did you say? N-Narcotics?

864
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,010
Wh-What do you mean by that?

865
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,510
Wait, what is this?

866
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:29,970


867
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:35,580
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

868

00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:42,280

876
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,480
 Preview 
I'm suspended? 

877
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,940
 Do you think I don't know that you've partnered with her? 

878
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:16,140
 They are launching a massive media campaign to divert public attention away from Ji Myeong Seob's murder case. 

879
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,250
 Chief Cheon Su Beom. 

880
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:21,750
 If I step into the forefront of the media battle, it would be the most uncomfortable scenario for Ojeong Group. 

881
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:25,560
 Leave the country immediately. Live there quietly until I call you back. 

882
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,160
 Where's the video? Where's the video? 

883
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,060
 Above the law, above people, there's money. 

884
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,930
 The upcoming events won't go as you want it to.
