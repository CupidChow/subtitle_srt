00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,780
   

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,250
   

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,810
   

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,010
   

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,970
   

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,090
   

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,020
   

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,080
   

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,040
 Stop right there! 

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,590
What are you doing?

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,890
Ma'am, should I go?

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,980
No, just stay here.

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,090
Are you sure you recruited the right players?

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,060
I told you I was rushed.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,250
And you can't blame me right now. We need to fix this situation first.

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,140
I don't think you can fix this situation.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,860
Wh-Where are you going?

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,070
I need to go to fix the situation.

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,820
President Choi, please give me some gambling money.

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,300
What? You'll go in as a player, Attorney Lee?

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,860
We don't have any other way, do we?

24
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,000
Is this really a good idea, Attorney?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,940
Attorney Lee, is this a good idea? If you lose my money, you have to pay it all back.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,260
Try betting on me.

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,600
Wh-What are you doing right now?

28
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,890
 Be careful who you let in! 

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,910
 How dare you bring in a cheater? 

30
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,510
 Hey, over here! 

31
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,580
 Who is he? 

32
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,130
Hello. The game isn't over, right?

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,250
Yes, join us.

34
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,030
Geez. I'm late because I got lost in the area. Thank you.

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,650
What is this?

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,320
Did you recruit more easy targets?

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,340
Huh? Yeah.

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,090
He said he was running late. Here he is.

39
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,720
The more easy targets there are, the better.

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,120
I'll be pulling out now.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,820
Let's set the table again.

42
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,110
Young lady, give us all a round of drinks.

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,220
Reset the table!

44
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,200
Please distribute the cards while the game is still hot.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
Wow, new guy.

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,340
You may be bad with directions, but you sure have a fiery personality.

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,070
Let's do so, then.

48
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,660
Hey. Let's proceed quickly. Go.

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,180
Well then, we'll get started.

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,220
 Something's off. 

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,530
 A dagger flies and pierces my heart. 

52
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,170
My eyes are faster than your hands.

53
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,590
If you're going to play tricks, you put your life on the line.

54
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,640
Are you shaking?

55
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,210
Yes.

56
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,850
   

57
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,710
   

58
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,810
All in.

59
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,090
Okay. President Choi, now's the time.

60
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,390
All right, is it finally my turn?

61
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,880
Let's go, Assistant Baek.

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
Fighting!

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,990
- Keep your eye on this. 
- Okay.

64
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,150
I don't have enough money.

65
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,130
Then, just fold.

66
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,020
My hand is too good to fold.

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,860
Hello!

68
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,330
All right, a reasonable interest rate you can't usually find at a gambling ring.

69
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,510
Unlimited gambling loans!

70
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,570
House Manager, who needs money?

71
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,820
It's this way.

72
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,800
Wow, the money pool here is pretty big.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,700
All right, tell me.

74
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,060
How much do you need?

75
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,960
She's the queen of gambling loans, President Choi.

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,290
About three large bills.

77
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,620
Three bills?

78
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,210
We should still draw up a promissory note, right?

79
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,220
Did you bring it?

80
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,620
Why go through the trouble of writing a promissory note?

81
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,110
I don't have time for that.

82
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,910
I'll pay you right back after I win this round.

83
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,980
Yeah? Then, leave something with me.

84
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:37,090
You know, I can't just lend my money without any security.

85
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,780
As you said, you can win the round, pay me back, and take it back.

86
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,970
What will you leave with me?

87
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,470
Watch the cards.

88
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,310
I am also...

89
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,780
all in.

90
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,610
I have...

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,940
a pair of nines.

92
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,570
Reveal your hand, too.

93
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,360
   

94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,240
So, you caught Choi Jeong Hak?

95
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,570
That stupid bastard is like a moth that flies into the fire,

96
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,980
not knowing he'll die.

97
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,390
If you caught that bastard, tell Myeong Seob to return.

98
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,070
Yes, understood.

99
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,330
There's one more thing I need to report to you, Chairman.

100
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,400
A three?

101
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,930
A t-t-three card!

102
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,710
Aigoo, I really got scared for a second.

103
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,410
You went all in with a three?

104
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,760
I enjoyed myself today.

105
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,300
Well, this is fun.

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,830
Should I give you a small portion of the winnings?

107
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,430
- It's okay.
 - Come on.

108
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,690
Don't be proud and regret it later.

109
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,270
I can't spend a portion of your winnings, anyway.

110
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,570
Why not? Why can't you?

111
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,010
What do you mean, why not?

112
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,750
Because illegal gambling funds are returned to the national treasury.

113
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,380
All right, everyone, freeze!

114
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,740
This is the police. Don't move.

115
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,530
All of you are arrested for illegal gambling in the act.

116
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,100
No! You can't!

117
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,670
Track the item that Attorney Lee asked about first and let me know.

118
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,120
I'll wrap up here and go.

119
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,140
Let go!

120
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,580
- It's unfair!
 - That's my money!

121
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,760
Officer, that money is my money! My money!

122
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,930
Jin Suk, I'm right here. Don't worry.

123
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,390
Don't worry. It's okay.

124
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,740
Let's go quietly, please.

125
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,710
You think you'll be fine after putting this terrible thing around my wrists?

126
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,940
Gosh, well, the thing is...

127
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,620
Thank you for cooperating with the investigation.

128
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,230
Don't mention it.

129
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,410
I'm more grateful that you helped us out.

130
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,500
C-C-Cooperated with an investigation?

131
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,800
What kind of situation is this?

132
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,630
Your employees who were taken into custody

133
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,610
will be released after light questioning.

134
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,060
Well, please unlock my handcuffs, too.

135
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,660
All right, let's eat up.
    

136
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,770
Thank you for the food.

137
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,180
President Choi, could you pass the salt?

138
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,180
- Attorney Lee?
 - Yes?

139
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,970
Explain everything.

140
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,970
- Explain what?
 - Today's situation.

141
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,490
Oh... well...

142
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,690
I partnered up with Inspector An to catch CEO Yong Jin Sang.

143
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,430
Partnered?

144
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,690
It worked out that way. It was a sting operation.

145
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,030
No, no. I had no idea about it.

146
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,820
Then, you should've at least given me a hint about it beforehand!

147
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,880
The more people who know a secret, the harder it is to keep quiet.

148
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,300
I don't like it.

149
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,540
Thanks to you, we were able to successfully complete our mission today.

150
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,830
Also, thanks to your performance,

151
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:45,700
I was able to obtain the truth that will prove Yang Bok Gyu's innocence.

152
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,190
My performance?

153
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,380
 All in? 

154
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,490
 When CEO Yong wants a gambling loan, 

155
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,340
 push for a promissory note and ask him to give you collateral. 

156
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,870
 Then, he will bring out something more expensive and valuable. 

157
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,870
 Something more expensive and valuable? 

158
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,610
 As you said, you can win the round, pay me back, and take it back. 

159
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,740
 What will you leave with me? 

160
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,950
Oh, my performance.

161
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,190
Well, clearing an innocent man with my performance

162
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,420
is a good thing,

163
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,230
but I have nothing in my hands. Not a cent!

164
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,440
It's still too early to be disappointed since we're not done yet.

165
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,310
Oh, really?

166
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,940
You should eat now.

167
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,190
Seolleongtang (bone broth soup) is best when it's hot.

168
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,850
Okay.

169
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,420
   

170
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,910
That last round was worth so much money.

171
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,660
What a waste.

172
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,330
Please explain yourself.

173
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,030
After looking up this watch's serial number,

174
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,920
it shows up as the watch that Yang Bok Gyu supposedly stole.

175
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,040
How did this end up at the gambling ring?

176
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,020
Did the watch grow wings or something?

177
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,160
How did that end up there? My goodness.

178
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,450
Feigning ignorance won't get you anywhere.

179
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,760
If you falsely accused Yang Bok Gyu regarding this watch,

180
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,500
that's a crime of false accusation.

181
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,270
I'll pay the measly fine for the crime of false accusation, then.

182
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,280
Also, detaining me on charges of illegal gambling...

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,890
You guys don't have an arrest warrant, right?

184
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,580
Yeah, there's no way you do.

185
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,810
Then, I will be released soon.

186
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,530
Since this is originally mine, I'll take it with me.

187
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,710
This is a piece of evidence found at the illegal gambling ring.

188
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,830
What's wrong with you? This is mine!

189
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,710
- Yong Jin Sang!
 - What?

190
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,830
How dare a meager cop like you yell at me?

191
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,410
Do you know who's backing me?

192
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,360
It's out? I'll be right there.

193
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,730
Excuse me!

194
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,630
Give me a phone so I can call an attorney.

195
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,430
Seonbae, the serial number inquiry results came out.

196
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,760
I sent it to you, so take a look.

197
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,410
Okay.

198
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,800
- Attorney Lee.
 - Yes?

199
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,220
I'll send you this. Please take a look.

200
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,330
Oh, okay.

201
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,950
Can we look at it together?

202
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,460
Whoa, you can find out all this with a serial number?

203
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,540
Didn't you know?

204
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,450
It's a limited edition Yolex.

205
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,820
A luxury product of that caliber is even difficult to repair.

206
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,850
Everything is managed carefully, starting from the purchase history.

207
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,430
The purchaser of the 100 million won luxury watch that Yong Jin Sang had was...

208
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,660
As expected, it was Professor Kim Nae Gyeong.

209
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,450
   

210
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,770
What's the favor you want to ask me?

211
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,880
Did you get sued for medical malpractice or something?

212
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,630
I don't even go into the operation room these days. What medical malpractice?

213
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,080
Then?

214
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,120
It's the Hospital Director.

215
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,060
To be more accurate, it's about the Hospital Director's son.

216
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,510
The director's son is currently serving time at Wushin Prison.

217
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,990
Could you release him on parole?

218
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,920
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

219
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,770
Come on, I already looked into everything.

220
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,010
I heard you got Hyangbaek Construction CEO's son released on parole.

221
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,480
Who said that?

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,550
Don't be like that and do me this favor.

223
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,120
I came with a special mission from the Hospital Director.

224
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,440
Isn't this what friends are for?

225
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,160
Give it to me.

226
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,080
- Give you what?
 - When you do surgery,

227
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,780
do you open them up without any examinations?

228
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,330
I should know at least his personal information so I can give you an estimate.

229
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,400
 Kim Nae Gyeong? 
   

230
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,040
The parole examiner, Professor Kim Nae Gyeong,

231
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,650
is colluding with Yonggeol Industries CEO Yong Jin Sang

232
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,180
and abusing the employment-based parole system.

233
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,720
After several children of rich families were released through this parole system,

234
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,380
they were employed by Yonggeol Industries.

235
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,770
 Look down, you bastard! 

236
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,180
 So, he basically received the 
   

237
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,860
bribe in the form of a Yolex watch.

238
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,220
So, you've suspected their corrupt connection already, Attorney Lee?

239
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,810
Through today's operation, I was able to turn the suspicion into conviction.

240
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,850
Operation?

241
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,810
But won't it be difficult to prove the corruption, just because

242
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,940
Professor Kim gave Yong Jin Sang a watch?

243
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,250
That's right. We need conclusive evidence.

244
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,990
And Yong Jin Sang has that evidence.

245
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,140
So, we have to make CEO Yong Jin Sang

246
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,480
hand over that evidence himself.

247
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,070
Great work.

248
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,970
How did it go?

249
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,950
I got out just now, thanks to you.

250
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,050
This is why I told you to quit gambling a long time ago.

251
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,070
In any case, what about my money for the Hyangbaek Construction case?

252
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,170
You just left the police station, and the first thing you do is ask for money?

253
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,300
Shouldn't you lie low for the time being?

254
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,110
 Give me advice after you pay me! 

255
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,570
If you skip out on paying, I won't let you get away with it.

256
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,270
If you don't, I'll expose everything.

257
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,820
Okay, gosh!

258
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,750
You sure have a terrible temper.

259
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,460
There is an item I was asked to handle quickly,

260
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,530
so make room and receive it first.

261
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,180
 I'll pay you everything at once after you take care of that. 

262
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,670
What item is it?

263
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,910
It's a hospital director's son.

264
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,130
 There's one more thing I need to report to you, Chairman. 

265
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,480
 While tracking down Choi Jeong Hak, that cop appeared. 

266
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,250
 - That cop?
 - Yes. 

267
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,980
 It's Inspector An Seo Yun who came and testified at your parole review last time. 

268
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,270
- Director Son.
 - Yes?

269
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,110
Will that bastard get scared a bit

270
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,800
if we slice the throat of that annoying cop like you slice sashimi?

271
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,790
Never mind.

272
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,850
Lee Han Sin runs wild without any fear,

273
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,020
but his Achilles' heel is that guy in prison.

274
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,230
Director Son, go and try to shake him up.

275
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,860
Got it.

276
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,480
- And Attorney Seo,
 - Yes?

277
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,110
Meet with the parole examiners.

278
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,310
Give them what they want so I can pass the parole review right away.

279
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,530
Make sure everything is set in advance.

280
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,140
Yes. I'll make sure to do so.

281
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,100
 The customer is unable to answer your call. 

282
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,540
How dare he not pick up my calls?

283
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,410
   

284
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,910
 The customer is unable to─ 

285
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,210
He's not picking up!

286
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,260
This bastard really is jinsang*.
  ("Annoying" in Korean) 

287
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,140
- Should I go get him?
 - Yeah.

288
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,300
 The customer is unable to answer your─ 

289
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,400
Geez! Stop pressuring me so much.

290
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,200
CEO Yong will be more anxious after going to the police station.

291
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,460
- Let's make him even more nervous.
 - Okay.

292
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,720
How could you come in like this?

293
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,350
We meet again. It's me, Mr. Hwang.

294
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,280
- You remember me, right?
 - Oh, yes.

295
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,240
This time, it's a real inspection.

296
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,220
Director Lee, let's go inside.

297
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,680
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

298
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,310
Didn't she tell me to make room for an item?

299
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,330
I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.

300
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,070
 Hello. The game isn't over, right? 

301
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,400
You!

302
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,860
Why are you here?

303
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,230
- You're that...
 -  I'm from Parole Examiner 

304
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,740
 Lee Han Sin's attorney office. 

305
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,400
I came today as a parole examiner to investigate the correctional partner company.

306
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,440
Then, he is Lee Han Sin?

307
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,590
Yes.

308
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,750
What's going on?

309
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,640
After our preliminary investigation,

310
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,070
we found multiple complaints about unpaid wages filed with the Labor Department.

311
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,620
If you keep this up, the correctional partner company registration will be revoked.

312
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,880
You know that, right?

313
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,750
Also, you have an employee named Oh Yeong Hwan, right?

314
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,860
Where is he right now?

315
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,130
Oh Yeong Hwan is...

316
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,920
His day off.

317
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,640
He took a day off.

318
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,550
- A day off, you say?
 - Yes.

319
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,680
Did he come to work yesterday?

320
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,840
- Sure.
 - So, he came to work, huh?

321
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,760
These are pictures that Oh Yeong Hwan posted on his social media yesterday.

322
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,270
If you look here,

323
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:21,590
he saw a musical and dined at a restaurant with his girlfriend during his work hours.

324
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,890
And he went to a nightclub at night.

325
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,930
He must have been very busy,

326
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,840
yet he came in and worked?

327
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,680
Why did he have to post pictures of himself playing around?

328
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,120
Oh Yeong Hwan was granted parole on the condition of working diligently

329
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,720
at the correctional partner company Yonggeol Industries.

330
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,720
However, he doesn't even come to work

331
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,950
and there's an allegation that you're turning a blind eye because of compensation.

332
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,160
So, the Ministry of Justice will conduct an inspection. Please cooperate.

333
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,150
- Yes, we will start the inspection.
 - Wait, wait, wait.

334
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,820
Hey, hey, take care of him.

335
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,620
H-Hey, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

336
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,100
Let's go out and talk privately.

337
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,100
- I don't have anything to say.
 - Oh, no, that's fine.

338
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,730
Just a moment.

339
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,830
Please come this way.

340
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,390
If you have something to say, please go ahead.

341
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,320
Do I look like a pushover who would put up with this?

342
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,470
What would happen if the world found out

343
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,850
that a practicing attorney and parole examiner is a gambling addict?

344
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,310
You'll blackmail me with the video you secretly recorded of me?

345
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,500
How... do you know that?

346
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,930
 Young lady, give us all a round of drinks. 

347
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,230
 Reset the table! 

348
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,280
CEO Yong, you're at ease only when you obtain video evidence.

349
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,170
You won't be able to use that video.

350
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,910
Why not?

351
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,490
The video clearly shows your face at the gambling ring.

352
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,850
Because it was a sting operation.

353
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:18,260
I asked the Metropolitan Investigation Unit's Inspector An Seo Yun to prove Yang Bok Gyu's innocence.

354
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,090
A sting operation?

355
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,750
Since I didn't encourage or prompt anyone to gamble,

356
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,150
it wasn't an illegal investigation, and will be indemnified.

357
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,560
Damn you!

358
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,880
Oh, right. You took out a gambling loan, right?

359
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,270
President Choi is a very scary and persistent loan shark.

360
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:45,630
You'll have to... pay back your loan.

361
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,870
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

362
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,710
Gosh, what is she trying to do?

363
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,520
Oh, there she is.

364
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,410
Hey, Professor Kim!

365
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,830
Wait, wait, wait!

366
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,080
Wait, wait.

367
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,710
J-Just a moment.

368
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,990
This is my workplace!

369
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,190
Why did you come to school?

370
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,720
So, why didn't you pick up my calls?

371
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,110
Anyway, you know the parole examiner, Lee Han Sin, right?

372
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,130
- Lee Han Sin?
 - He came to my company!

373
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,620
With the Ministry of Justice's Inspection Office staff.

374
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,860
So, what happened?

375
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,060
What else? I'm screwed.

376
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,530
Hey, hey, in any case, can you give me three large bills?

377
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,790
Where would I get that much money?

378
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,260
It's an emergency! Help me out!

379
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,510
Hey, Professor Kim, Professor Kim!

380
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,080
Hey, help me out! It's urgent!

381
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,500
Hey! Hey! Kim Nae Gyeong!

382
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,390
Hey, you little...

383
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,030
She completely ignored me!

384
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,500
What?

385
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,860
Who are you guys?

386
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,500
Who are you?

387
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,140
What's going on?

388
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,020
Damn!

389
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,390
Did you think you'd be fine if you didn't pick up my calls and ignored me?

390
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,100
Are you empty here, or have you gone mad?

391
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,370
I'm sorry.

392
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,700
I'll make sure to pick up your calls next time.

393
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,690
Picking up my calls goes without saying.

394
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,510
So, did you bring the money?

395
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,490
What's this? You didn't even bring the money?

396
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,040
Okay. Why don't you say ah?

397
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,440
- Pardon?
 - I said, open your mouth.

398
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,230
Grab him.

399
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,720
All right, let's eat more.

400
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,420
You know you can eat more.

401
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,740
- No, you can't spit it out.
 - Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

402
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,040
What? Do you have something to say?

403
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,450
I don't understand what you're saying. Spit it out.

404
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,300
I'm supposed to get a large amount of money soon.

405
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,210
If you just give me a little more time...

406
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,860
Time?

407
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,750
How much?

408
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,490
   

409
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,090
And?

410
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,370
 I froze him overnight and sent him home thawed as soon as the sun rose. 

411
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,560
I used my specialty and wrung him out to dry before I let him go.

412
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,790
He must be totally out of it right now.

413
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,060
Okay, thank you.

414
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,180
Enough with the small talk.

415
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,470
Just make sure to pay my guys and me.

416
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,170
Okay.

417
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,320
   

418
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,210
Regarding Inmate 1423.

419
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,070
His recidivism rating is 3,

420
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,710
if he's released on employment-based parole, there could be issues.

421
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,000
- Pushing back a couple more months─ 
- Chief Choi,

422
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,000
you're so fretful, as always.

423
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,740
I'll take care of everything so there won't be any problems, so don't worry.

424
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,130
He's the son of Ohgwang Hospital's director.

425
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,190
I'll make sure to compensate you better this time.

426
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,260
Gosh, I mean...

427
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,110
Who is it?

428
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,670
Hello.

429
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,980
I'm Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin.

430
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,730
I dropped by to say hello─

431
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,190
Professor.

432
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,700
- Hello.
 - What brings you here, Attorney Lee?

433
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,850
I had some business to tend to here,

434
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,220
and I dropped by to say hello to the chief.

435
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,820
You two talk. I'll come back at another time.

436
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,590
Okay.

437
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,630
But let me ask you something, Chief.

438
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,710
I hear that the son of

439
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,550
Ohgwang Hospital's director is at Usin Prison.

440
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,140
Is that true?

441
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,750
Oh, well, that is...

442
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,560
That's right. He's serving his sentence at this prison.

443
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,450
But why are you curious about that?

444
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:01,150
I happened to hear rumors that the son of the Ohgwang Hospital's director

445
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,490
was being released on employment-based parole.

446
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,250
It's probably a false rumor, right?

447
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,290
Probably.

448
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,250
Based on the policy, the child of someone that wealthy

449
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:19,180
would not be considered a candidate for employment-based parole.

450
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,270
But I thought I should at least come and confirm that.

451
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,770
That's right.

452
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,810
Like you said, Attorney Lee...

453
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,090
it's probably a false rumor.

454
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,330
   

455
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:50,640
At this rate, I might get caught up and get screwed.
    

456
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,150
Who is it?

457
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,520
Classification Chief Park.

458
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,080
What brings you here without a call?

459
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,250
Classification Chief Choi,

460
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,540
you really don't know why I came?

461
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,040
 Who? 

462
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,760
Yonggeol Industries CEO Yong Jin Sang?

463
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,870
What about him?

464
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,340
I don't even know who that is.

465
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,510
 Professor, you've got many steps to climb. 
  

466
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,350
 You should take the easy path with Chairman Ji Dong Man. 

467
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,940
Yeah,

468
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,140
I have Ojeong Group.

469
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,150
 The phone is turned off. 

470
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,470
Damn it! Kim Nae Gyeong, that cursed bitch!

471
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,320
She didn't pay me or send the item, and she's not picking up.

472
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,100
Is she ignoring me?

473
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,010
Is she thinking of cutting ties with me?

474
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,450
Gosh, you scared me!

475
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,050
What brings you here so late at night, Parole Examiner?

476
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,450
You didn't hire an attorney yet, did you?

477
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,180
I feel like you'll need one.

478
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,030
Why would I need an attorney?

479
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:33,720
Because Professor Kim Nae Gyeong has cut ties with you.

480
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,320
That's nonsense.

481
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,530
It's not nonsense.

482
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,710
 Who? 

483
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,420
 Yonggeol Industries CEO Yong Jin Sang? 

484
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,640
 What about him? 

485
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,090
 I don't even know who that is. 

486
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,930
 Though Professor Kim Nae Gyeong orchestrated it, 

487
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,740
 since the payment was received through CEO Yong Jin Sang's cousin's account, 

488
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,950
 there's no evidence of Professor Kim's direct involvement. 

489
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,380
 It appears Professor Kim prepared an escape hatch 

490
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,960
 just in case things went south. 

491
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,800
All right,

492
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,860
the table is now set

493
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,940
and you just need to make your decision.

494
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,840
Wait, what decision?

495
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,980
Whether you'll shoulder all the blame

496
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,900
or expose your accomplice and reduce your sentence a bit.

497
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,060
And you got your limited edition Yolex watch from Professor Kim, right?

498
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,260
Pardon?

499
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,150
Like how you secretly filmed me at the gambling ring,

500
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,880
you secretly filmed your transaction with Professor Kim Nae Gyeong.

501
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,250
"Why are the inmates not forced to serve the full sentence

502
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,970
and are released early on parole instead?"

503
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,220
I know there are many complaints like this.

504
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,810
However, the parole system is absolutely necessary.

505
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:11,200
It can be helpful in solving the overcrowding issue in prisons,

506
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,110
and it can also motivate good behavior for early release,

507
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:22,900
which makes it easier to control the inmates.

508
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,780
Thank you for inviting me.

509
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,250
What brings you here, Attorney Lee?

510
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,980
It won't affect you negatively. Why don't you play along?

511
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,990
- What are you doing right now?
 - Just a moment.

512
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,540
Hello, I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin, who is working with

513
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,270
Professor Kim Nae Gyeong as a parole examiner.

514
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,940
I am standing before you today

515
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,250
because Professor Kim invited me to be a special lecturer.

516
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,340
Just a moment.

517
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,730
Let me prepare this first.

518
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,690
Is it here?

519
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,650
Just like the professor said, the parole system is definitely necessary.

520
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:29,190
However, there is also a possibility that the parole system can be abused.

521
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,070
The most common example is the employment-based parole system.

522
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,550
Taking advantage of the less strict review compared to ordinary parole,

523
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:45,650
there was a case of accepting a huge bribe to have the children of rich families

524
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:51,300
released early on parole by getting them hired at a correctional partner company.

525
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,970
By the way, that photo is just an example.

526
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,300
You should stop now.

527
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,620
One of the parole examiners colluded with certain partner companies,

528
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,840
not only by receiving a large sum of money

529
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,660
but also receiving an expensive luxury watch like that one.

530
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,730
Will you guys ever need to give or receive a bribe?

531
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,920
That should never happen, but if you ever face such a situation,

532
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,240
you should never give a rare item

533
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,840
from an expensive luxury watch brand as a bribe,

534
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,980
because it's possible to trace the purchase history clearly.

535
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,690
Anyone who gives such a luxury watch

536
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,230
is stupid. They are stupid.

537
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,360
Okay.

538
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,320
We will end today's class here.

539
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,890
So, shall we talk a bit?

540
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,910
- Shall we?
 - Yes.

541
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,300
 You know Yuguk Pharmaceutical's CEO Seon's son, right? 

542
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,320
 That bastard who drugged girls' drinks, raped them, and took pictures, right? 

543
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,780
 I saw the news. 

544
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,860
 I agreed to have him released on employment-based parole. 

545
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,220
 We have to help someone like that on parole? 

546
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,700
 We're supposed to receive five large bills. 

547
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,950
 - You still don't want to?
 - Come on. 

548
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,290
 You have to listen to the Korean language to the very end. 

549
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,180
 Who said I didn't want to? 

550
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,020
The evidence is conclusive, so it'll be difficult to avoid arrest.

551
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,610
You should turn yourself in, Professor.

552
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,800
   

553
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,320
Hey.

554
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,310
Attention!

555
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,090
Turn around.

556
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,900
Come here and sit down.

557
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,240
One! Two!

558
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,260
Two and a half!

559
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,280
Are your clothes tailor-made? They look good on you.

560
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,940
Why did you come?

561
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,100
I guess both your body and mind are at ease.

562
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,050
You put on weight. Look at how chubby your face is.

563
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,330
I asked you why you're here.

564
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,880
Gosh, seriously.

565
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,670
I came to get my money back.

566
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,870
How can I pay you back when I'm like this?

567
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,500
You'll stick it to me? Whoa, you think I'm too easy.

568
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,960
Whatever!

569
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,390
I don't care, so do as you wish.

570
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,580
Assistant Baek, a few of our guys are studying hard

571
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,300
in the detention centers and prisons, right?

572
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,470
Our guys are ready.

573
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,610
Yeah, show them his face.

574
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,240
I'm so curious what will happen when we show them your face.

575
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,570
All right, let's decide.

576
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,530
Option one, a hellish prison life.

577
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:20,350
Option two, a wise prison life after selling your company to pay me back.

578
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,540
What? Is it unfair that you're about to go broke?

579
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,090
You should've been ready for this when you borrowed my money!

580
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,590
Sit up straight!

581
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:43,460
How much will I get if I sell a company the size of Yonggeol Industries?

582
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,250
Oh, Attorney Lee. It's me.

583
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,140
Have you been well?

584
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,280
You should've called me.

585
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,950
Hey, Yong Jin Sang is in prison,

586
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,090
and Kim Nae Gyeong will turn herself in with the evidence Yong Jin Sang gave you,

587
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,190
so you must feel at ease now that everything's over.

588
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,160
It's not over yet.

589
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,520
I need to resolve all the issues with the parolees left at Yonggeol Industries for it to be truly over.

590
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,480
Attorney Lee, there is no end to your work.

591
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,590
You're not intentionally making more problems for yourself, right?

592
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,190
President Choi, I'll call you back later.

593
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
I heard you were looking for me.

594
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,160
Yes.

595
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,220
Please have a seat.

596
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,220
CEO Yong Jin Sang is currently being investigated and is in custody.

597
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,740
That means...

598
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:02,630
he won't ever threaten you again, Yu Seong Mun.

599
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,090
Is that true?

600
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,630
Yes, he was detained yesterday and is currently at a detention center,

601
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,540
and his company was sold to someone else to pay for his debts.

602
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,640
So, can you tell me

603
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,480
what's been happening up until this point?

604
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,530
I'll help you.

605
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,370
We were like slaves.

606
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,890
 Gosh, my cards got stuck. 

607
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,330
 CEO, did you ask for me? 

608
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,960
 Buy me a pack of cigarettes. 

609
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,560
 You didn't give me enough money. 

610
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,890
 What? So, you won't do it? 

611
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,600
 Do you want to go back to prison? 

612
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,420
 No. 

613
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,260
 This is why they say you don't take in people. 

614
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,940
 I've taken in a criminal who is delinquent to the core. 

615
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,140
He often said degrading slurs at us and made us do all sorts of odd jobs.

616
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,470
 Cheers to the Yonggeol Industry! 

617
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,060
 Cheers! 

618
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,200
 Fill it up, fill it up! 

619
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,080
 It's good, it's good. 

620
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,090
And he didn't even treat us like human beings.

621
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,430
We worked for 16 hours a day without a single day off.

622
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,310
We prayed every night that the machinery would break down.

623
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,010
If so, at least

624
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,320
we could skip one night of late-night work.

625
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,640
And we didn't even receive our wages properly.

626
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,530
All we received was a little allowance money.

627
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,030
Then, one day, Bok Gyu

628
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,150
went to CEO Yong and demanded that he pay us our wages.

629
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,570
 Bok Gyu! Hyeongnim! 

630
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,750
 Let go of me! 

631
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,400
 Why don't you pay us? 

632
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,160
 Did he lose his mind? 

633
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,090
 Yeah. That's right. 

634
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,200
 - I've lost my mind. I've lost it!
 - Hyeongnim! 

635
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,330
 If you make us work like slaves, you should at least pay us! 

636
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,020
 - I need money, so give it to me! 
- Come out! 

637
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,190
 Before I report you to the Labor Department, pay me my wage! Please! 

638
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,300
 - Come out!
 - Pay me! 

639
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,920
He did that because he wanted to buy his grandson a toy.

640
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,110
But this drew the ire of the CEO and...

641
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,840
 I really didn't steal it! 

642
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,190
 I really didn't steal it! 

643
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,380
 No! 

644
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,820
He was falsely accused of being a thief and...

645
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:33,200
   

646
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:41,630
Dad, are you crying?

647
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,260
No, let's go inside.

648
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,590
Let's go.

649
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,190
It's Grandpa. Say hello.

650
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,490
Hello.

651
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,420
H-Hey.

652
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,340
Thank you for the airplane.

653
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,240
 Your father was framed and though it's late. 

654
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,930
 I wanted to let you know that his name was finally cleared. 

655
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,400
 I'm not interested. 

656
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,500
 For me and my family, he has already been dead for a while. 

657
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,070
 It was because of you, Jeong Ho. 

658
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:50,290
 He was afraid of disappointing his son again, 

659
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:56,190
 so he tried to prove his innocence by throwing himself over to die. 

660
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,560
 We found this at the company dorms where your father lived. 

661
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,680
 His coworkers told me he made it himself. 

662
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,660
 Wow, it's an airplane! 

663
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,270
 Ji Hun, do you like it? 

664
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,710
 Yeah. 

665
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,760
 You'd like to play with it? 

666
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,390
 Yeah. 

667
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,970
You're so handsome.

668
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,920
Attorney Lee Han Sin used my weakness

669
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,880
to blackmail me into stopping Chairman Ji's parole.
    

670
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,590
So, if Ojeong Group could do something about him─

671
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,540
 Don't call us again about such unpleasant matters. 

672
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,850
 I'll hang up now. 

673
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,830
What's this?

674
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,030
   

675
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,860
What the heck?

676
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:01,890
Lee Han Sin, you son of a bitch.

677
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,550
Yong Jin Sang, you deserved to be ripped to shreds, you bastard.

678
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,130
Ji Dong Man, Ojeong Group, all of you are dead!

679
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,260
Just wait and see, you f***ers!

680
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,890
What are you looking at?

681
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,030
Who do you think you're looking at, you f***ers!

682
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,940
Haven't you ever seen someone who got cut off? F***!

683
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,420
   

684
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,020
What brings you here?

685
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,230
Would I have any other reason to see you other than his business?

686
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,930
His parole review date is coming up soon.

687
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,890
"His, him..."

688
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:59,810
I can't understand what you're saying because you're only using pronouns.

689
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:03,710
Now that I think about it, you're right.

690
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,750
The person I serve

691
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,480
and the one you used to serve are both in prison.

692
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,250
Also,

693
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,090
both will have their parole reviews soon

694
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:22,220
and we both want the person we serve to be released first.

695
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,430
We share that in common, too.

696
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,770
Is this a threat?

697
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,360
That's right.

698
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,430
It is a threat.

699
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,850
Cheon Su Beom...

700
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,330
If you care about Cheon Su Beom's safety,

701
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,050
stop getting in our way.

702
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:45,110
This is the chairman's last warning.

703
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,220
You remember this spot, right?

704
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,260
   

705
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,680
Lee Han Sin.

706
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,240
Inmate 2777 refused your visitation.

707
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,790
- What's his reason?
 - We wouldn't know.

708
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,510
 Lee Han Sin. 

709
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,170
 He's gone mad because of you 

710
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,570
 and is running wild without any fear. 

711
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,710
 If you don't want to see Lee Han Sin dead, 

712
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,080
 don't act smart. 

713
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:23,570
 Just keep living quietly, as though you don't exist. 

714
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,290
 Do you understand? 

715
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,740
 These aren't just empty threats. 

716
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,450
Chief...

717
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,110
I miss you.

718
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,780
 Dear passengers, 

719
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,190
 we've arrived at Incheon International Airport in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. 

720
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,680
 Please put on your seat belt. 

721
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,240
 When the plane comes to a complete stop, be careful 

722
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,920
 when you open the overhead bins to ensure items do not fall on you. 

723
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,150
He's here, he's here. Hurry, hurry.

724
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,180
Hello.

725
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,750
- Long time, no see.
 - Yes, yes.

726
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,630
You must be tired.

727
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,230
Not at all.

728
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:47,400
My dad finally allowed me to come back.

729
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,000
I couldn't even sleep because I was so excited.

730
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,100
Is that so? I was excited, too. Shall we go? Okay.

731
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,600
All right.

732
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,710
You're probably tired from the long flight,

733
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,130
but I'll take you to Jungbu Prison first.

734
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,480
The chairman told me to bring you to him first.

735
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,460
Gosh, did he tell me to come because something bad happened?

736
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,720
Tell me if you know anything, so I can prepare myself.

737
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,140
I don't think that's the case.

738
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,470
   

739
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,140
Is there a flower shop anywhere?

740
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,010
A flower shop?

741
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,440
He quit coffee and ramen, as well.

742
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,660
He probably can't quit eating rice.

743
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,110
Right, Leo?

744
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:48,070
I'll make you some tasty meat, too.

745
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,020
Who is it?

746
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,600
 It's a flower delivery. 

747
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,490
Flower delivery?

748
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,540
Gosh, seriously.

749
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,890
What's with the flower bouquet?

750
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,830
Who sent this?

751
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,850
Is it Attorney Lee by chance?

752
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,840
He fell for me, huh?

753
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,090
 Ahjumma, it's been a while. 

754
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:25,400
 I'm back in Korea. I'll see you soon. 

755
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,990
   

756
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,230
 Thank you. 

757
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,600
All right, we're here. Please come.

758
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,880
Is something wrong?

759
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,160
I just remembered the past.

760
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,930
You mean when you were in prison...

761
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,680
I'm sorry.

762
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,720
Surprise, Chairman!

763
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,660
I brought him!

764
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,040
- You made it.
 - Yes.

765
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,600
You didn't cause any trouble already, right?

766
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,490
I didn't even have time to.

767
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,230
Be extra careful for the time being.

768
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,800
Don't do anything that would cause even the slightest scandal.

769
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,640
All right.

770
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,850
You will be appointed as the executive director of the Strategic Planning Department.

771
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,620
While you learn the job,

772
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:04,780
keep an eye on the board members until I'm released, so they won't get any ideas.

773
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,320
Okay, thank you.

774
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,470
Wow, the visitation room has gotten so much better these days.

775
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,950
If it's this good, you could probably...

776
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,070
just keep living here.

777
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:22,230
That mouth of yours is always the problem!

778
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,060
I'm sorry.

779
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,120
Is it because he's grown old?

780
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,810
He's nagging even more now.

781
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:42,480
Don't you think so?

782
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,710
Are you sure nothing problematic happened while I was out of the country?

783
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,900
No, nothing like that happened.

784
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,840
Everything's been as I've reported to you.

785
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:54,970
- Attorney Seo.
 - Yes?

786
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,530
Let's go eat some Jjampong (spicy seafood noodle soup).

787
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,260
Jjampong?

788
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,750
I do like  Jjampong.

789
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,910
- Attorney Seo.
 - Yes?

790
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:07,820
Great work today.

791
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,490
Okay. But why, all of a sudden? You said let's get Jjampong together.

792
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:15,400
Attorney Seo, I ate Jjampong with you today and went home, okay?

793
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,300
- You know what I mean, right?
 - Yes.

794
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,450
But what does that mean?

795
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,490
How do I go home?

796
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,320
We're in the middle of nowhere.

797
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,970
Hey.

798
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,300
Do I know what he means? Of course, I don't, bastard! How would I know that?

799
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,900
Hyeong, it's been a while.

800
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,730
Where's Jeong Hak right now?

801
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,110
Come on, don't be like that.

802
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:50,570
The fact that my dad called me back means you caught Jeong Hak.

803
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,770
Take me to Jeong Hak.

804
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,250
I have something to ask that bastard.

805
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,550
Jeong Hak.

806
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,700
How... are you here?

807
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,680
Hyeong.

808
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,390
Why did you trash his face?

809
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,330
I'm sorry.

810
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,420
Jeong Hak,

811
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,790
when did you come back to Korea?

812
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,730
You didn't even tell me.

813
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:49,910
If you had reached out to me as soon as you came back, you wouldn't have ended up like this.

814
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,970
You should be grateful to me.

815
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:57,600
Director Son was going to kill you, and I begged him to spare your life.

816
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,900
Aren't you grateful? You want to repay me, right?

817
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,290
Repay you, my foot.

818
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,420
Hand it over to me.

819
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,070
What?

820
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:15,160
I already handed over all the CCTV footage to Director Son.

821
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,810
Not that.

822
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:20,670
You're much more clever than that, Jeong Hak.

823
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,040
I'm sure you had more than that one.

824
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,830
You recorded a separate footage, right?

825
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,980
- No.
 - Then, you'll die.

826
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,920
You're the only witness.

827
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,620
Are you okay with that?

828
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,310
I knew it.

829
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:50,650
There's no way you wouldn't have left any evidence.

830
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,700
Jeong Hak, I'll give you the money.

831
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,050
Hand it over.

832
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,420
If I hand that over to you, you're going to kill me.

833
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,590
Do you take me for an idiot?

834
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,880
Do you think I'll hand over my lifeline that easily?

835
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,040
Gosh, this lowly scum.

836
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,370
What are you saying?

837
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,520
Hey, if I expose that,

838
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,160
both you and your company are done!

839
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,090
You're nothing without your dad, bastard.

840
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,590
Open the door.

841
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:53,460
Bastard, you'll have to die today.

842
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,260
Geez!

843
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,410
Hey!

844
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,720
Hey, please open the door!

845
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,860
It looks like a suicide.

846
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,580
Correction Officer Lee hasn't changed one bit.

847
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,470
 Han Sin, 

848
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:04,530
 Ji Myeong Seob... is back in Korea.

 Preview 
Choi Jeong Hak died as soon as Ji Myeong Seob came back. Do you think it's a coincidence? 

860
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,030
 I added a few special terms to the contract. 

861
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:55,000
 An inmate? What's this? You want me to become someone's guardian? 

862
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,490
 Executive Director Ji Myeong Seob, you remember me, right? 

863
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:00,090
 And you caused trouble as soon as you came back? 

864
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,390
 Are you out of your mind? 

865
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,440
 She had a baby in prison. 

866
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,440
 You're worse than a beast, you bastard. Die! 

867
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,360
 Do you suspect anyone, if it was a murder? 

868
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,830
 How dare you interrogate me? 

869
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,770
 I'll stop it, no matter what. 

870
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,880
 Let's see what happens.
