00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,580
An attorney, a metropolitan investigation officer, and a loan shark.

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,450
Find out in detail why they're together and what they're plotting.

14
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,720
Chairman, Attorney Lee Han Sin and Chief Cheon Su Beom know each other.

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,930
Cheon Su Beom?

16
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,350
Isn't Cheon Su Beom the correction officer who stopped Myeong Seob's parole?

17
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,880
We drove him out with a false accusation.

18
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,370
That's correct.

19
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,700
He was arrested at the time, and he's still in prison.

20
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,310
While Attorney Lee Han Sin was a correction officer,

21
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,280
he followed Chief Cheon Su Beom like a father.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,720
I wondered why that bastard did that.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,770
I didn't understand why he was acting that way,

24
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,480
but now I understand.

25
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,070
This was his plan all along.

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,720
   

27
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,680
Please make way!

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,480
Excuse us!

29
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,370
That punk who ran wild without fear.

30
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,750
I wonder if he's learned to be fearful now.

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,120
Yes, this should be enough warning for him.

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,040
Did you starve? Why don't you apply more pressure?

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,010
I-I'm sorry.

34
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,150
Gosh, it finally feels like a proper massage.

35
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,790
- Attorney Seo.
 - Yes?

36
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,800
What about the dropping of the charges?

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,070
Oh, about that...

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,290
It's a work in progress.

39
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,950
- Still? 
 - Ms. Choi Won Mi's schedule is so packed, so─

40
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,870
Are you her manager? Why are you managing her schedule?

41
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,490
I'll take care of it.

42
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,540
- Stop acting so scatterbrained and get the charges dropped asap. Got it?
 - Yes.

43
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,350
Gosh, don't massage me in my ticklish areas!

44
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,600
How could this be...

45
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,500
Aigoo, goodness.

46
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,190
Attorney...

47
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,400
Attorney, please wake up.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,610
You can't die like this, please.

49
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,470
Oh, no. Oh, no.

50
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,640
Do you know this person?

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,370
He's my attorney,

52
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,980
but he suddenly got into an accident.

53
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,700
What do we do?

54
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,580
What do we do...

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,530
Why are you here, Attorney?

56
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,680
   

57
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,260
   

58
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,300
Wh-What happened?

59
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,900
I was about to go into my house when they suddenly attacked me.

60
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
If it was just one person, I would've been fine.

61
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,760
But I couldn't handle it, since they were coming at me at once.

62
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,410
How many were there?

63
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,950
Three?

64
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,900
Or was it four? Anyway.

65
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,780
Did you report to the police?

66
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,210
Gosh, why would I report it to the police? It's so obvious who was behind it.

67
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,220
- Chairman Ji Dong Man?
 - Yeah.

68
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,960
I told you messing with Chairman Ji Dong Man could be dangerous!

69
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,270
Gosh, seriously.

70
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,620
 Is it this room? 

71
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,950
- Why did you throw a tangerine?
 - Attorney Lee!

72
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,740
- Oh, my gosh!
 - You're not dead, right?

73
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,160
How did you know to come here, President Choi?

74
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,860
I'm quite interested in Attorney Lee.

75
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,190
Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

76
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,660
Attorney Lee, I'm here.

77
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,330
Who are you?

78
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,680
Do you know me?

79
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,350
Attorney Lee,

80
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,940
you've watched too many dramas.

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,510
Do you suddenly feel reluctant now that it's time to hand over the building?

82
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,460
Building?

83
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,080
I don't understand what you're saying.

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,690
It's okay. You don't need to know.

85
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,260
Assistant Baek, please take out what's in your coat.

86
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,020
Attorney Lee, all you need to do is lend me your thumb.

87
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,110
President Choi!

88
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,600
President Choi, it's you, right?

89
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, now, I remember!

90
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,260
- All of a sudden?
 - Yeah, I suddenly remember.

91
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,780
I haven't finished looking over the contract yet.

92
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,910
Just sign the contract and hand over the building.

93
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,870
I should still review the contract.

94
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,520
Fine then.

95
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,960
Hurry up and look it over.

96
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,790
Also, you better not die before you sign the contract, Attorney Lee.

97
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,800
Say ah.

98
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,790
You eat one, too.

99
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,990
Let's go.

100
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,380
Why are you looking at me like that?

101
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,390
Who are you?

102
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,090
Your acting was too awkward to fool President Choi.

103
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,030
Was it?

104
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,590
I better practice acting a bit more before I meet with Chairman Ji Dong Man.

105
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,220
I can't let it show that he did frighten me a bit with this.

106
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,390
   

107
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,140
People die in car accidents, in a robbery,

108
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,960
and from falling into a manhole.

109
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,560
Human lives are so trivial.

110
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,150
I was surprised to hear you were coming.

111
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Is my visit that surprising?

112
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
I never thought I'd get to see you again.

113
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,160
Of course, I was surprised to hear you were visiting me.

114
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,310
I thought you'd come back as a ghost.

115
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,070
Well, how are you?

116
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,090
Have you come to your senses now?

117
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,400
Did you come to apologize?

118
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,410
Apologies are reserved for when you've done something wrong.

119
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,310
You haven't come to your senses yet.

120
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,690
What brings you here then?

121
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,440
I thought you might be curious about how I'm doing.

122
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,560
As you can see,

123
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,410
I'm fine. I was lucky.

124
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,270
You say you were lucky?

125
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,660
Do you think you're still alive because you're lucky?

126
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,380
I told you, human lives are trivial.

127
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,360
Since I received such a great present,

128
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,640
I'll make sure to repay you soon.

129
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,660
Cheon Su Beom.

130
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,720
You're doing this because you're angry about Cheon Su Beom.

131
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,940
It's all in the past.

132
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,310
Nothing is more foolish than ruining your life over the past─

133
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,570
So, you know.

134
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,110
That's why

135
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,010
I'll see it...

136
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,310
to the end.

137
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,770
That rude bastard.

138
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,030
You may really end up dead at this rate.

139
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,120
Hey! Mr. Yang, come down!

140
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,340
I said come down from there!

141
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,720
 There is a suicide attempt at 127 Yeogok-ri. 

142
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,120
 There is a suicide attempt at 127 Yeogok-ri. 

143
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,510
Wait, isn't that nearby?

144
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,050
 Any patrol cars in the vicinity, go check out the scene. 

145
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,060
Hey, what are you doing?

146
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,740
That's not a case we've been assigned to.

147
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,080
So what if it's not our assignment? There's a life at stake here.

148
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,140
You're slacking off! Seriously.

149
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,570
Turn the car around!

150
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,670
Geez, all right.

151
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,400
It's not me!

152
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,070
I didn't steal it!

153
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,390
Okay!

154
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,760
I got it. Let's talk after you get down here.

155
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,960
Yeah, right!

156
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,260
You won't believe me anyway!

157
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,960
I believe you, I believe you! I believe you!

158
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,530
As if.

159
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,610
I don't believe you.

160
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,760
Do something!

161
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,350
How will you deal with the consequences?

162
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,040
You don't even treat me like a human being

163
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,230
and always threaten me!

164
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,280
I'm innocent!

165
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,620
I'm really innocent!

166
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,780
- What's with you?
 - Sir!

167
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,850
Please calm down. I'm a cop.

168
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,520
What's going on?

169
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,940
There was a bit of a misunderstanding,

170
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,690
but it should be resolved soon.

171
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,430
Hey, hey, hey! Even police officers are here!

172
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,810
Get down here and talk!

173
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,920
I really didn't steal it! I really didn't steal it!

174
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,650
Okay, I got it! I got it!

175
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,960
No! Don't, don't!

176
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,480
Jeong Ho!

177
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,860
Your father is...

178
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,220
I'm so sorry.

179
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,390
No!

180
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,830
   

181
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,630
You're Yang Bok Gyu's probation officer, right?

182
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,200
Yes.

183
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,710
I never expected something like this to happen.

184
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,480
How do I write a report on this?

185
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,300
Did you notice anything off about him recently?

186
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,100
No.

187
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,740
Yang Bok Gyu was hardworking.

188
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,680
He was determined to do his best to turn over a new leaf.

189
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
When was the last time you met Yang Bok Gyu?

190
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,770
Well,

191
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,100
it was about a month ago.

192
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,200
One month?

193
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,380
I have so many probation cases to manage,

194
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,990
and Yang Bok Gyu was granted parole release on the condition of employment.

195
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,820
He's partially managed by a correctional partner company.

196
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,670
Yes, I know you go through a lot.

197
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,540
We also complain when we have tons of cases.

198
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,000
But still, we should still do our job.

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,840
CEO.

201
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,410
Let's talk.

202
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,190
O-Oh, me?

203
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,910
I'll make the coffee. You can get back to work.

204
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,590
Okay.

205
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,700
Aigoo, we have important guests, but I don't have much to offer you.

206
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,520
But I'm well-known for making really good instant coffee.

207
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,390
What kind of employee was Yang Bok Gyu?

208
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,500
Well,

209
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,260
Mr. Yang was a special employee.

210
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,450
Special?

211
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,180
What do you mean by that?

212
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,600
Well, how should I explain this?

213
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,740
- Young Officer, you've been in the military, right?
 - Yes.

214
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,340
Then, you must know about "special-care soldiers."

215
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,510
I do.

216
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,960
Mr. Yang was similar to a special-care soldier.

217
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,280
Since he started working here on the condition of employment for his parole,

218
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,050
he struggled to adjust, so we had to pay special attention to him.

219
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,590
Yang Bok Gyu insisted on his innocence before attempting suicide.

220
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,110
Do you have any guesses as to why?

221
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,530
Well, the thing is...

222
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,140
There was a theft.

223
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,450
You didn't really need to bring that up.

224
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,190
A theft?

225
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,520
Yes.

226
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,680
It's a bit embarrassing.

227
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,360
 What are you doing here at this hour? 

228
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,990
 Oh, the thing is... 

229
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,690
 I was out of coffee. 

230
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,300
 Okay, you may leave. 

231
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,480
 Have a good night. 

232
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,180
 Gosh, this makes no sense! 

233
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,240
 Where did it go? 

234
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,760
 What are you looking for? 

235
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,940
 My watch! 

236
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,260
 I definitely put it in here when I left work, but it disappeared. 

237
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
 A watch? 

238
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,710
 CEO. 

239
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,310
 What are you doing? 

240
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,180
 Can't you tell? 

241
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,880
 I'm digging through a thief's room. 

242
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,440
 Where did you hide my watch? 

243
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,960
 - Did you sell it already?
 - What watch? 

244
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,020
 Why are you asking me about your watch? 

245
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,840
 Why, bastard? I'm asking you because you stole it! 

246
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,710
 Damn it. This is why you should never take ex-convicts. 

247
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,910
 CEO. 

248
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,410
 How dare you look at me defiantly! 

249
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,220
 You got on my nerves as is, so this is perfect. 

250
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,370
 I'll do whatever it takes to send you back to prison. 

251
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,590
 You got that? 

252
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,100
 I really... I really didn't do it! 

253
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,230
 Oh? Look down. Look down, you bastard! 

254
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,420
 I told you it really wasn't me! 

255
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,550
He ran out, screaming that he was innocent and he didn't steal.

256
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,700
Unable to control his temper, he did what he did.

257
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,570
I told him so many times to keep his temper in check, goodness.

258
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,760
Did you find the watch?

259
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,580
I didn't.

260
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,420
Maybe he hid it somewhere really well.

261
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,250
Or maybe he already sold it since it's valuable.

262
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,540
If it's a luxury watch, it must have a serial number.

263
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,860
If you give us the number, we'll look for it.

264
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,820
The serial number?

265
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,950
I'm sure it's somewhere.

266
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,950
Where did I put that again?

267
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,910
Well, I'll look for it.

268
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,500
Yes.

269
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,570
 An important meeting was held between the President and the opposition party leader. 

270
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,460
 This meeting was to discuss important political issues 

271
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,930
 and to consider plans for future collaboration. 

272
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,850
- You're early.
 - Seonbae, please come in.

273
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,040
What's wrong with your arm?

274
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,800
Oh, I just fell.

275
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,550
It'll get better soon.

276
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,130
- Are you okay?
 - Of course.

277
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,560
By the way, I said I'd buy you something expensive.

278
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,780
Why insist on coming here?

279
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,960
I craved pork rinds from this place since it's been a while.

280
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,820
It's been a while. It's nice.

281
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,130
Ma'am, please give us some pork rinds.

282
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,760
 Okay. 

283
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,950
By the way, what about Hae Seong? How's Hae Seong doing?

284
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,820
The surgery went well, and he's gotten much better.

285
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,690
- That's good to hear. 
  - According to the experts... 

286
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,790
Seonbae, if you're grateful, just say so.

287
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,840
Fine. Thanks.

288
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,590
Does it make you happy to hear me say thanks?

289
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,600
Of course, it does.

290
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,670
 Bringing you the next news. 

291
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,520
 There was a suicide attempt at an SME* today. 
  (Small to medium-sized enterprise) 

292
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,510
 The police determined that a worker, released on parole on condition of employment, 

293
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,550
 was accused of being a thief, but he claimed his innocence before attempting suicide. 

294
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,770
 The suicidal worker was immediately transported to the hospital 

295
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,870
 but is currently reported to be unconscious. 

296
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,710
That's why ex-convicts are a problem.

297
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,420
Why do they keep releasing people like him on parole?

298
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,940
He should complete his sentence.

299
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,770
Regular people have a tough time finding jobs as is,

300
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,670
and yet they release ex-convicts and find them employment?

301
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,310
It's absolutely ridiculous.

302
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,690
It's so unfair for those who aren't convicts!

303
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,400
 To solve prison overcrowding issues, the Ministry of Justice... 

304
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,590
You also know Yang Bok Gyu, right?

305
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,020
Yes, I do.

306
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,700
He was recently released on parole on condition of employment.

307
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,000
He promised to take it as his last chance and live diligently.

308
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,680
Seonbae, did you actually believe that?

309
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,360
Do you know why I'm such a regular at this pork rind restaurant?

310
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,110
When you keep chewing on the pork rinds,

311
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,540
you can taste the different flavors, from sweet to bitter.

312
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,890
Inmates are the same.

313
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,900
If you watch them for a long time,

314
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,760
you learn things you didn't know about them.

315
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,110
The true nature of who they are, hidden beneath

316
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,730
their label as ex-convicts.

317
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,950
But what's there could be fake, too.

318
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,750
They could pretend to repent and act like they've changed,

319
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,040
but they haven't in reality.

320
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,900
We've seen so many like that.

321
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,820
Yeah, you're right.

322
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,770
But Yang Bok Gyu was different.

323
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,510
Also, something bothers me about it.

324
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,730
What's bothering you?

325
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,630
 My son will be born soon. 

326
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,570
 Is that so? Congratulations─ 

327
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,400
 That's why... 

328
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,290
 I... I'm... 

329
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,710
 really going to sever ties with you. 

330
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,250
 I don't want my son to know he has a grandfather like you. 

331
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,210
 I'll tell my son that his grandfather died. 

332
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,890
 And I'll consider you dead as well, 

333
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,500
 so don't make promises you can't keep and live however you want. 

334
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,280
 Jeong Ho... 

335
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,990
 Jeong Ho! 

336
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,150
 Correction Officer, 

337
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,420
 let me see my son just one more time. 

338
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,460
 This time... 

339
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,730
 This time may be the last. 

340
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,500
 Just one more time. 

341
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,660
 - It won't be your last.
 - Pardon? 

342
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,260
 If you change, 

343
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,910
 you will have an opportunity to meet your son again. 

344
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,730
 Will I really have another opportunity? 

345
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,650
 Yes. 

346
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,350
 If you truly repent and change. 

347
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,200
   

348
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,760
Attorney Lee?

349
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,380
Oh, that's great. Great pose! One more time.

350
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,850
That's good. One more time.

351
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,370
Okay, that's good.

352
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,670
This time, let's do a Justice Girl pose.

353
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,140
Okay.

354
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,370
Ready.

355
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,430
I will defend justice.

356
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,490
Defend justice.

357
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,830
Defend justice, yeah. You're doing great.

358
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,910
Gosh, you're all doing great. Wow, there are so many people here.

359
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,810
I will defend justice!

360
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,580
Man, I wish you'd stop with this kind of concept.

361
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,120
- Who are you to be doing this? 
- Me?

362
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,200
No need to be curious about that.

363
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,920
Everyone, take a 10-minute break and leave the room.

364
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,330
- Get coffee.
 - I'm sorry.

365
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,070
Why did you come all the way here again?

366
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,840
I came to check your schedule.

367
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,900
How ridiculous. People would think you're my manager.

368
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,310
Looks like you're free tomorrow. Go with me to drop the charges.

369
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,410
No, I can't. I have my own personal schedule tomorrow.

370
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,650
What personal schedule?

371
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,210
Why would I tell you that?

372
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,230
- Do it next week.
 - Next week is no good.

373
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,830
Why can't I do it next week?

374
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,460
I can't really explain the reasons.

375
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,960
In any case, you need to drop the charges this week. You have to.

376
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,180
You said you checked my schedule!

377
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,140
You know I have work every day this week!

378
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,790
Just cancel what you're doing tomorrow and go with me to drop your charges!

379
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,340
I don't care about anything else!

380
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,910
Just go!

381
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,840
What brings you here?

382
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,410
I came for an inspection.

383
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,770
An inspection?

384
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,350
What department are you from?

385
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,010
The Ministry of Justice.

386
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,630
A worker here recently attempted suicide by throwing himself over, right?

387
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,700
I'm here about that case.

388
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,100
Well, let me call the CEO first.

389
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,970
Stop right there.

390
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,600
Don't you know what an inspection is?

391
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,240
I'll look around quietly, so you don't have to call him.

392
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,860
Oh, okay.

393
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,980
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

394
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,980
Your acting has improved.

395
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,130
I practiced acting while watching dramas.

396
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,590
In any case, where is the CEO's office?

397
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,680
Is that it?

398
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,030
So, I'll look around inside,

399
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,880
and you go directly to the CEO's office.

400
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,360
- Me?
 - Yes, while I meet with the employees,

401
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,630
please keep CEO Yong busy.

402
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,740
Also, ask CEO Yong some questions and see what he says.

403
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,850
Okay, sure. Got it.

404
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,770
Is anyone here?

405
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,580
 Why are you doing this? 

406
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,660
Come on, I told you not to worry. Why do you keep doing this?

407
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,200
You're a professor who knows the law so well. Why would you get scared about that?

408
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,100
Who are you?

409
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,330
Oh, hello.

410
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,920
- I'm here from the Ministry of Justice.
 - J-Justice?

411
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,510
- Hang up, hang up.
 - The Ministry of Justice?

412
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,890
- Yes.
 - Why would the Ministry of Justice...

413
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,840
Well, it was for an inspection.

414
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,110
Oh, I see. Please take a seat.

415
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,250
- Okay.
 - Please take a seat.

416
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
- Please enjoy.
 - Thank you.

417
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,830
You must be tired coming all the way here.

418
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,220
I'm Yonggeol Industry CEO Yong Jin Sang.

419
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,710
Yes. I'm Hwang Ji Sun.

420
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,690
It's nice to meet you.

421
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,320
What brings you to my company from the Ministry of Justice?

422
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,280
Yes, I'm from the Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin's attorney office.

423
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,410
I'm here because I have a few questions regarding

424
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,630
the parolee working at Yonggeol Industry, who attempted suicide.

425
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,830
You came because of that, I see.

426
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,940
If you have any questions, please ask away.

427
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,940
By chance, is it okay if I film this like an interview?

428
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,500
The basics of inspection entail evidence collection.

429
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,350
O-Oh, okay, go ahead. Film it as you please.

430
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,920
Okay. Thank you.

431
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,960
   

432
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,330
Yang Bok Gyu.

433
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,730
You must know him.

434
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,210
Hello, I'm Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin.

435
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,380
Why didn't you do anything when Yang Bok Gyu stole

436
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,290
the CEO's expensive watch?

437
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,450
The possibility of that didn't cross my mind, then.

438
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,650
After learning that the CEO's watch was missing,

439
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,610
I realized that's what Mr. Yang was up to then.

440
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,930
Basically, we were blindsided.

441
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,610
I set the deck to forget his past mistakes and live well

442
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,740
and yet, he caused trouble again.

443
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,880
"Set the deck"?

444
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,070
Oh, I guess I must have misspoken.

445
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,250
I was trying to say we provided

446
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,290
the perfect environment for him to adjust to life after being released.

447
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,950
I see.

448
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,250
But did you come by yourself?

449
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,830
Oh, no. The Parole Examiner came as well.

450
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,250
He said he would come here after meeting with the employees first.

451
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,650
No, it's all right.

452
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,140
Let him meet the employees.

453
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,750
Were you close to Yang Bok Gyu?

454
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,130
Well, somewhat.

455
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,840
We used the same dorm.

456
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,470
I heard it's been about six months since you started working here

457
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,910
after being released on parole on the condition of employment.

458
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,620
Are you facing any discomfort or difficulties?

459
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,820
Not at all.

460
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,030
The CEO treats us well and takes good care of us.

461
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,690
 Inspector, did Yang Bok Gyu say or do anything strange 

462
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,630
 before attempting suicide? 

463
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,030
 You won't believe me anyway! 

464
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:11,050
 You don't even treat me like a human being and always threaten me! 

465
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,350
 Threaten... 

466
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,430
 I think he said he was being threatened. 

467
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,100
I heard Yang Bok Gyu said he was being

468
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,210
threatened before he jumped off.

469
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,420
Have you heard or do you know anything about that?

470
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,720
It's okay. You can tell me.

471
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,550
To tell you the truth...

472
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,190
Hey! Yu, what are you doing over there?

473
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,350
- No, he never received threats.
 - Hey, come over here! Geez, seriously.

474
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,860
Yes, yes, I'm coming!

475
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,910
Come here.

476
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,770
You should be working right now!

477
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,840
 I set the deck to forget his past mistakes and live well 

478
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,070
 and yet, he caused trouble again. 

479
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,990
Set the deck?

480
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,500
Huh? Do you know that saying, too, Attorney?

481
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,870
It's a slang used by gamblers.

482
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,930
It means to set the table for a game.

483
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,930
By chance...

484
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,010
I used to be a correction officer.

485
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,650
Oh, right, right.

486
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,830
But did you find anything strange about CEO Yong?

487
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,000
Something strange, you say.

488
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,170
Well, I shook hands with CEO Yong

489
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,230
and noticed his hands were very soft, unlike his appearance.

490
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,400
It was unnaturally soft.

491
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,030
He's definitely a gambler, then.

492
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,400
- A gambler? 
- Yes.

493
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,330
Of course, your hands get shiny and soft if all you do is look at cards like this.

494
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,020
That's it.

495
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,240
The company is small and struggling, but the CEO is draped in luxury goods.

496
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,130
Where do you think he got the money?

497
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,280
Now that I think about it, the luxury watch that was supposedly stolen

498
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,060
seems a bit out of the league for a factory CEO.

499
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,100
Let's change our destination.

500
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,130
To where?

501
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,780
Let's go to President Choi.

502
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,480
Why do you want to meet President Choi?

503
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,010
If we don't go, she'll come to our office.

504
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,430
Her office is in the opposite direction, though.

505
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,480
I won't ask you to come inside with me, so let's go.

506
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,200
Then, I'll take you there right away.

507
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,630
♪ It's drifting away ♪

508
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,700
♪ Where my love is ♪

509
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,830
♫     ♫

510
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,250
Gosh, Attorney Lee, you're here!

511
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,570
Come in, come in.

512
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,750
If you didn't come by today, I was going to pay you a visit.

513
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,670
Aigoo. That's why I came to visit you first.

514
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:15,040
Gosh, Attorney Lee. Not only are you handsome and smart, you're so quick-witted.

515
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,970
Assistant Baek, what did we do with the contract from last time?

516
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,350
What do you mean, contract?

517
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,610
Oh, oh, that contract.

518
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,350
I haven't had a chance to look through the contract yet.

519
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,840
Attorney Lee, I think your jokes are going too far.

520
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,150
No, no, wait, wait.

521
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,130
I've prepared something else for you instead.

522
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,120
Something else, what?

523
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:44,150
Let me introduce you to a guest.

524
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,950
He's what you call an "Easy Target" around here.

525
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:51,150
He's a CEO of a SME who loves to gamble.

526
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,790
Gamble?

527
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,440
Are you saying I should open a gambling house

528
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,770
and swindle him out of his money?

529
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,310
Yes, that's right.

530
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,190
Are you... not feeling it?

531
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,130
Yeah, honestly, I'm not feeling it.

532
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,940
That requires a lot of work and is inconvenient.

533
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,510
W-Wait.

534
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,710
He's an Easy Target with a lot of money.

535
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,500
A lot?

536
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,070
Gosh, I'm hungry.

537
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,680
When is the attorney coming back?

538
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,700
It's not like he went on a date with President Choi.

539
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,550
What the heck... He said we should eat together.

540
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,160
Attorney Lee! I'm in big trouble, Attorney Lee!

541
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,530
Aigoo, what brings you here, Ms. Choi?

542
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,940
Where did Attorney Lee go? He didn't pick up his calls, either.

543
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,530
He went out to take care of some business. But what brings you here?

544
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,050
I need to meet Attorney Lee right now.

545
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,870
Attorney Seo came all the way to my photo shoot and threatened me.

546
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,330
T-Threatened you?

547
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:57,110
Yes. He said if I don't drop the charges by tomorrow, he would─

548
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,750
What did he say he would do if you didn't?

549
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,340
Attorney Lee!

550
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,980
- Oh, yes, Ms. Choi, let's sit down and talk.
 - Y-Yes... Ms. Choi...

551
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,210
So, he pressured you to drop the charges specifically by tomorrow?

552
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,710
Yes. I told him several times that I won't,

553
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,550
but he's like a brick wall. Nothing I say gets through to him.

554
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,970
There is a reason why Attorney Seo is rushing you.

555
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,420
Why?

556
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,300
A candidate like Chairman Ji, whose parole review was suspended, needs to reapply.

557
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,120
That means he needs to start over from the preliminary review.

558
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,580
The deadline to drop the charges

559
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,590
is the day before the preliminary review held once a month.

560
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,500
And that preliminary review is this week.

561
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,710
So, if I delay dropping the charges by one more day,

562
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,320
Ji Dong Man's parole will be delayed by another month?

563
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,270
Yes, that's right.

564
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,300
No wonder he was being so fierce.

565
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,670
If Ji Dong Man is enraged, forget my Justice Girl image.

566
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,310
He'll kill me.

567
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,590
Would it be better to just drop the charges?

568
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,670
Attorney Lee, say something!

569
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,380
How about you go on a trip instead?

570
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,100
What trip all of a sudden?

571
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,420
Trips are fun when you take off out of the blue.

572
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,890
Not somewhere too close. It would be good if you go somewhere far.

573
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,520
Actually, I do have a photo shoot in Italy.

574
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,740
Hey!

575
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,240
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

576
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,670
Gosh, this is driving me nuts!

577
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,360
She's not home and isn't picking up her calls. Where is she?

578
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,540
Did she go into hiding so she doesn't have to drop the charges?

579
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,360
Gosh, damn it.

580
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,700
Gosh, this is driving me crazy!

581
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,610
Where is she?

582
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,580
So, did you look into where Choi Won Mi is?

583
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,520
Photo shoot? She already did that yesterday.

584
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,880
She's going to Italy? When?

585
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,720
Today? What time today?

586
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,280
Oh, okay. Hang up.

587
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,830
Gosh, damn it! This is driving me insane!

588
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,120
No, no, move, move!

589
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,690
Gosh, seriously!

590
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,090
Move, move, move!

591
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,160
Move, move!

592
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,190
Hey, stop right there!

593
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,410
Come here, come here! Wait, wait!

594
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,370
You thought I couldn't catch you, huh?

595
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,150
- What's wrong with you!
 - What do you mean?

596
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,740
What the...

597
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,780
Did you put on a disguise? Your disguise looks so real.

598
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,190
Are you crazy?

599
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,580
What are you doing?

600
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,100
Mr. Hwang, why are you here?

601
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,590
- What?
 - Where's Choi Won Mi?

602
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,020
Why are you looking for her here?

603
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,680
I asked where Choi Won Mi was!

604
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,800
This man keeps touching me!

605
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,780
- This man? 
 - Yes!

606
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,370
It's not that. I thought I knew her and touched her.

607
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,480
Where's Choi Won Mi! Choi Won Mi!

608
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,910
No, Choi Won Mi! Where's Choi Won Mi?

609
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,650
You know everything! Don't hold my feet! Let go of me!

610
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,710
Hey, Choi Won Mi!

611
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,650
It's nice to come out to the outskirts, right?

612
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,900
Yes.

613
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,360
It feels like my headache has vanished.

614
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,630
But are you okay?

615
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,590
Oh, yes.

616
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,400
♫  The morning comes to me and extends its hand  ♫

617
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,100
 No, Choi Won Mi! 

618
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,790
 Hey, where's Choi Won Mi? 

619
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:00,560
-  You know everything! Don't hold my feet! Let go of me!  
- I'm right here!

620
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,660
 Choi Won Mi! 

621
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:09,690
♫  It doesn't leave me  ♫

622
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,320
Here we are.

623
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,900
We're here. Italy.
    

624
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,040
Oh, my. It really is Italy.

625
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,420
Attorney Lee, you're so tactful.

626
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,250
You're so cool.

627
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,350
Take it easy, then. I'll give you a call later.

628
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,120
Hey, Attorney Lee.

629
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,330
You must be tired from driving.

630
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,190
Do you want to have some ramen before you go?

631
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,200
I would like to,

632
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,150
but I quit ramen.

633
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,140
Come on, how about coffee?

634
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,700
I quit that, too.

635
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,920
- You drank three or four cups last time at your office.
 - Come to my office, then.

636
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,770
Okay.

637
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,440
Drive safely.

638
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,130
   

639
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,910
Are you saying my parole review was delayed because you couldn't sway her?

640
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,870
Yes. That's how it turned out.

641
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:39,590
So, Attorney Seo, you're telling me I have to waste another month locked up here?

642
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,920
Yes, that is correct.

643
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,230
I told you to take care of it meticulously.

644
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,080
What are you capable of handling?

645
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,570
I'm sorry.

646
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,540
And you still haven't found Choi Jeong Hak?

647
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,860
We're still searching, but we haven't found him yet.

648
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,160
You also let Choi Jeong Hak get away last time, right?

649
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,650
Yes.

650
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,910
It doesn't have much meat on it, but it's a waste to throw it away.

651
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,950
This is... what you call a chicken rib.

652
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,340
Take it.

653
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,680
   
   

654
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,140
- Pardon?
 - I said, take it.

655
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,610
Okay.

656
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,200
Hold it up to your face. Like this.

657
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,760
- Like this?
 - It suits you.

658
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,770
If you weren't Chief Seo's nephew, I would've already fired you.

659
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,660
I can't stand the sight of you. Get out!

660
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:52,280
Make sure to take care of Choi Jeong Hak, so he doesn't become a hindrance to Myeong Seob.

661
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,710
Chicken rib?

662
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,110
What are you looking at?

663
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,650
Let us... do our job properly.

664
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,960
I'll handle my business, so don't worry about me.

665
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,200
Worry about your job.

666
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,550
Attorney Seo, how long do you think he'll be patient with you?

667
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,870
I'm talking about the chairman.

668
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,130
You got a call.

669
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,010
Yeah, are you ready?

670
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,810
It's about time the drug is wearing off for the druggie.

671
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,230
Report to me when you have found his location.

672
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,580
Seriously, he's an ex-gangster.

673
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,670
How dare he try to lecture me?

674
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,360
They found his location?

675
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,980
I'm getting stressed from both sides. It's driving me nuts!

676
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,380
   

677
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,550
Seonbae, Seonbae!

678
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,470
- His phone turned on.
 - What?

679
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,580
Choi Jeong Hak!

680
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,070
- Really?
 - Yes.

681
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,120
   

682
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,550
Let's go.

683
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,150
Sir.

684
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,600
Sir, we're here.

685
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:20,310
Shit, what the...

686
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,920
What are you doing over there?

687
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
What's this?

688
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,940
- Jeong Hak. 
- Who are you?

689
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,010
That's not drugs. It's flour.

690
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,350
What's this?

691
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,980
Who are those bastards?

692
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,090
- Who are you to stop me?
 - You can't go in here.

693
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,020
Don't you see the warning sign?

694
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,380
Leave.

695
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,040
I told you to leave.

696
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,610
What a couple of morons.

697
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,690
- Ju Mok.
 - Yes.

698
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,640
I'm your opponent.

699
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,550
Hey... gosh!

700
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,310
You bastard!

701
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,240
Hey, you bastard!

702
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,910
Stop!

703
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,730
Goodbye, you druggie bastard.

704
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,090
Hey, Helmet!

705
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,630
I guess we were meant to cross paths.

706
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,930
We meet here again.

707
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,450
That bastard!

708
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,610
Gosh, I'm screwed.

709
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,650
Damn it! That rat!

710
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,800
Why have you been so out of touch?

711
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,760
So, what's up?

712
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,000
Something going on?

713
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,710
What?

714
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,380
You found one?

715
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,350
Okay!

716
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,370
Aigoo, you scared me! Why would you shout?

717
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,600
Anyway, I prepared the location and easy targets.

718
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,890
Just come on time with sufficient funds.

719
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,850
I'll send you the location through text. Yeah, yeah.

720
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,550
How long has it been since I went to a gambling house?

721
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,920
My fingers are itching to go already!

722
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,110
What the... This is it?

723
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,220
Gosh, I can't be lacking in funds.

724
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,930
Hello.

725
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,620
Why are you calling me at this hour?

726
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,470
Professor. I have an emergency.

727
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,960
When will you pay me for the last job?

728
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,460
Payment? How can you say that after handling it like that?

729
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,380
I told you to quietly make room for one more,

730
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,670
and the police showed up and drew the media.

731
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:29,450
So, are you saying you won't give me my money?

732
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,030
Right now isn't the time to talk about money.

733
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,880
What else would we talk about, then?

734
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,590
To be blunt, is that all my fault?

735
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,340
Hiring and raising a parolee doesn't do much for me.

736
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,620
All that happened because you said to open a spot for Hyangbaek Construction CEO's son!

737
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,030
Stop bringing up Hyangbaek Construction!

738
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:52,410
Wait, are you trying to keep all the money from Hyangbaek Construction for yourself?

739
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,830
So, that's what's going on!

740
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:56,560
Shit.

741
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,230
H-Hello?

742
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:02,920
Gosh, this is why I can't deal with such an ignorant low-life.

743
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,920
What the heck?

744
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,580
Crazy. What a freak.

745
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,040
 - The customer isn't answering the phone right now. 
 - Oh-ho?

746
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,510
 After the beep... 

747
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,850
Is she really trying to skip out on my money?

748
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,150
Geez, what would I gamble with later?

749
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,460
With the uptick in retaliatory crimes against people involved in cases, 
    

750
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,540
the Criminal Procedure Act was partially amended in 2016.

751
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,270
New personal information protection measures for case-related individuals, including victims,

752
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,380
were introduced to view and copy litigation records.

753
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,140
 There are rumors that Professor Kim Nae Gyeong is abusing 

754
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,900
 employment-based parole to get the children of rich families out of prison sooner. 
  

755
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,800
 Come on. I told you, you don't have to worry. 

756
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,280
 You're a professor who knows the law so well. Why would you get scared about that? 

757
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,040
 Gosh, how did you know this? 

758
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,940
 As you said, Oh Yeong Hwan, the son of Hyangbaek Construction's CEO, 

759
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,360
 got hired by Yonggeol Industries after his parole. 

760
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,860
The judge ensured that the personal info of individuals involved in the case,

761
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,160
such as their names, wouldn't be disclosed.

762
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,500
So, in 2016, we...

763
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,560
Inspector, it's me, Lee Han Sin.

764
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,640
I want you to repay me today for my bribe from last time.

765
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,780
Could you look into CEO Yong Jin Sang of Yonggeol Industries?

766
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,750
Also, well, what are you doing tonight?

767
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,910
Hey, Attorney Lee. Welcome.

768
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,470
That was quick.

769
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,770
When did you finish preparing all this?

770
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,090
Easy Targets need to be taken advantage of quickly.

771
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,080
He's the gambling house manager that Easy Target contacts often.

772
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,180
I thought he would get suspicious if the location changed,

773
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,150
so I requested the house manager's cooperation.

774
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:07,610
Cooperation? Are you sure you didn't threaten him?

775
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,010
Threats or cooperation. What difference does it make?

776
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,560
It's important that he agreed to help us, right?

777
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,220
Oh, yes, o-of course.

778
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,690
You don't need to worry at all.

779
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,390
All right.

780
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,150
Here are the players I recruited. Say hi.

781
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,520
I'm Red Ear from Chungcheong.

782
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,580
Hey, don't lower your voice.

783
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,170
He's Red Ear because his ears are red.

784
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:36,260
I'm Half Ear from Jeju.

785
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,640
Hurry up and turn your head. This looks terrible.

786
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,080
He got caught cheating while gambling, and half of his ear got cut off.

787
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,330
He's only got half an ear left, so he's called Half Ear.

788
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,540
- President Choi, a moment.
 - Yeah? Me?

789
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,450
What about the players' skills?

790
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,680
They're not top-notch since I had to recruit them quickly.

791
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,770
Still, they should be good enough to swindle an Easy Target.

792
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,040
But, Attorney Lee.

793
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,910
You didn't ask me to do all this for just a little bit of interest from this gambling ring, right?

794
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,230
Of course not.

795
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,400
- I wish you great earnings.
 - Thank you.

796
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,980
- What an awesome vibe.
 - What took you so long?

797
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,470
It was tough to recruit players. How could you make them wait?

798
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,890
Bastard, stop with the nagging.

799
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,620
Come here.

800
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,410
You checked their background, right?

801
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:12,450
I recruited especially easy targets.

802
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:15,450
Make sure to pay me plenty for giving you a seat.

803
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,910
Okay.

804
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,810
- Where's my seat?
 - It's over there.

805
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,920
Then, shall we get started?

806
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,000
Here's a VIP.

807
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,620
It's nice to meet you. I see you've won a lot.

808
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,670
Let's get started right away.

809
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,590
Let's go.

810
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,900
- Fighting!
 - Okay.

811
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,950
Why, what? Are you waiting for a call?

812
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,590
No, it's just habit.

813
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,270
By the way, Attorney Lee,

814
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:12,880
though it was cumbersome, I am grateful you brought me an easy target.

815
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,040
But what do you gain from this, Attorney Lee?

816
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,370
The truth.

817
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,680
The truth?

818
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,990
The truth that will clear the false charges against

819
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,620
Yang Bok Gyu, an employment-based parolee.

820
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,910
The truth that will clear his name.

821
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,470
I have no idea what you're saying, but to sum it up,

822
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:40,480
he's not just an easy target, but an evil easy target?

823
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,810
Yes, that's right.

824
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,500
Okay.

825
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,690
Stop right there!

826
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,780
Are you cheating right now?

827
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,610
- What are you doing?
 - Do I look like a fool to you?

828
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:05,630
How dare you play tricks?

829
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:08,050
This crazy bastard is making up stories!

830
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,370
D-Do you have any proof?

831
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,080
Proof?

832
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,040
I do.

833
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:22,980

834
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:30,530
How could you call yourself a gambler and still not know you'll see blood if you get caught cheating?

835
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,270
Sorry, sorry.

836
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,570
 Do I look like a pushover just because I'm short? 

837
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:48,590
I still won bronze in the Super Flyweight category at the 2000 National Sports Festival, you bastard!

838
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:52,330
 How dare you try to cheat? 

839
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,500
Are you sure you recruited the right players?

840
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,400
I told you I was rushed.

841
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,730
And you can't blame me right now. We need to fix this situation first.

842
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:03,400
I don't think you can fix this situation.

843
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,000
 It ruined my mood just because of this cheating asshole. 

844
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,910
I'm taking all of your gambling money.

845
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,020
That bastard.

846
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,370
 Be careful who you let in! 

847
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,500
 How dare you bring in a cheater? 

848
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,830
 Hey, over here! 

849
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:28,670
Hello. The game isn't over, right?

850
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,670
Yes, join us.

851
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:33,630
Geez. I'm late because I got lost in the area.

852
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,640
Thank you.

853
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,070
What is this?

854
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,810
Did you recruit more easy targets?

855
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,890
Huh? Yeah.

856
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:46,630
He said he was running late. Here he is.

857
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,280
The more easy targets there are, the better.

858
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,970
I'll be pulling out now.

859
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,510
Let's set the table again.

860
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,890
Young lady, give us all a round of drinks.

861
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,210
Reset the table!

862
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,170
Please distribute the cards while the game is still hot.

863
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,700
Wow, new guy.

864
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,070
You may be bad with directions, but you sure have a fiery personality.

865
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,380
Let's do so, then.

866
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,020
Hey. Let's proceed quickly. Go.

867
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,460
Well then, we'll get started.

868
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,260
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

869
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,500
♫  You’re going to lose so many, uh  ♫

870
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,870
♫  Cover your eyes and hide  ♫

871
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,720
♫  I'll show you  ♫

872
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,500
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

873
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,540
♫  You don’t deserve what you own now  ♫

874
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,090
♫  You can push me away and try to hold me off   ♫

875
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:49,680
♫  It won't work on me, Megalomaniac  ♫

876
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,120
   

877
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,060
 Preview 
All right, everyone, freeze! 

878
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,530
 What kind of situation is this? 

879
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,920
 If you caught that bastard, tell Myeong Seob to return. 

880
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,120
 Ahjumma, it's been a while. 

881
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,520
 Will you guys ever need to give or receive a bribe? 

882
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,410
 I said, open your mouth. 

883
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:14,130
 Lee Han Sin's Achilles' heel is that guy in the prison. 

884
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:18,020
 If I expose that, both you and your company are done! 

885
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,280
 Is that a threat? 

886
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,700
 You remember this spot, right? 

887
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,580
 You didn't hire an attorney yet, did you? I feel like you'll need one.
