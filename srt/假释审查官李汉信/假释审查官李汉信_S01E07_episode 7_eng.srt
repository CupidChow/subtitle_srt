1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,360
   

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,060
   

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,260
   

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,860
   

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,020
   

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,970
   

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,010
   

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,020
   

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,090
   

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,000
If you do something like this one more time, I won't let it slide. 
    

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,990
Bribery really isn't working on you.

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,760
Is it not enough?

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,890
Should I give you some more?

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,810
You'll never leave this place

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,790
until you complete your sentence.

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,840
Are you sure about that?

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,920
In my opinion, you'll soon regret this.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,020


19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,600
Mr. Cheon Su Beom.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,500
We're the police. Come with us.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,420
- What?
 - What's going on?

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,710
You need to tell me what this is about!

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,620
- Let go of me! 
- Seonbaenim!

24
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,350
What are you doing right now?

25
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,540
There must be some misunderstanding!

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,680
- Our chief did nothing wrong! 
- Han Sin!

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,900
- Hyeong. 
- Don't worry about me!

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,670
I'll be back soon!

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,680
- Chief!
 - Don't worry about me!

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,030
Sir.

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,440
Hey, you came. You guys can head inside.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,000
Things are so hectic right now.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,330
What do the police say?

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,590
They suddenly barged in, saying it was an emergency arrest.

35
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,720
- I don't know much, either.
 - What's the situation?

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,860
I wish I had a say, but I don't.

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,090
In any case, I'll look into it.

38
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,980
But don't get your hopes up, Correction Officer Lee.

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,680
Let me look into it.

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,910
Gosh, seriously.

41
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,300
It doesn't make any sense that Chief Cheon dealt drugs in the prison.

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,220
That's why you should know when to cave in when you're up against a strong force.

43
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,450
Hey, you can't judge a book by its cover.

44
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,850
Do you think the police would've arrested him without any evidence?

45
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,400
Just like that?

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,910
What are you guys saying?

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,930
Did you see it yourself?

48
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,220
Did you see him smuggling drugs with your own eyes?

49
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,540
I told you to be quiet.

50
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,710
You all know Chief Cheon would never do that!

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,370
- Han Sin.
 - Yes.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,500
This doesn't seem like a simple situation.

53
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,140
I asked the security team leader on the way.

54
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,410
This wasn't just based on a circumstantial suspicion,

55
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,230
but they arrested him because they obtained conclusive evidence.

56
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,670
They obtained conclusive evidence?

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,050
Inmate 4556, this is your doing, right?

58
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,230
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,640
Chief Cheon's false accusation.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,930
It has to do with you.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,190
He was being falsely accused? I didn't know that.

62
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,800
Don't laugh, you bastard.

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,980
Chief Cheon would never get involved in such vulgar corruption.

64
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:41,170
Are you saying my dad framed Chief Cheon for something he didn't do?

65
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,520
Is that what you're suspecting?

66
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,270
I'm not suspecting that. I'm sure of it.

67
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,850
You're not as stupid as I thought.

68
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,900
That's why he should've stopped when I warned him nicely.

69
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,730
Don't you get it?

70
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,140
A cart the size of a house was rolling along,

71
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,780
but a mantis stood in front of it to stop it.

72
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,410
What do you think happened to that fearless mantis?

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,320
It's pretty obvious what happened.

74
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,260
It was squished to death.

75
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,600
The lesson of this story is

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,150
that if you don't know your place

77
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,610
and get in my way,

78
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,540
you die.

79
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,080
Oh, yeah?

80
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,910
That cart...

81
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,140
I'll stop it, no matter what.

82
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,010
Whether the cart stops or the mantis is squished to death.

83
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,300
Let's see what happens.

84
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,590
Okay.

85
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,640
Let's see what happens.

86
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,050
 Candidate 133, 

87
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,480
 Ji Myeong Seob, the son of Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man, 

88
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,950
 has been placed on the parole review list despite lacking in enforcement rate 

89
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,590
 and remorse just because he is the son of a rich family. 

90
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,760
 As his correction officer, I submit this written opinion stating that he is not fit for parole. 

91
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,770
I already told you.

92
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Parole Examiner.

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,340
I declare that Candidate 133's parole

94
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,010
has been approved unanimously.

95
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,950
   

96
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,380
   

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,900
This is an unregistered car.

98
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,290
Is this really a suicide?

99
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,030
Have you ever seen anyone get an unregistered car to commit suicide?

100
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,110
Choi Jeong Hak isn't the type to commit suicide.

101
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,380
The strangulation marks on his neck and his head wound look suspicious.

102
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,260
Send him to autopsy right away. Tell them it's urgent.

103
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,060
- All right.
 - Hello, sir!

104
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,930
Hello!

105
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,060
Captain, hello.

106
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,790
It's suicide, right?

107
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,390
We're looking into it. We'll send him to autopsy andâ”€

108
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,040
Then focus on other cases until the autopsy results come out.

109
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,700
Our team has so many major crimes we need to handle.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,500
- Wrap things up here.
 - Okay.

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,750
That pathetic bitch lost her judgment to gain a little bit of money.
    

112
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,560
I intend to install someone new to take Professor Kim's place as parole examiner.

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,510
Plant someone who will do the job properly.

114
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,580
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,610
- Myeong Seob's installation ceremony is coming up soon, right? 
 - Yes.

116
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,730
With the past issues, be sure to prepare well to avoid any weird articles popping up, Director Son.

117
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,870
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,740
Whether he's a good kid or not, since it's about my son,

119
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,060
I can't help but worry.

120
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,530
   

121
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,710
I can't believe this worked.

122
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,050
Did something good happen?

123
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,510
I won a hotel stay and access to its buffet.

124
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,740
It was my credit card company's end-of-year event.

125
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,220
I applied for it, and I won.

126
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,540
Though, what I really wanted was the laptop, the second-place prize.

127
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,910
It's great that you even won anything at all.

128
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,090
It's just that I don't have much use for a hotel and buffet without a girlfriend.

129
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,170
It's not like I can go there with you, Attorney.

130
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,230
How much could I get for this if I sell it online?

131
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,880
Ten million won (~$10.000)?

132
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,180
Pardon?

133
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,420
Are you telling me to post it for 10 million won?

134
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,700
Oh, no, it's not that.

135
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,260
I just found something strange in this parole review application.

136
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,170
What is it?

137
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,090
She was a voice-phishing money handler.

138
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,950
But what's so strange about that?

139
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,040
Heo Eun Ji was a first-time offender and the amount of damages wasn't that high.

140
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,600
In this instance, if she submitted a petition and got help from a lawyer,

141
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,720
she would either be released on probation,

142
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,970
or, at worst, be sentenced to less than a year in prison.

143
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,670
But it seems she received an excessively long sentence.

144
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,210
Wait! This is Su Ah!

145
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,280
- How do you know her name?
 - Look at this.

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,130
I saw her face recently in a documentary.

147
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:14,380
Gosh, I felt so bad that such a young baby was living in prison.

148
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,610
But why is Su Ah's photo here?

149
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,170
Su Ah's mother is Heo Eun Ji.

150
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,490
   

151
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,190
You can put her to sleep, right? Then, do it.

152
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,250
Inmate 1896, please put your baby to sleep.

153
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,490
Gosh, it's so noisy.

154
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,790
Su Ah, please.

155
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Mommy, Mommy!

156
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,530
Mommy's here. Mommy's right here.

157
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,960
Gosh, so loud.

158
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,600
Baby...

159
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,770
 Your food is here. 

160
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,830
Your food is here.

161
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,930
Food's here. Food, food, food.

162
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,290
- Thank you.
 - Eat up, Su Ah.

163
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,180
Thank you.

164
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,030
They gave us so few side dishes today. It's not enough for everyone!

165
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,040
Don't spit on it.

166
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,500
All right, the rolled eggs are one per person.

167
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Look here! It's your favorite, Su Ah! Meat!

168
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,340
- Hurry up and feed her meat.
 - Do you want to eat meat?

169
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,810
- Meat? You don't like meat?
 - Hey.

170
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,370
Don't be picky with the side dishes today.

171
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,510
- I couldn't sleep because you cried all night.
 - Come on!

172
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,100
She's eating just fine.

173
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,490
Seriously, you have no compassion.

174
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,760
It's because she's trying to eat adult food as a baby!

175
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,580
Eun Ji, you should eat, too.

176
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,360
How could you ever be full when all you eat is your baby's leftover rice and kimchi?

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,110
Hey, eat more. Here.

178
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,420
She doesn't even do chores because she has to watch her baby.

179
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,910
Of course, she wouldn't be hungry.

180
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,120
Shut your trap.

181
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,710
Do you know that caring for a baby is way more difficult than working?

182
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,440
You've never raised or given birth to a child. What a stupid girl.

183
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,340
What? Stupid?

184
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,700
Inmate 1896, you have a consultation with the classification chief after your meal.

185
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,870
A consultation?

186
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,110
Do you mean that, Chief?

187
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,170
Yes. I placed you on the parole review list.

188
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,940
Thank you. Chief, thank you so much!

189
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,480
Don't get your hopes up too high, though.

190
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,750
You're lacking in enforcement rate, and your visitation count is pretty low.

191
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,400
Not only that, but you don't have a way to earn your living after your release.

192
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,470
Even if you are placed on the parole review,

193
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,940
there's a high chance you'll get a disqualified opinion.

194
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,840
Still, you're giving me a chance.

195
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Thank you so much, Chief.

196
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,240
Su Ah will be 18 months old next month.

197
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,690
According to policy, she has to leave the prison.

198
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,370
If you don't pass this parole review,

199
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,760
do you still not have anyone to take care of Su Ah?

200
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,550
Eun Ji, you should consider putting Su Ah up for adoptionâ”€

201
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,590
No.

202
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,880
Never.

203
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,840
Realistically, the chances of you passing the parole review are low.

204
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,590
And even if you get lucky and you're released on parole with Su Ah,

205
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,170
how will you provide for her?

206
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,510
I think it's better for both you and Su Ah

207
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,960
to make up your mind and put Su Ah up for adoption.

208
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,060
No, I can't.

209
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,580
Don't just keep saying no.

210
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,090
I can raise her well.

211
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,710
No matter what I need to do,

212
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,090
I'll make sure to raise her.

213
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,670
Seeing how she was placed on the review list

214
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,220
despite not fulfilling her enforcement rate,

215
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,820
it appears the inmate has a strong desire to be

216
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,850
released on parole and raise her child herself.

217
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,150
Then, you should help her out, Attorney.

218
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,860
Don't you feel sorry for her?

219
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,070
Just because I feel sorry for herâ”€

220
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,480
Wait, wait.

221
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,330
H-Here. Take this hotel and buffet coupon worth 10 million won,

222
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,160
- and please help her out.
 - Wow.

223
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,200
I don't accept solicitations.

224
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,690
Gosh, it's not a solicitation. I'm just saying we should go together.

225
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,540
Gosh, don't be like that and help her out.

226
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,070
I was going to visit her and ask her about her situation anyway.

227
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,270
I feel like I shouldn't go empty-handed since she has a baby.

228
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,790
What should I bring?

229
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,490
You're thinking about bringing a gift?

230
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,100
Don't you think cash is the best gift?

231
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,770
Cash?

232
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,400
Yes.

233
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,470
   

234
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,650
 I came for a parole preliminary hearing for Inmate 1896. 

235
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,360
Su Ah, you should say thank you.

236
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,630
I'm sorry. You even bought a gift for Su Ah.

237
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,270
Because Su Ah was born and raised here,

238
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,080
she's not accustomed to being around men.

239
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,000
That's all right.

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,720
Inmate 1896, your current situation is

241
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,140
so lacking in requirements that it's almost strange

242
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,390
that your name was listed for parole review.

243
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,500
Did you know that?

244
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,430
Yes. The classification chief said the same.

245
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,260
Parole Examiner, I won't be able to live if I'm separated from Su Ah.

246
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,640
So, pleaseâ”€

247
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,140
I can't give you a qualified opinion

248
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,560
just because you are in an unfortunate situation.

249
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,210
Therefore, let me ask you a few questions.

250
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,400
How did you end up participating in a voice-phishing case?

251
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,630
I ran away from home

252
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,900
when I was in high school.

253
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,060
   

254
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,370
I ran away to escape from my hellish home.

255
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,170
But once I was outside, I didn't know what to do.

256
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,860
I was cold and hungry,

257
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,260
and ran out of money.

258
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,090
Then one day,

259
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,280
I happened to meet Gyeong Min.

260
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,030
 Did you run away from home? 

261
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,510
 Why are you so surprised? It's written all over your face. 

262
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,120
Thanks to Gyeong Min, I was able to have food and housing.

263
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,280
He also introduced me to that job.

264
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,530
You probably won't believe me,

265
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,920
- but I really didn't know it was voice-phishing. 
  - Show me your ID. 

266
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,000
I thought it was just a legitimate part-time job of delivering money.

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,900
 - Don't you know this is voice phishing? 
 - I was just stupid.

268
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,790
 I did the test. 

269
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,580
And...

270
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,370
 There are two lines. You're pregnant. 

271
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,160
 I'm pregnant? 

272
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,050
 Medical office? 

273
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,990
 We have an inmate who needs to be examined. 

274
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,770
 What's wrong? Are you feeling pain in your belly? 

275
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,880
 Yes. 

276
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,970
 If it hurts, ask them to excuse you from labor. 

277
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,050
 It's okay. 

278
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,610
 Your baby can't rest because of you. 

279
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,280
 Hey, do you have a nickname for your unborn child? 

280
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,480
 Yes, it's Eomsal.*
 (Means "Crybaby" in Korean) 

281
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,050
 Gosh, how could a baby overreact when it's in your womb? 

282
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,820
 No, it means, "Don't live like your mom."
 (Eom is the first letter for "mom", Sal is short for "live") 

283
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:12,130
It really wasn't easy to live in prison while pregnant.

284
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,000
 Hey! You said your due date is still far off. 

285
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Why are you groaning all night and keeping me awake? 

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
 Hey, move. 

287
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,830
 Eun Ji, what's wrong? Are you in pain? Eun Ji. 

288
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,750
 Oh, my God, what's this! 

289
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,960
 Hey! Hey! Correction Officer! 

290
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,230
 Hey, Eomsal isâ”€ No, a baby is about to be born! 

291
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,740
 Over here! 

292
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,530
My body wasn't in a good condition,

293
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,420
so I ended up going to a hospital outside the prison.

294
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,040
 - Push! 
 - My angelic Su Ah

295
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,450
is unfortunate to meet a mom like me.

296
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,070
Heo Eun Ji, you were a first-time offender

297
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,600
and your number of damages wasn't that high.

298
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,090
If a family member or a friend submitted a petition,

299
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,340
you could have received a reduced sentence.

300
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,410
I don't have any family or friends.

301
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,720
What about the child's father?

302
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,420
After I was arrested, I lost contact with him.

303
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,120
You didn't hire an attorney?

304
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,390
The police officer told me I would be released quickly

305
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,170
since it was my first time, and

306
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,020
and I didn't know I was committing a crime.

307
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,050
That's why I didn't hire one.

308
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,540
Parole Examiner, is there any way for me to be released on parole?

309
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,780
It won't be easy.

310
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,080
There are a lot of things for you to prepare

311
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,160
and even if you prepare all that,

312
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,810
there is no guarantee you will be released on paroleâ”€

313
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,980
I'll do it.

314
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,190
If I can just leave here with my Su Ah,

315
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,130
I'll do whatever it takes.

316
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,860
 If you obtain a license 

317
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,800
 and show that you've prepared to earn a living after your release, 

318
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,190
 it will help your parole review. 

319
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,240
- What book is it that you're lost in it?
 - Sorry?

320
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,260
You've been feeding Su Ah only rice for a while. She'll choke like that.

321
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh, Su Ah, I'm sorry. I was distracted.

322
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,180
You looked so down in case you'd have to put your daughter up for adoption.

323
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,920
Your face has gotten a lot brighter these days.

324
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,830
I found a way not to be separated from Su Ah.

325
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,770
A parole examiner said he would help me.

326
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,530
Oh, really?

327
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,420
But didn't you say parole was going to be difficult for you?

328
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,310
But still, I'll try everything I can.

329
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,030
If I put my Su Ah up for adoption without trying anything,

330
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,510
I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

331
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,600
If I obtain a license, it'll help my parole review.

332
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,770
Really?

333
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,360
Hey, hey, you should study.

334
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,440
Su Ah, Auntie will take care of you.

335
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,450
You're acting as if giving birth in prison is something to boast about.

336
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,450
Had I known, I should have gotten pregnant before coming in here.

337
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,280
Shut the f*** up!

338
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,760
Hey, do you think just anyone can get pregnant?

339
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,880
You have to be chosen by the goddess of birth.

340
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,950
What would you know, you don't even have a husband.

341
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,910
She doesn't have a husband, either!

342
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,270
It seems Eun Ji, I mean, Inmate 1896

343
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,320
really didn't know she was participating in a crime.

344
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,780
At first, I suspected that she might be acting.

345
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,550
But after watching her here, I realized she wasn't acting.

346
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:55,330
She cried a lot because she felt bad for the victims who were hurt by her.

347
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,090
"Stop right there. Stop! Don't worry."

348
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,590
Is this not good, either?

349
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,100
Eonni.

350
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,200
- Is this really okay?
 - What do you mean?

351
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,640
I don't think you should do this commercial as an actress.

352
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,360
Yeah, Eonni. I don't think this is a good idea, either.

353
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,280
What's wrong with a hemorrhoid commercial?

354
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,340
Is there a law that states an actress shouldn't do hemorrhoid commercials?

355
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,350
There isn't, but you should think about your image, Eonni.

356
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,050
Does your image feed you?

357
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,150
I don't know when Ji Dong Man will try to stop me.

358
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,810
I need to earn as much as I can while I still can. Okay?

359
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,740
Hemorrhoids, stop right there!

360
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,690
"Even actresses are afraid of hemorrhoids."

361
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,450
"However, fear no longer."

362
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,190
"Bringing justice to your hemorrhoids, Chi Jeong." Chi Jeong.

363
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,150
Why isn't anyone here? Isn't this the location?

364
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,170
Eonni, just a moment.

365
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,740
A passionate affair*?
  (Sounds like "Chijeong") 

366
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,870
No, remember this.

367
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,870
Chi Jeong is a hemorrhoid medication.

368
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,380
- Is it funny?
 - Oh, okay.

369
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,630
Why? What's up?

370
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,340
The shoot was canceled.

371
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,430
How could they suddenly cancel the shoot without any prior notice?

372
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,000
The thing is...

373
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,640
The thing is?

374
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,190
What the hell? What did you do?

375
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,180
Seeing how angry you are, I guess you heard your commercial was canceled.

376
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,610
 Don't get worked up already. This is just the start. 

377
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,390
From now on, you won't get any roles in commercials, movies, or dramas.

378
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,350
Why are you doing this to me?

379
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,500
 You really don't know? 

380
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,860
Because you delayed dropping charges, I have to rot in here for another month!

381
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,420
You did that without being prepared for something like this?

382
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,840
 This is my final warning. 

383
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,060
Hurry up and drop the charges before you fall any further.

384
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,290
- Warden Bae.
 -Yes?

385
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,810
Are you behaving these days?

386
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,730
Pardon?

387
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:11,140
You haven't forgotten how you became the warden, right?

388
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,380
Of course not!

389
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,810
24 Mi...

390
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,200
It was 24 Mi 5883! I found it!

391
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,530
Is that it?

392
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,710
Yes, it passed through this way around 2 a.m.

393
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,450
and passed through the other direction around 3:15 a.m.

394
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,300
It wasn't caught in the next CCTV?

395
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,690
No.

396
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,160
What's the distance from here to there?

397
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,650
It's about 5km to the next CCTV.

398
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,410
That means the site where Choi Jeong Hak was murdered is within a 5km radius from here.

399
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,110
But we checked the autopsy results together.

400
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,220
Though there are strangulation marks and bruises,

401
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,590
the direct cause of death was from carbon monoxide poisoning.

402
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,580
There are no signs of homicide.

403
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,500
Wait for me.

404
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,600
Aigoo. 
 â™«  Three bears are living in a house  â™«

405
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,330
Wow, she's so cute.

406
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,480
It would've been bad if I listened to you, Mr. Hwang.

407
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,890
I know.

408
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,760
If you gave her money, she'd be dancing with cash instead of a teddy bear!

409
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,630
â™«  So cute  â™«

410
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,060
Goodness, seriously.

411
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,790
It's sad that cute Su Ah has to separate from her mom.

412
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,250
After meeting her personally and hearing her story, I did feel sorry for her.

413
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,010
If she had received help from family or an attorney,

414
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,400
she could have reduced her sentence.

415
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,830
And if she had, they could perhaps be living together elsewhere.

416
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,110
That's why you should help them out, Attorney.

417
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,760
It will be difficult for me to do it alone.

418
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,330
What should I do to help my Su Ah?

419
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,120
Why are you suddenly calling her your Su Ah?

420
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,070
Yes, that's right, my Su Ah.

421
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,040
I asked you what I should do.

422
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,660
First, give me your phone.

423
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,410
Oh, okay.

424
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,030
I wonder what she's doing right now.

425
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,750
Where are you going?

426
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,950
Attorney Lee, welcome.

427
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,650
You sat down already.

428
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,650
I finished looking over the contract.

429
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,200
Finally.

430
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,330
Wow. Did you finally sign the contract?

431
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,850
I felt like a few things were missing from the contract.

432
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,650
I added a few special terms. Please take a look.

433
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,510
Attorney Lee, why are you doing this to me?

434
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,510
I mean, it's so difficult trying to get that small building from you.

435
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,680
How much do you want? How much more do you want? Tell me.

436
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,630
Please take a look at the contract.

437
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,030
   

438
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,360
What's this? You want me to become someone's guardian?

439
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,340
Heo Eun Ji? Who's Heo Eun Ji?

440
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,520
She's an inmate at Changju Women's Prison.

441
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,300
An inmate?

442
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,520
So, you're asking me to look after some random stranger in prison?

443
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,600
No.

444
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,150
All you need to do is just lend Heo Eun Ji

445
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:56,560
your name during her parole review period.

446
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,910
It's something like acting as a puppet CEO.

447
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,730
How could you tell a CEO to act as a puppet CEO? Puppet CEO, my foot.

448
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,170
Well, since there's no change to handing over the building,

449
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,720
I don't think I'd be losing anything.

450
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,520
Are you sure I only need to lend her my name?

451
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,160
   

452
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,130
 Name, Choi Jeong Hak. 

453
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,790
 Age, 27 years old. 

454
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,430
 Occupation, a nightclub marketing director. 

455
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:48,220
 You admit to taking and providing drugs to club VIPs, right? 

456
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,760
 You know why I'm so interested in you, right? 

457
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,640
 What does Choi Jeong Hak have to do with the Ojeong Group? 

458
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,850
 Why do you think that? 

459
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,540
 The attorney with him is part of Ojeong Group's legal department. 

460
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,180
 You are... 

461
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,880
 suspecting me of being a murderer, right? 

462
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,010
 An Da Yun, who died in the VIP room. 

463
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,810
 She's my younger sister. 

464
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,390
 Why are you speaking down to me? 

465
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,460
 Just because I went to the nightclub that day, 

466
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,480
 is it okay to speak down to me and treat me like a criminal? 

467
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,730
 Do you have evidence that I killed your sister? 

468
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,580
What were you doing?

469
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,230
Can't you tell?

470
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,350
I was digging through all of Choi Jeong Hak's belongings, hoping to find something.

471
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,750
These belong to Choi Jeong Hak?

472
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,380
Yeah.

473
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,680
What a weirdo.

474
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,790
Why?

475
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,590
I mean, a collaboration between Christianity and Buddhism?

476
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,210
That's so contradictory.

477
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,940
Maybe he believed in both, since he's committed so many sins.

478
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,650
Yes, this is Inspector An Seo Yun.

479
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,590
He entered the country?

480
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,150
Thank you for letting me know.

481
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,140
Yes.

482
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,890
Entered the country?

483
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,910
Who did?

484
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,380
Ji Myeong Seob. He came back three days ago.

485
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,070
Wait, you were keeping track of Ji Myeong Seob's immigration records?

486
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,030
Please clean this up for me.

487
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,780
Where are you going?

488
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,920
Choi Jeong Hak died as soon as Ji Myeong Seob came back.

489
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,020
Do you think it's a coincidence?

490
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,650
   

491
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,510
Executive Director, congratulations on your installation.

492
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,400
 Congratulations on your installation! 

493
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,530
Oh, yes.

494
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,580
Yes, thank you.

495
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,710
What is all this? We're not gangsters.

496
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,040
I'm different from my dad.

497
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,270
There must've been a misunderstanding at the secretary's office.

498
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,750
I'm sorry for having busy board members come out here like this.

499
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,700
My apologies.

500
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,600
I am still lacking in many ways.

501
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,140
I look forward to working with you. Thank you.

502
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,960
Let's go.

503
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,850
Mr. Ji Myeong Seob.

504
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,700
Executive Director Ji Myeong Seob.

505
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,770
You remember me, right?

506
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,640
I've eagerly waited for you to return.

507
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,160
How come you haven't given me a call?

508
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,830
What are you so busy with?

509
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,900
Didn't you kill Choi Jeong Hak?

510
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,830
Drug dealer Choi Jeong Hak was found dead as soon as you returned, Ji Myeong Seob.

511
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,770
Isn't the timing a bit too convenient?

512
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,400
Many people are watching. We should go.

513
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,960
Do you know Choi Jeong Hak?

514
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,890
When did you decide to return? Please give us a statement.

515
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,900
Are you a police officer? Please identify yourself.

516
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,660
Do you suspect Director Ji Myeong Seob to be involved in Choi Jeong Hak's death?

517
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,130
I merely came to verify the facts related to the case.

518
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,030
Nothing's been confirmed yet.

519
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,600
However, from my experience,

520
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,740
those who avoid a response like this tend to be the culprit.

521
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,580
Are you a police officer? Please reveal your identity first.

522
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,270
Please give us a more detailed statement.

523
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,390
Please give us a statement.

524
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,720
Director Son. I guess you don't want to work with me.

525
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,190
Would you have handled business like this if it had been my dad?

526
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,440
Would you have let that police bitch talk like that?

527
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,350
Is it true?

528
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,750
What?

529
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:24,330
Are you involved in Choi Jeong Hak's death?

530
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,170
How dare you interrogate me?

531
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,890
What if I am involved?

532
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,070
What will you do if I am involved?

533
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,150
Isn't it your job to make me irrelevant, even if I am?

534
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,290
Hey, Lim Jeong Gyun.

535
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,940
You better answer my questions honestly.

536
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,530
Who killed Choi Jeong Hak?

537
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,880
What is this madness?

538
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,300
What's with this fiasco as soon as you arrive? Are you all right?

539
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,900
- Attorney Seo.
 - Yes?

540
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,850
Prepare to file a lawsuit.

541
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,740
A lawsuit, all of a sudden? Who are you suing?

542
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,750
Who do you think?

543
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,060
The police bitch who lost it over her sister's death.

544
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,940
My ceremony was ruined because of her. Should I let it go?

545
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,060
Won't I be a pushover if I do?

546
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,870
Yes, you'll be a pushover if you do.

547
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,950
Defamation and spreading false information. What else?

548
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,590
Anyway, sue her for everything we can. Got that?

549
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,860
I asked if you got that!

550
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,250
Yes, we'll sue her for whatever we can.

551
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,060
 Are you sure I only need to lend her my name? 

552
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,440
 You should still meet her at least once. 

553
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,510
 Why are you changing your words? 

554
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,940
 Even puppet CEOs have to go in for an interview. 

555
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,280
I have no idea what I am doing here.

556
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,890
Let's go.

557
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,990
   

558
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,520
It's cold.

559
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,850
I'm Choi Hwa Ran. I'll be your guardian.

560
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,090
I told the correction officer that I had no interest in putting her up for adoption.

561
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,280
I'm your guardian.

562
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,640
Obviously, you'll be that kid's guardian.

563
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,450
You will...

564
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,210
really be my guardian?

565
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,560
Don't cry.

566
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,550
I hate it when people cry.

567
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,730
Thank you.

568
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,120
You don't need to do this.

569
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,110
I'm only doing this because I kind of need to.

570
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,440
Still...

571
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,250
still, thank you so much.

572
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,810
I said, don't cry!

573
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,400
If you keep crying, I may change my mind and not become your guardian.

574
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,120
What is that?

575
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,160
- Sorry?
 - That scar on your hand.

576
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,100
What is it? It looks like you've had it for a while.

577
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,890
In the past...

578
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,770
my dad...

579
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,040
 The man who was supposed to be my dad 

580
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,370
 was a severe alcoholic. 

581
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,740
 He was always drunk 

582
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,460
 and beat me any chance he got. 

583
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:18,750
 When I was in 12th grade, I learned that I was adopted. 

584
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,880
 After that, I ran away from that hell of a home. 

585
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,270
 What about the child's father? 

586
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,510
 I can't get in touch with him. 

587
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,210
 Tell me. 

588
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,580
 Tell me that bastard's name and phone number. 

589
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,640
 Assistant Baek, give me something to write on. 

590
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,490
 Correction Officer, please give me something to write with. Like a pen. 

591
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,230
 Write it. 

592
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,560
- Assistant Baek.
 - Yes.

593
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,550
Find this bastard.

594
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,760
Report to me what kind of asshole he is and what he's doing.

595
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,570
Also, don't forget to send the guys on schedule, as Attorney Lee requested.

596
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,320
- Okay?
 - Okay.

597
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
   

598
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,160
Just like me coming today,

599
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,360
employees working for President Choi will be coming by for the time being.

600
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,380
The visitation count also plays a factor in your parole review.

601
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,800
Though it may be a bit awkward and uncomfortable,

602
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,600
don't mind me and keep on studying.

603
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,230
Happy? Happy?

604
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,820
 Visitor for Inmate 1896. 

605
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,100
Who are you?

606
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,700
W-We are employees under President Choi.

607
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,140
M-My name is Park Beom Seok.

608
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,490
Why are you shouting? The baby will get scared!

609
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,630
My name is Kim Ji Hu.

610
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,390
You're pretty.

611
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,150
She's so pretty.

612
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,080
We could have a baby that pretty when we get married, too, right?

613
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,010
Gosh, you're so silly!

614
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,800
   
   

615
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,700
   

616
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,740
I'm here.

617
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,480
Did you really kill Choi Jeong Hak?

618
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,310
Is that why you called for me?

619
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,650
Dad, it's no big deal.

620
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,370
What's the big deal about a guy like that dying?

621
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,090
That bastard would've blocked my path and the company if I left him alone.

622
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,280
It's better to get rid of him early onâ”€

623
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,170
Director Son.

624
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:06,050
   

625
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,160
It's that police bitch yapping without any evidence!

626
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,690
The brainless pigs and dogs yapping will quiet down if you just give it a few days.

627
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,670
I did everything in my power to cover up that you killed that girl

628
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:29,060
by overdosing her on drugs at the nightclub,

629
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,930
and you caused trouble as soon as you came back?

630
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,150
Are you out of your mind?

631
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,870
I built Ojeong Group from the ground up from Busan to Seoul,

632
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:46,440
working tirelessly to the point of wearing out my joints.

633
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,620
If anyone is a hindrance to my company, I will cut them off

634
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,990
even if it's my own son. Did you get that?

635
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,150
 All right, let's start the mukbang* right away. Please bring it. 
(Online content streamer who eats a lot for viewers) 

636
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:16,520
 Here is the five-star Chinese food you ordered. 

637
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,970
 Gosh, the broth is... 

638
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,600
 You have to see this. 

639
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,440
Why would you eat this?

640
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,500
Why did you come out already?

641
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,610
Did you get in trouble againâ”€

642
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,160
You guys must be drunk.

643
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,070
Do you think this is a taxi? Hurry up and get out.

644
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,630
She doesn't look like you.

645
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,380
That kid was okay-looking because she took after her mom.

646
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,160
That's a relief.

647
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,560
What are you bullshitting me about, Ahjumma?

648
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,520
Hey, you know Heo Eun Ji, right?

649
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,410
- Do you know her or not?
 - I do.

650
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,860
Did you know she had your child?

651
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,480
What...

652
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,330
What?

653
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,210
I didn't know, I didn't know!

654
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,160
You didn't know? You really didn't know?

655
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,480
- I really didn't know!
 - Hey, you bastard!

656
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,950
Are you proud that you didn't know she had your child?

657
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,830
Is that something to be proud of, you bastard?

658
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,460
I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'm sorry.

659
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,340
Shut up!

660
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,150
Go over there already.

661
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,350
Su Ah, did you see Auntie score?

662
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,770
Why are you so pretty?

663
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,250
How much prettier will you be tomorrow?

664
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,950
Inmate 1896, Inmate 1896!

665
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,430
Inmate 1896.

666
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,260
Eun Ji, it's here. This came for you.

667
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,740
I felt like the sender's name was familiar.

668
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,170
This is the name of Su Ah's father, right?

669
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,270
Gyeong Min?

670
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,230
Yes.

671
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,320
 I couldn't believe that I had a daughter, 

672
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,200
 but I was really happy. 

673
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,410
 With your permission, I'll take care of our daughter Su Ah. 

674
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,580
 Let's talk on the phone first. Call me. 

675
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,340
Parole Examiner, I received this from Oppa.

676
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:24,010
Oppa says he was really worried because he couldn't get in touch with me.

677
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:29,800
And he says he cried because he felt like this was all his fault.

678
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,280
So, have you talked to him on the phone?

679
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,900
Yes.

680
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,360
You trust Gyeong Min, right?

681
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,720
Yes.

682
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,840
But Gyeong Min introduced you to the voice-phishing money handling job.

683
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,680
He says that he didn't know about it, either.

684
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,460
You'll probably realize it if you meet Oppa,

685
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,460
but he's really nice.

686
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:59,860
And since Oppa says he will take care of my Su Ah...

687
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,170
But still, you should focus on preparing for the parole review now.

688
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,970
Leaving this place with Su Ah is most important.

689
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,150
Wow. There's nothing you can't do, Attorney Lee.

690
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,580
You're smart and handsome, and you also know how to make coffee!

691
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,270
Gosh, why would you make your own coffee? It's so much work.

692
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,680
We could just buy coffee.

693
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,950
The coffee you make tastes better.

694
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,590
- Please have some.
 - What a nice picture you make.

695
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,120
Here.

696
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,000
The taste of coffee is pretty much the same everywhere.

697
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,580
- How is it?
 - Oh, it's so, it's so...

698
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,480
In any case, you said you wanted to check something urgently.

699
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,600
What is it?

700
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,450
- Your feelings.
 - My feelings?

701
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:20,390
Did you decide to become Heo Eun Ji's real guardian

702
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,420
instead of a puppet CEO helping her parole release?

703
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,870
Enough with the cringey talk.

704
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:33,050
Aren't you curious about me finding the father of Heo Eun Ji's child?

705
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,870
Yes. What kind of person is An Gyeong Min, Su Ah's biological father?

706
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,530
The thing is...

707
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,340
something about him seems off.

708
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,750
 I finished writing it. 

709
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,860
 You wrote five lines. 

710
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,800
 Is it true that you didn't know the job you introduced her to was voice-phishing? 

711
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,820
 Yes, if I knew it was illegal, I wouldn't have told her to do itâ”€ 

712
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,850
 Are you sure you're not connected to those guys? 

713
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,750
 Of course! I have my own job! You saw me earlier. 

714
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:34,200
 Though driving around hostess bar girls isn't exactly a job to be proud of... 

715
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,300
 Anyway, all I did was 

716
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,700
 introduce that job to Eun Ji because a customer said it was an easy job. 

717
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,450
 So, who would've known that would happen to Eun Ji? 

718
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,650
 I should've looked into it more! 

719
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,190
 There's one last question. 

720
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,450
 You said you would take care of your daughter Su Ah. 

721
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,280
 Do you mean that? 

722
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,130
 Yes. Since she's my daughter, I should take responsibility for her. 

723
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,250
 I really do love Eun Ji. 

724
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,300
 Once Eun Ji is released, the three of us will live together. 

725
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,200
 Hey, let's rewrite your letter. How could you write only five lines? 

726
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,890
 And write neatly, too. 

727
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,570
 Be sincere and add some more content. 

728
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,590
 - You got that, right?
 - Yes. 

729
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,950
 Send it right away on your way home. 

730
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,690
 - Go visit her right away. Got it?
 - Okay. 

731
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,110
 Thank you. Thank you for letting me know about Eun Ji and Su Ah. 

732
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,470
 R-Rewrite it? 

733
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,590
From what I can tell, nothing seems off about him.

734
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,300
That's the problem.

735
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,800
I'm suspicious of him because nothing about what he said seems off.

736
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,190
What do you mean by that?

737
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,180
Shall I say it's my hunch I've developed from dealing with many

738
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,080
who declared they had no money to pay me back?

739
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,300
Anyway, the fishy thing about him won't go away,

740
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,510
so I told my guys to keep digging. Just so you know.

741
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,510
Well, okay, do that then.

742
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:09,270
Even if Heo Eun Ji manages to pass this parole review,

743
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:14,260
her livelihood and well-being need to be guaranteed after her release to live a new life.

744
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,490
Well, that's not my business.

745
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:22,970
Attorney Lee, you just focus on Heo Eun Ji's parole review.

746
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,480
Okay.

747
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,160
It's tasty.

748
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,050
Su Ah, your mom will be here soon.

749
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,970
Goodness, h-how did it go?

750
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,590
Can't you tell?

751
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,220
She obviously failed!

752
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,850
You're the failure here!

753
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,140
Don't be too disappointed. And don't give up.

754
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,310
I...

755
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,050
passed!

756
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,470
- What?
 - I passed!

757
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,310
I obtained the Korean culinary chef's license!

758
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,860
She passed! She passed!

759
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,580
Good job, good job!

760
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,610
Wow! You sure studied hard!

761
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,630
Su Ah, look. Your mom passed!

762
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,960
Su Ah, Mommy passed!

763
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,650
I did well, right?

764
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,170
She passed!

765
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,280
She passed!

766
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,480
She passed!

767
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,190
   

768
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,580
â™ª I love you â™ª

769
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,050
What the...

770
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,080
   

771
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,970
What's this?

772
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,260
It was the chairman's orders.

773
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,880
- I was fired?
 - Yeah.

774
00:49:58,690 --> 00:49:59,780
F***!

775
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,380
This is wrong! Honestly, this is too much!

776
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,100
In an age where human rights are a thing!

777
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,260
I won't stand for this. I'll report him to the labor department.

778
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,160
No, I'm going to call my uncle!

779
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,600
You know my uncle, right? Chief Seo? I'll really call him.

780
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,540
Stay seated there for a bit.

781
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,690
Why isn't he picking up? Give me a moment. What?

782
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,910
Congrats.

783
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,770
Congrats on what?

784
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,210
Hey, An Gyeong Min!

785
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,530
Oh, Hyeongnim!

786
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,380
What is it? I'm struggling with a decline in sales.

787
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,860
I called you so we can earn some money!

788
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,380
- Money?
 - Yes!

789
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,070
Come.

790
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,960
I prepared something that reeks of profit.

791
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,380
- I've got a new job for us.
 - Really?

792
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,570
My heart is racing with the thought of smelling some hard cash.

793
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,170
What is it? Tell me quickly! This is so frustrating!

794
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,460
Let's do a big one together and flee overseas!

795
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,980
Why would we flee?

796
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,640
We can have a scapegoat to take the blame while we get all the money.

797
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,230
Scapegoat? What scapegoat?

798
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,010
- Heo Eun Ji.
 - What?

799
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,620
- You remember her, right?
 - Yeah.

800
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,160
She's being released soon.

801
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,950
We get her on the day of her release, use her for a bit and send her off to prison.

802
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,610
Come on! You think she'd listen to you after getting burned last time?

803
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:34,100
Hyeongnim, do you want to bet whether she listens to me or not?

804
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,820
What is it? Looks like you have a solid backup plan.

805
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:42,040
That stupid bitch had a baby in prison.

806
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,420
A baby? But supposedly, she's my daughter!

807
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,910
She's asking me to take care of her!

808
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,930
As long as I have her daughter,

809
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,280
that bitch has no choice but to listen to me!

810
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,100
- She wants me to take careâ”€
 - Who are you?

811
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,860
Grab them.

812
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,520
Who are you?

813
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,470
It's not what it looks like!

814
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,020
No, it's really not like that!

815
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,970
Really, I wasn't trying to do this!

816
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,270
You're worse than a beast, you bastard.

817
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,250
Hey, you bastard.

818
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,040
Die.

819
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,350
Die, damn it!

820
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:23,160
You're worse than a beast, you bastard. Die!

821
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,090
 Bring me alcohol. 

822
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:30,070
 Die. 

823
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,160
 Just die. 

824
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,630
 Just die! 

825
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,720
 Just die, please! 

826
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,190
   

827
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:53,090
   

828
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,740
 This won't even cover one month's interest. 

829
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,380
 What a pathetic life he has lived. 

830
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:51,010
 Hey, I guess his pretty daughter will have to pay back her father's debts. 

831
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,510
 Why should I? 

832
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,470
 What did you say? 

833
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,580
 Why should I? 

834
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,530
 Why should I pay for the money he wasted on alcohol? 

835
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:07,400
 For me, money is more important than your father's life. 

836
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:12,450
 If his only daughter doesn't pay for the father's debt, 

837
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,310
 then who will? Right? 

838
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,570
 Why should I? Why should I! 

839
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,270
 Get out! Get out! 

840
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,640
 I said, get out! Get out! 

841
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,550
 I'll call the police! Get out right now! 

842
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,800
 No! 

843
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,900
 A young girl... 

844
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,090
 is fearless... 

845
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,150
 and is pretty bold. 

846
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,710
 You show real promise. 

847
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,910
 I think you'll do well in this field. 

848
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,600
 You know? 

849
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,400
 How about you work under me? 

850
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,590
- Assistant Baek. 
 - Yes?

851
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,580
Take the voice-phishing organization info we squeezed out of him

852
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:30,320
and this animal, and turn them over to the police.

853
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,130
You guys take care of that guy.

854
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,460
- All right.
 - Ma'am, Iâ”€

855
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,400
I'm really sorry. Really.

856
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,630
Please give me one more chance!

857
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,570
Ma'am!

858
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,270
Hey, Attorney Lee, it's me.

859
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,360
My hunch was right.

860
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,470
Heo Eun Ji's child's father is out of the picture.

861
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:58,340
You make sure to have Heo Eun Ji released on parole,

862
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,340
 no matter what it takes. You got that? 

863
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,650
   

864
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:18,310
I turned An Gyeong Min over to the police.

865
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,360
What? Why?

866
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,600
He was a member of a voice-phishing organization!

867
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,610
He had you do those jobs. And when you got caught, he used you as a scapegoat!

868
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:34,420
Can you really entrust your child to someone like that?

869
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,630
Why...

870
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,840
Why?

871
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,040
Don't lean on anyone.

872
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,350
No matter what anyone says, steel yourself and fight!

873
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,590
That's the only way you can protect your child. You got that?

874
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,570
Don't cry, and pull yourself together!

875
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:01,000
Correction Officer! Open the door... please!

876
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,640
I thought she finally caught a break when she found the child's dad.

877
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,990
But he got arrested by the police!

878
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,870
Gosh, that cursed bastard! Seriously!

879
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,100
Oh, no.

880
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:23,210
Su Ah, Auntie is here.

881
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,270
Cheer up.

882
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,210
This may be for the best.

883
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,390
Don't worry too much.

884
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:34,720
You know what they say about a blessing in disguise.

885
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,060
I'm sure you'll pass the parole review.

886
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,420
Right, Su Ah?

887
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,790
She agrees with me.

888
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,850
Don't cry.

889
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,460
Let's go inside.

890
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,470
The great Ojeong Group that my father built

891
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:09,730
from the ground up, from Busan to Seoul, working tirelessly

892
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,440
to the point of wearing out his joints.

893
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,430
   

894
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:26,770
In the end, he'll pass it on to his son with perfectly fine joints anyway.

895
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,020
What's happening with the lawsuit against the police bitch?

896
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,720
Oh, yes.

897
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:41,510
I prepared a comprehensive lawsuit for spreading false information and defamation,

898
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:44,090
and put in a claim for damages.

899
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:47,700
Everything should be completed in two days.

900
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,190
Ojeong Group's legal team is amazing.

901
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,850
Oh, really? Thank you.

902
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,820
But...

903
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,880
Yes?

904
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,570
Why was Chairman Ji's parole review unsuccessful?

905
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:12,480
Didn't you meet with all the parole examiners and set everything up beforehand?

906
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,670
I did, but the thing is...

907
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:19,200
It's a bit of a long story.

908
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,460
What is it?

909
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,930
Gosh, you're making me so curious.

910
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,850
Oh, right.

911
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:31,320
Tell me. Why wasn't the Chairman released last time?

912
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,820
What brings you here?

913
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,580
Please come in.

914
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,670
Attorney, you have a guest.

915
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,890
As expected. I heard attorneys were struggling to get by these days.

916
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,310
I guess it was true.

917
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:18,210
It's been a while, Correction Officer Lee Han Sin.

918
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:30,030


919
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:38,320
â™«  You are fighting like a coward does, it wonâ€™t be easy against me  â™«

920
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,480
â™«  I donâ€™t care, will you just come at me?  â™«

921
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,150
â™«  You're a megalomaniac  â™«

922
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,450
â™«  Youâ€™re going to lose so many, uh  â™«

923
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:51,880
â™«  Cover your eyes and hide  â™«

924
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,710
â™«  I'll show you  â™«

925
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:56,490
â™«  You're a megalomaniac  â™«

926
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:59,540
â™«  You donâ€™t deserve what you own now  â™«

927
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,000
â™«  You can push me away and try to hold me off  â™«

928
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,680
â™«  It won't work on me, Megalomaniac  â™«

929
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:15,800
   

930
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,500
 Preview 
I guess you decided to come at me with more people now. 

931
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,830
 No, I'm thinking of beating you up with the law. 

932
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,120
 A new parole examiner has been appointed. 

933
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,680
 Once Su Ah leaves, you won't see her again. Say goodbye. 

934
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,840
 - It's been a while.
 - You didn't even call ahead. 

935
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:30,780
 It's you. 

936
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,220
 Tons of abrasions and bruises on his body that show it was a homicide! 

937
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,130
 It's true that you killed him. 

938
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,310
 Will you get dragged around like that for the rest of your life? 

939
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:40,820
 I must break the finger that would hurt Lee Han Sin the most. 

940
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,770
 He made me an offer. 

941
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:46,220
 I'm thinking of accepting his offer.
