4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,730
   

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,050

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,560
 Tell me. 

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,080
 Why wasn't the Chairman released last time? 

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,270
 Well... 

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,310
 it ended up like that because of Attorney Lee Han Sin. 

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,990

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,490
 Lee Han Sin? Attorney Lee Han Sin? 

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,090
 Yes. 

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,660
 Attorney Lee Han Sin is a parole examiner. 

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,090
 The Chairman's previous parole review 

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,220
 ended up being suspended due to a trick he played during the review. 

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,680
 Oh, right. Inspector An Seo Yun, who came to your installation ceremony and caused a fuss, 

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,320
 also came to the review committee and testified. 

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,350
What brings you here?

24
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,920
Please come in.

25
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,980
Attorney, you have a guest.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,500
I heard attorneys were struggling to get by these days.

27
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,110
I was a bit surprised when I heard the news

28
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,580
that you went from being a correction officer to an attorney

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,110
and now to a parole examiner.

30
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,160
You've lived quite diligently all this while.

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,800
It's all thanks to you.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,950
Me?

33
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,110
I learned the disgusting truth that, as a correction officer,

34
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,100
I couldn't stop bastards like you who shouldn't be released early

35
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,230
no matter how hard I tried.

36
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,810
Don't try so hard.

37
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,170
You remember the story of the mantis who died while trying to stop a cart, right?

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,680
If you keep running wild like that, you'll really die.

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,790
I guess the cart was shaken a bit,

40
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,860
seeing how you personally came to threaten me.

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,990
It's not a threat.

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,040
It's a concern.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,900
I came to tell you that I'm secretly cheering for you.

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,440
Even from my point of view,

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,110
my dad shouldn't be released on parole.

46
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,520
If you can stop his parole until he serves his full sentence, that would be great.

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,650
Or if he ends up being imprisoned for life, even better.

48
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,410
   

49
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,640
   

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,640
 You've gone through a lot all this time. 

51
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,120
 You've done everything you can in the time you were given, 

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,100
 and now, only the decisions of the parole examiners remain. 

53
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,400
   

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,690
Wait. As you all may know,

55
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,890
Parole Examiner Kim Nae Gyeong can no longer carry out her duties,

56
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,340
so a new parole examiner has been appointed.

57
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,620
Let's exchange greetings before the review.

58
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,570
I look forward to working with you.

59
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,770
Yes, I look forward to working with you too.

60
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,390
I look forward to working with you. I am Attorney Seo Dong Hun.

61
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,080
Yes, I look forward to working with you.

62
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,020
Oh, hello. I'm Attorney Seo Dong Hun.

63
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,710
I look forward to working with you. I look forward to working with you.

64
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,580
So? Were you shocked?

65
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,970
Do you have to catch your breath?

66
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,460
It's too bad that we keep running into each other

67
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,750
when we're not very fond of each other.

68
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,110
I guess you're here as a yes-man?

69
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,710
Hey, you and I are on different levels.

70
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,950
Even if you act as Chairman Ji Dong Man's yes-man,

71
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,140
please handle the other cases fairly.

72
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,170
Yeah.

73
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,970
You do you.

74
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,000
All right, let's prepare for the review.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,270
Okay.

76
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,680
Where is my seat?

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,480
Parole Examiner, it's over here.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,460
Oh, that's my seat? Oh, okay.

79
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,910
Since all the members are present,

80
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,250
we will start the monthly parole review committee meeting for January 2025.

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,080
Administrative Secretary, please tell us what's on the agenda.

82
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,850
876 people applied for the monthly parole review for January 2025.

83
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,370
Yes.

84
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,070
Yes.

85
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,200
Please do that.

86
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,100
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes, yes.

88
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,390
 Finally, we will examine the case, which needs careful review. 

89
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,170
We will summon Candidate 233 for an in-person review.

90
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,420
We summon Candidate 233.

91
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,920
We will give you a chance to give your final testimony.

92
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,450
 Even parole examiners are human beings. 

93
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,980
 Please appeal to their emotions. 

94
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,810
I'm raising a baby daughter in prison.

95
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,180
My name is Heo Eun Ji, Su Ah's mother.

96
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,770
If I am not released on parole this time,

97
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,860
I may have to put Su Ah up for adoption.

98
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,900
I was also an adoptee.

99
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,420
So, I don't want Su Ah to go through the suffering that I went through.

100
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:35,090
Please give me a chance so that I, her mother, can raise Su Ah.

101
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,470
Please, I beg you.

102
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,130
I'm asking because this is my first time here,

103
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,230
but does such melodramatic storytelling work here?

104
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,560
Isn't it overly emotional?

105
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:59,590
Candidate 233 obtained a Korean culinary chef license so she can

106
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,140
provide for herself and her baby after her release.

107
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,580
And I would like you to consider that someone has become her guardian.

108
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,780
But the license and the guardian all came after she applied for parole review.

109
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,250
It seems like she did so at the last minute to earn points.

110
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,130
Doesn't it seem like that?

111
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,320
She hasn't even settled with her victims.

112
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,810
No, she hasn't.

113
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,020
That's because she had no family to facilitate the settlement.

114
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,290
Also, with the desire to compensate her victims,

115
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,190
she's been saving up prison funds and labor wages.

116
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,860
Please check the relevant documents.

117
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,160
It is a fact that she hasn't fulfilled her enforcement rate.

118
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,290
Yes, that's right.

119
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,970
There is a need to discuss whether

120
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,240
the length of her sentence was appropriate.

121
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,950
Seeing how the amount of damage wasn't that high and the fact it was her first time,

122
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,780
the three-year sentence given to her by the court is a bit excessive.

123
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,400
It's excessive?

124
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,230
Could you tell us what's excessive about it?

125
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,630
Candidate 233 ran away from home

126
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,310
to escape domestic abuse from her alcoholic father.

127
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,460
At the time, there were no social safety nets to protect a runaway minor.

128
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,800
In the end, she ended up getting involved in a crime.

129
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,700
Also, during her investigation and trial, she couldn't receive any help from an attorney.

130
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes, it's true that it's a sad story,

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,780
but don't you think it's not appropriate for us

132
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,980
to argue a court decision that's already past?

133
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,220
Of course,

134
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,790
we can't change the court's decision.

135
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,550
Also, we can't change the past events of Candidate 233's life.

136
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,250
However,

137
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,840
we can change the fate of her daughter, Su Ah.

138
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,870
Why would you bring up fate?

139
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,710
This parole review is her last chance to be released with her daughter,

140
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,310
so I give Candidate 233 a qualified opinion

141
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,580
for her parole.

142
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,040
Though I feel bad for her situation, rules are rules.

143
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,770
Since her recidivism rating is 3,

144
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,780
I give her a disqualified opinion.

145
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,280
Though she hasn't fulfilled her enforcement rate,

146
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,570
I see no problems with her being released early to care for her child.

147
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,380
I give her a qualified opinion.

148
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,820
Overall, she lacks the requirements to be released.

149
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,470
I give her a disqualified opinion.

150
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,120
This is my first time here, so is it okay to give my opinion at the front?

151
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,840
We currently have 2 qualified and 2 disqualified opinions.

152
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,100
So, my opinion will decide the vote, right?

153
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,000
- It looks that way.
 - I see.

154
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,910
My opinion is...

155
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:38,340
Su Ah, these clothes are gifts from the correction officers.

156
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,380
It's nice to wear new clothes, right?

157
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,600
All done. Let's take a look.

158
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,380
My Su Ah, you look so pretty.

159
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,260
She's so pretty.

160
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,040
Su Ah, let Auntie hug you from behind.

161
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,610
Su Ah, you can't forget Auntie 2218, okay?

162
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,650
No, just forget about Auntie.

163
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,480
Forget us all

164
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,970
and have a happy, healthy, and wealthy life, okay?

165
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,940
Hey, once Su Ah leaves, you won't see her again.

166
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,730
Say goodbye.

167
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,220
Hey, wherever you go, don't complain about sleeping or eating.

168
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,860
Gosh, I got something in my eye.

169
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,630
Su Ah, goodbye.

170
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,330
All right, it's time to leave now.

171
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,960
- Let's go.
 - Bye-bye, Su Ah!

172
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Bye-bye.

173
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,830
Su Ah, bye-bye.

174
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,560
Bye-bye!

175
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,410
Assistant Baek, are you crying?

176
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,170
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,910
I'm the one who wants to cry!

178
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,900
Gosh, what a hassle. Goodness.

179
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,270
Stop crying.

180
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,150
I really didn't know it would turn out like this.

181
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,390
Why do I keep tearing up?

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,310
 My opinion is... 

183
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,810
 a qualified opinion. 

184
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,080
 Thank you! 

185
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,480
 Thank you! 

186
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,230
 - Thank you!
 - You don't need to thank me like that. 

187
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,230
 Thank you! 

188
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,670
 So weird, so weird. I don't get these people. 

189
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,400
 My goodness. 

190
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,500
 Then, with 3 qualified and 2 disqualified opinions, 

191
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,510
 we'll conclude that Candidate 233 has a qualified opinion. 

192
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,650
 Thank you! 

193
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,620
 Attorney Seo. 

194
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,950
 Yes? 

195
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,820
 I guess you listened to my advice. 

196
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,230
 You stopped me to say this nonsense? I'm busy. 

197
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,870
 I was scared that you would give her a disqualified opinion because of me. 

198
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,100
 Hey, that's your misunderstanding. 

199
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,440
 You have no impact on my life whatsoever. 

200
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,890
 As a parole examiner, I made that decision 

201
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,670
 after assessing the candidate's situation 

202
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,550
 based on my own review standards. 

203
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,530
 What? Do you have anything else to say? 

204
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,900
 You don't, right? I'll be going since I'm busy. 

205
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,810
 Don't smile. 

206
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,890
 He's a funny man. 

207
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,320
 I can't tell what he's thinking. 

208
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,980
Su Ah.

209
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,980
Bye!

210
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,040
Bye! Live a happy life!

211
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,960
Thank you.

212
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,940
Thanks to you, I don't have to be separated from Su Ah.

213
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,620
If it wasn't for you all, I would really...

214
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,790
Thank you.

215
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,510
You've gone through a lot, Eun Ji.

216
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,220
Su Ah, you've been through a lot, too.

217
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,460
You, too, President Choi, and everyone else as well.

218
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,420
Are we holding a funeral? Stop being so sentimental and leave!

219
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,240
Also, carry her bags and help her with the baby's jacket.

220
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,360
Are you crying, too?

221
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,300
I think she's mad because of me.

222
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,790
No, she rushed over here, saying you two shouldn't wait outside in the cold.

223
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,130
President Choi, I love you!

224
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,210
Thank you.

225
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,990
Shut up! Are you all going to live here?

226
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,540
- Don't keep the baby out in the cold, and come quickly!
 - Come.

227
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,540
Hurry up and open the door.

228
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,670
Here, come in.

229
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,290
Aigoo, aigoo.

230
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,080
She's so pretty.

231
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,750
Gosh, every time I watch this, I feel so...

232
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
touched.

233
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,340
What are the chances that I would run into her like that?

234
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,990
   

235
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,920
All right.

236
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,310
All right. I prepared a meal for you. Please enjoy.

237
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,120
Why would you do something I didn't even ask for?

238
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,260
I was so grateful, but this was the only thing I could do.

239
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,030
Since you made it already, I'll eat it.

240
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,200
- Let's eat.
 - Yes.

241
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,950
Hey guys, bring the baby─

242
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,460
Do you like it?

243
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,040
Yes, it's good.

244
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,340
Noodles all taste the same.

245
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,920
   

246
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,690
   

247
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,200
We're closed for the day.

248
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,370
We're closed for the day.

249
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,460
I guess your business is doing great, as usual.

250
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,200
President Choi!

251
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,730
What brings you here?

252
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,130
Did you come for some noodles?

253
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,060
Looks like you're out of ingredients and closed for the day.

254
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,560
My gosh. Of all people, you're here.

255
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,330
Of course, I can make you a bowl of noodles!

256
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,280
Forget the noodles.

257
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,140
I came because I have a favor to ask of you.

258
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,320
A favor?

259
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,600
Of course, I should do it since it's coming from you.

260
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,060
Gosh, I told you not to live like that!

261
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,070
How could you say yes without even knowing what I'll ask of you?

262
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,310
I've been able to earn a living thanks to you, President Choi.

263
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,260
Of course, I should do whatever it is.

264
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,640
What is it? Tell me quickly.

265
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,810
I'll send you someone.

266
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,250
Teach her how to run a business.

267
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,950
Well, that's not that difficult,

268
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,050
but who is it?

269
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,730
Someone who reminds me of my old self.

270
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,480
She'll work hard.

271
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,600
Since she has someone to protect.

272
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,870
Deal?

273
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,760
   

274
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,760
The only clue we have is that unregistered car, and all the CCTVs are useless.

275
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,210
This is driving me nuts.

276
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,210
Should I ask colleagues in other teams about someone who's good at tracking unregistered cars?

277
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,880
No, I'll ask.

278
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,430
Who?

279
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,130
Gosh, you're all working so hard.

280
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,870
Inspector An, here you are.

281
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,150
It's been a while. Nice to see you again.

282
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,560
- How can we help you?
 - Why do you pretend not to see me? It's been a while.

283
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,860
What's this?

284
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,160
I guess you decided to come at me with more people now.

285
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,410
No, I'm thinking of beating you up with the law.

286
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,260
What are you doing right now?

287
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,650
All right. Ta-da! We've come from Ojeong Group's legal team.

288
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,220
Yes, I know, Attorney Seo Dong Hoon.

289
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,560
I worked so hard to catch Choi Jeong Hak, and you took him.

290
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,350
Citing presumption of innocence.

291
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,020
And then, Choi Jeong Hak died.

292
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,390
Wow, you have such a good memory.

293
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:01,110
But today, I came regarding your malicious dissemination of false information

294
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,160
and defamation of Executive Director Ji Myeong Seob.

295
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,270
I came to tell you that I filed a lawsuit against you, Inspector An.

296
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,260
This is something I need to see for myself.

297
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,720
That's right.

298
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,350
Here. Here, take this.

299
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,380
I see. You're trying to shut me up with a lawsuit. 
    

300
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,790
- Geez.
 - Wh-What's wrong?

301
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,450
Her reaction is too boring.

302
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,840
Too boring?

303
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,400
Really? It's only starting to get fun for me.

304
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,260
- What?
 - I dangled the discovery of Choi Jeong Hak's corpse case,

305
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,690
and you're floundering around in fear

306
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,570
as if you're a criminal caught red-handed.

307
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,610
Again, again, again! You're saying words of defamation!

308
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,500
Everyone heard her problematic words, right?

309
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,700
Sue me as much as you want.

310
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll investigate you as much as I want.

311
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,790
- I'll be going.
 - Bye now.

312
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,450
Whoa, how could she be so bold when she just got sued?

313
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,140
Wow! Everyone saw Inspector An's attitude when she received the lawsuit, right?

314
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,600
Everyone saw, right? Everyone saw.

315
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,030
A noodle house?

316
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:24,090
A-Are you saying President Choi found employment for Heo Eun Ji?

317
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,870
Wow, I knew Heo Eun Ji could do it.

318
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,490
You know how pretty women are also good at cooking.

319
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,820
You know that.

320
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,230
Gosh, you seem so happy, Mr. Hwang.

321
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,970
Is it that obvious?

322
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,550
I don't need to eat this ramen. I can eat noodles.

323
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,010
- Hello? Yes, Inspector.
 - But it's not good cold.

324
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,730
Something you need to discuss with me?

325
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,790
- Here.
 - Okay.

326
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,590
Will noodles be enough for the people who helped you out?

327
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,420
But the noodles are tasty.

328
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,710
Okay. Ask them if they need anything else.

329
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,530
Okay.

330
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,810
Oh, it's ready.

331
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,610
All right.

332
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,010
- Thank you for the food.
 - Please.

333
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,540
I'm so grateful to Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin and President Choi,

334
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,200
but this is all I can do for you.

335
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, no, this is more than enough.

336
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,090
Gosh, it looks so good.

337
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,200
Thank you for the food.

338
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,930
You're welcome. If you need anything, please let me know.

339
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,330
By President Choi, does she mean Smile Cash's President Choi?

340
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,530
Yes. She also helped her get a job here after her release.

341
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,640
I guess she's pretty different from the rumors.

342
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,730
Well, you can only know a person after getting to know them.

343
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,340
Please eat.

344
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,380
Oh, you guys seem to be enjoying yourselves.

345
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,920
President Choi, come in!

346
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,130
Please come join us.

347
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,690
Are you doing well, Eun Ji?

348
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,980
I asked her to join us since she was about to have lunch soon.

349
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,940
You said you had something to tell me, Inspector An.

350
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,340
Shall we discuss it later?

351
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,950
Choi Jeong Hak died.

352
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,430
I thought I should tell you, Attorney.

353
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,800
- The cause of death is?
 - According to the autopsy results, it wasn't a homicide,

354
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,270
but I'm sure it was a homicide made to look like a suicide.

355
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,390
If it's a homicide, do you have any suspects?

356
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,010
Ojeong Group's Ji Myeong Seob.

357
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,500
But Choi Jeong Hak's body was found in an unregistered car.

358
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,050
So, I'm stuck in my investigation.

359
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,310
An unregistered car?

360
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,420
Unregistered car...

361
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,120
- Unregistered car.
 - What, what?

362
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,770
If it's an unregistered car, aren't you an expert in that field?

363
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,940
It's true. That is my expertise.

364
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,460
What? Do you want me to help you?

365
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,980
I mean, you should ask yourself if you want my help.

366
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,240
Do you want me to help you or not?

367
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,970
What did you come to leave with me? A car?

368
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,310
It's been a while.

369
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,450
- P-President Choi!
 - Hey.

370
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,250
- How have you been?
 - Doing well, all thanks to you.

371
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,300
But what brings you here? You didn't even call ahead.

372
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,570
I'm looking for something.

373
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,000
- Oh, you should first say hello.
 - Sorry?

374
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,090
All right, this is the famous unregistered car businessman,

375
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,320
- Jobs.*
 - Regi.*
  ("Jobsregi" sounds like Korean for "random trash") 

376
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,270
President Choi, your sense of humor is...

377
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,700
How could you call me random trash?

378
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,760
I'm pretty much like a revolutionary Steve Jobs,

379
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:43,270
creating the most cutting-edge system to make the illegal, unregistered car business world clean!

380
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,600
You're still all talk, I see.

381
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,200
Here.

382
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,350
I want to find the actual owner of this unregistered car.

383
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,440
He ran away without paying me.

384
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,290
There's someone who would dare to recklessly run away without paying you, President Choi?

385
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,200
What a stupid bastard.

386
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,120
Seonbae, sorry to call you out during your work.

387
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,230
It's okay. Sit down.

388
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,050
I asked Jeoksong Prison for a list of Seonbaenim's visitors during his imprisonment.

389
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,950
Check it.

390
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,910
   

391
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,570
Son Eung Jun?

392
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,620
Isn't he the Director of Ojeong Group?

393
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,680
Yeah.

394
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,480
There must be a reason why these bastards

395
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,450
are still so fixated on the chief

396
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,460
after framing him for a crime he didn't commit.

397
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,810
Until Chief is released... no...

398
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,860
if he could get released,

399
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,210
they'll continue to watch him.

400
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,620
But why do you think Chief met with Ojeong Group's

401
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,520
Director Son when he rejected our visitations?

402
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,890
That's what I can't understand, either.

403
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,980
There must be some reason.

404
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,680
I must hear it from him directly.

405
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,600
From whom?

406
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,440
Chief Cheon.

407
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,250
How will you do that when he keeps rejecting our visitations?

408
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,950
What can I do to make this happen?

409
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,040
Huh? This is a fake license plate made in a factory in Southeast Asia.

410
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,820
It's a fake you can buy for 500,000 won.

411
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,220
- How do I catch this asshole?
 - This asshole?

412
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,580
Seeing how there's no transaction record,

413
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,400
he must have bought the car from a junkyard and put the license plate on it.

414
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,200
A junkyard that repairs cars meant to be scrapped,

415
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,940
attaches a fake license plate and sells them─

416
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,580
Where's such a junkyard?

417
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,110
Hey, Ju Mok. I'm investigating the unregistered car seller, so get over here.

418
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,520
Yeah, I'll send you the address.

419
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,680
 24 Mi. 5883! 

420
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,500
 You sold this car! You'd better tell it to me straight! 

421
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,130
Should I fold your junkyard and your life in half today?

422
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,420
Hey! I'll say it one more time.

423
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,130
Listen carefully.

424
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:37,460
24 Mi 5883!

425
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,360
Wait, wait! Stop, stop.

426
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,840
Why? Did you find something? Shit.

427
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,970
That's him.

428
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,000
Ahjussi, you have the transaction records, right? Hand them over.

429
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,120
Do you think he put his personal info on paper while buying an unregistered car?

430
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,220
Do you think he disclosed his phone number and talked to him?

431
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,160
Geez, that ahjumma...

432
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,830
I heard you're pretty famous in this field.

433
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,630
You manage your customers well, right?

434
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,630
Pardon? M-Manage customers?

435
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,910
You know a secret way to contact him, right?

436
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,560
W-Well, I mean...

437
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,370
Gosh, Assistant Baek. Go and fold him in half.

438
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,550
Fold him in half and wash him.

439
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,960
- Don't you shower? Don't you wash?
 - Tell me quickly.

440
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,700
- Don't get near me. You stink.
 - Tell me before I fold you in half.

441
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,040
 24 Mi 5883. I just received an order to scrap it quickly because it's a suicide vehicle. 

442
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,520
 But there's something strange in it. 

443
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,930
 What strange thing? 

444
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,240
 Something the police might find interesting. 

445
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,530
 If you're curious, bring me some money and check it out. 

446
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,620
24 Mi 5884. Where's that car?

447
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,630
- It's not here.
 - What?

448
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,220
I didn't know you would actually come!

449
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,190
Damn it! What rubbish is this?

450
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,660
Gosh, I finally get to see your face.

451
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,730
I had high expectations because you kept hiding your face,

452
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,340
but in reality, your face is subpar.

453
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,650
So, it's you.

454
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,870
♫  I'm a typhoon that will wipe away the unjust world  ♫

455
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,610
♫  The steps of these cowards busy running away  ♫

456
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,190
Let's end it here.

457
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,660
♫  You can't see the light before you know the truth. I'll protect my will even in the face of power  ♫

458
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,380
Get out.

459
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,710
Oh, there she is.

460
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,780
Hey, Inspector An.

461
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,440
What's this?

462
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,430
And who is this?

463
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,860
The prime suspect in the murder of Choi Jeong Hak.

464
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,800
I'll explain later after I interrogate him.

465
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,980
   

466
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,440
 Seonbae, you know Warden Bae Han Seong, right? 

467
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,010
 - Prison Warden Bae?
 - Yes. 

468
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,250
 After he became the prison warden, 

469
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,730
 he began lying low while busy being dragged around by Chairman Ji. 

470
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,950
 But don't you think we should watch him more closely? 

471
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,520
 That's right. 

472
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,530
 He may fall back into his old habits and start acting up. 

473
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,600
   

474
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,460
   

475
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,770
Yes, hello?

476
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,320
Attorney Lee, it's me.

477
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,670
I tracked down the unregistered car with Inspector An today,

478
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,660
and she arrested the unregistered car buyer.

479
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:27,130
I thought I should let you know that everything went well, Attorney Lee.

480
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:32,640
Things get resolved quickly when you get involved, President Choi.

481
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,280
I know these are empty words, but it's so nice to hear that.

482
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,880
I think I'll tell you the details in person. What do you think?

483
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,470
Oh, okay. Well...

484
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,900
I had something to talk to you about anyway. Come on over.

485
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,590
Okay, then I'll head over right away.

486
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,990
Assistant Baek, let's go quickly.

487
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,620
Okay.

488
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,480
On January 6th, you bought an unregistered car at Donggan Junkyard.

489
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,500
With Choi Jeong Hak in the car, you entered Ilcheon Valley at 3:40 a.m.

490
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,640
You administered drugs to him there and lit the charcoal starter to make it look like a suicide. Right?

491
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,290
What are you talking about?

492
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,990
All I did was buy the unregistered car at his request.

493
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,790
Strangulation marks on his neck and tons of abrasions and bruises all over his body show it was a homicide!

494
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,450
It's true that you killed him.

495
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,840
I didn't kill him.

496
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,730
Im Jeong Gyeon,

497
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,910
you're here as the prime suspect in Choi Jeong Hak's murder.

498
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,540
I'm sure you killed Choi Jeong Hak with Ji Myeong Seob.

499
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,060
Ji Myeong Seob murdered my younger sister,

500
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,600
and you killed Choi Jeong Hak because he had proof of that!

501
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,400
No. I told you that's not true!

502
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,890
Yes, Detective Kim.

503
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,260
I called you as we planned.

504
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,740
What?

505
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,240
That was there?

506
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,510
Okay, hurry up and come back.

507
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,920
Come back?

508
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,140
The interrogation is over.

509
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,400
But will you be okay to leave right now?

510
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,030
If we've found the evidence that Choi Jeong Hak hid,

511
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,210
Ojeong Group won't leave you alone.

512
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,610
You don't know what's filmed there.

513
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:46,500
So, the evidence Choi Jeong Hak was hiding was a video, huh?

514
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,690
Why did you ask to meet me?

515
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,850
What could we possibly have to talk about?

516
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,340
That's right.

517
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,020
It wouldn't be you unless you looked at me with disgust and talked back to me, Choi Won Mi.

518
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,380
Ahjumma, you haven't changed.

519
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,590
If you're going to say such nonsense, I'll be leaving.

520
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,400
Let go!

521
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,500
You couldn't say a thing when my dad beat you every day. But I'm easy to dismiss, yeah?

522
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Let go!

523
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,320
So? You remember how my dad used to take turns beating you and me, right?

524
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,210
Let go!

525
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,930
You hate my dad, too.

526
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,660
That's why you aren't dropping the charges.

527
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,210
I dropped the charges.

528
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,120
How could you drop the charges already!

529
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,970
He kept threatening me.

530
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,970
I need to live, too!

531
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:43,010
I need to live!

532
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,340
Will you get dragged around like a dog on a leash for the rest of your life?

533
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,760
Don't be like that, and let's get revenge together.

534
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,520
Are you crazy? Revenge?

535
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,500
The people who know Ojeong Group Chairman Ji Dong Man the best are us two.

536
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,310
Everything from his true nature to the weaknesses he wants to hide.

537
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,870
 Shut up. 

538
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,690
 Stop making a fuss and listen to me. 

539
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,000
 Make sure you cover up this incident. 

540
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,200
 If any word of this gets out, 

541
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,370
 it will affect not only you but also our entire group! Got it? 

542
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,780
 The death of a lowly girl is not a big deal! 

543
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,740
 Cover it up, cover it up! 

544
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,970
 Death? 

545
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,860
Hey, stop being a nuisance

546
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,430
and drink your alcohol without causing trouble.

547
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,700
If you keep this up, things could all go downhill in an instant, like in the past.

548
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,760
Also, you better watch out.

549
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,060
   

550
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,050
Is this your first time in the VIP room?

551
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,080
It's also my first time at a nightclub.

552
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,660
That's nice.

553
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,240
Pardon?

554
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,760
It's nice that you're so innocent.

555
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,860
What is it?

556
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,640
Gosh, you've got such a good eye, Hyeong.

557
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,470
I decided to give you something extra since it's you, Hyeong.

558
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,280
- Should I sit next to you?
 - Please just leave.

559
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,270
Okay, okay. Have fun!

560
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,140
See you.

561
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,790
I called you because I was bored drinking alone.

562
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,800
You can leave after we chat a bit.

563
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,610
You can leave whenever you'd like.

564
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,490
I'll just drink water.

565
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,940
Oh, you want to drink water?

566
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,370
Give me your glass.

567
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,640
I'll be leaving.

568
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,680
Leave if you can.

569
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,350
You've got good mental strength.

570
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,210
- Where are you going?
 - Let go of me!

571
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,690
You wretched bitch!

572
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,440
What the...

573
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,930
Is she dead?

574
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,260
Damn it.

575
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,910
Director Son,

576
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,150
well, I...

577
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,720
I have a bit of an annoying situation. You need to come.

578
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,870
You're here?

579
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,660
She's dead, right?

580
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,900
Is she dead?

581
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:33,450
Damn it, this is so annoying.

582
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,210
You brought a car, right?

583
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,360
Give me the keys.

584
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
A person has died.

585
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,980
So what?

586
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,460
Isn't it your job to clean up after stuff like this?

587
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,070
Hand over the car keys.

588
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,360
Please go straight home.

589
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,340
Just clean up this mess properly.

590
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,990
I'm leaving.

591
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,700
Hey! Hey!

592
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,480
Are you okay?

593
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,590
- Are you okay?
 - Damn it!

594
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,900
Gosh, this is so annoying! Damn it!

595
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,960
Move!

596
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:54,490
In the end, he'll be released.

597
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,920
Just like how it has always been.

598
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,220
No.

599
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,100
I found evidence that he's connected to Choi Jeong Hak's death and requested an arrest warrant─

600
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,860
The warrant won't be issued.

601
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,350
All you've found so far is circumstantial evidence,

602
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:20,940
and you already know that it would be difficult to detain Im Jeong Gyeon

603
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,520
just for buying an unregistered car.

604
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,180
It was like that back then, too.

605
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,500
Back then, those bastards...

606
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:45,990
   

607
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,130
 You're really not picking up? 

608
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,100
 You're not picking up? 

609
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,930
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail 

610
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,680
 after the beep and, there will be an additional charge. 

611
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,310
 She's ignoring me now that she's an adult? 

612
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,680
   

613
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,240
   

614
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,320
 Yeah. 

615
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,330
 What is it? Is there an incident? 

616
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,950
 Seonbae. 

617
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,720
 Tell me. 

618
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,030
 The thing is... 

619
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,500
   

620
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,150
 Da Yun... 

621
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,830
 Da Yun... 

622
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,830
 I'm sorry. 

623
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,900
 I will... 

624
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,590
 I will... 

625
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,570
 I will make sure to find the bastard who did this to you 

626
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,510
 and kill him. 

627
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,460
 I will... 

628
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,230
 I will make sure to find the bastard who did this to you and kill him! 

629
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,540
 I'll be leaving. 

630
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:20,570
 I'll find the evidence that you killed my younger sister. 

631
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,330
 I bet you won't. 

632
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,290
 You son of a bitch! 

633
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,940
 - Seonbae!
 - Inspector An Seo Yun. 

634
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,720
 Follow me. 

635
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,600
 Geez, took you long enough. 

636
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,810
 An Seo Yun. 

637
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:57,220
 Do you know what age we live in? How could you use physical violence? 

638
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,230
 - I'm sorry.
 - Forget it. 

639
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,370
 Take your hands off this case. 

640
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,560
 - Pardon?
 - You're not in your right mind right now. 

641
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,320
 I understand since it's your younger sister. That's why you should be off this case. 

642
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,900
 - Captain!
 - If you don't want to face disciplinary punishment, 

643
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,420
 do what I say. 

644
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,630
 You understand? 

645
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,520
All the circumstances pointed to Ji Myeong Seob as the culprit. However─

646
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,480
It was after all the conclusive evidence disappeared,

647
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:35,010
and you probably had no choice but to watch him slip through the cracks of the law.

648
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,600
I also experienced that.

649
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:52,370
Chief Cheon, whom I followed and relied on like a father,

650
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,800
was framed by the Ojeong Group.

651
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,760
But there was nothing I could do

652
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,100
as a correction officer.

653
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,960
Gosh, is it almost done?

654
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,410
 Is that why you became a parole examiner? 

655
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,120
Not too long ago, Ji Myeong Seob came to see me.

656
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,340
Ji Myeong Seob?

657
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,340
He made me an offer.

658
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:35,470
 Even I don't think that my dad should be released on parole. 

659
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,150
 If you can stop his parole until he pays his due, that would be great. 

660
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,090
 Or if he can stay in there for life, that's even better. 

661
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,370
 You're thinking, "What is this guy plotting," right? 

662
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,920
 I'm really not plotting anything. 

663
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,730
 So, tell me. 

664
00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:00,890
 I'll help in any way for a strategy that will be a win-win for both of us. 

665
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:07,250
He said let's partner up

666
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:12,180
to bring Ji Dong Man down.

667
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,450
I don't know about anything else, but he seemed to mean that,

668
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:19,400
so I'm thinking of accepting his offer.

669
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,470
Attorney Lee, Ji Myeong Seob is trying to use you.

670
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,190
He'll cast you aside when he gets what he wants.

671
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:36,320
I will do exactly the same.

672
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:42,230
I'll use Ji Myeong Seob to strike Ji Dong Man, then cast him aside mercilessly.

673
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:47,240
I'll bring down Ojeong Group with the same method

674
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,380
that Ojeong Group used up until now.

675
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:02,480
I'll join you.

676
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,850
When is Attorney Lee coming? He said he'll be here soon!

677
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:23,340
Yes, he called me saying he'll be here soon.

678
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,490
Aigoo, I'm a little late.

679
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,880
- You should've called us.
 - Goodness.

680
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,270
Since Attorney Lee is here, I should go now.

681
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:33,680
President Choi, where are you going?

682
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,930
Why did you come so soon? Why not come in the morning?

683
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,550
Our conversation took longer than expected. I'm sorry.

684
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,830
I don't feel like drinking anymore.

685
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:44,790
Aigoo, President Choi, you should have just one more glass.

686
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:48,020
Just one more glass? Maybe I shall.

687
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,590
Cheers!

688
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,650
Gosh, you've got such a dangerous face. So dangerous.

689
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:18,130
All right, so what is it this time?

690
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,520
Well...

691
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:25,910
Hello?

692
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,780
 I checked the contents of your lawsuit. 

693
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,120
Oh, did you finally get scared and call me about a settlement?

694
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,490
That's not it.

695
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:38,610
I just thought I should return the favor since I got that from you.

696
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,980
Return the favor? Like what?

697
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,610
Im Jeong Gyeon, the guy who always wore a helmet.

698
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,310
I caught him.

699
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,140
   

700
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,940
These bastards!

701
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,260
Because I'm not stepping in, they have no fear and keep stepping all over.

702
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:13,590
I'll destroy every single bastard who's been getting in my way!

703
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,060
Director Son.

704
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,340
Yes, Chairman.

705
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,350
I must break the finger that would hurt Lee Han Sin the most.

706
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:22,760
I'm talking about Cheon Su Beom!

707
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,630
- Warden Bae.
 - Y-Yes?

708
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,830
- Make preparations for me to leave briefly.
 - Okay.

709
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,590
Whether a temporary leave or a medical treatment, prepare so I can leave immediately!

710
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,780
Yes, understood, sir!

711
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,350
Yes.

712
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,350
   

713
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,060
- Hyeongnim!
 - Oh, you're here, Gi Su?

714
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,830
- Please drink this.
 - Give me a second.

715
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:10,040
No one will complain, even if you don't finish that today.

716
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,440
Hurry up, my arm hurts, my arm hurts!

717
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,140
Okay, okay.

718
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,140
This guy...

719
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,950
What brings you to this area?

720
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,940
I can only see you here, Hyeongnim. That's why I came.

721
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,560
It's hot, so drink it slowly.

722
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,260
Gosh, it's good.

723
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,530
I'll go and check up on the guys.

724
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,070
- Okay. Thanks for the drink!
 - Sure.

725
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,410
 If you don't want to see Lee Han Sin dead, 

726
00:57:55,410 --> 00:58:00,730
 just keep living quietly, as though you don't exist. 

727
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,080
Gosh, you've been both a correction officer and an inmate.

728
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,110
How could you be so naive when you've spent so much time in prison?

729
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,550
How could you be so trusting?

730
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,740
Gi Su, why would you...

731
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,570
Me?

732
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,670
I was hired to kill you today.

733
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,790
I don't know the reason why.

734
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:10,180
Why don't you ask the person who hired me when you get out?

735
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,210
Correction Officer!

736
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,100
Inmate 2777, wake up! Are you all right?

737
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,710
I heard a loud crash, so I went and saw him on the floor, passed out.

738
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,960
He must've hit his forehead on a rusty iron lever, but gosh...

739
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,900
If not treated properly, he could get sepsis.

740
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:43,070
What? Last month, an article saying we neglected a sepsis patient caused a ruckus.

741
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,790
Let's move him to an outside hospital.

Ji Dong Man left the prison? 

751
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,930
 Correction Officer! Over here! 

752
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:58,650
 There are drugs inside that. 

753
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,230
 How do you record videos? 

754
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,710
 I know you guys have a backup plan to survive. 

755
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:06,730
 So, you're the president bitch who runs this sewer of a corner store. 

756
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,000
 Ji Dong Man. 

757
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,250
 The more I look into them, the clearer it becomes why I should bring them down. 

758
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,410
 I found it. 

759
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:17,040
 Can we stop his parole if we find proof that he left the prison without authorization? 

760
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,090
 Do you really not know where it is? 

761
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:22,380
 She's alive! She's alive!
