00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,020

00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,420
   

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,120
Han Sin!

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,300
- You've gone through a lot.
 - Chief.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,230
- Congratulations.
 - Congratulations.

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,430
- Oh, thank you.
 - Thank you.

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,680
You all must be busy. Why'd you come out all this way?

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,290
What are you saying? Of course, we should come.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,030
But I think it's too early to let our guard down.

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,430
Though you were released on a cancellation of detention decision, the investigation isn't over yet.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,500
Still, once Chief Cheon wins the retrial,

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,900
the case will close with them being declared innocent.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,780
Right now, the public opinion is favorable, right?

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,380
Yes, that's right.

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,730
There's even an open chatroom with the name Ogyopa,

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,690
short for "Let's Expose the Correctional Services Corruption of Ojeong Group."

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,230
Attorney Lee.

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,660
- Attorney!
 - Attorney Lee Han Sin!

29
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,920
Let me ask you a question.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,090
Is it true that you're innocent regarding the Sangbu Prison drug smuggling case?

31
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,620
Is it true that Ojeong Group manipulated the case at the time?

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,900
- Please give us a statement. 
 - Please.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,860
Attorney Lee Han Sin, while you were a parole examiner,

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,900
you stopped Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole twice.

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,840
Do you think this was an act of retribution for that?

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,940
 Please give us a statement. Please give us a response. 

37
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,250
 Just one statement. Please look this way as well. 

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,040
Yes. I was unjustly detained despite not committing any crimes.

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,510
Meanwhile, Chairman Ji Dong Man, who even committed a jailbreak during his sentence,

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,000
was released on a special pardon.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
However,

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,520
it won't be long now.

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,650
The truth that Ojeong Group covered up and buried with their money and power...

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,950
That truth will soon be exposed...

45
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,790
for all to see.

46
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,750
 These days... 

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,460
♫  I'm a megalomaniac  ♫

48
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,470
♫  I'm going to take all your pennies, uh  ♫

49
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,680
♫  Even if you hide, I’ll find a way to you  ♫

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,050
   

51
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,440
 The public opinion has completely shifted. 

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
Lee Han Sin was released as well.

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,010
It will be difficult to stop Cheon Su Beom's retrial, too.

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,210
Send Myeong Seob away first before the re-investigation gets started.

55
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,960
Damn it.

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,010
Hurry up and get up.

57
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,580
I said, get up!

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,360
Now, you're speaking down to me to my face.

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,310
Cheon Su Beom's case might be overturned with a retrial.

60
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,720
You have to leave quickly before a travel ban is issued.

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,600
Why are you making such a fuss when my dad's going to take care of it?

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,140
If you miss your chance now, you'll end up in prison.

63
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,590
The situation will get more serious.

64
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,560
Gosh, damn it.

65
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,480
His ability to deal with problems sucks shit with his age.

66
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,580
You don't have time for this.

67
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,480
I'm going to wash before I go!

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,040
I'll wash up before I go.

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,990
Don't I have time to wash up before I go?

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,990
Then, will you go to prison instead?

71
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,680
Dad wouldn't go in my place.

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,570
I guess you're going, Director Son.

73
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,340
Thanks.

74
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,930
Gosh, your driving sucks.

75
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,680
Are we here?

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,450
Where are we?

77
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,570
Huh?

78
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,540
Where are we?

79
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,260
You're not having other thoughts, are you?

80
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,200
I asked where we are!

81
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,770
Myeong Seob!

82
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,570
Ji Myeong Seob!

83
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,770
How much longer must I deal with you?

84
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,350
Let me go!

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,560
Myeong Seob.

86
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,460
Can't you think of your father and live like a human being for once?

87
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,050
Let go of me!

88
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,990
Let go!

89
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,800
Let go.

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,340
I could just kill you here.

91
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,900
You know that?

92
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,750
Let me breathe.

93
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,370
Y-You're really... g-going to kill me.

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,370
Myeong Seob.

95
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,550
I'm also at fault.

96
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,020
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,780
   

98
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,670
Hold your glass.

99
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,320
Even while I was able to eat all sorts of luxurious foods,

100
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:30,040
I missed these BBQ trimmings the most in prison.

101
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,490
Here.

102
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,900
We used to crawl in here to eat late at night

103
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,440
after stamping debt collections all day in the marketplace.

104
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,660
We used to grill the trimmings left over from the butcher.

105
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,210
I don't know why this was so tasty then.

106
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,250
   

107
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,930
I'm sorry, Eung Jun.

108
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,050
I raised my son wrong.

109
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,020
As a result,

110
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,580
both you and I are suffering,

111
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,960
and my company as well.

112
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,540
Fortunately, we sent Myeong Seob abroad,

113
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,230
but we'll need someone to take the fall for it.

114
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,650
There are too many things against us.

115
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,210
Eung Jun, I'm asking you this.

116
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,430
Shouldn't the guy who will inherit our Ojeong Group

117
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,110
be flawless without any issues?

118
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,010
I'll put the entire legal team in charge of your case.

119
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,680
I'll look for an opportunity to get you out on parole or a special pardon.

120
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,210
When you're released, take over a subsidiary company.

121
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,880
It's about time you hear people call you "president."

122
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,320
 Do you think Cheon Su Beom is worth putting your own life on the line? 

123
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,830
 What about you, Director? 

124
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,660
 Is Ojeong Group... 

125
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,160
 worth that much? 

126
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,970
 Enough for you to take all the blame for its crimes? 

127
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,750
 Is Ojeong Group worth that? 

128
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,130
 Ojeong Group isn't worth that. However, 

129
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,280
 the chairman is a different story. 

130
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,550
 I guess we both put our lives on the line for another person. 

131
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,570
 Both you... 

132
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,300
 and me, Attorney Lee. 

133
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,450
   

134
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,850
Attorney Lee.

135
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,660
You look worse off than before.

136
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,210
Yes.

137
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,010
But what brings you all the way here, Ms. Choi?

138
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,940
You're doing well, right?

139
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,780
Actually, I came because I was in a dilemma.

140
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,470
What dilemma?

141
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,930
I have something deadly and dangerous.

142
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,860
Because of that, I can't sleep at all.

143
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,650
Help me.

144
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,680
 You still haven't come to your senses yet? 

145
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,990
Choi Won Mi brought such a dangerous video to Ji Dong Man?

146
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,600
- Why is that?
 - Why do you think?

147
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,390
To tell you to stop being childish and blocking my path.

148
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,320
Instead of me, you could've given it to Lee Han Sin,

149
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,710
whom you partnered with to stop my parole.

150
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,790
- I already did.
 - What?

151
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,110
Did you think that was the original copy?

152
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:06,740
I'm not so naive and foolish that I wouldn't have a backup plan.

153
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,210
If something were to happen to me,

154
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,420
or if you keep blocking my path,

155
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,610
Attorney Lee will release that video.

156
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,980
So, you're saying Lee Han Sin has the original copy?

157
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,700
Yes.

158
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,500
   

159
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,030
   

160
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,800
I guess Ms. Choi came by.

161
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,340
 You crazy bastard! How could you kill someone? 

162
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,130
   

163
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,260
 It's not a big deal. 

164
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,540
 I was just a bit unlucky. 

165
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,350
 It's not a big deal? 

166
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,970
 Director Son is going through hell trying to clean up your mess! 

167
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,910
 So, he just needs to clean it up properly! 

168
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,090
 You still haven't come to your senses yet? 

169
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,470
 Why don't you say anything? 

170
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,560
 This is conclusive evidence. 

171
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,180
-  Are you a celebrity?
 - Yes. 

172
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,570
 If only Ji Myeong Seob confessed to it clearly. 

173
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,070
 It's a shame. 

174
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,190
 Let's hand over that video to Ji Dong Man. 

175
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,000
 - What are you saying? 
- Attorney Lee! 

176
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,540
What will you do for me if I hand this over to you, Chairman?

177
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,800
I see that you've lost your sense of fear after getting out using a few tricks.

178
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,760
Lee Han Sin, are you threatening me right now?

179
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,880
It's not a threat but a negotiation offer.

180
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,820
Shall we...

181
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,450
discuss the conditions in person?

182
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,770
 I can't leave him alone anymore. 

183
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,300
 I'll need to see to his end. 

184
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,200
 I'll take care of Lee Han Sin 

185
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,840
 and go to prison, Chairman. 

186
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,580
You're on your way, right?

187
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,070
 Attorney, no matter how much I think about it, this is too dangerous. 

188
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,970
I know this is dangerous, but...

189
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,620
I have to risk danger

190
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,450
to catch him.

191
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,680
It's so quiet here that nobody would ever know if someone died.

192
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,130
Let's start the negotiations right away.

193
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,520
As I thought, you didn't come to negotiate.

194
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,790
Get on your knees.

195
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,190
Did you think I'd be scared and not be able to fix a small problem like that?

196
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,490
I came here to kill you myself.

197
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,630
I warned you before.

198
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,360
So, you shouldn't have run so wild.

199
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,290
There's no point in waiting.

200
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,630
The inspector bitch and loan shark bitch won't be coming here.

201
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,810
 Hurry up, Assistant Baek. 

202
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,630
 Yes, ma'am. 

203
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,890
I said, step on it.

204
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,760
If we're late, Attorney Lee will be in danger.

205
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay.

206
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,710
Hey, you bastard! Move your truck!

207
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,690
What a crazy bastard. How could he drive like that?

208
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,910
Tell him to move his truck quickly.

209
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,370
Hey, you bastard! Move your truck!

210
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,050
These bastards!

211
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Who are those bastards?

212
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,040
Inspector An, it looks like this will take some time.

213
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,190
- Go ahead first.
 - Will you be all right?

214
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,310
Come on! I'm Choi Hwa Ran!

215
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,950
Those two bitches will be busy dealing with the men I sent their way.

216
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,760
So, it's useless to hold out any hope.

217
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,650
Since you hastened your own death,

218
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,860
don't blame me for it.

219
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,640
- Chairman!
 - What is it?

220
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,800
This!

221
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,130
- You need this.
 - I can just kill you and take it.

222
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,730
I wasn't talking to you.

223
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,350
What?

224
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,480
Chairman!

225
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,990
Eung Jun, are you all right?

226
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,800
Wake up!

227
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,420
Damn it! That traitor is pretending to actually care about my dad.

228
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,780
Dad, Director Son betrayed you. You didn't know that, right?

229
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,100
I guess you've gotten old, Dad.

230
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,690
What?

231
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,550
 It's me. 

232
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,130
 It's all true. Come to the address I sent you and check for yourself. 

233
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,550
 I'll send you the evidence I've gathered until now, 

234
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,830
 so make sure he pays for his crimes. 

235
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,590
 In return, I'll take the blame for the chairman. 

236
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,360
 Don't get in my way. 

237
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,100
   

238
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,330
 So, how does it feel? 

239
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,230
 Should I release you? 

240
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,660
 What is this? 

241
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,470
 Did you partner with Director Son instead of me? 

242
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,000
 That's what I'm saying. 

243
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,090
 I wonder why Director Son tied you up and called me. 

244
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,910
 What are you saying? 

245
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,210
 You two aren't working together? 

246
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,000
 Ojeong Group isn't worth that. However, 

247
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,170
 the chairman is a different story. 

248
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,030
 It seems Director Son 

249
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,840
 thinks of you as an obstacle in Chairman Ji Dong Man's path. 

250
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,900
 So... 

251
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,590
 what about it? Go to the police station again? 

252
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,020
 No, no. I won't turn you over to the police. 

253
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,130
 Really? You mean that? 

254
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,250
 I'm thinking of meeting with Ji Dong Man today for a final showdown. 

255
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,930
 I have conclusive evidence of the murder... 

256
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,670
 you committed, Ji Myeong Seob. 

257
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,220
 What murder? 

258
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,600
 I guess you're getting confused because you've committed so many crimes. 

259
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,740
 If you're curious as to what evidence I've found and what conditions I'll give, 

260
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,330
 then come with me. 

261
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,550
 Are you crazy? Why would I go there? 

262
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,340
 It's up to you whether you come or not. 

263
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,540
 Help me up! 

264
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,890
 But when that evidence is exposed, 

265
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,150
 it'll be over for you, Chairman Ji Dong Man, and Ojeong Group as well. 

266
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,220
 He knows that. That's why he agreed to meet my negotiation terms. 

267
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:03,100
 Also, I'm planning to go today for a final showdown, no matter what. 

268
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,370
 It's too bad. I'm just not interested. 

269
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,350
 I told you already. It's up to you. 

270
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,810
 But aren't you curious how things will end? 

271
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,040
 I will lure Ji Myeong Seob there as well. 

272
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,070
 Attorney Lee, I don't think that's a good idea, no matter how I think. 

273
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,970
 Let's just release it all to the media. 

274
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,010
 The last time we released that video, 

275
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,360
 Ji Myeong Seob and Son Eung Jun were both promptly released. 

276
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,450
 It will be the same this time as well. 

277
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,880
 There is only one way we can punish them. 

278
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,260
 We must catch them in the act as red-handed perpetrators 

279
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,640
 so they don't have any time to 

280
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,480
 get rid of evidence and play tricks. 

281
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,500
Damn it! That traitor is pretending to actually care about my dad.

282
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,260
It hurts, right? It hurts, right? It hurts, right?

283
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,540
- Let go of me, damn it.
 - Eung Jun! Are you awake?

284
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,100
Why is Myeong Seob here?

285
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,150
Tell me quickly! Tell me!

286
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,660
- Ji Myeong Seob, no.
 - If you don't want to croak first, stay put.

287
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,380
- You!
 - Move, move!

288
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,000
Move. I said, move!

289
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,560
I'll take care of this myself. Stay in the car, Dad.

290
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,170
What? You'll take care of everything?

291
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,440
Have you gone mad?

292
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,240
Director Son has to take the fall for everything anyway!

293
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,530
He looks like he's barely alive.

294
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,550
It's only polite to end his life quickly. Right?

295
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,090
Gosh, Inspector An, you really don't listen!

296
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,210
I told you to go! I said, go!

297
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,560
- Hurry up and go!
 - President, are you all right?

298
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,180
Hey, hurry up and clear these guys.

299
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,700
Clear them out quickly!

300
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,940
Let's go!

301
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,160
We found it! Pull it up!

302
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,090
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

303
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,720
Over here!

304
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,990
Careful, careful.

305
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,780
It's coming out! It's coming out!

306
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,580
Pull! Pull!

307
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,740
It's almost up. Careful, careful.

308
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,760
Slowly! Pull it up slowly.

309
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,590
It's up!

310
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,610
Ji Myeong Seob, no... this is wrong!

311
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,730
You're making a mistake.

312
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,530
Mistake?

313
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,400
You're right. You're right. It is a mistake.

314
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,610
I should kill you first before I kill Director Son, Attorney Lee.

315
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,900
So, it would look like Director Son killed you and then committed suicide.

316
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,940
That was close.

317
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,410
Damn, you made me miss!

318
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,150
You bastard!

319
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,180
How many more people are you going to kill?

320
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,730
Stop messing around and hand over that gun!

321
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,640
You stop it, Dad!

322
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,430
- If you'll clean things up, do a better job!
 - What?

323
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,370
I wouldn't be saying this if you did it right.

324
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,030
I have so many things to worry about because you keep being soft!

325
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,380
O-Okay! I get it, so put this gun down first.

326
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,160
- If you go abroad for now─ 
- I said, I'm not going!

327
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,560
I'm not going!

328
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,640
How many times do I have to tell you I'm not going!

329
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,500
I said I don't want to go!

330
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,680
This is the final deal terms.

331
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,190
Deal terms?

332
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,260
Damn it.

333
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,080
The timing f***ing sucks.

334
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,980
 I told you already. It's up to you. 

335
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,500
 But aren't you curious how things will end? 

336
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,620
 Attorney Lee. 

337
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,420
 You'll never beat my dad. 

338
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,350
 We'll see about that. 

339
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,340
 Wait, wait, wait! 

340
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,350
 Let's make one final deal. 

341
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,610
 What do you mean? 

342
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,940
 A deal. 

343
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,610
 I'll give you conclusive evidence to put my dad away. 

344
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,660
 Hand over the video to me. 

345
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,480
 How about it? 

346
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,560
 Attorney, this is Detective Kim Ju Mok of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit. 

347
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,840
We found Im Jeong Gyeon's corpse at the location you mentioned.

348
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,080
Seeing his body size and his clothes,

349
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,070
 it definitely appears to be Im Jeong Gyeon. 

350
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,990
Im Jeong Gyeon's corpse?

351
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,520
Did you really kill Im Jeong Gyeon, too?

352
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,140
Crazy bastard, are you possessed by a murderous spirit?

353
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,980
Attorney Lee, what were Ji Myeong Seob's final deal terms?

354
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,060
A bullet from that hunting rifle is in Im Jeong Gyeon's corpse, right?

355
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:24,930
And this bastard shot him with the chairman's gun to frame him for murder.

356
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,160
Is that true?

357
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,580
Did you really do that...

358
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,840
to frame me for murder, Myeong Seob?

359
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:51,180
You're too curious and talkative for someone who's about to die.

360
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,020
Shoot me, you bastard.

361
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,840
Die, you bastard!

362
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,880
Ji Myeong Seob, drop the rifle.

363
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,850
You scared me.

364
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,440
What are you, my stalker?

365
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,980
Maybe this is a good thing. I can get rid of you all at once.

366
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,470
Drop the rifle now.

367
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,690
Why did you bring a gun you can't even shoot?

368
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,680
This time, it's live ammunition.

369
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,270
You think I won't shoot you?

370
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,820
Yeah. I don't think you'll shoot me.

371
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,570
If you have the guts to shoot me, then shoot me.

372
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,320
Crazy bitch!

373
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,480
You really...

374
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,210
M-Myeong Seob...

375
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,410
M-Myeong Seob...

376
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,830
M-Myeong Seob! Myeong Seob!

377
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,230
Dad! It hurts! It hurts so much!

378
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,780
Dad, it hurts! It hurts...

379
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,120
You bitch, how dare you shed my son's blood in front of me?

380
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,820
Eung Jun, why...

381
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,850
why would you...

382
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,010
Hyeongnim, let's stop this now.

383
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,160
I can't stand to see you fall apart anymore.

384
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,500
Eung Jun!

385
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,040
Eung Jun...

386
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,300
M-Myeong Seob!

387
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,500
Myeong Seob...

388
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,130
Oh, no.

389
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,120
Myeong Seob!

390
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,890
Dad, it hurts.

391
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,780
Myeong Seob.

392
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,310
It's all your fault!

393
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:51,470
It's all because of you that my son... and Eung Jun...

394
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,660
Call 911!

395
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,860
Call 911 for an ambulance!

396
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,290
Myeong Seob!

397
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,150
 You brought this upon yourself. 

398
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,490
 The consequences for all the evil you've done 

399
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,720
 and for trying to keep doing evil 

400
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,240
 without any remorse. 

401
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,240
 You're facing them now. 

402
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,980
Myeong Seob!

403
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,460
Eung Jun!

404
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,440
Myeong Seob!

405
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,860
Myeong Seob...

406
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:14,010
♫  No matter where you go, you’re in the palm of my hand  ♫

407
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,510
Hey, have you searched the pockets of those guys in the back?

408
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,070
Find me the truck keys!

409
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,780
Whoever has the truck keys, you better come out!

410
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,670
Find me the one who has the truck keys!

411
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,630
♫  I don’t care, will you just come at me?  ♫

412
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,210
   

413
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,510
   

414
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,970
   

415
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,230
   

416
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,070
   

417
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,310
 The first trial verdict of Chairman Ji Dong Man, who was arrested at the scene 

418
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,500
where Ojeong Group's heir, Ji Myeong Seob, died, will be held today.

419
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,370
Public attention is focused on the sentence to be handed down to Chairman Ji Dong Man,

420
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,520
who was arrested on charges of murder and instigating the concealment of a crime.

421
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,800
 All eyes are on the court's decision. 

422
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,510
The defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.

423
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,010
 Ji Dong Man, this is only the start of your trial. 

424
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,970
 I will relentlessly pursue every single crime you have committed 

425
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,950
 until the very end. 

426
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,630
 Until you pay for all your crimes, 

427
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:44,190
 you won't be able to leave the prison built by your past. 

428
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,960
 Where is this guy? 

429
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,170
Yeah, keep buying that stock I told you about

430
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,660
as soon as we get the funds for it.

431
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,750
I'll be back after meeting someone.

432
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,890
Forget it.

433
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,450
Just focus on buying up the stocks. Hang up.

434
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,200
Gosh, where is this guy?

435
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,650
Why are there so many of them?

436
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:29,070
President!

437
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,200
President!

438
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,760
I'm here! Hwa Ran is here!

439
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,500
- Who?
 - Yeah, me, Hwa Ran!

440
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,120
- Hwa Ran?
 - Yeah!

441
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,440
I'm here!

442
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,350
 I'll call the police! Get out right now! 

443
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,500
 No! 

444
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,510
 A young girl... 

445
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,670
 is fearless... 

446
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,770
 and is pretty bold. 

447
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,880
 How about you work under me? 

448
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,380
Hey, what brings you here, Hwa Ran?

449
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,780
What brings you here?

450
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,380
Come here! Quickly!

451
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,050
You haven't forgotten me, right?

452
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,280
Hey, this is a lot. Just a little, a little.

453
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,120
Cheers!

454
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,140
You always talked about becoming a farmer.

455
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,490
You've got your wish.

456
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,730
- Are the potatoes good?
 - The potatoes are great!

457
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,940
The potatoes are this big.

458
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,660
Hey, seeing how your eyes have lost their spite, something must've happened.

459
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,210
Nothing happened.

460
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,290
Well, actually, something did happen.

461
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,580
- What is it?
 - I crossed paths with a weird attorney.

462
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,770
A weird attorney?

463
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,780
I don't know who that guy is, but he got the spite out of your eyes.

464
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,860
He must be a special man. Stick around him.

465
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,480
I actually came to ask you for a favor.

466
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,230
- What is it?
 - Lend me some money.

467
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,760
Five hundred large ones.

468
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,970
You're asking a potato farmer to lend you 500 large ones?

469
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,880
Seriously?

470
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,260
I found... something that I really want to have.

471
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,150
Seeing how your eyes are burning with ambition,

472
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,820
I guess it's something you really want.

473
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,010
What is it?

474
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,910
Look at you not telling me! You're not telling me!

475
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,380
- Tell me.
 - No.

476
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,500
- Tell me.
 - No.

477
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,200
Eat. Tell me.

478
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,010
Here, Eun Ji. Try some pizza, too.

479
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,070
Thank you.

480
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,260
S-So, do you like it?

481
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,540
It's so good.

482
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,180
But why aren't you eating anything?

483
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:52,130
O-Oh, I feel full from just watching you eat, Eun Ji.

484
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,360
Don't be silly. Hurry up and eat.

485
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,570
Oh, okay.

486
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,470
Eat up.

487
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,510
Hurry up.

488
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,660
You didn't have to...

489
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,480
Okay.

490
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,220
It's good, right?

491
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:17,350
I think it's the tastiest pasta I've had in my life.

492
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,990
- Me, too.
 - Pardon?

493
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,990
I think this pizza and pasta I'm having with you

494
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,270
are the tastiest in the world.

495
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,950
Oh, r-really?

496
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,120
- Are you all right?
 - I'm sorry.

497
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,770
Are you all right? Me, too.

498
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,570
It was just so good.

499
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,120
   

500
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,990
   

501
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:50,440
Senior Police Officer Kim Ju Mok of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit of Seoul Sangbu Police Precinct,

502
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,740
you are hereby promoted one rank.

503
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,150
Assistant Inspector Kim Ju Mok!

504
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,230
Next.

505
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,490
Inspector An Seo Yun of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit of Seoul Sangbu Police Precinct,

506
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,400
you are hereby promoted one rank.

507
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,690
Senior Inspector An Seo Yun.

508
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,630
To the Commissioner, salute.

509
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,520
Welcome.

510
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,190
Are you looking for something for yourself?

511
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,780
It's for my younger sister.

512
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,180
Please look around comfortably.

513
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,840
   

514
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,730
An Da Yun.

515
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,850
I kept my promise.

516
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,550
I won't cry anymore.

517
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,210
   

518
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:40,290
 As long as there are those who don't give up to the end, 

519
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,720
 the truth will come to light, even if it's a bit late. 

520
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,210
 That is why we don't give up to the end. 

521
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,400
   

522
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,510
All right, we'll sell the construction subsidiary to Unyang Group,

523
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,760
and the chemicals subsidiary to Hyungho Group.

524
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,810
- Everyone agrees to that, right?
  - Yes. 

525
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,450
All right, let's all clap together!

526
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,010
Clap definitively. Please record this.

527
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,550
Nice, nice. It's challenging to build up a company,

528
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,490
but it's so easy to break it down like this.

529
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:46,210
The subsidiaries just rip apart like dried, shredded squid.

530
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,590
All right, what's next?

531
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,950
Capital? Is the Bitline Joint Fund representative

532
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:55,060
- who bought the shares for Ojeong Capital here?
 - Is it here?

533
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,330
Bitline Joint Fund?

534
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,870
Assistant Baek, this place even smells different.

535
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,800
Make sure to take things you think are good.

536
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,530
Ji Dong Man?

537
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,220
Who are you?

538
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,570
Who are you to walk in here and sit there as you wish?

539
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,910
- Oh, me?
 - Yes.

540
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm Choi Hwa Ran, who came to take over Ojeong Capital.

541
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,830
Oh! I see, I see. I'm sorry for not recognizing you.

542
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,530
Wow, Chairman Ji Dong Man must be so upset that his company is split up.

543
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,890
I wonder if he is able to sleep at night in prison.

544
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,440
Assistant Baek, let's take this chair with us later when we go. It's so comfortable.

545
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,200
I'll make sure to take it.

546
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,780
Oh, right. Can I ask you for a favor?

547
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,380
Pardon?

548
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,910
What favor?

549
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:05,100
Go to Chairman Ji and deliver this message.

550
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,750
I, Choi Hwa Ran, will enjoy taking over

551
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:14,290
his beloved Ojeong Capital.

552
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,890
♫  One shot, turn the tables  ♫

553
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,860
♫  Ahead of the scammers  ♫

554
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,610
♫  One shot, one shot on the game  ♫

555
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:26,030
♫  Alone but not afraid, back on the game  ♫

556
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,260
The defendant is declared not guilty.

557
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,080
Thank you.

558
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,090
Thank you!

559
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,890
Su Beom! Su Beom!

560
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,600
Han Sin, thank you!

561
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,500
Hooray, Cheon Su Beom!

562
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,780
 Hooray! 

563
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,840
Hooray!

564
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,990
 Do you know what we're called in English? 

565
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,380
 We're called correction officers. 

566
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,800
 We're like a whiteout pen that corrects criminals with many dark crimes. 

567
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,210
 We don't get to choose what they write on top of that. 

568
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,940
 That's up to the inmates. 

569
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,470
   

570
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,050
Don't smile.

571
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,350
Today's your first day at work. Shouldn't you have come in earlier?

572
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,080
Oh, the thing is...

573
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,820
I'm sorry.

574
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,340
Since you're experienced, I won't say a lot.

575
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,960
Regulations, first. Regulations, second.

576
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,620
And regulations, third.

577
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,020
Just follow the regulations.

578
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,190
I'll keep that in mind.

579
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,670
- Also─ 
 - Aigoo.

580
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,600
Seonbae, I think that's enough. At this rate, you'll be called a geezer.

581
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,260
What, a geezer?

582
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,730
Yes, you sound like a geezer.

583
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,670
Congratulations on your reinstatement!

584
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,880
Aigoo! Thanks.

585
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,810
Where did you get this?

586
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,300
How about you tell us how you feel about being reinstated?

587
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,870
- Did I sound like a geezer?
 - No, it was great.

588
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:33,150
It feels like I'm back where I belong.

589
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,820
- Liar!
 - That's not true! It feels like I'm back home.

590
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,610
Aren't you sick of this prison?

591
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,400
No, I'm not sick of it at all.

592
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,900
You're fit to be a correction officer. You were born for it.

593
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,440
Thanks.

594
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,730
Thank you! Thank you!

595
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,570
 Congratulations! 

596
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,940
Thanks.

597
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,540
Thank you, everyone!

598
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,710
 I'm the newly appointed parole examiner, Attorney Lee Han Sin. 

599
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,700
 Could you show me your investigation records on Chairman Ji Dong Man? 

600
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:33,460
 Then, I can just go inside with you, Attorney Lee Han Sin, 

601
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,720
 and hand over the investigation records that I toiled over to you. 

602
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,300
 Yes, that's right. 

603
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,350
 I can't do that. 

604
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,420
 Let's make a deal. 

605
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,550
 A deal? 

606
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,880
 We already have many debt-collecting lawyers. 

607
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,710
 I'm a little different from those lawyers 

608
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,290
 since I'm trying to get back the money, you were scammed out of. 

609
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:06,180
 She's an infamously vicious loan shark. 

610
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,340
 Cop... 

611
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,380
 Attorney Lee Han Sin, I'm extremely disappointed in you. 

612
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,190
 How could you borrow such tainted money? 

613
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,280
 There's no such thing as clean or tainted money. 

614
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,610
 Money is money! 

615
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,300
 Let's not do this here. Let's go inside and talk about this over a meal. 

616
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,750
 I don't partner with criminals. 

617
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,200
 I don't eat with cops, either! 

618
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,970
 Open the door! 

619
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:32,720
 You think you'll be fine after putting this terrible thing around my wrists? 

620
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,920
 Thank you for cooperating with the investigation. 

621
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,370
 C-C-Cooperated with an investigation? 

622
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,740
 So, do you want me to help you? 

623
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,560
 I mean, if you're going to ask for help, you should say it yourself.

 Inspector An! Am I... Am I the only one who's losing sleep from anger?

 Are you guys like this because you think the rock won't break if we smash it with an egg?

That's why you should stay back!

I told you not to do it since it's dangerous!

It's so upsetting...

645
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:02,380
Why did you do that? I told you not to.

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,250
Stop flirting and grill the meat. It's burning!

650
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,130
Gosh, those guys, seriously.

651
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,840
Attorney Lee, take a seat.

652
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,670
How is it? It's nice to come outside for once, right?

653
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,540
The wine is pretty good.

654
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,380
It's because you're drinking it with me.

655
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,880
You know, we tend to be on the same wavelength.

656
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,300
I guess we do, and we don't at the same time. It's confusing.

657
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,560
No, listen.

658
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,500
Someone told me that you are a special person to me, Attorney Lee.

659
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,440
So, I'm thinking of sticking right next to you.

660
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,950
Gosh, it's cold. I guess it's cold since we're in the mountains.

661
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,950
Are you cold? Should I get you a blanket?

662
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,140
- We're here!
 - Oh, you're here?

663
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,240
- Aigoo, Inspector! Welcome!
 - Hello.

664
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,610
I'm no longer an inspector. I'm Captain An.

665
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,540
Oh, right, Captain. Congratulations.

666
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,300
- Please say a word.
 - Speech!

667
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,190
Gosh, that's embarrassing.

668
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,460
It's all thanks to you all. Thank you.

669
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,750
Congratulations.

670
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,860
Take a seat, take a seat. Hurry up and take a seat.

671
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,190
- Take a seat, take a seat for now.
 - Is Ms. Choi unable to make it today?

672
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:18,190
Ms. Choi is currently filming "Justice Girl."

673
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:21,780
- Oh, the title of that movie is "Justice Girl"?
 - Yes, it's a big hit.

674
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,720
Oh, that's a great title.

675
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,620
All right, everyone, please come this way.

676
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,700
Hey, you shitty son of a bitch!
    

677
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,180
What did you just say?

678
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,810
Are you deaf? I said you're a shitty son of a bitch!

679
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:38,270
Hey, you're delusionally jealous and lie all the time.

680
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,720
And you even cheated. You cheated on me!

681
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,230
Get lost!

682
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,100
Go to your milk cow, you cow bastard!

683
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,090
You're even worse than a cow!

684
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,930
- Cut! Nice!
 - Cut! Okay!

685
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,370
Gosh, your acting and charisma is amazing, Choi Won Mi!

686
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:57,070
- Hooray!
 - Attorney Seo!

687
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,690
What brings you here?

688
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,220
I came to see you.

689
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,450
When did you come?

690
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,370
What is all this?

691
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,890
I couldn't come empty-handed.

692
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,120
- Take a break.
 - I have an umbrella for her.

693
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,880
How could I come here empty-handed?

694
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,640
I brought this as a present. It's how I feel.

695
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,620
What is all this? Seriously. Thank you.

696
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,880
It's nothing. I'm the legal consultant for this movie.

697
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,480
- Really?
 - Yeah.

698
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,680
I see you in a different light.

699
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,260
Really?

700
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,570
So cute. You're so cute.

701
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,330
Here. Everyone take one.

702
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:39,870
I made a new business card.

703
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,990
Hwa Ran Capital?

704
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,680
Hwa Ran Capital?

705
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,430
I saw that Ojeong Capital was up for sale,

706
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,510
so I bought it and changed the name.

707
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,570
Congratulations.

708
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,240
I feel like I've got such an accurate eye for people.

709
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,600
Look at Attorney Lee. I just keep getting richer after sticking around him.

710
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,640
You're a financial industry professional.

711
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,620
Yeah.

712
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,370
Oh, there's one more thing.

713
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,950
- Guys.
 - Hey, open that up.

714
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,050
Yeah, open that up.

715
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,850
   

716
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,010
Hwa Ran Scholarship Foundation?

717
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,810
I decided to become its board chairwoman.

718
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,520
I mean, after making Hwa Ran Capital,

719
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,150
I'm being forced to pay so many taxes!

720
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,940
So, I just decided to make one.

721
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,050
It's just for the tax cut, you know.

722
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,820
What?

723
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,090
Why are you making me nervous, smiling dangerously like that?

724
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:43,460
I know your benevolent purpose behind it.

725
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,540
I agree. Congratulations.

726
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,520
Congratulations, President Choi.

727
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,960
Applause! Applause!

728
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,200
I did something pretty awesome this time, right?

729
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,800
Shall we all give a toast to such a wonderful day?

730
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,090
- Sounds good.
 - Good. Let's fill our glasses and stand up!

731
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,770
To President Choi Hwa Ran and the Hwa Ran Scholarship Foundation, cheers!

732
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:07,060

 Next up is celebrity news. 
   

739
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:30,290
 Ms. Choi Won Mi has returned as the female protagonist of "Justice GIrl," a new film by Director Hwang Dong Wuk, 

740
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:33,330
 the winner of the best director at the International Film Festival. 

741
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,830
 Director Hwang Dong Wuk says Ms. Choi Won Mi's Justice Girl image 

742
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,040
 fits well with his movie's protagonist... 

743
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,760
I told this bitch to lie low.

744
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,130
Why is she running wild again?

745
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:48,900
 I'm Choi Won Mi, back as the Justice Girl! 

746
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,650
And why is Myeong Seob...

747
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:58,540
not calling me these days?

748
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,010
 - Eung Jun.
 - Yes, Hyeongnim. 

749
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,950
 We're no longer loan sharks. 

750
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,230
 We're financial service providers, financial service providers! 

751
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,200
 What do you think? It's great, right? 

752
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,830
 Wow, Hyeongnim, this is great! 

753
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,420
 But we can't be satisfied with this. 

754
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,880
 This is only the beginning for us! 

755
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,270
 Of course, Hyeongnim. 

756
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,970
 What can't we do if the two of us are together? 

757
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:52,780
 All you have to do is trust and follow me to the top! Got it? 

758
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,590
 Then, from now on, I will no longer call you Hyeongnim, 

759
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,810
 but Chairman! 

760
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:01,130
 - Let's drink!
 - Okay! 

761
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,570
 - Cheers!
 - Cheers! 

762
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,390
 Hey, eat a lot of meat. 

763
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:14,840
 - Okay!
 - Eat up. 

764
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,730
 Please give it to me. 

765
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,100
   

766
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,650
   

767
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,310
Attorney, why are you taking that down?

768
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:55,280
- I'm thinking of quitting now.
 - Pardon?

769
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,120
I thought I'd feel so light after laying down this heavy burden,

770
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,010
but it feels bittersweet.

771
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:06,410
But why would you do that? You worked so hard to become a parole examiner.

772
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:09,210
That wasn't through my ability.

773
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:12,670
It's only right that someone who is more able and deserving

774
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,100
becomes a parole examiner.

775
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,520
All right, then.

776
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,150
Wait, where are you going?

00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,940
   

805
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:54,680
♫  The past dark nights are painted white  ♫

806
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,820
♫  The morning comes to me  ♫

807
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,000
♫  And extends its hand  ♫

808
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,380
♫  I throw myself into the light that I can nearly grasp  ♫

809
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:17,330
♫  Daylight breaks over a bright sky  ♫

810
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:28,630
♫  Starlight across a beautiful night sky  ♫

811
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:31,710
