1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,290
   

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,990
   

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,230
   

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,820
   

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,070
   

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,970
   

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,950
   

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,760
   

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,740
   

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,470
Letter of appointment. Lee Han Sin for the Parole Review Committee.

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,000
You are appointed as an examiner for the Parole Review Committee of the Ministry of Justice.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,530
November 4th, 2024.

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,080
Signed, Minister of Justice Park Jin Heung.

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,760
Thank you.

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,040
Could you tell us how you feel?

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,440
   

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,140


18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,470
   

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,130
 You'll never leave this place until you complete your sentence. 

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,150
 Are you sure about that? 

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,120
 In my opinion, you'll soon regret this. 

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,130
   

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,880
   

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,940
   

25
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,860
 Will you be all right? 

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,950
 I may not be. 

27
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,650
 But... 

28
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,710
 I'm a correction officer. 

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,470
 If I give in to threats, go against my conscience, and behave illegally, 

30
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,740
 I'm no different than the inmates. 

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,920
 How could I face the inmates and reform them? 

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,620
 Still... 

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,350
 Don't worry. 

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,490
 Nothing will happen. 

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,370
 Mr. Cheon Su Beom. 

36
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,240
 We're the police. Come with us. 

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,490
 - What? 
- What's going on? 

38
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,320
 You need to tell me what this is about! 

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,800
 Goodbye! 

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,050
 - Let go of me! 
- Seonbaenim! 

41
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,710
 What are you doing right now? 

42
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,200
 - Let's go. 
- Don't worry about me! 

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,760
 I'll be back soon! 

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,080
 - Warden. 
- I'll be back soon! 

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,610
 We declare that Number 133's parole case 

46
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,260
 has been approved unanimously. 

47
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,370
 Were these hallways always this long? 

48
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,320
 Let's go inside. 

49
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,260
   

50
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,720
     

51
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,910
 Parole is the only way 

52
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,650
 that an inmate can be released before the end of their sentence. 

53
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:06,260
 Thus, inmates also call parole examiners the final judges. 

54
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,230
 As fitting of a final judge, I will do my best to judge well. 

55
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,480
   

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,030
   

57
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,010
   

58
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,200
Here's an updated report.

59
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,310
It passed through the prison's classification committee,

60
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,150
and you've been placed on the parole review list.

61
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,740
The warden approved it.

62
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,160
Once you're approved at next week's parole reviewâ€”

63
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
No matter how much technology has improved, nothing beats a person's touch.

64
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,370
That's right.

65
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,680
Thanks to Attorney Lee,

66
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,770
I'll be able to receive a proper massage soon.

67
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,740
Congratulations.

68
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Chairman, there's a problem.

69
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,790
Problem?

70
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,410
Choi Jeong Hak was arrested by the police.

71
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,940
How could you take care of business like this?

72
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,200
He shouldn't even be in Korea. How could he get arrested?

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,290
Is this how you'll take care of business?

74
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,600
My apologies.

75
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
- Go fix the situation. 
- Yes, sir.

76
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,990
- What are you doing here? 
- Pardon?

77
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,630
Didn't you hear me say go fix it?

78
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,130
I heard you.

79
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,900
Here. Put your shoes on.

80
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,940
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,980
Number 2051 fulfilled his enforcement rate,

82
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,600
but he has poor family relationships since he's a domestic abuser. 
   

83
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,500
He has no plans, which will lead to a tough time adjusting to society after his release.
    

84
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,810
And the victim submitted a letter opposing parole.

85
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,900
Oh, and Number 1892...

86
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,710
 He dared harm my child. 

87
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,610
 Are you saying we should release a guy who blackmails you with people's lives? 

88
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,820
 Seonbae, just trust me this once. 

89
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,350
 I will stop Chairman Ji Dong Man 

90
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,920
 from being released on parole. 

91
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,330
What is he trying to do?

92
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,660
   

93
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,680
   

94
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,020
I'm back.

95
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,230
- Mr. Hwang. 
- Yes?

96
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,410
Is this...

97
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,750
Yes, well... it's perfect.

98
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,490
What's with your expression?

99
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,420
What is that piece of paper anyway?

100
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,590
You should have just taken the money when Chairman Ji offered it.

101
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,340
I just can't understand it.

102
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,420
Why did you do all that just to become a parole examiner who does more work for little money?

103
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,870
All right, let's get started.

104
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,190
Wh-What are we starting?

105
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,180
Hey, Attorney Lee, I'm just really curious, you know.

106
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,020
Isn't it enough to look at the files the Ministry of Justice sent you?

107
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,840
Is there a reason why you print all this out?

108
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,720
It feels better to flip through the pages myself.

109
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh, it feels better, I see.

110
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,980
Fighting.

111
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,850
- Mr. Hwang. 
- Yes?

112
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,420
Parole seems like it doesn't pertain to you, right?

113
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,010
Well, yes.

114
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,310
- But it does impact you. 
- How?

115
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,200
You may even have a felon who isn't ready to reenter society living next to you.

116
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,980
Wh-Why would you say such a scary thing?

117
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,110
How can someone like that be released on parole when they're not ready?

118
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,420
And do you know how nice the guy living next door isâ€”

119
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,740
Wait, i-is he nice?

120
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,530
Now that I think about it, he does look like he's got a temper...

121
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,710
I-Is there a way to look into it?

122
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,590
There isn't.

123
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,270
No one will ever tell you.

124
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,870
Whoa, this really isn't just other people's business.

125
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,130
It feels real to you now, right?

126
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,300
Gosh, there are so many files.

127
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,370
Should we go through them together?

128
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,060
This is disqualified, and this is qualified.

129
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,900
   

130
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,760
   

131
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,710
   

132
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,020
   

133
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,670
   

134
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,040
   

135
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,080
   

136
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,140
   

137
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,890
   

138
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,540
Inspector An Seo Yun?

139
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,300
I guess I can start from here.

140
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,550
   

141
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll confirm your identity.

142
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,150
What's your name, age, and occupation?

143
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,450
You've done this many times before, right?

144
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,310
I hit my head hard earlier. So I don't remember.

145
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,890
Name, Choi Jeong Hak.

146
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,340
Age, 27 years old.

147
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,540
Occupation, a nightclub marketing director.

148
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,690
What? Did I miss something?

149
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,240
You're pretty much a stalker.

150
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,870
You admit to taking and providing drugs to club VIPs, right?

151
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,840
The forensics will have your hair analysis result out soon.

152
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,800
Hurry up and admit it so we can get to the point.

153
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,500
You know why I'm so interested in you, right?

154
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,540
Is anyone here?

155
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,950
Aigoo, good day.

156
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,800
Who are you?

157
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,340
Who am I?

158
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,450
If someone comes in, shouldn't you at least look at them?

159
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,560
Are you remaining silent?

160
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,290
Fine. Then, let's do this.

161
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,070
If you tell me what I want to hear,

162
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,630
I'll overlook your drug charges.

163
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,760
- Seonbae. 
- What do you say?

164
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,130
Deal?

165
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,130
Well,

166
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,870
do you think I'd fall for such a lie?

167
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,780
Hey, Choi Jeong Hak.

168
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,420
How long will you be on the run?

169
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,540
Inspector, an attorney is here.

170
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,200
Thank you. You can go back now.

171
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,470
Who are you?

172
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm Choi Jeong Hak's attorney.

173
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,470
   

174
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,300
- Attorney? 
- Yes. What are my client's charges?

175
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,470
Consuming and distributing drugs.

176
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,950
Oh, really?

177
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,510
Did you find any evidence that my client took or had drugs on him?

178
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,920
I turned in his hair sample to the NFS. 
  (NFS = National Forensic Services) 

179
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,500
Shouldn't you interrogate him like this only after the results come out?

180
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,890
Right? Don't you know the rule of being considered innocent until proven guilty?

181
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,110
Gosh.

182
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,400
Gosh?

183
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,230
Do you know the rule "innocent until proven guilty" or not?

184
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:04,400
You arrested my client without any conclusive evidence and interrogated him here!

185
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,340
What are you doing right now? Not only that,

186
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,870
you took him down in an excessively aggressive manner.

187
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,600
 What will you do about it? 

188
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,460
 Seonbae! 

189
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,260
Look at this.

190
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,280
How can you do this to an ordinary citizen?

191
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,120
Look at this. Is this you or not?

192
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,330
It's me.

193
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,770
- It's you, right? 
- Yes.

194
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,920
Here. Provide conclusive evidence.

195
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,450
Right on! You don't have any evidence!

196
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,120
Show me the evidence.

197
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,820
Did you meet the requirements for emergency arrest? Answer me.

198
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,110
The requirements for emergency arrest!

199
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,980
The requirements for emergency arrest!

200
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,050
Gosh, you're so good at talking! I almost pissed myself!

201
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,660
But who are you?

202
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,100
That's what I want to ask you. Who are you?

203
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,870
What's your relationship with Chairman Ji?

204
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,380
Tell me.

205
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,260
Why can't you speak? Tell me.

206
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,350
- Whyâ€” 
- Hey! Choi Jeong Hak.

207
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,500
If the drug test comes back positive, I'll summon you right away.

208
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,100
- So, don't go too far. 
- Innocent until proven guilty!

209
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,190
How dare you treat him like a criminal after what I said earlier?

210
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,680
Hey, we don't have time. Follow me.

211
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,310
That little bastard.

212
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,800
Inspector An Seo Yun?

213
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,720
Oh, it is you.

214
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,180
How can I help you?

215
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,460
Hello, I'm the newly appointed parole examiner,

216
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,890
Attorney Lee Han Sin.

217
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,720
Here you go.

218
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,370
- I heard you were in charge of investigating Chairman Ji Dong Man. 
 - That's right.

219
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:15,330
Chairman Ji Dong Man was placed on the upcoming parole review candidate list.

220
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,990
So?

221
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,120
Aren't you surprised?

222
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,250
I saw the news report.

223
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,610
I see, you saw it.

224
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,540
Then, I guess you're still very interested in Chairman Ji Dong Man.

225
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,940
What is it you want to say?

226
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,760
Well, could you show me your investigation records on Chairman Ji Dong Man?

227
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,730
Then, I can just go inside with you, Attorney Lee Han Sin,

228
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,820
and hand over the investigation records that I toiled over to you.

229
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,330
Yes, that's right.

230
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,280
I can't do that.

231
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,640
Even if I'm trying to stop the release of Chairman Ji Dong Man?

232
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,610
If you want to access the files, submit an official request like an attorney.

233
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,000
By the way, I happened to overhear...

234
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,390
but what are Choi Jeong Hak's charges?

235
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,380
Why are you curious about that, now?

236
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,950
I happened to know the attorney who was with him.

237
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,510
Hey, stop shaking your leg. It's distracting while I'm driving.

238
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,270
I really need to use the bathroom.

239
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,760
Just hold it! We can't be lateâ€”

240
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,540
Damn it, I feel like I'll wet myself!

241
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,080
- Do it. 
- What?

242
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,500
How can I pee in here?

243
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,130
Where are we going?

244
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,930
I told you I booked your flight.

245
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,630
You don't listen when I talk to you.

246
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,170
Airport?

247
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,720
Airport.

248
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,020
Incheon Airport?

249
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,980
Will you keep talking down to me?

250
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,550
You crazy bastard!

251
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,640
Hey! Get over here!

252
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,360
If we were headed to the airport, you should've taken the Airport Expressway.

253
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,880
You! Get over here!

254
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,380
Hey! Hey, come here!

255
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,690
Hey! Get over here!

256
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,660
Oh, sorry, you can cross!

257
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,130
Hey, come here!

258
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,400
Hey, Hyeong!

259
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,240
Are you coming? What's taking you so long?

260
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,990
Things have gone a bit awry.

261
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,710
We were on our way,

262
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,760
and he suddenly punched me in the eye while I was driving andâ€”

263
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,970
Inspector.

264
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,860
 Inspector, an attorney is here. 

265
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,250
 Thank you, you can go back now. 

266
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,490
 Who are you? 

267
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,490
 I'm Choi Jeong Hak's attorney. 

268
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,240
 Who... 

269
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,950
 What does Choi Jeong Hak have to do with the Ojeong Group? 

270
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,410
 Why do you think that? 

271
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,360
 The attorney with him is part of Ojeong Group's legal department. 

272
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,150
 So, I presumed correctly, 

273
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,140
 seeing how quickly he's moving. 

274
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,560
   

275
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,270
You're here.

276
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
Yes?

277
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,530
What happened to your face?

278
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,870
You know, the bathroom?

279
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,200
I slipped on a wet slipper and fell.

280
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,920
You're so clumsy.

281
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,720
I put gochujang instead of soy sauce, and here's your sesame oil.

282
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,270
I told you not to add all the oil because it'll be greasy!

283
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,720
Oh, right.

284
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,190
Then, I'll take out the oil that's on the spoon.

285
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,200
You should be as half as good as Attorney Lee! Or at least a quarter.

286
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,630
Okay, I'll do better.

287
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,080
   

288
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,510
You should start by preventing reporters from writing articles like this!

289
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,690
So? You can do that much, right?

290
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,700
Yes, I-I'll take care of it.

291
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,290
 Great work, everyone. Cheers! 

292
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,640
Director Cheon!

293
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,700
My chairman is very upset because of the article in the Sinseong Daily.

294
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,230
What will you do about it?

295
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,560
So you can do better,

296
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,100
I even asked the chairman to increase the advertising on Sinseong Daily

297
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,790
and the chairman told me to do as I saw fit and I adjusted it favorably.

298
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,040
R-Really?

299
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,850
Of course. You think I'd call you over and lie when we're all busy?

300
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,320
And if we only increase the advertising on Sinseong Daily,

301
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,850
there will be much ruckus about favoritism or whatnot.

302
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,200
So, Ojeong Group decided to increase the advertising

303
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,260
for all of the newspapers gathered here. All right?

304
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,260
- Happy, right?
 - Yes, we're happy.

305
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,500
Make some noise!

306
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,310
Stop! The important thing is that

307
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,010
when my chairman is released on parole,

308
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:57,480
please help out so there's no negative talk about it, each of you.

309
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,500
- Yes.
 - Of course, we should.

310
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,020
I know I talked a lot with our glasses full.

311
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,300
Let's do another toast.

312
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,110
- Ojeong Group, fighting! 
- Cheers!

313
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,440
 Contact the civic groups, too. 

314
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,890
 If we want to make a loud statement, we can't lose in numbers. 

315
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,260
"The power to change the world!" 
   

316
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,450
Upright Society Research Institute.

317
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,400
Wow, that's such an awesome name!

318
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,280
What brings you to such a lowly place?

319
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,030
The thing is,

320
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,560
my chairman will be released on parole soon.

321
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,310
Right, right.

322
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,720
I came to ask you to lend us some of your support.

323
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,380
Oh, support.

324
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,260
- Support. 
- Support.

325
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,980
Support.

326
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,130
Oh, right. Support, support.

327
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,540
You can just tell me comfortably. It's not like we're strangers.

328
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,270
You don't have to bring anything. Why did you bring this?

329
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,120
How could I come here empty-handed?

330
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,990
I should bring something so we have a good relationship.

331
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,000
Shall we take a quick peek?

332
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,200
Aigoo, I'll enjoy the drinks.

333
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,510
 And create an opportunity for me to meet with the parole examiners. 

334
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,990
 It may be possible to see deep into a body of water but not into a person's heart. 

335
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,040
 I need to make sure in advance that they won't get any other ideas. 

336
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,590
You'll need to step aside from being a parole examiner now.

337
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,740
   

338
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,720
When Minister Go runs for president, his position will become vacant.

339
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,300
Let me congratulate you in advance, Minister of Justice Yun Sang Hun.

340
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,480
It's an internship position for a global company we've partnered with for a long time.

341
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,090
Director, your son can gain some experience in Silicon Valley for a year 
    

342
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,400
and start working for our group immediately.

343
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,940
I'll prepare a position for him.

344
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,050
Professor, you've got many steps to climb. 
     

345
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:30,150
Head of the Law Department, university vice president, university president, 
    

346
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,850
and assemblywoman.

347
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,550
You should take the easy path with Chairman Ji Dong Man.

348
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,050
How was your meeting with Inspector An Seo Yun?

349
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,210
Did she say she'll help you?

350
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,630
She was quite particular.

351
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,170
I decided to be satisfied with just making myself known to her.

352
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,100
Well, I guess things worked out.

353
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,340
Pardon? What do you mean?

354
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,140
How did things work out?

355
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,090
Honestly, I wasn't really sure about it from the beginning.

356
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,580
Chairman Ji Dong Man is an evil bastard who shouldn't be released on parole.

357
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,270
It's true, but if you stop his release,

358
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,070
knowing his terrible temper, do you think he'll sit back?

359
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,930
I'm not sure exactly, but he'll probably try to kill you.

360
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,560
Gosh, there's no way he would try to kill me.

361
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,000
Come on, he's Ji Dong Man. He's more than capable of that.

362
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,420
Well, in any case, you should just give up here.

363
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,990
No. I can't give up.

364
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,590
Wait, you said it's the majority rule.

365
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,140
If it's Chairman Ji Dong Man, he probably bought off all the other parole examiners.

366
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,780
You can't stop Chairman Ji's parole release by opposing it alone.

367
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,780
You'll need to see things through to the end to know.

368
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,060
Well, okay, fine. Do as you wish.

369
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,540
Mr. Hwang, it seems you're stressed out a lot these days.

370
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,680
Don't be like this. Let's go and watch a movie.

371
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Why watch a movie all of a sudden?

372
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,350
- Let's go. 
- Your life is on the line!

373
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,280
Come on, let's go.

374
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,870
No. No, no. I'm not going. I'm not watching.

375
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,830
   

376
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,960
The movie was fun!

377
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,110
Y-Yes, it was fun.

378
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,080
Apart from watching it in a couple's seat, it was perfect.

379
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,780
Let's leave now.

380
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,990
Why leave? Things are only just getting started.

381
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,960
What? The movie is over. What do you mean it's starting?

382
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,940
Everyone, you enjoyed the movie, right?

383
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,380
 - Yes!  
- Yes.

384
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,400
Now, it's time to feast your eyes on the actors as they come out.

385
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,600
Please welcome the "Heiress" cast with a warm round of applause.

386
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,160
Choi Won Mi!

387
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,700
I love you, Choi Won Mi!

388
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,750
Choi Won Mi!

389
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,610
Choi Won Mi, I love you!

390
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,720
Choi Won Mi, Choi Won Mi!

391
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,100
Choi Won Mi!

392
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,500
Hello. Aigoo, thank you.

393
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,800
Oh, thank you.

394
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Thank you.

395
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,340
Thank you.

396
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,540
Eonni, I enjoyed the movie.

397
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,320
Thank you so much for watching the movie.

398
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,720
- Thank you! 
- I love you, Eonni!

399
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,690
- I love you, too! 
- Eonni, this is a gift!

400
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,130
Thank you.

401
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,490
Get home safely!

402
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,980
I enjoyed your movie so much.

403
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,740
Hello, we meet again.

404
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,690
Why did you come?

405
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,210
We wanted to get autographs, and I also had something to tell you.

406
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,520
What else do you have to say?

407
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,560
You're not here to ask me to send Leo again, right?

408
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,250
It's not like that, so you don't need to worry.

409
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,800
Then, what did you come here to say?

410
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,870
I wrote hate comments.

411
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,620
Pardon?

412
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:19,140
I said, "I wrote hate comments on a news article related to Choi Won Mi".

413
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,470
What are you saying right now, Attorney Lee?

414
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,720
What are you talking about?

415
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,080
"You silicone-filled plastic surgery monster,

416
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,120
I'm afraid you'll appear in my dreams. Please lay low and don't come out."

417
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,150
"Lay low and don't come out"?

418
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,520
"If you got divorced, have shame and self-reflect in remorse."

419
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,930
"If you keep running wild like that, I'll come to you with a knife."

420
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,070
Attorney Lee, please stop.

421
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,910
- Are there more? 
- Yes.

422
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,900
Wow. Actually, forget that.

423
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,380
Why did you come all the way here to confess about writing hate comments?

424
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,930
Please sue me for defamation.

425
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,120
Attorney Lee, why are you doing this after enjoying a nice movie?

426
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,920
That's Choi Jeong Hak's house.

427
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,460
Hiding someone else's property or documents is property damage crime.

428
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,100
What's your relationship with Choi Jeong Hak?

429
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Take off your helmet so I can see your face.

430
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,900
   

431
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,390
Aigoo, good morning.

432
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,800
Attorney Lee?

433
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,110
Attorney Lee?

434
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,680
Where did he go?

435
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,000
Attorney Lee! Attorney Lee!

436
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,260
He's not here, either.

437
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:39,490
   

438
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,590
You came on time.

439
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,260
Let's go and fill out the complaint first.

440
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,760
Wait, Attorney Lee.

441
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,530
Is this really necessary?

442
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,040
Yes, it is.

443
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,060
Still, I...

444
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,060
You said Chairman Ji messed you up so much that you want to screw him over big time.

445
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,990
If you want to do that, you need to file a lawsuit.

446
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,460
You don't have a lot of time. Let's go.

447
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,850
I don't think I can.

448
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:33,350
He will really try to kill me.

449
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,110
I'm really sorry, Attorney Lee.

450
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,220
I'll give you a gift.

451
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,000
A gift?

452
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,400
Who is that?

453
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,680
I'm dying to find out myself.

454
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,040
It's Choi Won Mi.

455
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,950
Choi Wonâ€” Wow.

456
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,700
Why did you come again, Attorney Lee?

457
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,550
Hello.

458
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,910
We meet again.

459
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,720
Did you bring in an official letter of cooperation?

460
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,020
No, I brought in something else instead.

461
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,940
A letter of complaint.

462
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,410
A complaint?

463
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,270
It's a complaint about defamation from hate comments.

464
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,730
Attorney Lee, this is the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

465
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,920
You can take that to the Cyber Investigation Unit.

466
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,890
I'm an attorney. Of course, I know that.

467
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,870
I want you to investigate this yourself, Inspector An.

468
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,860
Me? Why should I?

469
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,670
You're the perfect person for the investigation.

470
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,710
Ms. Choi Won Mi.

471
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm a fan.

472
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,970
Thank you.

473
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,530
It's true that hate comments are a big problem these days.

474
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,140
Due to depraved hate comments that go beyond just criticism,

475
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,170
- some people get hurt and even commit suicide. 
- Yes.

476
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:32,490
Jerks who hide in anonymity and recklessly spew out hate need to be punished severely!

477
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,620
I've saved the evidence.

478
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,490
I'll make sure to identify the IP and catch the perpetrator.

479
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,250
You don't need to do all that.

480
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,750
Pardon?

481
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,510
I wrote the hate comments.

482
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,970
You wrote the hate comments, Attorney Lee?

483
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,570
Yes.

484
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,630
Then, Choi Won Mi is the plaintiff

485
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,360
and you're the defendant, Attorney Lee?

486
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,970
That's right.

487
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,810
Then, will you two make a settlement?

488
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,390
No, I will never agree to a settlement.

489
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,230
That's usually what the plaintiff says...

490
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,870
Please investigate thoroughly and punish the crime severely.

491
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,830
- I oppose, I oppose! 
 - I oppose, I oppose! 

492
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:55,270
If Ojeong Group falls, the economy of South Korea will fall, too!

493
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,460
 It will fall, it will fall! 

494
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,810
Released on parole after only a year?

495
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,760
No one should be above the law!

496
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,750
 No one should be above the law! 

497
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,390
Release Chairman Ji Dong Man!

498
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,970
 Release him, release him! 

499
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,840
   

500
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,930
   

501
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,450
The Review Committee will be held here at the Ministry of Justice

502
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,850
to decide the parole eligibility of Chairman Ji.

503
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:25,060
The dispute among those who are for and against Chairman Ji's release is heating up here.

504
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,420
Attention is on what decision the Ministry of Justice will make.

505
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,880
In the morning...

506
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,210
- Don't worry. 
- Of course not.

507
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,210
Hello.

508
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,360
Oh, Examiner Lee Han Sin.

509
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,520
This is your very first parole review, right?

510
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,920
Yes, that's right.

511
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,520
Your first case happens to be Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole which is under much public scrutiny.

512
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,780
You must feel pressured.

513
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,550
Wouldn't it be weird to feel more pressure?

514
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,330
Regardless of who the candidate is,

515
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,600
I will examine him according to the regulations and principles.

516
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,950
What you said isn't wrong.

517
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,030
Then, let's start the review.

518
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,780
   

519
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,800
Since all the members are present, we will start the

520
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,230
monthly parole review committee meeting for November 2024.

521
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,590
Administrative Secretary, please tell us what's on the agenda.

522
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,770
Sure.

523
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:54,690
Four-hundred eighty-two people applied for the monthly parole review for November 2024.

524
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,700
Among the 482 parole review candidates,

525
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,540
426 were deemed qualified, 55 were deemed disqualified,

526
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,090
and 1 was deemed in need of careful review.

527
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,950
Is there anyone who objects to the disqualified decisions?

528
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,310
I have an objection.

529
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:16,550
I believe that Candidate 125, who was disqualified,

530
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,840
 should be qualified. 

531
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm sorry.

532
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,210
I mean, Candidate 125 has a recidivism rating of 3

533
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,540
and he hasn't settled with the victim, either.

534
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,670
It seems you don't know what you're saying since you're a first-timer.

535
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,950
I'm asking this since I may not be aware as a first-timer,

536
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,510
but what do you think Candidate 125's

537
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,560
biggest disqualifying reason is, Examiner Jeong Wuk?

538
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,040
They haven't come to a settlement!

539
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,160
We should consider the suffering the victim must be going through.

540
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,970
Look, Examiner Lee Han Sin.

541
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,360
It says here that they didn't come to a settlement.

542
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,970
Please read thoroughly next time.

543
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:03,920
It's not that they didn't come to a settlement. It was delayed.

544
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,870
 It's been quite a while since the incident. 
  

545
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,570
 But why is it still not settled? 

546
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,980
 Because I still never received his apology. 

547
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,840
 But the perpetrator has apologized on multiple occasions. 

548
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,540
 Pardon? What do you mean by that? 

549
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,840
 Here, take a look. 

550
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,790
 Why are these... 

551
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,960
 addressed to Unit 403? 

552
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,050
 Unfortunately, 

553
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,380
 he wrote the address incorrectly 

554
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,030
 and was unable to deliver his apology to you. 

555
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,300
 I see. 

556
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,170
 Tomorrow is his parole review. 

557
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,520
 Please read through the letters, and if you change your mind, 

558
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,760
 please give me a call.
    

559
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,070
 Release him, release him! 

560
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,730
 Let's go! 

561
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,150
 Attorney Lee! 

562
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,310
 I hope it's not too late. 

563
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,450
Candidate 125's elderly mother is suffering from severe dementia.

564
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:21,460
Candidate 125's reason for desperately wanting parole release

565
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,060
is to meet his mother before she completely loses her memory.

566
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,840
And...

567
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,710
it's late, but he has come to a settlement with the victim

568
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,660
and he promised to get a job at his friend's interior design company

569
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,250
and do his best to pay damage compensation.

570
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,940
Considering these aspects,

571
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,640
I give him a qualified opinion.

572
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,240
What about you, Examiner Jeong Wuk?

573
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:59,210
Since they came to a settlement, I give him a qualified opinion.

574
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,270
I also give him a qualified opinion.

575
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,020
I give him a disqualified opinion.

576
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,410
I give him a qualified opinion.

577
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,480
With four qualified opinions and one disqualified opinion,

578
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,650
Candidate 125 will be deemed qualified.

579
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,840
But Examiner Lee Han Sin.

580
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,200
How did you know they came to a late settlement?

581
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,180
I personally visited the victim.

582
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,830
I personally delivered the apology letters

583
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:36,050
that were returned due to an incorrect address.

584
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:40,120
That sounds like you're saying we haven't been doing our job properly.

585
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,320
No, no, no. That's not it.

586
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,890
Let's not go so overboard.

587
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,760
Being excessive is a problem, too.

588
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,260
Let's stop this and move on with the review.

589
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,770
- Secretary.
 - Yes, Chairman.

590
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,780
Please delete the conversation we just had.

591
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,900
 - You only need to do one thing, Eonni. 
- What is it? 

592
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,060
 Just live a long life. 

593
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,450
 So, don't go anywhere that's too dangerous, okay? 

594
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,830
 Okay, okay. 

595
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,740
 Your gift for getting into the college. 

596
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,040
 It's actually something I like for once! 

597
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,720
 Do you like it? 

598
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,890
 Eonni, can I go to a nightclub to celebrate becoming a college student? 

599
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,980
 What are you saying? Of course not! 

600
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,700
 You'll be late at this rate! 

601
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,110
 Seonbae. 

602
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,600
 I will... 

603
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,130
 I'll catch the bastard who did this to you and kill him! 

604
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,860
 Keep him in prison! 

605
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,590
 Release Chairman Ji Dong Man! 

606
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:41,470
 Release him, release him! 

607
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,320
 Finally, we will examine the case in need of careful review. 

608
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:55,380
 We will summon Candidate 177 for an in-person review. 

609
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,500
 I finished talking with all the parole examiners. 

610
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:10,660
Candidate 177, if you have any final words,

611
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,310
we will give you this opportunity to speak.

612
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:23,690
I spent a lot of time in remorse for my wrongdoings while serving my sentence.

613
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,240
 If I am released on parole, 

614
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,780
 I will work even harder 

615
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,950
to advance South Korea's economy and meet the purpose of the parole.

616
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:44,350
You have met the enforcement rate and served your sentence as a model inmate.

617
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,890
I give you a qualified opinion. 
    

618
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:52,580
He served with a good attitude and is remorseful of his crime,

619
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,820
so I give him a qualified opinion. 
    

620
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,160
Being on the parole review list after serving only

621
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,250
a third of your sentence is historically very early.

622
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,840
I feel you haven't spent enough time reflecting on your actions,

623
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,860
so I give you a disqualified opinion. 
    

624
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,040
 What if your son succeeds you on the Supreme Courtâ€” 

625
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,570
 I'll pretend I didn't hear it. 

626
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,910
 Don't come back to me over something like this. 

627
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:26,030
I will give a qualified opinion. 
    

628
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,980
My opinion on Candidate 177's parole release is...

629
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,420
disqualified.

630
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,290
What did you say?

631
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,630
Based on the opinions of the examiners,

632
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,650
there are three qualified and two disqualified opinions.

633
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,580
Thus, Candidate 177's review result will beâ€”

634
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,260
Committee Leader.

635
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,770
I'm not finished yet.

636
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:48,090
There is a major factor that disqualifies Candidate 177

637
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,400
from being released on parole.

638
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,190
Committee Leader, it's already decided as qualified based on a 3 to 2 vote.

639
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,360
There are no issues with his enforcement rate, and his attitude while serving was good.

640
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,430
We also shouldn't ignore the public opinion that Candidate 177

641
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,620
is crucial to attracting international events.

642
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:10,630
What is the major disqualifying factor you mentioned, Examiner Lee Han Sin?

643
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:17,290
Candidate 177 is currently being investigated in a different case.

644
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,520
 I'm a fan. 

645
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,400
 I'm a long-time fan of Choi Won Mi. 

646
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,280
 There's no reason for me to write hate comments like that. 

647
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,300
 But you just said you wrote the hate comments. 

648
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,200
 It was my ID, but I didn't write the hate comments. 

649
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,480
 What are you saying? 

650
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,800
 Someone took my phone 

651
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,750
 and secretly wrote the hate comments. 

652
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,770
 Who? 

653
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,690
 Chairman Ji Dong Man. 

654
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,560
A few days ago, I was investigated by the police for

655
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,580
defaming Actress Choi Won Mi for writing hate comments.

656
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,370
As you know, Actress Choi Won Mi was Candidate 177's ex-wife.

657
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:10,720
Examiner Lee, what does your police investigation have to do with this review?

658
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,210
When I first was being investigated,

659
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,560
I suspected identity theft.

660
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,680
But...

661
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,100
it was true the hate comments were written with my ID.

662
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,620
The time of the posting happened to be during my consultation with Candidate 177.

663
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:35,090
The location of the posting turned out to be the prison where Candidate 177 is held.

664
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,160
 Can you really stop him this way? 

665
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,450
 This is the only way I can stop him. 

666
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,810
 The opponent is resorting to all kinds of methods. 

667
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,840
 We can't fight back by abiding by all the rules, either. 

668
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,120
"You silicone-filled plastic surgery monster,

669
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,120
I'm afraid you'll appear in my dreams."

670
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,860
"Please just lay low and don't come out."

671
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,000
"To think your mom had seaweed soup

672
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,180
even after giving birth to a plastic surgery monster..."

673
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,860
Geez.

674
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,410
It's just so extreme, so I'll stop reading here.

675
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,750
This is just a part of the hate comments that Candidate 177 wrote.

676
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,640
Wait. I didn't write that.

677
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,470
I never wrote that.

678
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,490
I have no reason to write hate comments!

679
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,300
 "The Heiress"? 

680
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,440
 I told this bitch to lay low. 

681
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,700
 Why is she crawling out already! 

682
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,520
 How dare she try to make a movie without my permission! 

683
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,290
 Director Son, what's with you these days? 

684
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,320
Isn't this your voice?

685
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:50,080
"This bitch" you mentioned was Actress Choi Won Mi who was about to make a comeback, right?

686
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:55,910
Didn't you maliciously write hate comments because Choi Won Mi tried to come back

687
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:00,700
to the entertainment business instead of laying low?

688
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,220
Check the CCTVs in the attorney consultation room.

689
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,570
Then, it'll become clear that this is slander.

690
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:11,730
Unfortunately, there are no CCTVs in the attorney consultation room.

691
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:19,300
Currently, the police are investigating Candidate 177 on defamation charges.

692
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,250
I am requesting the suspension of this parole review

693
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,830
so the police can do a fair investigation.

694
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,840
- We cannot accept that request. 
- Why is that?

695
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,430
A new lawsuit against a review candidate

696
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,890
isn't a reason for suspending his parole review,

697
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:43,060
as long as the parole release of the candidate doesn't affect the investigation.

698
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,730
However, if the parole release would affect the investigation,

699
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,800
the parole review must be suspended.

700
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,860
 - Release him, release him! 
- We oppose, we oppose! 

701
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,020
Release Chairman Ji Dong Man!

702
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,790
 Release him, release him! 

703
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,190
We oppose the parole release of Ji Dong Man!

704
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,410
 We oppose it, we oppose it! 

705
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,800
 An Da Yun. 

706
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,640
 - You know her, right? 
- Do you have evidence? 

707
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,300
 You son of a bitch! 

708
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,900
 I'll find the evidence that you killed my younger sister. 

709
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,400
 I bet you can't. 

710
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:44,650
Candidate 177 threatened his ex-wife, Choi Won Mi, to forcibly meet her pet dog, Leo,

711
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:48,550
who is like her family even while serving his sentence.

712
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,550
Hey! You threatened her and brought him to me.

713
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:55,480
If he's able to exert such power even in prison,

714
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,870
think about what would happen after he's released.

715
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:04,830
The investigator in charge of this case will personally explain this part.

716
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,920
I'm the investigator in charge of this case,

717
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,020
Inspector An Seo Yun from the Criminal Investigation Team of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

718
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:36,020
As you know, Candidate 177 is a chaebol Chairman.

719
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,560
If he is released on parole,

720
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,290
there is a high risk of destruction of evidence,

721
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:45,000
as well as a threat to the safety of the plaintiff.

722
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,810
Thus, as the investigator in charge of this case,

723
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,570
I believe it is the right decision

724
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:55,620
to suspend the parole review of Candidate 177.

725
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,350
This is the written opinion by Inspector An Seo Yun,

726
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:14,560
asking to suspend Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole review.

727
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,800
That is all.

728
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,870
 Chairman, it's been so long since you saw Leo. 

729
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,990
 How about a picture? 

730
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,300
 Look here! Kimchi, cheese! Smile! 

731
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,440
 I heard the situation is a bit difficult. 

732
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,100
 You should have brought him, even if you have to sue! 

733
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,970
 You worthless bastard. 

734
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:46,750
 Attorney Lee, what are you doing? 

735
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,010
 My apologies. 

736
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,470
Based on parole regulations,

737
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,040
we have decided to...

738
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:08,470
suspend Candidate 177's parole review.

739
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,420
What are you doing?

740
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,550
Hey, you bastard!

741
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,480
Are you crazy? You bastard!

742
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,630
Do you want to die?

743
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,050
You bastard!

744
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:26,150
Do you think you'll be safe after this?

745
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,380
â™«  Sadly, this wasted life is a fraudulent sale  â™«

746
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,690
â™«  You grabbed me by my collar and now you're in court for assault  â™«

747
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,850
â™«  Even if you beg me, I won't let you go  â™«

748
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:49,930
â™«  I love you  â™«

749
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:57,710
â™«  I should have told you that  â™«

750
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:04,510
â™«  Without you  â™«

751
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:11,700
â™«  I cannot live  â™«

752
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,380
   

753
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,230
 Your mouth is about to be torn open 

754
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:23,730
 for spewing easy promises you can't keep. 

755
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,040
Eat it.

756
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,830
Eat more! Say ah.

757
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,840
Ma'am.

758
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,650
What?

759
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,240
What is it?

760
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,520
Me? Attorney.

761
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,750
Aigoo. If you handle your debt collection like this,

762
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:47,710
I told you last time that it's disadvantageous in court.

763
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,700
But you still do this.

764
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,190
Let's make a deal.

765
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,740
A deal?

766
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,270
We already have a lot of debt-collecting lawyers.

767
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,540
All right, let's eat one more.

768
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,450
I'm a little different from those lawyers

769
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:09,110
since I'm trying to get back the money you were scammed.

770
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:26,030


771
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,810
â™«  Youâ€™re a megalomaniac  â™«

772
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,030
â™«  Youâ€™re going to lose so many, uh  â™«

773
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:36,430
â™«  Cover your eyes and hide  â™«

774
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,310
â™«  I'll show you  â™«

775
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,000
â™«  You're a megalomaniac  â™«

776
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,170
â™«  You donâ€™t deserve what you own now  â™«

777
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,570
â™«  You can push me away and try to hold me off   â™«

778
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,060
â™«  It won't work on me, Megalomaniac  â™«

779
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,970
â™«  I'll give up anything  â™«

780
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,650
â™«  Thereâ€™s only one thing I want  â™«

781
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:00,320
   

782
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,630
 Preview 
That's Park Hui Jun, right? 

783
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:06,060
 Isn't he the guy who went to prison for the Junbong Holdings investment fraud? 

784
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,540
 Isn't that justice? 

785
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,700
 Why did you do that to me, you son of a bitch! 

786
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,490
 You think you can get away with this? 

787
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,650
 Will you be all right? 

788
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:16,250
 The Chairman Ji Dong Man I know won't just let you be. 

789
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,060
 I came to meet President Choi. 

790
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,680
 How will you get back the money I was defrauded? 

791
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,600
 Let's go! 

792
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,030
 Are you Korean? You're handsome. 

793
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,780
 Do you want to go on a treasure hunt with me?
