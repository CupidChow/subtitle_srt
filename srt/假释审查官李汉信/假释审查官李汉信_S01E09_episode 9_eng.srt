1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,280
   

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,000
   

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,370
   

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,790
   

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,060
   

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,060
   

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,040
   

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,070
   

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,990
   

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,920


11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,020
Think back to the past.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,830
Think, think! I mean...

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,960
why didn't I label it?

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm so stupid!

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,090
 Look down! 

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,730
 Have you gone crazy? 

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,100
 How dare you look me in the face? 

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,050
I really can't find this.

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,890
 I need to live, too! 

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,260
 I need to live! 

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,700
 Will you get dragged around like a dog on a leash for the rest of your life? 

22
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,630
Choi Won Mi, get a hold of yourself.

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,690
Don't give up.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,790
You can do it. Look for it a bit longer.

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,680
Yeah.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,870
All you need to do is find it.

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,530
 Where did you go without even reporting to me? 

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,540
Look for it a bit longer.

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,200
I definitely recorded it that day.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,770
To gather evidence for divorce,

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,030
I put them all on the same USB. Right?

32
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,400
Yeah.

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,730
 Director Son can just clean it up! 

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,460
 Bastard! 

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,870
 Why can't you behave, you bastard! 

36
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,810
I found it.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,310
Ji Dong Man,

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,270
did you think I would just lie down and take it?

39
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,300
I'm going to start fighting back now.

40
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,240
   

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,200
   

42
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,250
What happened with Cheon Su Beom?

43
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,800
He was sent to an outside hospital before we could do anything.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,630
- To an outside hospital?
 - Yes.

45
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,080
There was an assault in the prison.

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,340
Cheon Su Beom got hurt in the process and was rushed to the hospital.

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,040
Now that we've thrown the correction officer into the most infamous prison in the country,

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,340
it's good to see that he's getting hurt and beaten up on his own.

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,420
Should I arrange any other measures, Chairman?

50
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,990
We can decide later whether we should kill him in the hospital

51
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,730
or get him while he's in prison.

52
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,590
- Just let him be for now.
 - Yes, sir.

53
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,710
Hurry up and bring me my clothes.

54
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,660
And get that stupid bastard out of the police station.

55
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,100
Okay.

56
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,540
Han Sin...

57
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,250
Chief.

58
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,800
How...

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,200
How'd you know to come here?

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,320
What happened?

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,730
 Attorney, did I hear you wrong? 

62
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,450
 You asked her to do what? 

63
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,990
 You're asking me to mess him up gently. 

64
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,760
 Sounds good. It's just my style. 

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,330
 Attorney Lee, just leave it to me. 

66
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,480
 I've got an idea. 

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,390
 Gi Su, why would you... 

68
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,620
 I was hired to kill you today. 

69
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,660
I was looking for a way to escape Ojeong Group's surveillance.

70
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,470
That's why I couldn't tell you in advance.

71
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,220
There was no way to tell you, either.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,640
Why did you do that?

73
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,360
Why did you reject all our visitations?

74
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,160
I have nothing more to say to you.

75
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
Just go back.

76
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,320
- Chief.
 - Han Sin...

77
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,570
I wasn't framed.

78
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,350
Han Sin, did you...

79
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,240
By chance, did you...

80
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,290
You should reveal the truth now.

81
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,370
I will help clear your name

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,770
of false charges, Chief.

83
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,010
   

84
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,160
   

85
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,700
5B10.

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,100
Okay.

87
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,300
Gosh.

88
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,170
Oh, it's here.

89
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,160
Why does he need this?

90
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,050
Open the door.

91
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,150
 Ji Myeong Seob was provided drugs even during his imprisonment 

92
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,080
 by having it hidden in supplied goods to Sangbu Prison. 

93
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,150
 And there were followers who aided his crime and helped frame you by manipulating evidence. 

94
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,610
 Tell him to submit an application during the open hiring at Ojeong Group. 

95
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,580
 Thank you, Chairman! Thank you. 

96
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,140
 And Welfare Chief Bae Han Seong, who was responsible for supplied goods, 

97
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,490
 was promoted to the warden of Jungbu Prison. 

98
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,770
 I give him a qualified opinion. 

99
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:41,110
 Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jeong Wuk, who orchestrated the investigation at the time, became the Director of Correctional Services. 

100
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,840
 Don't worry about me! I'll be back soon! 

101
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,950
 - Seonbaenim!
 - Don't worry about me! 

102
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,490
You're not the one who should be in prison.

103
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,200
It's Ojeong Group, who's committed all kinds of corruption,

104
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,560
and the followers who accepted filthy offers to cash in on it.

105
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,650
I don't want people close to me to get hurt because of this.

106
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,770
So, please stop─

107
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,050
No. No, things will be different.

108
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,120
I'll make things different.

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,050
So, Chief, please leave the prison and prove your innocence before the statute of limitations expires.

110
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,320
I'll look for evidence to prove your innocence.

111
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,180
   

112
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,760
Yes, Seonbae.

113
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,390
I'm on my way out after meeting with the chief.

114
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,680
Pardon?

115
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,830
Ji Dong Man left the prison?

116
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,300
Yes. The pretext is an emergency medical treatment,

117
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,660
but it seems a bit fishy.

118
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,300
Im Jeong Gyeon.

119
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,280
I think Ji Dong Man came out to take care of Im Jeong Gyeon.

120
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,300
- Pardon?
 - Seonbae!

121
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,900
- Hey.
 - Here you are.

122
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,540
- Hello.
 - Hello.

123
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,000
- You need to head inside right away.
 - Why?

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,740
The captain is looking for you with quite a serious face.

125
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,360
I think it's about that bastard, Im Jeong Gyeon.

126
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,300
- It's about time, I suppose. 
- Pardon?

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,010
Attorney. Can we stop his parole if we find proof that he left the prison without authorization?

128
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,910
Yes, of course. We can stop his parole.

129
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,640
You couldn't find it, right?

130
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,160
Pardon? What do you mean?

131
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,470
Im Jeong Gyeon, whom you arrested so proudly as if you were Joan of Arc.

132
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,730
Did you find the evidence that proves Im Jeong Gyeon murdered Choi Jeong Hak?

133
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,800
We decided to conclude Choi Jeong Hak's death as a suicide case,

134
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,880
so finish questioning him about the unregistered car and release him.

135
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,070
Yes, sir. Will do.

136
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,300
What?

137
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,690
Is that it?

138
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,720
Is there anything more you want to say?

139
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,480
Yes, it's me.

140
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,220
Then take care of it like that.

141
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,940
Okay.

142
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,260
How could he stupidly get caught by the police

143
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,440
when he's supposed to be like a ghost without leaving a trace?

144
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,070
- What did he say?
 - They will release him in a couple of hours or so.

145
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,280
It's best to lure him to Ilcheon Port as if we would smuggle him out of the country

146
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,040
and eliminate him quietly there.

147
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,050
What brings you here?

148
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,320
I came to see how you're doing.

149
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,850
You even have depression.

150
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,390
I'm asking how you knew to come here.

151
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,460
I called the prison, and Warden Bae told me you were here.

152
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,370
I'm perfectly fine,  as you can see. Now leave.

153
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,050
When will Jeong Gyeon be released from the police station?

154
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,320
How did you know that?

155
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,910
I mean, he was arrested as a suspect for Choi Jeong Hak's murder,

156
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,860
so I looked into it because it concerned me.

157
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,230
But I think you overexerted yourself in leaving the prison to take care of Jeong Gyeon.

158
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,720
I'll take care of him instead─

159
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
Mind your own business!

160
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Don't try to get involved unnecessarily and focus on the company, got that?

161
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,480
Okay.

162
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,210
Im Jeong Gyeon, come out.

163
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,240
Will a savior appear for you in this situation?

164
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,470
If it's Ojeong Group, I think they would cut you off as a troublesome tail.

165
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,370
Just like Choi Jeong Hak.

166
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,130
Take this.
    

167
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,060
You never know.

168
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,630
Seonbae, we just let him go like this? Shouldn't we follow him?

169
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,410
It's fine. I got all I needed from him.

170
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,930
Pardon?

171
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,920
Hey, what are you doing right now?

172
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,500
- You've got too much time on your hands.
 - I'm all ready to go out.

173
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,210
What will you do instead of going out, Seonbae?

174
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,800
I need to find the evidence that Choi Jeong Hak left behind.

175
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,950
So you make sure to go and catch Ji Dong Man, got it?

176
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,890
- Yes.
 - A boat and a fake passport are ready for you.

177
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,600
See you at the port.

178
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,870
Warehouse 5 at Ilcheon Port.

179
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,160
Throw away your phone after this call.

180
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,540
It's done. Let's go.

181
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,660
   

182
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,010
 If you go to Director Son, you're dead, Hyeong. 

183
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,530
Hey, Hyeong, it's me. Did you talk to Director Son?

184
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,430
-  Yes, just now. 
 - What did he say?

185
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,450
 That he would smuggle you out, and you should come to Ilcheon Port, right? 

186
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,860
- Yes.
 - I told you! I'm right.

187
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,940
My dad personally came out of prison to eliminate you.

188
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,950
Come to me. I prepared a safe boat for you.

189
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,170
Okay, great work.

190
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,010
Hi, what is it, Ms. Choi?

191
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,090
I dropped the charges a while ago.

192
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,050
When can I get back to the suspended movies and dramas?

193
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,440
Do you still not know what Chairman Ji's style is?

194
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,860
What style?

195
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,350
 He repays several-fold what he's received. 

196
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,290
He's had to rot in prison for the past few months because of you.

197
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,940
Would you let it go if it were you?

198
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,380
So, when will I be able to start again?

199
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,730
I think you'll have to wait quite a long time.

200
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,020
Ever since the executive director came back, the chairman is constantly angry!

201
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,130
Goodness.

202
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,910
I guess Myeong Seob is still causing trouble.

203
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,690
It's such a headache for me!

204
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,100
Why did the chairman make me assist Ji Myeong Seob, that bastard─

205
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,020
I mean, the executive director. I don't understand why he made me his assistant!

206
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,520
Attorney Seo, you're sticking next to Myeong Seob?

207
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,690
What do you mean, sticking next to him? I'm his assistant! His assistant.

208
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,810
Attorney Seo, when do you get off work?

209
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,670
 Why do you ask? 

210
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,190
Attorney Lee.

211
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,550
What's wrong now?

212
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:44,220
I mean, why do you look so nervous and regretful

213
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,450
like a man waiting for his ex-girlfriend?

214
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,560
I guess it's similar since I'm meeting someone with whom I have a complicated past.

215
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,180
I didn't know you would act this quickly.

216
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,350
After hearing about how you quit being a correction officer...

217
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,790
"Fight Ojeong Group!"

218
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,090
I got a strong urge to do that.

219
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,480
So, I spend the money to get someone who would do the job right.

220
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,420
So, don't worry too much, okay?

221
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,470
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

222
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,870
Hey, hey!

223
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,310
- Correction Officer! Over here!
 - What? What's wrong?

224
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,280
Hey, what's wrong?

225
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,030
- What's going on?
 - Hey, wake up!

226
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,600
Seriously, what's wrong!

227
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,610
Take him to the medical office for now. Hurry.

228
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,010
Pick him up, pick him up.

229
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,720
Let's lift him up.

230
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,700
Hey, what's wrong with him?

231
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,080
Gosh, seriously!

232
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,810
How could this happen as soon as I left for vacation?

233
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,190
 Gosh, seriously! I can't catch a break! 

234
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,750
What's this, Chief Park? What happened?

235
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,450
He's a drug addict who came in a few days ago.

236
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,560
I don't know where he got them, but he collapsed after overdosing on drugs.

237
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,330
Drugs?

238
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,700
Yes.

239
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,920
Prison Warden, he's in a critical state.

240
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,430
I think we need to rush him to an outside hospital.

241
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,720
What are you saying?

242
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,830
We don't know what drugs he took.

243
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,620
How could we send him to an outside hospital?

244
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,790
Whether it's a detoxification or an exorcism, hurry up and do something!

245
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,640
Oh, okay.

246
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,780
Goodness.

247
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,510
Geez.

248
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,180
Warden.

249
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,750
Chief Park.

250
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,980
That guy...

251
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,780
Who found him first?

252
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:51,170
If the other unit guys or the CRPT* team finds out, it'll be a real headache.   (Correctional Rapid Patrol Team; Specially trained prison officers) 

253
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,350
I found him first and moved him to the medical office right away.

254
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,840
That's a relief.

255
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,080
Did you find the drugs?

256
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,490
It so happens...

257
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,730
that I brought it with me.

258
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,920
Wait, the pen...

259
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,500
 Hey!
   

260
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,490
Pardon?

261
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,260
Wait, wait.

262
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,140
Warden, I think

263
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,390
this is the drug.

264
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,000
Geez.

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,650
We recently changed the office supplies vendor,

266
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,290
and I think they're behind this.

267
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,720
I think we can find out the details once we investigate the Welfare Department.

268
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,000
Let's clean up this situation first.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,850
I'll clean up that inmate's cell and shut everyone up.

270
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,600
I-If word gets out,

271
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,800
all hell will break loose.

272
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,830
- M-Make sure... to clean this situation up...
 - I-I got it.

273
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,560
Okay, I got it.

274
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,000
- I'll be back.
 - Thoroughly, okay?

275
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,390
- Yes, I'll be back.
 - Hey, m-make sure...

276
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,500
make sure of it.

277
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,680
I... I won't get to live out my life at this rate.

278
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,650
I mean,

279
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,180
how... did that pen reappear?

280
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,740
I guess you received the present I sent you.

281
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,250
Han Sin...

282
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,780
Prison Warden, walk down the memory lane with me.

283
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,140
Memory lane...

284
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,480
Like what?

285
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,680
You know this pen very well, don't you?

286
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,850
Chief Park.

287
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,350
Wait.

288
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,640
Will it be okay to report

289
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,870
the drug-filled pens to the police?

290
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,920
Hey, P-Park Jin Cheol, you─

291
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,470
I want to hear everything you know about what happened to Chief Cheon, Warden Bae.

292
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,750
All of it.

293
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,070
I can't.

294
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,040
I-I... I can't tell you. I can't.

295
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,980
I can't. I can't.

296
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,430
What happened, Director Son?

297
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,600
Are you sure you told him the right location?

298
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,080
Yes, I did, Chairman.

299
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,140
Are you sure he didn't figure it out and ran off somewhere else?

300
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,500
Im Jeong Gyeon, that bastard.

301
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,900
Maybe this is...

302
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,530
Surprise! I scared you, huh?

303
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,380
Why do you look so scared?

304
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,200
All you have to do is trust me now.

305
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,700
Relax!

306
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,410
Han Sin...

307
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,800
Jin Cheol...

308
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,510
It was my fault.

309
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,670
I'm sorry.

310
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,270
But this is really...

311
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,700
unfair for me, too.

312
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,690
I mean, how could I have known

313
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,180
the Ojeong Group bastards would pin the drug incident

314
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:52,270
on Cheon Su Beom by framing him?

315
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,020
How could I have known?

316
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,480
 Please give this to Chief Cheon Su Beom. 

317
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,710
 Chief Cheon? What is it? 

318
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,070
 I wanted to get closer to Chief Cheon, so I wanted to butter him up a little bit. 

319
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,580
 Butter him up? 

320
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,500
 But I don't think that will work on Chief Cheon, though. 

321
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,580
 I got it. Just give it to him. 

322
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,820
 Okay. 

323
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,400
 - What's this?
 - Open it. 

324
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,350
 Who sent this? 

325
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,860
 Ji Myeong Seob sent it. 

326
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,450
 Take it back immediately. 

327
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,730
 Just turn a blind eye and take it. 

328
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,100
 All you have to do is just put him on the parole review list. 

329
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,120
 Are you seriously telling me that? 

330
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,700
 Geez. 

331
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,530
 I mean─ 

332
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,740
 You... 

333
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,360
 If you pull this one more time, I won't let it slide. 

334
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,400
 Buttering you up really isn't working. 

335
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,210
 It's not enough, right? 

336
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,370
 Should I give you more? 

337
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,300
 You'll never leave this place 

338
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,250
 until you complete your sentence. 

339
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,280
 Are you sure about that? 

340
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,230
 In my opinion, you'll soon regret this. 

341
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,780
I thought that was the end of that. But...

342
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,850
   

343
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,930
not long after that,

344
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,970
police barged into Sangbu Prison after receiving a report

345
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,670
that drugs have been brought in

346
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,180
and Chief Cheon was arrested.

347
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,870
 Do you know what this is? 

348
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,050
 It's the drugs that were brought into Sangbu Prison. 

349
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,930
 There are drugs inside that. 

350
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,790
While running errands for Ji Myeong Seob for pocket money,

351
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:03,260
I ended up delivering the conclusive evidence that led to Chief Cheon's arrest.

352
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,400
 Aigoo, the correction officers plotted together to bring drugs into the prison? 

353
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,500
 You sure have no fear. 

354
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,240
 Because of people like you, civil servants like us get trashed. 

355
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,080
 Do you know that? 

356
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,100
 I'll prosecute all the correction officers involved 

357
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,260
 and put them all away with the maximum sentence. 

358
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,110
 Look forward to it. 

359
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,320
 I did it! 

360
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,680
 What? 

361
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,030
 This was all my doing. 

362
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,950
 None of the other correction officers were involved in this. 

363
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,860
I really didn't know the drugs were inside those pens.

364
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,570
 You know you yourself put away Chief Cheon Su Beom, right? 

365
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,070
 If you care about your future as well as the other correction officers, 

366
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,060
 you better keep quiet. 

367
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,240
When I reflected on this later,

368
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,910
I realized Ji Myeong Seob planned this all along to remove

369
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:19,350
Chief Cheon as the classification chief for blocking his parole.

370
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,810
After that happened,

371
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,760
Ojeong Group exerted force on the Correctional Services Department

372
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,450
and the Prosecutors' Office to shush everyone up.

373
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,560
 You saw what happened to Chief Cheon Su Beom, right? 

374
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,060
 You choose what to do. 

375
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,270
And...

376
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,010
   

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,420
   

378
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,720
 See, I told you. 

379
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,900
 You can't stop me. 

380
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,070
 Su Beom... 

381
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,930
 In the end, 

382
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,300
 they had to arrest me to stop everything. 

383
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,290
 I couldn't put our colleagues and juniors in danger as well. 

384
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,840
 It was all my decision. So, don't say anything! 

385
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,740
 Especially to Jin Cheol 

386
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,430
 and Han Sin, never. 

387
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,740
 Su Beom... 

388
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,410
 I'm sorry! 

389
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,510
 I'm sorry... 

390
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,440
 I'm sorry, Su Beom. 

391
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,780
Even if it was Chief Cheon's decision,

392
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,450
how could you

393
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,140
turn a blind eye on your colleague for so long?

394
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,430
I...

395
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,170
I'm to blame for my weakness.

396
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,210
Though it's late, you should testify the truth

397
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,280
and clear Chief Cheon's name.

398
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,410
But that's...

399
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,610
That's... but...

400
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,880
The Ojeong Group bastards...

401
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,820
The reason Ji Dong Man and Ji Myeong Seob were able to get away with everything

402
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,400
was because of

403
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,150
sympathizers like you, who gave up on their conscience.

404
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:07,000
However, in reverse, the sympathizers are the strongest witnesses

405
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to prove Ojeong Group's crimes.

406
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,500
Goodness.

407
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,970
Chief Cheon lived three years of hell.

408
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,760
Don't you feel bad?

409
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,730
 It won't be easy to find conclusive evidence against Ojeong Group. 

410
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,970
 I'm sure there is a way. 

411
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,060
 First, I'm thinking of winning over Warden Bae Han Seong. 

412
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,870
 If so... 

413
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,940
 If only Han Seong would help us out, 

414
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,080
 you'll be able to shake up Prosecutor Jeong. 

415
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,340
 He probably has all the evidence 

416
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,130
 against Ojeong Group. 

417
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,270
I know Director Jeong Wook is involved in this.

418
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,150
Prison Warden Bae.

419
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,630
Are you back?

420
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,890
Gosh, you scared me.

421
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,930
I'll have a cup, okay?

422
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,610
Are you feeling okay?

423
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,090
Yes, I'm fine now.

424
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,740
Medical Officer, I can sleep here before I go, right?

425
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,320
Chief Park Jin Cheol said I could.

426
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,790
S-Sure.

427
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,110
Gosh, all that acting really took me out.

428
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,530
You're telling me this was an act the whole time?

429
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,240
Goodness.

430
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,540
Oh, your passport. Let me go grab it.

431
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,800
Here's the key. Your money and suitcase are inside.

432
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,110
Hurry up and open it. We're late.

433
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,090
Geez.

434
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,200
Hyeong.

435
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,510
Whoa, shit.

436
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,600
I can't believe that worked.

437
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,690
Where's Yun Seong Ho? Bring Seong Ho.

438
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,120
Okay.

439
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,890
No, he's not.

440
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,630
No, he's handsome.

441
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,210
If you look closely, he's handsome.

442
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,200
Welcome!

443
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,220
Nuna, why are you here again?

444
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,280
I need to work, too, so I can make a living.

445
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,110
How do you record videos?

446
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,880
- Record what?
 - I know you guys have a backup plan to survive.

447
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,210
Where do you put it?

448
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,230
Is it over there?

449
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,020
Or here?

450
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,610
Put what, Nuna?

451
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,350
Are you making a movie? What's wrong with you─

452
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,720
You think I'm joking around, Asshole?

453
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,480
Why did you hit me? Even my mom doesn't hit me!

454
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,470
I heard there's the smell of drugs in this place.

455
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,620
Do you want me to turn this place into a funeral home?

456
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,500
Their sweet and sour pork is so good. But why aren't you eating?

457
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,680
Gosh, don't worry about me and eat up. Eat up!

458
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,340
- Eat this as well.
 - This, too?

459
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:56,110
It must be tough to assist a troublemaker like Myeong Seob.

460
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,700
That's what I'm saying. Since we're on the topic, his personality is...

461
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,950
just so...

462
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,410
Forget it. You probably know better than I do.

463
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,980
Gosh, of course.

464
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,800
Ji Dong Man is one thing,

465
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,350
but Myeong Seob is like a bone-chilling psycho.

466
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,600
That's what I'm saying.

467
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,440
I can predict when the chairman will get angry.

468
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,200
But the executive director... No, Myeong Seob is unpredictable.

469
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,000
- I feel like he's bipolar.
 - Bipolar!

470
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,490
When I was getting off work earlier, he called

471
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,760
and suddenly told me to obtain all the CCTV footage from Ilcheon Port.

472
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,440
Oh, why Ilcheon Port?

473
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,340
I don't know. Probably because he did something fishy there

474
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,530
to collect evidence. Don't you think?

475
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,840
Something fishy.

476
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,400
Both the father and son Ji are afraid of CCTV footage and video or voice recordings.

477
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,270
These days, I feel like gathering all these recordings

478
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,400
and spreading them all to the media and the police.

479
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,240
- The media and the police.
 - Yeah.

480
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,950
I understand why you ran away from that house... after your divorce.

481
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,220
- You finally understand me?
 - Yeah.

482
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,880
Thank you.

483
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,070
But you look so beautiful today.

484
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,110
- Please eat up.
 - Yeah, you ordered a lot.

485
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,920
- Please eat this, too.
 - You want me to eat all of it?

486
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,870
Eat all of it.

487
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,030
Hyeong, are you awake?

488
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,240
Sorry. You were shocked, huh?

489
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,530
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

490
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,560
You must be wondering why I'm doing this.

491
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,540
Hyeong, you need to be honest with me.

492
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,710
Or you could die.

493
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,950
Do you really not know where it is?

494
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,310
Jeong Hak's lifeline.

495
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,450
 There's no way you wouldn't have left any evidence. 

496
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,610
 Jeong Hak, 

497
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,540
 I'll give you the money. Hand it over. 

498
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,340
 Hey, if I hand that over to you, 

499
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,860
 you're going to kill me. 

500
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,090
 Do you take me for an idiot? 

501
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,410
 You think I'll hand over my lifeline that easily? 

502
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,980
 Will a savior appear for you in this situation? 

503
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,890
 If it's Ojeong Group, 

504
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,190
 I think they would cut you off as a troublesome tail. 

505
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,310
 Just like Choi Jeong Hak. 

506
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,550
 Bastard, you'll have to die today. 

507
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,150
Gosh, you're not answering.

508
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,090
Hyeong, I have two hypotheses.

509
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,970
Either Choi Jeong Hak hid it where nobody would find it,

510
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:45,160
or you found it but you are keeping quiet about it.

511
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,990
I don't have it.

512
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,780
"I don't have it"?

513
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,610
You're speaking in riddles.

514
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,860
Shit.

515
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,740
Shit!

516
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,610
"I don't have it"?

517
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,210
What does that mean?

518
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,550
"I don't have it"?

519
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,240
Okay!

520
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,420
My conclusion is...

521
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,100
I just need to eliminate you since you know that video exists.

522
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,230
- Myeong Seob...
 - Bye-bye.

523
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,640
I'm sure this is Myeong Seob's doing.

524
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,750
I felt something was off ever since he came by the hospital

525
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,000
unannounced earlier.

526
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,890
Executive Director isn't picking up.

527
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,210
If Myeong Seob really is responsible for this,

528
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,470
I will just...

529
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,870
What should we do next, Chairman?

530
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,480
Detective Kim, this is Lee Han Sin.

531
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,180
I'm on my way over there, but it's a bit far.

532
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,550
 - What about Chairman Ji? 
 - Yes...

533
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,310
It's quite difficult to see someone so famous.

534
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,980
For now, I've checked the traffic cameras in the vicinity

535
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,160
for all vehicles owned by Ojeong Group that left Ojeong Hospital.

536
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
Okay, please keep watch for him.

537
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,600
-  Hey, Attorney. 
 - Yes?

538
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,420
By chance, do you think he caught onto us waiting for him outside the hospital?

539
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,910
What a surprise that you'd call me first.

540
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,040
I guess you've got some good news.

541
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,540
Shouldn't you be calling me first to let me know Chairman Ji left without authorization?

542
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,000
You should've already known that much.

543
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,640
 If you didn't, I misjudged you. 

544
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,600
So, what happened?

545
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,370
Chairman Ji Dong Man left the hospital because of Im Jeong Gyeon, right?

546
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,860
Do I have to tell you stuff like that, too?

547
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,850
You approached me first, asking me to stop his parole release.

548
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,880
If you're going to give me information, give me something useful.

549
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,210
Where's Chairman Ji Dong Man right now?

550
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,860
Assistant Baek, make sure to bring that with you.

551
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,940
But Mr. Hwang, why would you come all the way here?

552
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,520
I wanted to see my Su Ah.

553
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,800
People might think you're her dad.

554
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,330
Does that make you Su Ah's grandma?

555
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,580
Gosh, look at the time.

556
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,180
I wonder if our Su Ah is sleeping already.

557
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,060
He's come a long way. He sure has.

558
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,240
He's come a long way.

559
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,000
Hey, you bastards!

560
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,520
Who the hell are you?

561
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,390
Who the hell are you bastards?

562
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,080
Gosh, we're okay.

563
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,970
What if you burn your hands?

564
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,560
Still, I wanted to offer you something.

565
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,990
- Please have some coffee.
 - Thank you.

566
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,340
Please have some coffee.

567
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,040
Thank you.

568
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,070
Isn't it uncomfortably living here?

569
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,690
What do you mean? This is like a palace compared to what I had in the past.

570
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,110
Where can you find a palace this tiny?

571
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,770
I'll get you a clean room nearby, so live there.

572
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,880
Gosh, it's really okay.

573
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,200
- Just do as I say.
 - Yes, yes.

574
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,930
You're the best, President Choi.

575
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,180
Yes, you're the best, President Choi.

576
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,270
Yeah, tell me.

577
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,440
What?

578
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,370
Ma'am, it's dangerous. I'll head inside first.

579
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,830
Hey, Assistant Baek, just shut up and follow me.

580
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,790
Who are you assholes?

581
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,020
It would cost too much to fix your ugly ass.

582
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,940
President Choi.

583
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,970
It's okay, it's okay. Did you eat?

584
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,520
Ji Dong Man.

585
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,790
So, it's you.

586
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,700
The president bitch who runs this sewer of a corner store.

587
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,570
"The president bitch who runs this sewer of a corner store."?

588
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,400
He's pissing me off.

589
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,340
- Assistant Baek.
 - Yes, ma'am!

590
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,080
It pisses you off, too, right?

591
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:52,110
Let's show them that the president bitch who runs this sewer of a corner store is no joke.

592
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,260
- Come at me.
 - You bastard!

593
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,510
Move!

594
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,440
Shit!

595
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,280
Hyeongnim!

596
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,580
Hyeongnim!

597
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:49,250
You used to collect debts at the market, bitch.

598
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,140
I heard rumors that the famous Chairman Ji Dong Man

599
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:01,640
also built his company by collecting debts in Busan.

600
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,180
Damn it! Let go!

601
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,670
Who do you think you're talking to? How dare you?

602
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,170
Wow! I'm so scared!

603
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:16,590
Do you think intimidating me like this will work?

604
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,780
You own a lot of land in Yangpan.

605
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,230
What?

606
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,120
As soon as you make money, you buy land in Yangpan,
    

607
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,440
and you give out loans using security loans on that land.

608
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,460
You're quite smart.

609
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,750
There's nothing more reliable than real estate.

610
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,520
You'd better stop your nonsense working with

611
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,250
Lee Han Sin.

612
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:57,300
Next time, you'll lose your head.

613
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,850
In the market streets and in the loan shark world,

614
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:06,030
I rolled around at the bottom to climb up to this point!

615
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,520
You've been there, so you already know!

616
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,170
The more you stomp on people like us,

617
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,540
the more our claws come out!

618
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,860
This bitch still hasn't come to her senses!

619
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,310
- Eonni...
 - Chairman.

620
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,750
You bastard!

621
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
You're...

622
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,730
nothing but a pig filled with lard...

623
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:01,550
You're worthless, you pig. You lard...

624
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,590
All you're good for is to grease up the pan...

625
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,540
 Attorney, something terrible happened. 

626
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,860
What? What's the matter?

627
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,850
 I think President Choi's office was attacked. 

628
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,680
 The mood on the phone was serious. 

629
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,640
Okay, I'll check up on them.

630
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,670
 These belong to Choi Jeong Hak? 

631
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,070
 Yeah. 

632
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,440
 What a weirdo. 

633
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,600
 Why? 

634
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,370
 I mean, a collaboration between Christianity and Buddhism? 

635
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,690
 That's so contradictory. 

636
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,000
 Where would Choi Jeong Hak have hidden it? 

637
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,870
 - You know, don't you?
 - How would I know? 

638
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,620
 If you don't want to die, hurry up and tell me. 

639
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,740
 I don't know about him. 

640
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,310
 But if it were me, 

641
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,520
 I'd keep it on me. 

642
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,760
I mean, I couldn't entrust it to just anyone.

643
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,510
 I decided to give you something extra since it's you, Hyeong. 

644
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,600
 - Should I sit next to you?
 - Please just leave. 

645
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,850
- Da Yun...
  - I'll just drink water. 

646
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,490
 Oh, you want to drink water? 

647
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,470
 Give me your glass. 

648
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,380
 I'll be leaving. 

649
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,930
 Leave if you can. 

650
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,660
Da Yun...

651
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,280
-  Director Son, 
 - You sons of bitches.

652
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,300
-  well, I...  
- You sons of bitches.

653
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,410
 I have a bit of an annoying situation. You need to come. 

654
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:33,970
 Yeah. 

655
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:36,100
 Yeah. 

656
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,480
 It's a bit serious. 

657
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,360
She's alive.

658
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,920
She's alive!

659
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,770
-  Come quickly. 
 - She's alive!

660
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,060
Da Yun.

661
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,800
Da Yun...

662
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,770
 She's dead, right? 

663
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,100
 Is she dead? 

664
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,740
You sons of bitches!

665
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,410
 Damn it, this is so annoying. 

666
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,290
 A person has died. 

667
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,440
 So what? Isn't it your job to clean up after stuff like this? 

668
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,940
 Just clean up this mess properly. 

669
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,590
Da Yun!

670
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,840
She was alive...

671
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,990
You sons of bitches!

672
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,680
Okay.

673
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,760
We're doing a security check. Please lower your window.

674
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,590
Please lower your window completely.

675
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,680
- Are you alone?
 - What is this about?

676
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,810
Please show me your driver's license.

677
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,890
   

678
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,170
Let me check your trunk.

679
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,630
You may go.

680
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:59,420
Attorney, I just checked Son Eung Jun's car,

681
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,640
 but Chairman Ji Dong Man wasn't there. 

682
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,160
What? He wasn't there?

683
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,710
Then, d-did he not return to hospital?

684
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,060
Detective Kim, I'll call you right back.
    

685
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,990
President Choi.

686
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:40,630
 - What did he say?
 - The patrol car that showed up after you left the hospital is still waiting there. 

687
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,590
 Lee Han Sin is behind this. 

688
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:46,760
 That bastard is resorting to shallow tricks again. 

689
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:54,320
Warden Bae, everything's ready, right?

690
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,630
Yeah, I'll be arriving soon.

691
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,090
 I called Warden Bae, 

692
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:23,110
and he said my dad is returning to the prison tonight.

693
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,530
Yes, Attorney Lee.

694
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,370
Inspector, where are you?

695
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,720
Near the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

696
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,020
Could you track someone's location using CCTV footage?

697
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,740
 I think Chairman Ji is heading back to the prison instead of the hospital. 

698
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,600
We have to catch him before he arrives.

699
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,660
 Yes, I understand. 

700
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,320
 Director Son's car left President Choi's office not too long ago. 

701
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,770
 I think you should search the route from there to the prison. 

702
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,250
 I'm not sure. He may have switched the car. 

703
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,330
Wait! Please zoom in on that.

704
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,410
   

705
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,530
   

706
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,540
23 Ji 4923.

707
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,390
 It was a taxi. 23 Ji 4923. 

708
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,810
Based on the time he passed through Samcheon Intersection,

709
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,640
he'll arrive at Jungbu Prison soon.

710
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,350
 But I feel like you'll be pressed for time. 

711
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:08,560
Hey, Director Son, I'll be arriving soon, so hang up for now.

712
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,830
I'm busy, so just go.

713
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,490
Don't you see the light turned red?

714
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:15,270
Just ignore it and go! The fine isn't even that much!

715
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,380
Gosh, this guy is trouble!

716
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,300
You should obey the traffic light.

717
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,200
Just go if I say so. How dare you talk back to me!

718
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,150
I don't care who you are. I refuse to go until the light changes.

719
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,220
This bastard!

720
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:38,280
4... 4... 4923!

721
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,010
4923!

722
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:50,330


723
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:57,580
What's wrong with your driving?

724
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,630
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

725
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:03,750
I'm all right, but what will you do? Report to the insurance?

726
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,940
Yes, let's go through insurance.

727
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,500
I even have a passenger in the back.

728
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,060
- Sir, are you all right?
 - I-I'm fine. L-Let's just go.

729
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,230
Will you go through insurance?

730
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,740
Yes, let's call our own insurance.

731
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,400
Then, please tell the passenger that you'll go through insurance.

732
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,650
Okay.

733
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,090
Are you all right?

734
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,560
It's not a passenger, but a fugitive is sitting here!

735
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,020
- What are you doing?
 - What do you mean?

736
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,290
Chairman, why are you here instead of at the hospital?

737
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:42,540
Seeing how you're out here without even a correction officer,

738
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,940
you must've run off

739
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,540
without authorization during an outside medical treatment.

740
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:53,820
Chairman, it appears your parole release will fail again.

741
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:02,930
♫  One shot, turn the tables, ahead of the scammers  ♫

742
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:08,670
♫  One shot, what a life. Thanks to villains, back on the game  ♫

743
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,380
♫  One shot, one shot on the game  ♫

744
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,210
♫  One shot, one shot on the game  ♫

745
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,910
♫  One shot, one shot on the game  ♫

746
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:20,180
♫  Alone but not afraid, back on the game  ♫

747
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:25,930
♫  Back on the game, back on the game, back on the game, back on the game  ♫

748
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:30,230
♫  Back on the game, back on the game, back on the game  ♫

749
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,670
   

750
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,680
 Preview 
Because of him, the company's image is ruined, and the stock prices have plummeted. 

751
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,350
 I think we'll need to have a special event. 

752
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,580
 Before the captain gets back, let's cause some trouble. 

753
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:45,610
 Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin's opinion will be excluded from reviewing this case. 

754
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,990
 Ojeong Group sent me a quite interesting invitation for a press release. 

755
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,270
 You'll do something this fun without me? 

756
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,960
 Let's defeat Ojeong Group! 

757
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,200
 It's time for us to start pushing him into the trap. 

758
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,770
 Ji Myeong Seob, you are under emergency arrest for the murder of An Da Yun.
