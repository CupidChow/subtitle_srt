1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,200
   

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,010
   

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,190
   

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,730
   

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,010
   

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,980
   

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,000
   

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,740
   

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,780
   

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:49,740


11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,620
Correction Officer Lee.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,460
By chance...

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,210
did you come to say your goodbyes?

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Number 4556, you can't be set free.

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,170
You haven't fully paid for your crimes.

16
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,940
"This certifies that the above individual has been granted parole

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,150
in accordance with Article 72, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Act and Article 295 of the Enforcement Rules

18
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,690
of the Act on Execution and Treatment of Prisoners."

19
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,390
That's what it says here.

20
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,330
I told you.

21
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,450
You can't stop me.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,670
   

23
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,690
Director Son, Myeong Seop's issue was taken care of properly, right?

24
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,160
Yes, he was just released on parole.

25
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,420
To think the one son I have

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,640
is like a time bomb that can explode at any moment...

27
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,570
 You crazy bastard, how could you kill someone! 

28
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,380
 The appeals court verdict for CEO Ji Dong Man of Ojeong Group, 

29
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,010
 who was indicted on charges including embezzlement and breach of trust... 

30
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,920
 With high expectations that a prison sentence will be handed down the Chaebol 3-5 Rule... 

31
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,330
 Whether the common sentence of three years in prison and five years of probation will be given... 

32
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,510
 Three years in prison is considered to be the maximum sentence allowed probation. 

33
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,110
 Though he is declared guilty, the punishment is not carried out. 

34
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,240
 It is essentially the same as being pardoned. 

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,500
 18 out of the 19 CEOs who were found guilty so far 

36
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,100
 were sentenced to between one to four years in prison, 

37
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,340
 but only half actually served their sentence. 

38
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,870
 Of these individuals, not a single person served their full sentence in prison before their release. 

39
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,320
 Now for the weather, the metropolitan area will be cloudy and 

40
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,010
 the daytime temperature will be lower than yesterday, so it will be chilly. 

41
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,640
 It is recommended that you dress warmly. 

42
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,490
 The remaining rain clouds will disappear to the East Sea by this afternoon... 

43
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,960
   

44
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,960
How could they tell me to rot in prison for three years for spending my own money?

45
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,960
It makes no sense, but the public opinion is really negative.

46
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,670
If you wait patiently while thinking of this as a year-long vacation,

47
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,520
- I'll have you released on probation— 
- Vacation?

48
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,030
If it's that comfortable and nice, you go to prison in my place.

49
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,100
- I'm sorry. 
 - There are tons of reporters here, Chairman.

50
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,710
These hyenas are excited to feast on me, aren't they?

51
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,110
What are they trying to get by swarming over here?

52
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,710
- Chairman. 
- Okay, all right.

53
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,000
If Ojeong Group falls, South Korea will fall, too!

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,930
Release Chairman Ji Dong Man! 
   

55
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,460
 Release him, release him! 

56
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,340
What do you mean, three years?

57
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,360
Wake up, Judiciary!

58
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,570
 Wake up, wake up! 

59
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,510
   

60
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,810
   

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
Chairman Ji Dong Man is innocent!

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,390
 He's innocent, he's innocent! 

63
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,460
Chairman Ji Dong Man, we love you, we support you!

64
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,670
 We love you, we support you! 

65
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,240
You were sentenced to a prison sentence against all expectations.

66
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,190
How do you feel right now?

67
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,750
Do you believe it was due to the recent assault case?

68
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,360
I apologize for causing you concern due to this unfortunate matter.

69
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,580
Before being Chairman of a group, as a citizen,

70
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,710
I respect the court's decision and will faithfully—

71
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,370
Chairman!

72
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,520
An egg!

73
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,800
- He was in the middle of talking! 
- Seriously...

74
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,420
I will faithfully commit to serving my sentence.

75
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,660
Once again, I sincerely apologize.

76
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,710
 Shut up! 

77
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,330
 Let's go! 

78
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,010
Hey! Hey, I saw you throw the eggs!

79
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,770
   

80
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,670
Call me whenever you need me. I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.

81
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,220
Stop throwing eggs!

82
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,930
This way.

83
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,210
 Chairman! Chairman! 

84
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,860
 Chairman! Chairman! 

85
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,000
Take good care, Chairman!

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,170
Goodbye, Chairman!

87
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,940
I'm sorry. All right, all right.

88
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,360
 Chairman Ji! 

89
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,630
When I got hit by the eggs,

90
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,900
I thought my jaw was going to break. Were eggs always this painful?

91
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,610
What?

92
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,570
Who are you?

93
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,820
   

94
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,370
   

95
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,190
   

96
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,310
Chairman Ji, you're all done now.

97
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,460
Thank you.

98
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,010
Is something not to your liking, by chance?

99
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,970
No matter how much money I spend on myself in here, it doesn't show.

100
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,820
Geez.

101
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,730
The attorney is waiting for you in the visitation room.

102
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,970
   

103
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,100
   

104
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,250
Chairman! Hello, sir!

105
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,820
What are you doing here, Warden Bae?

106
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,720
Oh, well, I was wondering if you were experiencing any discomfort.

107
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,900
You don't have any good news for me?

108
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,140
- Well... I'm sorry. 
- Aigoo.

109
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,300
You couldn't even talk your subordinate into cooperating.

110
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,730
Warden Bae, remind me how old your son is now.

111
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,930
He's 27.

112
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,120
What about his job?

113
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,600
He graduated last year but he hasn't found a job yet.

114
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,190
Employment is difficult these days.

115
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,080
Tell him to submit an application during the open hiring at Ojeong Group.

116
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,530
Thank you, Chairman! Thank you.

117
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,730
It isn't for free.

118
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,970
I'll be looking forward to hearing good news soon.

119
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,390
Yes, sir.

120
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,330
- Hello, sir! 
- Hello, sir!

121
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,050
Please take a seat.

122
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,570
Geez, look at the state of this company.

123
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,900
- Attorney Seo. 
- Yes?

124
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,770
How did your talk with the classification chief go?

125
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,390
I'm still contacting him.

126
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,970
It's not even that difficult! Why are you dragging it out so long?

127
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,850
Stop just getting in contact with him and bring me some results!

128
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,540
I'll come back with some results.

129
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,630
Attorney Lee, I said not to add all the oil because it's too greasy!

130
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,940
Oh, okay, okay.

131
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,140
I'm sorry. I forgot.

132
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,660
Please eat up.

133
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,420
Chairman, do you know a prisoner's favorite bread (bbang)?

134
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,810
It's gaseokbbang (parole)!

135
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,840
Attorney Lee.

136
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,180
Attorney Lee!

137
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,410
Don't you feel bad getting paid while spewing useless nonsense?

138
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,180
I'm sorry. I'll work harder.

139
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,620
Chairman, did you hear what's going on with Actress Choi Won Mi?

140
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,490
I heard she's preparing a comeback with the movie, "The Heiress."

141
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,280
Is that true?

142
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,540
"The Heiress"?
    

143
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,250
I told this bitch to lay low. Why is she crawling out already?

144
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,640
How dare she try to make a movie without my permission!

145
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,200
Director Son, what's with you these days?

146
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,150
The problem with Leo last time, and now, you didn't report to me about her antics.

147
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,940
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,350
So, what happened with Leo?

149
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,960
Oh, Leo?

150
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Leo... I'm working on it.

151
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,880
You should have brought him, even if you have to sue!

152
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,910
I'll file a lawsuit and make sure to bring him!

153
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,350
Attorney Lee, what are you doing?

154
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,300
Oh, I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

155
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,310
The passion you showed me while shielding me from the eggs thrown at me.

156
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,040
I don't see that energy from you these days.

157
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,070
Chairman, I'll bring the Mr. Leo you mentioned.

158
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,980
Mr. Leo?

159
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,580
- Hey.
 - Yes?

160
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,160
Do you even know who Leo is?

161
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,830
I don't really know who Leo is,

162
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,480
but I'll bring him, no matter what it takes.

163
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,700
- Really?
 - Yes.

164
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,440
- Can you bring him? 
- Yes.

165
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,410
Just leave it to me.

166
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,950
   

167
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,190
   

168
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,700
   

169
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,150
Gosh, geez.

170
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,210
Oh, y-you're here?

171
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,010
- This precious tower I built just fell. 
 - Aigoo.

172
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,520
The tower I built is about to fall, too.

173
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,160
Pardon? Why all of a sudden?

174
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,010
I told Chairman Ji Dong Man that I would bring Leo to him.

175
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,090
Leo? Who's Leo?

176
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,020
Oh, oh, that famous chef on TV these days?

177
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,960
No, not him.

178
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,900
It's a dog, a dog.

179
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,600
A dog?

180
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,780
 Leo! 

181
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,440
Leo! Come here, Leo!

182
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,950
Oh, what's wrong?

183
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,700
Why do you seem so depressed?

184
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,960
Leo, what's wrong? Did something happen?

185
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,830
He's quite handsome.

186
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,280
Isn't this Chairman Ji's ex-wife?

187
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,360
Actresses are really something else.

188
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,650
- Her beauty radiates through these pictur— 
- Gosh, seriously!

189
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,050
This is not the time to be appreciating her beauty!

190
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,920
We need to find a way.

191
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,140
Why are you yelling at me for?

192
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,640
Did you not have any sort of plan before making such a promise?

193
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,250
The milk has spilled already, so I'll need to find a way.

194
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,640
Come on, Attorney Lee.

195
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,400
You can just diligently partake in visitations like a lackey attorney.

196
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,780
Why did you have to stir the pot and cause people trouble?

197
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,200
Geez.

198
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,830
Paralegal.

199
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,240
Yes?

200
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,180
Mommy is going to go ahead of you!

201
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,550
Aigoo, good job!

202
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,230
Let's go!

203
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,900
Oh, good job!

204
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,220
Oh, hello!

205
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,410
You're Actress Choi Won Mi, right?

206
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,660
Oh, yes, I am.

207
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,290
Wow, the photos really don't do you justice.

208
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,400
I do hear that often.

209
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,790
I'm referring to Leo, not you. Leo, you're Leo, right?

210
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,270
Oh, Leo? Yeah, Leo's pretty.

211
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,210
But... how do you know my Leo?

212
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,630
- I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin. 
- An attorney?

213
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,600
Your ex-husband Ji Dong Man, Chairman of Ojeong Group, is my client.

214
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,670
What?

215
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,000
Did it piss him off that I was filming a movie?

216
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,200
He's the spouse at fault, and yet, he's still trying to meddle in my business?

217
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
It's not about the movie.

218
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,750
- I'll get to the point. 
- Yes, please.

219
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
Let me borrow Leo.

220
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,360
It looks like you're his new lackey attorney.

221
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,530
Go and tell that guy this.

222
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,060
"Don't even think about it!"

223
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,020
Let's go, Leo!

224
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,790
Your coffee and muffin are ready.

225
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,690
Thank you.

226
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,330
Leo, let's eat muffins!

227
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,380
Leo, Leo? Come here.

228
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,330
Leo? Where are you?

229
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,250
Hey, you!

230
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,170
You!

231
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,600
Aigoo.

232
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,140
I warned you to stay away from Leo!

233
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,220
Leo really likes this snack. Here, Leo.

234
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,100
I said no! Why did you come again?

235
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,550
I intend to file a lawsuit.

236
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,680
I came to let you know before I file the lawsuit.

237
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,110
What do you mean a lawsuit?

238
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,440
I'm preparing a lawsuit over Leo's custody and visitation rights.

239
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,480
- What? 
- The right of visitation

240
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,470
is a legal right explicitly stipulated in Article 837, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Act.

241
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,250
The right to custody is also—

242
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,860
I don't have children.

243
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,790
- Yes, you don't have children. 
- Right.

244
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,700
But, according to overseas cases, there are instances where visitation rights and custody have been recognized for

245
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,060
pets raised like children, based on their contribution during a divorce.

246
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,250
That man did nothing for Leo.

247
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,510
That's not true.

248
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,750
What do you mean?

249
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,990
Let me see.

250
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,450
This is Leo's snack and vet fees paid with Chairman Ji's credit card.

251
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,280
198,000 won (~$198), 34,000 won (~$34), 59,000 won (~$59)?

252
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,750
Over something petty like this?

253
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,030
Then, I'll see you in court.

254
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,560
I already sent the certification of contents to your home.

255
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,390
You'll need to hire a skilled attorney.

256
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,840
Hey, wait.

257
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,310
Wait.

258
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,700
Ms. Choi, could I get your autograph?

259
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,160
I'm such a fan of yours.

260
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,690
Oh, goodness. You look so much prettier in person!

261
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,590
Is that really a person's skin?

262
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,970
- Mr. Hwang. 
- Yes?

263
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,700
I'll do it. Give it to me.

264
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,780
Oh, really?

265
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,860
I've been your fan since I was young.

266
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,440
- Here you go. 
- Thank you!

267
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,450
I'll root for your upcoming movie. Fighting!

268
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,630
Yes, fighting!

269
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,260
I keep seeing reports of Chairman Ji's release on parole.

270
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,560
Is Leo the only thing he has missed while in prison?

271
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,280
Unfortunately, he misses Leo more than you, Ms. Choi.

272
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,020
Our next steps will be determined by your choices.

273
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,540
We can either get into a messy lawsuit or...

274
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,920
- Or what? 
- Or... you can let me borrow Leo for half a day

275
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,790
and let the Chairman reunite with his separated family.

276
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,160
That's all you need to decide.

277
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
I don't want to.

278
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,830
You won't allow your ex-husband in prison to even have visitation rights for half a day?

279
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,650
Won't you seem so cruel? You're supposedly an iconic actress of South Korea.

280
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:45,230
Don't you think it's petty of you to blackmail me like this?

281
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm not blackmailing you.

282
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,550
I'm offering you a deal.

283
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,740
 Actress Choi Won Mi. 

284
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,630
 Perhaps she got so burned while being married to Chairman Ji. 

285
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,270
 Her dating history is very clean. 

286
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,810
 Her attitude on set matches her status as an icon of beauty and diligence. 

287
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,090
 Why don't you join her fan club while you're at it? 

288
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,430
 Is there anything about her that could be a weakness? 

289
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,080
 Weakness... 

290
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,910
I heard you are currently in a dispute with your agency over a settlement.

291
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,240
If you let me borrow Leo for half a day,

292
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,200
I will resolve that problem for you.

293
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,100
Can you really resolve that for me?

294
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,690
Hey, you!

295
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,000
- Hey! 
- Move!

296
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,210
- I'm sorry! 
 - Get him!

297
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,120
You son of a bitch!

298
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,540
You asshole! You almost got killed!

299
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,360
Aigoo, help me!

300
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,510
Are you all right?

301
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,390
Ju Mok, take care of this lady.

302
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,260
Grandmother, are you all right?

303
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,890
Goodness.

304
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,400
- Damn it! 
- You bastard!

305
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,570
Choi Jeong Hak!

306
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,060
- Drop your knife.
 - Choi Jeong Hak, drop your knife!

307
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,980
I told you to drop it.

308
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,230
What will you do about it?

309
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,490
You have the right to an attorney, and the right to remain silent.

310
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,350
You know the drill, right?

311
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,870
There's something I want to hear from you.

312
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,790
Gosh, damn it!

313
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,390
Let's go!

314
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,450
   

315
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,600
These guys have all become complacent just because I'm in prison.

316
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,520
If they give excuses again today, I'll fire them all.

317
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,100
Attorney Lee! Attorney Lee, where are you?

318
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,500
   

319
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,770
   

320
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,790

What's this? Why is that bastard... what is he doing?

329
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
He's bringing such disgrace to all the attorneys. That bastard.

330
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,470
You're doing great, Leo!

331
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,270
Isn't that Leo?

332
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,370
That is Leo!

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,570
Why is Leo over there?

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,190

Stop, that's enough, Attorney Lee! That's enough!

338
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,660
That's enough.

339
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,840
You saw that, right?

340
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,350
Even a lackey attorney can do this much.

341
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,970
- But you, Attorney Seo. 
  - Yes, sir. 

342
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,010
You get paid a fortune, but what have you done?

343
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,790
I am still contacting Classification Chief Park Jin Cheol.

344
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,690
 You're still just contacting him? 

345
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,610
That means you have no results.

346
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,580
That's not really true,

347
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,010
but Classification Chief Park Jin Cheol is a bit by the book.

348
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,730
- So, when I talk to him— 
- I heard his child is sick.

349
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,810
Didn't you even set him up in a hospital?

350
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:32,800
 Yes, he is suffering from pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension due to a congenital heart defect. 

351
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,330
 I told him we will pay to have the top surgeon in this field 

352
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,050
perform the surgery on his son at Ojeong Hospital

353
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,650
and even push up his surgery date ahead of schedule,

354
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,180
but Classification Chief Park Jin Cheol refused.

355
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,390
I told you to bring me Leo, even if you have to file a lawsuit,

356
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,360
but you couldn't without a domestic precedent.

357
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,360
And I told you to persuade Classification Chief to put me on the parole list,

358
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,390
 but you said he's too by the book. 

359
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,800
 If you can't persuade him, 

360
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,220
have him reassigned to Jeoksong Prison, which is filled with felons!

361
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,420
You can't take care of a guy like him?

362
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,400
I would love to do that, too,

363
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,750
but the press would catch on and talk, which would hurt the Group's image.

364
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,980
 Why would you worry about the Group's image! 

365
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,250
I'm sorry!

366
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,800
Stop with your apologies!

367
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,910
Three days.

368
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,230
If you can't bring me results in that time, prepare to lose your job.

369
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,110
Leo.

370
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,960
Leo... How did he bring Leo?

371
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,470
Right? Does he know someone?

372
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,270
Oh, right. I can't be sitting here.

373
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,510
I'll contact you guys later.

374
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,750
The file, the file.

375
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,130
Gosh, shall we eat something tasty?

376
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,050
Here you go!

377
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,940
Chairman, it's so good to see you like this.

378
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,520
Chairman, it's been so long since you saw Leo.

379
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,280
How about a picture?

380
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,470
Look here! Leo, look here!

381
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,660
Taking the picture!

382
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,920
- Attorney Lee, take a seat. 
- Okay.

383
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,320
That bitch wouldn't have let you take Leo so easily.

384
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,380
How did you manage to bring him? By chance,

385
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,690
you didn't kidnap him, right?

386
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,360
Chairman, I'm an attorney. I wouldn't kidnap him.

387
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,610
I politely threatened her.

388
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,880
You threatened her? Tell me in detail.

389
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,860
I threatened her with a lawsuit over custody and visitation rights for Leo.

390
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,160
The legal department said there was no chance of winning even if we did sue.

391
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,160
That is correct, but I thought actress Choi Won Mi wouldn't want news of a lawsuit

392
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,640
involving her to become public when she has an upcoming movie.

393
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,130
Then, she got scared and let you take Leo?

394
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,400
You're definitely more competent than those educated idiots.

395
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,970
- Chairman. 
- Go ahead.

396
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,260
Is Classification Chief the reason you were left out of the parole list?

397
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,010
Yes. It's a done deal with the warden,

398
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,710
but I can't get through to this classification chief.

399
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:36,220
By chance, if I manage to persuade the classification chief,

400
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,870
what will you do for me?

401
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,690
You would, Attorney Lee?

402
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,190
If you can persuade him, what couldn't I do for you?

403
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,340
Tell me what you want.

404
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,310
I suddenly remember what you said about my worth.

405
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,440
If I can prove that I'm more useful than my attorney fees,

406
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,470
shouldn't you compensate me accordingly?

407
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,670
Do you want money?

408
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,800
I'll pay you generously for a successful job.

409
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,170
Please make me a parole examiner.

410
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,220
You want me to make you the parole examiner?

411
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,770
Why do you want to become the parole examiner?

412
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:40,310
I'm curious as to why you want that position instead of the contingency fee.

413
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:47,370
I'll tell you that after I successfully persuade the classification chief.

414
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,250
All right. Go for it.

415
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,560
If you succeed,

416
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,630
I'll make you the parole examiner, Attorney Lee.

417
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,740
Wow! I enjoyed your special performance today.

418
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,440
♪ Why are you coming out from there? ♪

419
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,000
You might as well change your career and become a trot singer.

420
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,400
It looks like that field suits you better.

421
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,700
I guess my performance was quite memorable.

422
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,680
Yeah, it was quite memorable.

423
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,690
Where did you get clothes like this?

424
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,340
Let me know if you need them anytime. I'll help you get some.

425
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,020
Take it easy, man.

426
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,920
You should retain some dignity as an attorney!

427
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,270
Aren't you embarrassed to go around dressed like that?

428
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,270
Aren't you the one that should feel embarrassed, Attorney Seo?

429
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,020
- About what? 
 - An attorney is also a service job.

430
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,440
Ensuring client satisfaction is our top priority.

431
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,940
But the chairman doesn't seem to be satisfied with your work.

432
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,020
Aren't you busy?

433
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,170
I don't think you have the time to be talking idly with me.

434
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,790
I am busy. But what did you mean by what you just said?

435
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,950
If you can't change the classification chief's mind in three days,

436
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,280
aren't you going to lose your job?

437
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,650
Then, you should be moving pretty quickly.

438
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,710
I'll take care of it myself.

439
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,490
Oh, Leo. Okay.

440
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,720
But don't take it too easy.

441
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,090
I may just persuade the classification chief first.

442
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,260
What? You'll persuade him first?

443
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,420
How will you persuade him?

444
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,700
You think of putting money inside a vitamin drink box and bribe him, right?

445
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,310
   

446
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,510
 Who is it? 

447
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,120
It's me, Lee Han Sin.

448
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,470
The chairman is fed up with the legal department.

449
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,390
Yes, I'm aware.

450
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,020
It's true that you're doing worse than that new lackey attorney, Lee Han Sin.

451
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,170
Don't you think it's going too far to compare me

452
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,790
to some guy who's a lackey attorney because he lacks skills?

453
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,120
He doesn't lack skills.

454
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,820
That Lackey Attorney Lee Han Sin brought Leo

455
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,500
when you couldn't, Attorney Seo.

456
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,800
He brought Leo, he definitely has skills.

457
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,470
And he has a weapon that you don't, Attorney Seo.

458
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,850
What weapon?

459
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,310
You don't know?

460
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,260
I don't know.

461
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,760
What is it?

462
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,240
Lackey Attorney Lee Han Sin was once a correction officer.

463
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,390
He once worked with Classification Chief Park Jin Cheol.

464
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,110
I'm sure you knew of this before, right?

465
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,010
Thank you, as always.

466
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,400
How's Hae Seong?

467
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,120
He should get better after he gets surgery.

468
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,380
He'll get better soon.

469
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,220
Please have some.

470
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,580
I guess Hae Seong's dad is here.

471
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,320
- Dad! 
- Hey, son.

472
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,780
Uncle's here.

473
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,970
It's been a while, Seonbaenim.

474
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,790
   

475
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,880
Oh, give it to me.

476
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,730
It's all right.

477
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,110
You've got quite the reputation.

478
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,150
- What reputation? 
- That you're still as by-the-book as ever.

479
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,500
What do you mean, by the book?

480
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,140
I'm just doing things by the rules.

481
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,470
I hear that things are rough for attorneys as well.

482
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,060
Is that why

483
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,530
you are working as Chairman Ji Dong Man's lackey attorney?

484
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,710
 - You're here, Attorney Lee? 
- Hello. 

485
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,510
 Yes, Chairman. 

486
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,310
 What are you doing? 

487
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,370
Of all people,

488
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,450
how could you stick with Chairman Ji Dong Man?

489
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,770
You're putting on a stern face so quickly.

490
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:36,280
This is why I told your wife not to tell you that I've been coming by.

491
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,320
I heard that you are refusing to change Chairman Ji's recidivism risk rating.

492
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,960
You know already

493
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,180
that one has to meet the enforcement rate to be put on the parole list.

494
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,590
But Chairman Ji still has a long way to go before he meets the enforcement rate.

495
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,800
You haven't changed one bit, Seonbae.

496
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,280
If you know that, just go home.

497
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,280
And he still doesn't listen to what people say to the end.

498
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,060
 You know Dr. Lee Bok Jun? 

499
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,500
 I heard he's Hae Seong's surgeon. 

500
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,750
 His surgery schedule was packed. 

501
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,010
 But it just happens that there is a single opening in his schedule. 

502
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,140
 It would be good if we had Hae Seong receive surgery for that opening. 

503
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,710
 What do you say? 

504
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,070
 All you have to do is just one thing. 

505
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,290
 I'd like for you to put my chairman on the parole review list. 

506
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,220
 It's simple enough, right? 

507
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,910
 Why? 

508
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,310
 Do you need more money? 

509
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,630
 What are you doing? 

510
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,580
 If you come to see me again, 

511
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,370
 I'll report this to the police. 

512
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,870
 Aren't you being too selfish? What about Hae Seong? 

513
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,100
 I won't be able to make an offer like this next time. 

514
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,080
 Make your decision wisely. 

515
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,370
 - Hey, Park Jin Cheol. 
- Yes, sir. 

516
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,170
  - Congrats! 
- Seonbaenim, thank you. 

517
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,690
 Hey, Han Sin, what are you doing? Get up here. 

518
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,390
 Seonbae, congratulations! 

519
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,870
 I feel bad that only I received the award when we all worked hard. 

520
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,490
 Saying stuff like that makes you sound like a prick. 

521
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,040
 If you feel bad about receiving an award alone, 

522
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,980
 why don't you treat us to a meal? 

523
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,750
 Of course, I will. 

524
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,860
 - Pork? 
- What? 

525
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,730
 What? What! 

526
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,690
 Let's get beef. 

527
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,450
 Hey, p-please take a picture of us! 

528
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,680
 Okay. Our proud correctional officer! 

529
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,400
 Wow, Park Jin Cheol's so cool! 

530
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,020
 So cool! 

531
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,500
 One, two, three! 

532
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,990
At least he hasn't turned into the worst.

533
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,000
Aigoo, Attorney.

534
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,980
Aigoo, it's a good morning.

535
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,820
Here you were.

536
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,480
This coffee is my special treat for you today.

537
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,400
Mr. Hwang, you're so sensible.

538
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,930
Drink some coffee. It's hot.

539
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,610
- Thank you for the coffee. 
- Sure, sure.

540
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,810
I guess your meeting with Chief Park didn't go so well.

541
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,690
You always come up to the rooftop when you're feeling troubled.

542
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,380
He says he can't put his name on the review list.

543
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,170
Really?

544
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,640
Gosh, I really can't understand him.

545
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,680
I heard his son is ill. He should do whatever he can right away.

546
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,690
That's the kind of guy he is.

547
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,330
It's the reason I like and respect him.

548
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,620
   

549
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,020
   

550
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,470
 Correction Officer Lee Han Sin. 

551
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,650
 Correction Officer, Lee Han Sin! 

552
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,060
 Do you know what we're called in English? 

553
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,880
 I don't know, sir! 

554
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,040
 We're called correction officers. 

555
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,670
 We're like a whiteout pen that corrects criminals with many dark crimes. 

556
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,710
 We don't get to choose what they write on top of that. 

557
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,760
 That's up to the inmates. 

558
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,430
 I'll keep that in mind. 

559
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,360
 At this rate, you'll be called a boomer. I think that's enough. 

560
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,950
 No, sir! I appreciate your good advice— 

561
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,370
 Thank you for the candy! 

562
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,150
 All right. 

563
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,730
 Regulations, first. Regulations, second. 

564
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,560
 And regulations, third. 

565
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,010
 All you have to do is follow the regulations. 

566
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,610
 Understood, sir! 

567
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,350
 Eat it. 

568
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,990
 What a nice weather today. 

569
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,390
 Forget it. I'm too experienced for that. 

570
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,820
 Geez. 

571
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,220
 How's the wedding prep going? Is it going well? 

572
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,290
 Things are going well according to regulations! 

573
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,410
 Aigoo, is that so? 

574
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,380
 Treat your wife well. 

575
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,170
 Of course, of course. 

576
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,170
What are you going to do now?

577
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,450
Will you give up like this?

578
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,290
What do you mean, what will I do?

579
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,260
I'll have to keep persuading him

580
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,840
until my sincerity gets through to him.

581
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:13,510
Why do you keep giving me photos like this in this day and age?

582
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,940
What's this?

583
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,900
 Seeing the look on his face means it didn't go well! 

584
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,870
It's clear from how he hung his head.

585
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,880
He's sighing, and things didn't go well—

586
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,160
The classification chief's son's condition is like a ticking time bomb.

587
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,340
Though he is holding off well for now,

588
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:47,450
parents are helpless when it comes to their children. Right?

589
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,150
That's true.

590
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm not reporting this to you,

591
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,370
but notifying you.

592
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:57,380
I thought you should at least know, Attorney Seo.

593
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,690
It's me.

594
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,510
I've got a job for you.

595
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,270
It's true that you can't hide where you come from.

596
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,520
He acts just like a gangster!

597
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,250
How could he think of harming a kid?

598
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,690
Gosh, seriously.

599
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,050
- You scared me. 
- You scared me!

600
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,600
Why are you here, Paralegal Hwang?

601
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,280
I came to hand in the expense receipts to the legal department.

602
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,230
Hand them in and leave.

603
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,570
But... what did you mean by what you just said?

604
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,220
What?

605
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,790
I think you mentioned something about harming a kid?

606
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,170
- Me? 
- Yes.

607
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,230
- When? 
- Just now.

608
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,800
I never said that.

609
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,410
Maybe something's wrong with your ears.

610
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,160
Do you hear this?

611
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,850
- Of course, I hear it. 
- Really?

612
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,610
Go to a hospital.

613
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,400
All right.

614
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,580
Gosh, why does he have such good hearing?

615
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,730
A kid?

616
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,760
 Just frighten him a little. 

617
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,810
Hae Seong. Park Hae Seong.

618
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,120
Don't run, don't run!

619
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,510
 Hi Attorney. 

620
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:11,430
I came to take care of the expense receipts and overheard something strange.

621
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:15,000
I met Team Leader Seo Dong Hun...

622
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,030
Have a good day.

623
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,070
- Hello. 
- Welcome.

624
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,360
Oh, so cute.

625
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,680
- Are they good? 
- Would you like some apples?

626
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,830
Who are you?

627
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,440
Who the hell are you? Get over here!

628
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,900
Hae Seong! Hae Seong, Hae Seong!

629
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,310
- Are you okay?
 - Someone call 911!

630
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,650
Hae Seong.

631
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,470
Hae Seong, open your eyes!

632
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,730
He's not breathing.

633
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,620
Hae Seong, it's Mommy! It's Mommy. Hae Seong!

634
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,920
Open your eyes! Wake up, Hae Seong!

635
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,270
Hae Seong, Hae Seong.

636
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,330
Hae Seong, please! Hae Seong!

637
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,460
It's coming. The ambulance is coming!

638
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,580
   

639
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,930
Gosh, geez.

640
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,020
I can't even hit the ball because of the stress.

641
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,330
Golf is about focus.

642
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,180
Chief Park, you don't play golf, right?

643
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,030
Yes, I don't think it suits me.

644
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,510
But I know how to watch.

645
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,670
Listen.

646
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,930
During the game last time, I hit a birdie on the 4th hole.

647
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,540
But the caddie lady marked it as a bogie!

648
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,580
Can you imagine how mad I was?

649
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,230
But you know what?

650
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,390
She marked the next bogie I had as a birdie.

651
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,710
Gosh, you know, you know?

652
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,610
That's what you call flexibility and adaptability.

653
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,820
I think that recidivism risk ratings are a different matter.

654
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,350
You're so stubborn!

655
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:11,860
To be blunt, it's not like Chairman Ji is a felon who murdered someone!

656
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,810
Just change his recidivism risk rating slightly!

657
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:19,660
I'm saying turn his bogie into a birdie!

658
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,780
You got that?

659
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,930
   

660
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,820
Just take it. You can take the call!

661
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,350
This guy has no flexibility whatsoever! Goodness.

662
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,270
If it's not anything urgent—

663
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,530
Wh-What?

664
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,660
Where are you?

665
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,760
I-I'll head over right away.

666
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,460
Gosh, seriously!

667
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,020
Aigoo, seriously!

668
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:04,390
   

669
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,350
Hae Seong...

670
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,660
- How's Hae Seong? 
- Honey.

671
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,050
Honey, please save Hae Seong!

672
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:33,600
He's past the critical stage, but they say he'll be in danger if he doesn't get surgery quickly.

673
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,790
Hae Seong...

674
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:39,930
Hae Seong. Oh no, our Hae Seong.

675
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,490
Hae Seong...

676
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,060
I heard from my wife what happened.

677
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,980
Thanks.

678
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,160
I am really grateful,

679
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,070
but let's keep our work and private lives separate.

680
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,300
Regarding Chairman Ji's parole, I'll never—

681
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,180
Seonbae.

682
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,930
What happened to Hae Seong today.

683
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,960
It was all planned.

684
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,830
What do you think is your Achilles heel, Seonbae?

685
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,200
Those sons of bitches, I'll...

686
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:35,030
I heard that they offered to have Hae Seong receive surgery quickly.

687
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,250
If you're too late, even that offer will be rescinded.

688
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:43,350
You should have Hae Seong receive the surgery first.

689
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,130
He dared to harm my child.

690
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,290
Are you saying we should release a guy who blackmails you with people's lives?

691
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:55,710
Seonbae, just trust me this once.

692
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,630
   

693
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,340
Please take good care of him.

694
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,980
Please take good care of him, Doctor.

695
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,440
   

696
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,540
   

697
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:49,460
   

698
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,210
It has taken so long.

699
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,820
   

700
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,570
Chief Park has finally come to his senses!

701
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,150
Okay! All right.

702
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,290
There.

703
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,920
Chairman! Chairman! Chairman!

704
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,700
Open the door, open the door!

705
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,660
Chairman!

706
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:21,590
Chairman, I've got good news!

707
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,080
Wow, you're so good.

708
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,740
- Hey. 
- Pardon?

709
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,640
Is the Chairman going to give you a reward?

710
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,730
Well, yes, he's giving me a reward.

711
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,650
Really? Well, how much is he giving you?

712
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,200
One bill (100M won)?

713
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,850
Two?

714
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,010
I asked for something else, not money.

715
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,230
Hey. Why do you keep walking away while I'm talking to you?

716
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,210
Something else, what?

717
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,840
Are you stupid?

718
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,220
You should've asked for money! Why ask for something like that...

719
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,920
Why did he ask to become the parole examiner?

720
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:20,100
You actually made it happen, Attorney Lee.

721
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,960
Yes, Chairman.

722
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,410
You'll be on the next parole review list.

723
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:30,020
Now, all that's left is for you to make your grand comeback.

724
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:37,000
Since you kept your promise, I should keep my promise.

725
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,310
Soon, you'll be appointed as the parole examiner.

726
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,400
Thank you, Chairman.

727
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,090
Attorney Lee.

728
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,560
I'm asking because I'm so curious,

729
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,610
but why do you want to become the parole examiner?

730
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,700
You must have a reason you asked for that instead of money.

731
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,920
   

732
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,450
 You're learning carpentry well, right? 

733
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,900
 Well, about that... 

734
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,390
 - Mr. Cheon Su Beom 
- It's not easy. 

735
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,150
 We're the police. Come with us. 

736
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,780
 What's going on? 

737
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,460
 - Come with us. 
- Why are you doing this? 

738
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,970
 You need to tell me what this is about! 

739
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,750
 Hey, let me go! 

740
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,470
 Goodbye! 

741
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,540
 Let go of me! 

742
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,530
 Seonbaenim! 

743
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,200
 What are you doing right now? 

744
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,550
 There must be some misunderstanding! 

745
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,530
 - Our chief did nothing wrong! 
- Han Sin! 

746
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,200
 It's okay. 

747
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,490
 I'm innocent, so I'll be released soon. 

748
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,750
 Hyeong. 

749
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,160
 - Let's go. 
- Don't worry about me! 

750
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,930
 I'll be back soon! 

751
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,710
 Don't worry about me! 

752
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:03,760
 Chief Cheon ultimately did not return. 

753
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,710
 I can't watch you 

754
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,860
 get hurt as well. 

755
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,880
 Seonbae, just trust me this once. 

756
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:44,870
There's an inmate whose parole release you want to prevent?

757
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,320
Who is he?

758
00:58:54,970 --> 00:59:03,030


759
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,330
It's you.

760
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,250
♫  I'm a typhoon that will wipe away the unjust world  ♫

761
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,120

00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,840

770
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,930
 Preview 
He shouldn't even be in Korea. How could he get arrested? 

771
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,550
 I guess I can start from here. 

772
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,880
 You silicone-filled plastic surgery monster, 

773
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,340
 I'm afraid you'll appear in my dreams. 

774
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,810
 You wrote the hate comments, Attorney? 

775
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,610
 You can't stop Chairman Ji's parole by opposing it alone, Attorney! 

776
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:04,200
 Let's make a deal. 

777
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,010
 Your mouth is about to be torn open for spewing easy promises you can't keep. 

778
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,950
 Can you really stop him this way? 

779
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:12,380
 We should pay back what we received. 

780
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:18,260
 My opinion on Candidate 177's parole release is...
