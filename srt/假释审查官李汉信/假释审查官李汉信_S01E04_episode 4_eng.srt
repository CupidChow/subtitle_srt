♫  To capture the mythical living whale  ♫

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,720
Let's leave for now.

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,280
Gosh, what was that about?
    

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,700
Is he a marine documentary or whale enthusiast?

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,260
Really weird.

19
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,160
Don't you think it's vicarious satisfaction?

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
Vicarious satisfaction?

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,030
Who would find vicarious satisfaction from watching whales?

22
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,550
 You should have seen Lee Dong Myeong's face when a killer whale 

23
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,110
 the size of a house rose on my screen with a roar. 

24
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,860
 He was dying with envy. 

25
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,310
There's just something like that.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,720
But is it even possible to find the illegal proceeds?

27
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,640
It's definitely hidden somewhere in that building.

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,350

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,270

35
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,060
Attorney Lee, I'm here.

36
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,890
How could a handsome guy like you sit here so coolly?

37
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,400
So, did you call me all the way here just to have Doenjang-jjigae* together? 
  (Soybean paste stew) 

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
Gosh, of course not.

39
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,290
You should buy that building.

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,500
Buy a building...

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,830
   

42
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,800
- Are you telling me to buy that building?
 - Yeah.

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,060
What's this? Did you quit being an attorney and become a real estate agent?

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,740
I'm especially giving you this special tip because it's such a good property.

45
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,640
It's clear it's rundown, with no business in the area and not much foot traffic,

46
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,500
and yet that building is a good property?

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,330
Trust me this once.

48
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,260
Soon, the value of that building will soar.

49
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,480
What are you saying?

50
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,540
If you don't listen to me now, you'll regret it later.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,060
   

52
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,130
   

53
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,650
So, did you check what I told you last time?

54
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,850
 It's true, Bong Su is trying to settle with the victims. 

55
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,770
 What? 

56
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,520
 Wh-Where would he get the money for that? 

57
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,910
 He sold his sports cars to prepare the settlement money. 

58
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,660
 Gosh, this is driving me nuts. 

59
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,950
Well,

60
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,060
it turned out to be true.

61
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,120
Doesn't it worry you?

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
Once Kim Bong Su is released on parole,

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,500
he'll take the illegal proceeds for himself.

64
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,020
Damn it.

65
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,900
Illegal proceeds?

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,370
- There's nothing like that.
 - Let's say that's true.

67
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,580
I mean, it's not like that right now.

68
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,620
Not too long ago, Director of Correctional Services Jeong Wuk visited me

69
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,140
and asked me to help Kim Bong Su be released on parole.

70
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,140
 CEO Kim Bong Su of Junbong Holdings is on the list for the upcoming parole review. 

71
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,180
 Yes, I'm aware. 

72
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,300
 I think it's about time for CEO Kim to be released on parole. 

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,350
 So I would like for you to help, Attorney. 

74
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,520
 For nothing in return? 

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,670
 Of course not. 

76
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:49,020
 Attorney Lee, shouldn't you work in a more comfortable place now? 

77
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,680
 I mean, my office is a bit shabby. 

78
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,420
 It's great that we're on the same wavelength. 

79
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,500
He's not even that close to me,

80
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,210
so I didn't understand why he came to me asking me to help

81
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,920
with Kim Bong Su's parole release.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,780
By chance, do you have any idea why?

83
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,830
I don't know.

84
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,980
You don't know, huh?

85
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,960
All right.

86
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,460
The commercial district analysis results came out.

87
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,940
What did they say?

88
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,080
The profitability of the building is extremely low.

89
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,290
Also, the potential for other development or favorable factors is unclear.

90
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,650
Attorney Lee, it's me.

91
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,540
Are you sure that building is actually worth investing in?

92
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,050
 Gosh, have you been lied to all your life? 

93
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,990
Trust me this once.

94
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,750
Attorney Lee, enough with the random talk.

95
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,680
When are you going to get back my money?

96
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,050
All this is to get your money back, President Choi.

97
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,280
Will you just watch someone take it?

98
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,480
You have to buy it with cash and register it within one week.

99
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,790
One week? And with a lump sum at that?

100
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,340
Yes, the timing is important for this investment.

101
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,050
Yeah, timing is important. It is important.

102
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,360
Then, you buy it, Attorney Lee.

103
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,840
I don't have that kind of money.

104
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,880
I'll lend you that money. If you're so confident,

105
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,560
you buy the building yourself.

106
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,290
Fine, lend me the money.

107
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,280
I'll buy it. I'll purchase it.

108
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,340
It seems you are really sure about it.

109
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,940
In return, I have a favor to ask you.

110
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,420
 What favor? 

111
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,610
I need to put Park Hui Jun in a difficult position while in prison.

112
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,910
 Will that be too difficult for you, too? 

113
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,590
That much I can do.

114
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,990
How difficult do I have to make it for him?

115
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,930
Gosh, this bastard! Seriously.

116
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,650
Hey! Watch where you're going!

117
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,260
Gosh, seriously.

118
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,500
What did you say, you bastard? Hey.

119
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,800
You're the one who tripped me.

120
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,950
Apologize. Hurry up and apologize, you bastard.

121
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,520
Apologize?

122
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,760
Eat this, man.

123
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,800
You asshole.

124
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,890
You think I'll just take this?

125
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,850
You're dead, you're dead!

126
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,860
Let go, let go!

127
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,760
You're dead!

128
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,100
He picked a fight with me first.

129
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,770
Lock him up! Lock him up!

130
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm telling the truth! I'm telling the truth!

131
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,160
Protect your precious family from pests.

132
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,350
Bringing justice by exterminating pests,

133
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,610
Killer Killer.

134
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,100
Cut, that's good. We'll take the next cut.

135
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,300
Director, let's take a 10-minute break first.

136
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,070
I might die while trying to kill a mosquito.

137
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay, let's take a 10-minute break.

138
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,910
Thank you.

139
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,640
Oh, thanks.

140
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,260
Eonni, your coffee truck is here.

141
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,170
- For me?
 - Yes, for you.

142
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,130
Who sent it?

143
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,680
I don't know. Maybe it's from your fan club?

144
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,660
You should go check it out quickly.

145
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,610
- Thank you for the coffee.
 - Enjoy.

146
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,930
   

147
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,970
Thank you.

148
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,270
Gosh, I must really be popular these days!

149
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,920
You like the coffee truck the chairman sent,

150
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,150
right?

151
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,430
Here, we even had the sticker especially made.

152
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,210
Pink!

153
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,340
Great work, everyone. Aren't you having some coffee?

154
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,640
Why would that moron send me a coffee truck?

155
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,180
Probably giving you a chance to enjoy things for the last time.

156
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,350
- Last time?
 - Yes.

157
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,400
You gained popularity as Justice Girl

158
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,990
but if people find out about your school bullying,

159
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,060
what do you think would happen?

160
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,910
School bullying?

161
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,100
School bullying.

162
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,070
   

163
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,780
- Do you know who she is?
 - No, I don't.

164
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,120
She knows you, though.

165
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,530
She was in your class during high school,

166
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,710
and she remembers the time you slapped her across the face as if it were yesterday.

167
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,370
What are you trying to do here?

168
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,100
I'm threatening you.

169
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,310
You became famous as Justice Girl,

170
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,970
yet what would happen when people find out you were once a school bully?

171
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,220
I was not a school bully but rather a victim.

172
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,010
I have a pretty face and a nice body,

173
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,890
my family was wealthy, and my grades...

174
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,230
Okay, my grades were a bit lacking.

175
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,840
But everyone was jealous and envious of me.

176
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,670
The facts are not relevant here.

177
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,240
Even small things can become a big deal if we try.

178
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,510
And I have the power to make something small into a big deal.

179
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,870
I'm giving you one last chance for our old time's sake.

180
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,620
What do you want?

181
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,980
First, drop the charges.

182
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,680
Also,

183
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,300
if you don't want to be branded as a school bully

184
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,000
and ostracized by society, bring Attorney Lee Han Sin...

185
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,680
Bring that bastard to me.

186
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,120
Ms. Choi!

187
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,020
Attorney, Attorney!

188
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,420
Yes, welcome.

189
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,180
Attorney Lee, I'm in big trouble.

190
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,230
What's wrong?

191
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,210
He's trying to frame me as a school bully and have me ostracized for good.

192
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,330
I see.

193
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,950
Why aren't you surprised at all?

194
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,800
First, please have a seat.

195
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,980
- What...
 - Ms. Choi, over here.

196
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,490
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

197
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,300
It's okay.

198
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,000
I expected Chairman Ji Dong Man to act like this.

199
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,580
Then what do I do now?

200
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,070
You should drop the charges.

201
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,950
What?

202
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:04,060
I didn't think we'd be able to hold back Chairman Ji Dong Man for long with this anyway.

203
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,620
Seriously.

204
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,690
Do you have anything more to say?

205
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,040
Well,

206
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,690
Attorney Lee, could you meet with him just once?

207
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,990
I can't have you become a school bully,

208
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,730
so I'll meet with him.

209
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,350
Also, I was planning to meet him at some point anyway.

210
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,150
Attorney, thank you so much.

211
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,220
I'll never forget this.

212
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,210
H-Hey, Ms. Choi...

213
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,380
b-by chance, you weren't really a school bully, right?

214
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,910
Seriously? I wouldn't hit or bully anyone!

215
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,790
The food you used to prepare for me tasted best.

216
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Attorney Lee, why did you do it?

217
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,760
I already...

218
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,950
told you the reason.

219
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,120
You stopped my parole release because I lacked remorse?

220
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,040
Let's talk openly.

221
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,840
I kept thinking about it.

222
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,300
Is it money you really want?

223
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,450
How much do you want?

224
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,830
How much will you give me?

225
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,300
Should I increase your sentence by three years for offering bribery?

226
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,850
If you keep running wild without fear,

227
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,170
you could end up dead.

228
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,440
You don't seem very scared.

229
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,620
Then how about this?

230
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,300
The people around you may get hurt.

231
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,620
Inspector An Seo Yun, whom you brought to the review.

232
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,580
Would you be okay if she got hurt because of you?

233
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,050
Seeing how you are still threatening me instead of having remorse,

234
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,440
as I expected,

235
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,520
I made the right choice to stop your parole release, Chairman.

236
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,040
If you have nothing more to say, I'll be going.

237
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,390
You're quite busy these days.

238
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,620
Won't you be included in the parole examination list again

239
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,690
once Actress Choi Won Mi drops her charges?

240
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,720
To stop your parole release again,

241
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,740
wouldn't I have to move diligently?

242
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,580
All right, then.

243
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,280
Yes, hello?
    

244
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,290
Attorney Lee, where are you?

245
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,610
I'm in front of your office, but you aren't here.

246
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,500
Oh, yes.

247
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,030
I am outside for a moment.

248
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,850
What brings you to my office all of a sudden? Is something up?

249
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,420
I'm the type who needs to finish what I've started.

250
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,020
Pardon?

251
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,740
I was curious if you found the illegal proceeds.

252
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,800
Oh, well, if you're curious, come to the place from last time.

253
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,710
By that place, you mean...

254
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,720
Why did you ask me to come all the way here again?

255
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,890
So, we can buy the building.

256
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,200
What?

257
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,520
You're going to buy the building?

258
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,510
Wow, Attorney Lee, I guess you have a lot of money.

259
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,050
No, you got it wrong.

260
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,410
I'm going to buy it with the loaned money.

261
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,250
Still...

262
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,990
Oh, she's here.

263
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,550
I borrowed money from her.

264
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,060
Hello.

265
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,240
President Choi of Jongro...

266
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,290
Are you two acquainted?

267
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,730
She's an infamously vicious loan shark.

268
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,110
Hey! Watch your mouth!

269
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,020
How dare you call me a vicious loan shark!

270
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,970
Attorney Lee, who is this woman that she's being so rude?

271
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,900
Well, she's...

272
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,200
Nice to meet you.
    

273
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,620
Cop...

274
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,560
There are better titles, such as financial sector workers.

275
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,890
It's upsetting if you call me a vicious loan shark.

276
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,620
Attorney Lee Han Sin, I'm extremely disappointed in you.

277
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,340
How could you borrow such tainted money?

278
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,720
You keep speaking harshly.

279
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,260
There's no such thing as clean or tainted money! Money is money!

280
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,540
Please calm down, ladies.

281
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,570
Let's not do this here. Let's go inside and talk about this over a meal.

282
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,050
I don't partner with criminals.

283
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,500
I don't eat with cops, either!

284
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,520
Open the door!

285
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,490
Forty billion won!

286
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,030
Recovery of illegal proceeds.

287
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,850
Oh, I got the Paulownia card!

288
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,540
Paulownia, it's a Paulownia card.

289
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,090
Is anyone here?

290
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,930
We're closed.

291
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,770
You're the police from last time.

292
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,520
What's this? Who are you guys?

293
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,720
What's going on?

294
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
Why are you doing this?

295
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,240
Have the two of you already come by here?

296
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,260
Well, buying a building is a big investment.

297
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,370
I came to check out the building before purchasing it.

298
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,660
Purchase?

299
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,600
Ahjumma, they're all nice guys, so you don't need to get scared.

300
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,800
- Is business going well? 
 - Not too bad.

301
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,920
You didn't have any customers. And I heard the food here is terrible.

302
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,870
Don't you feel bad selling such terrible food for money?

303
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,650
It seems like your lease is almost up.

304
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,890
How about you close your business now and leave?

305
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,950
Wait, you can't just tell her to leave without even giving her key money.

306
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,300
Inspector, she will give her key money.

307
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,750
She'll also pay a premium on top of that.

308
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,640
P-Premium?

309
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,910
Gosh, no, I can't.

310
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,460
My son said I can't close the business.

311
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,400
Assistant Baek.

312
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,200
What do you think?

313
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,310
Will you sell your restaurant if I pay you this much?

314
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,120
Gosh, no wonder I got Paulownia cards.

315
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,230
   

316
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,910
Oh, Attorney!

317
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,040
Seriously...

318
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,290
I guess you're happy to see me now.

319
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,540
Attorney, let me ask you for a favor.

320
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,730
Let me make one phone call.

321
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,370
I'm not supposed to let you use a phone.

322
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,430
Just once, please! I'll hang up right away.

323
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,250
It'll be quick. It'll be short.

324
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,100
Well then,

325
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,590
I'm going to go to the bathroom,

326
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,410
so make it quick, okay?

327
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,300
Thank you. Thank you, Attorney.

328
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,900
Wait, the password.

329
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,700
Ah, yes.

330
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,530
Oh, thank you.

331
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,270
Hyeongnim! Gosh!

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
Today is my day!

333
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,020
I should've used that machine first.

334
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,960
I should hurry up and try to win.

335
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,360
- Who is it!
 - Who else, man?

336
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,490
- It's me, Park Hui Jun.
 - Yes.

337
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,990
 Hey, I don't have time to explain everything, so listen to me carefully. 

338
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,860
Move everything in the restaurant to another location.

339
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,540
Does Bong Su know about this, too?

340
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,750
No! Don't tell Bong Su! He's a traitor!

341
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,390
- But─
  - Dong Myeong, Dong Myeong. 

342
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,470
I'll make sure to compensate you well.

343
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,020
Is double what I promised you good?

344
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,060
When do I need to move it by?

345
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,310
All right, move it as soon as you can.

346
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,900
You should move it to...

347
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,670
You know the place I told you last time, right?

348
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,290
Not there, man!

349
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,310
Yeah, yeah, there, there.

350
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,780
G-Go right now! Now!

351
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,770
All right.

352
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,850
   

353
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,950
Damn it, I picked the wrong day!

354
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,010
Where did this ahjumma go instead of running her business?

355
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,760
Why did you close already?

356
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,430
What?

357
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,660
Why would you sell your business?

358
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,100
Mom, are you crazy?

359
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,140
Hang up for now.

360
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,910
Shit, what a headache.

361
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,270
- What are you doing?
 - Geez, you scared me!

362
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,500
Ahjumma, mind your own business and keep moving.

363
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,380
Hey, I want to mind my own business, too,

364
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,550
but this involves me, so I can't just move on.

365
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,360
Ahjumma, have you gone mad?

366
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,810
You asshole. Seriously?

367
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,390
Asshole.

368
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,810
Who do you think you're talking to, you asshole!

369
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,000
This building will soon become mine, you bastard.

370
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,030
How dare you crawl into my building like a rat?

371
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,150
How could I just walk on and ignore you?

372
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,020
Do you want to get beat up and go, or just get lost?

373
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,060
I'll just get lost. Yes.

374
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,570
Goodbye.

375
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,460
   

376
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,720
   

377
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,150
Attention. Salute!

378
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,500
Ready front!

379
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,820
Director, what brings you here without giving us a call?

380
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,440
- Prison Warden Bae.
 - Yes.

381
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,210
Did you commit a crime?

382
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,730
No, sir.

383
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,250
Prison Warden Bae, you come with me. The rest can attend to your duties.

384
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,760
Yes, sir.

385
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,940
All right, you can disperse.

386
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,780
Come this way.

387
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,400
   

388
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,130
Yes.

389
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,390
Geez.

390
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:21,120
I mean, is my office a visitation room or something?

391
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,510
I finished talking with the parole examiners.

392
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,840
You should pass the review without any problems.

393
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,110
Thank you for your hard work.

394
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,690
You have to keep your promise.

395
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,200
Of course.

396
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,170
Hey, you bastard!

397
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,650
What did you do all this time?

398
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,760
I didn't know, either!

399
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,020
The landlady for the building changed to some weird bitch,

400
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,000
but she gave my mom a huge sum as key money with a premium and told her to leave quickly.

401
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,060
She said she lost it momentarily because it was so much money.

402
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,620
I'm sorry, Hyeongnim.

403
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,000
Give me a second.

404
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,850
Whoa, things are getting more and more twisted.

405
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,530
Hyeongnim, what should we do now?

406
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,010
What do you mean?

407
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:25,460
We need to get the goods from there, no matter what it takes.

408
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,960
Hey, ask Sang Su to gather all the guys and go.

409
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,170
- Okay.
 - Hey, Dong Myeong.

410
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,140
No matter what... You have to get it out, no matter what, okay?

411
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,740
Okay!

412
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,190
You must be tired, making the trip here.

413
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,030
No problem.

414
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,960
Sit.

415
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,800
My ex-wife will soon drop the charges.

416
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,010
That's great.

417
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,280
Then, you will be placed on the parole examination list again,

418
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,140
and you will soon be released.

419
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,170
But that guy keeps getting on my nerves.

420
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,660
You know, Attorney Lee Han Sin, who stopped my parole release.

421
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,410
I'm anxious because I don't know what he might be up to this time.

422
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,360
So, I want to kick him out. Is there a way to do that?

423
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,050
Are you saying you want Attorney Lee Han Sin dismissed as a parole examiner?

424
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,910
Is that possible?

425
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,690
Once someone is appointed as a parole examiner, it's difficult to dismiss them.

426
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,560
There has to be a tough situation where he can't perform his duties to be dismissed.

427
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,480
A tough situation where he can't perform his duties?

428
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,680
Hello!

429
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,460
What are all those thugs?

430
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,740
Get them!

431
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,280
♫  One shot, turn the tables, ahead of the scammers  ♫

432
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,960
♫  One shot, what a life. Thanks to villains, back on the game  ♫

439

440

441
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,480
♫  One shot, one shot on the game  ♫

442
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,990
Ahjumma!

443
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,350
How dare you crawl into my building like a rat!

444
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,320
President Choi, calm down.

445
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,110
And it's still my building.

446
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,900
Article 319 of the Criminal Act states home intrusion is

447
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,180
punishable by law, up to three years in prison, and/or a fine of up to five million won.

448
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,350
Inspector, what are you doing? You should carry out the law.

449
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,450
You bastard!

450
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,930
Gosh, she's so cool.

451
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,310
She's pretty good.

452
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,960
Freeze!

453
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,420
Come without a fuss while I tell you nicely.

454
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,240
None of you move!

455
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,470
You bastards! Stop right there!

456
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,500
Come here, you bastard!

457
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,530
No!

458
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,660
Hey, the ahjumma hit me!

459
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,850
I got hit!

460
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,710
Seeing how they tried so hard to come in here,

461
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:14,380
there has to be something in this restaurant.

462
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,140
How will you find the illegal proceeds that are supposedly hidden in this building?

463
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,530
That's what I'm saying!

464
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,570
You shouldn't have taken that guy away.

465
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,750
It would've been quick if we tortured him and made him talk.

466
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,050
Torture is illegal.

467
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,020
But it is also the most effective method.

468
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,220
But thanks to you-know-who, we blew our chance to use the most effective method.

469
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,920
So, let's just use a primitive method.

470
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,890
What you're saying is that there are 40 billion won

471
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,350
in here. Right?

472
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,890
Assistant Baek, just destroy everything.

473
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,560
Hey, wait!

474
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,190
Attorney Lee, do you have a better plan?

475
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,200
Well, it's not that I have a better plan─

476
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,600
You don't, but?

477
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,250
I'm just not sure about destroying my building like this.

478
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,640
Let's think about it a little longer.

479
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,860
I don't think we'll find an answer, though.

480
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,010
And this building will become mine anyway.

481
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,990
Assistant Baek, destroy it!

482
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,320
Hey, hey, wait!

483
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,070
Oh! The violation of origin labeling!

484
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,480
Attorney, why would you bring that up now?

485
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,280
It's different from what she said last time.

486
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,930
 I received a complaint about a violation of origin labeling. 

487
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,520
 Gosh, it's not true. 

488
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,160
 I personally make my own kimchi 

489
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,240
 and I only use soybean paste, which I make myself. 

490
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,870
She said she uses soybean paste she made,

491
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,690
but as you can see, she's using commercially made soybean paste.

492
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,190
Then, where's the soybean paste she made herself?

493
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,740
Attorney Lee!

494
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,160
Why are you suddenly talking about soybean paste?

495
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,960
I just got a hunch.

496
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,160
A hunch? What kind of hunch?

497
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,010
A hunch that soybean paste is really important.

498
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,620
Gosh, seriously.

499
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,120
Why are we going up here again?

500
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,070
Come on.

501
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,390
I mean, what's up on the rooftop that it's locked up?

502
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,380
Please give me the hammer.

503
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,640
You found the soybean paste as you wished.

504
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,180
Congrats.

505
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,650
Will you run a restaurant now that you found the soybean paste?

506
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,940
Isn't it weird?

507
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,830
What?

508
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,910
She had this much soybean paste she made, yet she's been using commercially made ones.

509
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,790
Well, I suppose so, but...

510
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,020
Attorney Lee, wh-what are you doing right now?

511
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,020
What did I tell you?

512
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,590
I told you this building's value will skyrocket!

513
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,150
Around this much should be good, right?

514
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,740
Wait a minute. No.

515
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,540
Is it too little? One more?

516
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,870
No, take one out.

517
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,490
Why are you telling me to take one out?

518
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,210
This is a lot more than the amount you were scammed.

519
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,580
- Attorney Lee.
 - Yes?

520
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,710
Don't you know there's interest?

521
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,080
You should be grateful to get your original investment back.

522
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,060
What are you two doing right now?

523
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,100
Don't you know that illegal proceeds are to be returned to the national treasury?

524
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,340
- Nonsense! I found this in my building. It's my money!
 - Hello? Yes, Mr. Hwang.

525
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,030
You found her?

526
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,870
 Please stop this! There's a child here. 

527
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,950
Attorney Lee, I did find her,

528
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,850
but it's a mess here with loan sharks.

529
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,890
You need to hurry over.

530
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,520
Oh, okay.

531
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,100
Six. You know how to count to ten, right, Mr. Kim?

532
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,270
Inspector, please come with me somewhere.

533
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,030
Go where?

534
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,200
I'll explain on the way.

535
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,960
Please come with me for now.

536
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,670
I'll repeat. These illegal proceeds are to be returned to the national treasury.

537
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,730
What are you saying?

538
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,010
Attorney Lee, where are you going?

539
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,530
Attorney Lee.

540
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,900
What happened?

541
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,730
The loan sharks barged in and destroyed everything in the store

542
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,900
and left this mess.

543
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,050
They all ran away when the police were about to arrive.

544
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,700
She's inside.

545
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,560
Okay.

546
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,000
Could you tell me what happened?

547
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,160
Well...

548
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,490
I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.

549
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,190
I'm asking to see if I can help in any way.

550
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,790
This is clearly an illegal debt collection.

551
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,950
If we arrived a little sooner, I could've put them all away in jail.

552
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,800
If you put them away in jail, would it resolve the matter?

553
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,250
Even if you were to arrest all those guys,

554
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,560
there will be more like them.

555
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,320
Will you go and intervene every time that happens?

556
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,370
- That's true, but...
 - That snack bar owner

557
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:39,170
was a victim of Jungbong Holdings investment fraud.

558
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,490
Before her husband, Jo Seong Hyeon got caught up in that scam,

559
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,240
they were an ordinary family.

560
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,190
After he lost all of his investment money

561
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,680
and got into an accident,

562
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,830
they faced extreme financial hardship.

563
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,810
 Excuse me, let me take a look at your bag. 

564
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,670
 I'm sorry! Forgive me this once! 

565
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,610
Her husband was arrested for subsistence theft

566
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:26,090
and lived as if he gave up on life thereafter.

567
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,700
In the end, an ordinary family was destroyed.

568
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,900
Like you said, Inspector,

569
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,030
illegal proceeds should be returned to the national treasury. However,

570
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,020
the process of returning illegal proceeds

571
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,260
recovered by the state treasury to the victims is very challenging.

572
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,580
Even after going through complicated legal procedures like filing a compensation claim,

573
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,060
it is often dismissed, and it takes a very long time.

574
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,350
Haven't you seen it for yourself, Inspector?

575
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,430
Do you think Jo Seong Hyeon's wife

576
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,370
will be able to hold on

577
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,970
and wait until then?

578
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,340
Then, are you saying we should

579
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,450
give the illegal proceeds to the victims, Attorney Lee?

580
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,470
Seonbae, where are you going?

581
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,130
I need to stop by somewhere.

582
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,300
Hyeong, is something wrong with the inspector?

583
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,090
I don't know.

584
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,580
Why does she look so serious?

585
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,450
Hey, business is done for the day!

586
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,040
Leave, leave!

587
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,800
Those thugs...

588
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,550
Ahjumma, what are you doing? Leave.

589
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,500
Don't cry. It's okay.

590
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,620
Ahjumma, you shouldn't lie to your child.

591
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,650
What do you mean, it's okay?

592
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,120
Kid, listen up.

593
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,130
If your mom doesn't pay back, you'll become an orphan.

594
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,740
You know what an orphan is, right?

595
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,950
Mommy.

596
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,250
Young lady, the store is closed. Leave.

597
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,530
I said leave.

598
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,200
You asshole, how can you say that to a child?

599
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,560
What's up with you?

600
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
You bastard!

601
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,930
Seriously, these bastards!

602
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,510
So Eun, that was scary, huh? I'm sorry.

603
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,780
You must be scared, ma'am.

604
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,500
So Eun, things will be okay, as your mom said.

605
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,780
Things will be all right.

606
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,680
Attorney Lee, don't you get greedy?

607
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,780
Greedy?

608
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,080
To be blunt, that money has no owner right now.

609
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,220
No one would know even if you took it all.

610
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,210
It's not money without an owner.

611
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,460
It should be returned to its rightful owners.

612
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,620
You're handsome.

613
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,820
- Yes, Inspector.
 - That really hurts!

614
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,370
Stop overreacting, damn it.

615
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,100
- It really does hurt!
 - Shut up!

616
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,000
Yes, sorry about that, Attorney Lee.

617
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,540
I made up my mind.

618
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm not interested in the recovery of illegal proceeds.

619
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,720
I didn't see anything.

620
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,420
Yes.

621
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,450
Auntie! Bye!

622
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,180
Bye, So Eun.

623
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,810
What did she say?

624
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:07,000
She said she's not interested in the recovery of illegal proceeds.

625
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,530
Then, let's get started.

626
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,480
There are many victims who desperately need this money.

627
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,400
 With all the members present, we will start the monthly parole examination 

628
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,200
 committee meeting for December 2024. 

629
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,810
 Next, there was a request from the victim to observe 

630
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,750
 and provide testimony regarding the candidate needing careful review. 

631
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:46,240
In accordance with procedure, we will summon the candidate

632
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,200
and proceed with the victim's observation and testimony.

633
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,780
Ms. Cha Yeong Hui, you requested to observe and give testimony, right?

634
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,230
You may give your testimony now.

635
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,610
I am a mother of a child.

636
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,930
Though our family wasn't well-off,

637
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:17,420
 we lived a happy life loving each other. 

638
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,800
 But... 

639
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,800
 after my husband got caught up in the Junbong Holdings investment fraud, 

640
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,510
 I lost... 

641
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,120
 my husband who was so loving 

642
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,320
 and diligent, taking care of our family. 

643
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,420
And I lost my happy family as well.

644
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,650
All...

645
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,240
because of this man!

646
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,030
Because of him,

647
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:59,240
my happy family became miserable.

648
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,260
So...

649
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,120
please make sure this man isn't released on parole.

650
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,780
Please make sure he pays the full price of his crime.

651
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,090
As you all know, Candidate 64 is one of the two perpetrators

652
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,620
of Junbong Holdings investment fraud, which resulted in countless victims.

653
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,230
In addition to the witness present today,

654
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:42,640
countless victims and their families are still living every day in pain

655
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,880
without any relief from the harm they had suffered.

656
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,270
Well, I've settled with a few of the victims.

657
00:46:54,850 --> 00:47:00,390
You settled with a portion of the victims to be reclassified as a general offender.

658
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,900
And these are the petitions written by victims,

659
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,630
asking to stop the parole release of Candidate 64.

660
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,440
   

661
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,280
 Thank you for your work. 

662
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,540
 This is a list of the victims' names and their losses. 

663
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,980
 Oh, okay. 

664
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,310
 And these are the petitions you asked for. 

665
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,100
 Thank you. 

666
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,580
 Did all the victims submit their petitions here? 

667
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,250
 All except for five people wrote and submitted their petitions. 

668
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,990
 Why didn't those five people submit theirs? 

669
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,960
 The thing is... 

670
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,530
As you can tell from the petitions, Candidate 64

671
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:21,620
still has yet to be forgiven by his victims.

672
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:28,750
Thus, I am against the parole release of Candidate 64.

673
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:34,970
Taking into account that Candidate 64 is a large-scale financial fraud offender,

674
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,980
he was classified as needing careful review.

675
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,710
First, let me give you my opinion.

676
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,410
Because Candidate 64 has fully paid the restitution fee and the fines,

677
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,800
and we have received petitions for leniency on his behalf,

678
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,640
I give him a qualified opinion.

679
00:48:53,930 --> 00:49:00,220
Taking into account how Candidate 64 is preparing to work in carpentry after his release,

680
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,050
I also give him a qualified opinion.

681
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:06,760
I give him a disqualified opinion.

682
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,410
He's an offender who committed large-scale financial fraud for his personal gain.

683
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,760
Taking into account how it involved an accomplice,

684
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,790
I give him a disqualified opinion.

685
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,490
Examiner Jeong Wuk, have you not decided yet?

686
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:44,150
 So, I'm sure you didn't just come here for a visit, Attorney Lee. 

687
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,330
 What brings you here? 

688
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,240
 Regarding Kim Bong Su... 

689
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,650
 I heard he's dirt poor after spending all the investment he got through fraud. 

690
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:01,350
 I just wonder where he'll get the money 

691
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,900
 to get me a new office. 

692
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,400
 CEO Kim Bong Su isn't the type to change his mind. 

693
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,830
 Well, I'm sure that's true, 

694
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:15,040
 but won't he need to have the money to keep his promise? 

695
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,830
 Pardon? 

696
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,330
 It's probably true he hid the illegal proceeds, but... 

697
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,710
 that's no longer Kim Bong Su's money. 

698
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,830
 I heard their fund manager, Lee Dong Myeong, ran off with all the money. 

699
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,800
 Is that true? 

700
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,980
 Yes! 

701
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,380
 We can't receive the money we were promised. 

702
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,460
 Is there a reason for us to keep our promise? 

703
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,270
My opinion is...

704
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,150
that of a disqualified opinion.

705
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:55,000
I considered the prisoner's poor attitude

706
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,760
and multiple previous convictions for similar fraud offenses.

707
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,290
What's with you?

708
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,690
This isn't what we promised!

709
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,640
Hey, do you know me?

710
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,030
What? Yeah, I do.

711
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,320
You think I don't know?

712
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,530
Gosh, that scamming bastard!

713
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,880
Chairman, what are you doing? Hurry up and decide.

714
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,590
After gathering the examiners' opinions, we have two qualified and three disqualified opinions.

715
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,710
Candidate 64 is deemed disqualified for parole.

716
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,760
We will conclude our meeting.

717
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,520
H-Hey, wait a minute.

718
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,340
Hey, get over here! This isn't what you promised!

719
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,590
Shut up! Be quiet, you evil bastard.

720
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,560
What, evil? Come over here!

721
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,660
Let me go for a second!

722
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,490
Damn it.

723
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,840
Weird, right?

724
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,240
You can't figure out what's happening here, right?

725
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,550
What did you do?

726
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,870
He learned that you can't keep your promise.

727
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:57,600
What bullshit are you spewing?

728
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,120
Jangju Restaurant.

729
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,510
I found your hidden illegal proceeds there.

730
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:09,990
You little...

731
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,540
Hey, where's that money?

732
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,690
Where is that money right now?

733
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:29,640
 Please make sure to share this with all of the Junbong Holdings victims. 

734
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,390
 Money, it's money! 

735
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,330
♫  You're a megalomaniac  ♫

736
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:40,290
♫  You don’t deserve what you own now  ♫

737
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,810
♫  You can push me away and try to hold me off   ♫

738
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,700
♫  It won't work on me, Megalomaniac  ♫

739
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,130
 Bye! Thank you! 

740
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,300
 What, pardon? 

741
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,290
 Really? 

742
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,590
 Thank you. Thank you. 

743
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:01,530
 What should I do now? 

744
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,910
 Oh, yes. Aigoo, okay. 

745
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,630
 Thank you, God! 

746
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,720
 Aigoo, thank you so much! 

747
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,650
 Thank you, God! 

748
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,210
Didn't you say you already spent all the money?

749
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:21,780
Stop the bullshit!

750
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,300
Hey, do you know what kind of money that is? Bring it to me.

751
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,130
What did you do with my money, you asshole!

752
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,600
Someone told me

753
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,720
that it's blind money with no owner.

754
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,410
You bastard!

755
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,790
Are you okay, Examiner Lee?

756
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,330
Let go of me!

757
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,160
Hey, bring me my money right now!

758
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,300
Bring it to me!

759
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,700
Assaulting a parole examiner has been added.

760
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,180
Not only are you not getting paroled,

761
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,230
your sentence will also be increased.

762
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,520
What are you all doing? Hurry up and take him away!

763
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,670
You! I won't let you get away with this.

764
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:56,260
I'll kill you!

765
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,630
I'll kill you, you bastard!

766
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,980
Let go of me!

767
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,370
 Get over here, you bastard! 

768
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,950
Oh, i-it's okay.

769
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,400
 Kind people have returned our money. 

770
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,930
 The snack bar is doing well, too, so don't worry. 

771
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,010
Do we have to come all this way to eat tteokbokki?

772
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,700
Just shut up and follow me.

773
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,910
We're going to have kimbap for lunch, all right?

774
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,290
- Okay.
 - Oh, hello!

775
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:48,510
Hello! Please come in.

776
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,010
 So Eun misses you a lot, Honey. 

777
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,410
 You just have to return to us. 

778
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:59,550
 Let's forget about what's past and start anew. 

779
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,740
Thank you.

780
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,280
Gosh, this is daebak. 
    

781
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,810
Who would've known an exit ramp would be built here?

782
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,980
The price of this building jumped in value.

783
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,200
I heard you bought this building for one billion won (~$1 million).

784
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,000
Someone wants it for two billion won.

785
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,050
Sir, let's talk next time.

786
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,800
I'll give you a call.

787
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,800
- Yes, please give me a call!
 - Sure.

788
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,480
Did you know already, Attorney Lee?

789
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,630
I didn't know.

790
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,550
You really didn't know?

791
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,540
Maybe I was blessed because I did a good deed.

792
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,290
Attorney Lee, you've got money fortune as well.

793
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,520
President Choi, why are you so happy looking at my building?

794
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,530
Since it'll become my building soon.

795
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,410
Do you have money to pay the interest?

796
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,630
Once I sell the building─

797
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,220
This building won't sell.

798
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,300
If my boys hang out here and cause a scene here,

799
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,300
do you think the building will sell or not?

800
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,860
What, you think I won't do it?

801
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:26,590
No, I'm sure you're more than capable of that.

802
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,740
Okay, let's do that then.

803
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Seriously? You'll hand over this building to me just like that?

804
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,960
But under one condition.

805
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,180
Subtract the original loan and the interest and spend the profits from the sale on a good deed.

806
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,100
Then, I wouldn't have any for myself!

807
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,110
You just saw that you will be blessed when you do good deeds.

808
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,550
Deal!

809
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,290
Really? You'll do it just like that?

810
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:58,320
Yeah. I thought of a good idea to make much more money.

811
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,770
What is that?

812
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,890
- Attorney Lee.
 - Attorney Lee?

813
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:04,180
You. Attorney Lee.

814
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,420
Not only are you handsome and smart,

815
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,520
you even have money fortune. I like you so─

816
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,300
Goodness, Attorney Lee!

817
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,230
Wait for me, Attorney Lee.

818
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:19,060
I like you. Don't worry.

819
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,440
   

820
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,370
I wondered why that bastard did that.

821
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:46,420
I couldn't understand it, no matter how much I tried.

822
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,200
But now I understand.

I'm really innocent! 

830
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:07,660
 - Yang Bok Gyu insisted on his innocence before attempting suicide.
 - No! 

831
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,450
 Do you have any guesses as to why? 

832
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:13,020
 The company is small and struggling, but the CEO is draped in luxury goods. 

833
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,230
 It's Choi Jeong Hak. His phone turned on! 

834
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,520
 Attorney Lee, I'm in big trouble! 

835
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,410
 Why would you get scared about that when you're a professor who knows the law so well? 

836
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,050
 Let me introduce you to a guest. 

837
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,300
 - Hello.
 - He was with another person? 

838
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,490
 Do you think you're still alive because you're lucky? 

839
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,450
 I told you, human lives are trivial. 

840
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:33,510
 That's why I'll see it to the end.
