1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,715
-These belong to my daughter!
-Are you sure?

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,008
This is her handwriting
and drawing.

3
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:09,677
Are you the owner
of this house?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,303
It's my mother's. Why?

5
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,014
Have you seen a woman
with a kid around here?

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,933
My mother lived here alone.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,309
My daughter is here.

8
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,146
She probably got scared
when she saw the cops.

9
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,939
I'm sure she's just
here somewhere.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,107
Grace?

11
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,818
Grace! Grace!

12
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,819
Anna.

13
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,529
Ma, I need your help.

14
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,114
How much did you
ask from Mama?

15
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,116
Who is this?

16
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,200
Mama.

17
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,535
That's your kid?

18
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,786
How?

19
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,916
Don't yell at my mother!

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,626
Stay out of this.

21
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,336
The adults are talking.

22
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,005
Can you leave the kid
out of it?

23
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,798
Why didn't you tell us, huh?

24
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,261
Is that kid the reason
why you hid from us for years?

25
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,514
Who's the father?

26
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,933
Who?!

27
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,518
You don't want to talk?

28
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,520
You! Who's your father?!

29
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,898
Hey, don't take it out on the kid!

30
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,487
Princess?

31
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,116
Princess, what's happening?

32
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,329
Wait, wait. Just stay here.

33
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,706
Don't go out. Close the door, okay?

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,459
I'll take you
to the hospital. Come on!

35
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,462
My baby...

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,888
Wait for us outside.

37
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,145
I wish you would've...

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,983
called so I know
that you're coming.

39
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,903
If my friend,
who owns this hotel,

40
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,031
hadn't told us you're here,

41
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,950
we wouldn't have known.

42
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,204
I didn't want to bother you,
Aunt Monica.

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,291
And I won't be here long.

44
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,586
I'm just here to cover a story.

45
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,506
You don't have
to leave right away.

46
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,302
You always have a place here.

47
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,387
Really?

48
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,599
Aunt Monica,
do you agree with this?

49
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,310
You know, Julius...

50
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,896
we didn't see eye to eye before.

51
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,982
But now, I want you to know

52
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,859
that I accept you.

53
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,821
I welcome your existence
in my and Edgardo's life.

54
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,573
So you've reconciled yourself...

55
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,034
because he has
an illegitimate child?

56
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,161
Hmm. Yes.

57
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,790
Tell me the truth.

58
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,376
Why are you here?

59
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,047
The campaign
is fast approaching.

60
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,967
We need someone
with your media experience.

61
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,511
And I would like it

62
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,431
if you take my position.

63
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,100
We've talked
about this many times.

64
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,811
I have no interest in politics.

65
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,148
But it's in your blood.

66
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,234
Can't run away from who you are.

67
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,611
I'm a journalist.

68
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,531
I expose the truth,
not cover it up.

69
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,327
Why? What do you
think of politics?

70
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,120
Covering up the truth?!

71
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,873
Isn't that what you do
with your corruption?

72
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,667
How dare you!

73
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,213
You drove me away
because I was a bastard!

74
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,007
And now you want me
to make peace with you?!

75
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,134
What else do you
want me to do, huh?!

76
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,512
I've introduced you to everyone.

77
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,348
-They know that you're my son.
-And what was that for?

78
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,059
What? That's all you have
to do to be a real father?!

79
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,481
I'm sorry, Governor Edgardo.

80
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,193
I still have a lot to do.

81
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,494
Charlie?

82
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,081
Yes, I've called Erin.

83
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,877
Princess is still inside
with the doctor.

84
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,894
Hey.

85
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:15,315
What are you doing there?
We have guests.

86
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,525
Uh...

87
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,818
Okay, I'll tend to them.

88
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,529
I need to get something
from there too. I'll be back.

89
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,801
Hey--

90
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,892
Anna!

91
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,519
Anna.

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,361
Let's not push through
with the wedding.

93
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,616
Anna.

94
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,578
If you're thinking about
what happened to our baby...

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,413
I know you want to have a family.

96
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,165
I know you want to have children.

97
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,544
We want different things now.

98
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,509
Yes, I want to have children.

99
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,972
But we can try again.

100
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,648
Did I do something?

101
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,694
Or is there something
wrong with me?

102
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,993
No.

103
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,996
I'm the problem.

104
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,419
I don't know if it's right
to keep this relationship.

105
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,506
I don't know if I'm holding on to you
because you're there.

106
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,426
Julius, I know you want
a family,

107
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,720
and you want kids.
I can't give you that.

108
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,722
Is that hard to understand?

109
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,015
No.

110
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,183
No!

111
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,352
Anna, I won't let you
do this.

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,566
Give me a good reason.

113
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,484
I won't...

114
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,531
Anna, please.
Don't do this. Please.

115
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,991
Please.

116
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,703
I don't love you!

117
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,581
Isn't that reason enough?!

118
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,000
No.

119
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,793
I don't believe you.

120
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,921
I don't love you.

121
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,312
Tsk, she doesn't even
seem embarrassed.

122
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,022
Her child is missing,

123
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,941
yet she's out there
enjoying herself.

124
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,819
I told you, it's just all drama!

125
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,822
Acting like she's the star
of a soap opera.

126
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,910
That's because she doesn't
really care about her child.

127
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,913
She's pretending
just to get money.

128
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,331
Are you talking about me?

129
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,124
Oh, look, hit the mark.

130
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,709
-Guilty!
-Guilty!

131
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,963
What exactly is your problem?

132
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,714
I'm just minding my own business!

133
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,967
Wow, is that what you call
minding your own?

134
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,718
Strutting around?

135
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,388
You're trending,
you know that?

136
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,725
What? Still going to act
high and mighty?

137
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,727
-Here, watch this!
-Keep strutting!

138
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,104
So embarrassing.

139
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,486
-Hey, that's my phone!
-Hey!

140
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,196
Perhaps I should strut your face

141
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,906
so you can be the next trend.

142
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,199
That's enough!

143
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,909
Don't make a scene here!

144
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,412
-Go home, Sarah!
-They started it!

145
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,622
You're all a bunch of old hags!

146
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,791
arthritic, and dried out!

147
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
Oh.

148
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,008
What's this?

149
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,218
You got a hip problem
or something,

150
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,636
blocking the way?

151
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,138
-Ms Miranda.
-Can you leave?

152
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,431
Here's the script

153
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,598
Thank you.

154
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,100
Excuse me?

155
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,185
Ashley, let's run through
your lines.

156
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,604
-Come on, Ashley.
-Oh.

157
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,731
I'm so sorry,

158
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,899
I got too absorbed
watching this video.

159
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,402
I didn't notice
I was in the way, sorry.

160
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,280
Have you watched this,
Miss Miranda?

161
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,116
What is that, a new trend?

162
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,617
Like the "Nasty Girl" trend?

163
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,037
Miranda doesn't have
time for that.

164
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,581
Well, there really was
a nasty girl.

165
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,666
What are you talking about?

166
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,299
It's spreading
all over the internet.

167
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,722
Miranda.

168
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,890
Mr. Galvez.

169
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,601
Have you seen the video
going around?

170
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,728
She just watched it, Mr. Galvez.

171
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,271
And this--
have you seen this?

172
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,782
The indignity.

173
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,120
People are bashing NTV.

174
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,791
They're saying we're enabling
the mother of the missing child.

175
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,626
Especially you--

176
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,879
you put yourself on the line
by helping them.

177
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,507
You're now associated
with them.

178
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,885
Mr. Galvez,
I didn't know about this.

179
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,097
But you better fix this.

180
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,683
If this continues...

181
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,187
I don't know what will happen
to your show.

182
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,488
Have you felt anything
these past few days?

183
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,199
Um...

184
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,785
I've noticed
some light bleeding.

185
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,329
But it's just a little.

186
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,497
That's spotting,

187
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,541
you should have been
checked right away.

188
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,001
I didn't know.

189
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,797
Well, how's the baby?

190
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,632
Is my grandchild okay?

191
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,219
Unfortunately, Princess
suffered a miscarriage.

192
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,512
This is common,

193
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,973
especially during
the early stages of pregnancy.

194
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,517
What caused it?

195
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,935
We'll confirm with tests,

196
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,230
but 50% of miscarriages
are due to...

197
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,399
chromosomal abnormalities.

198
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:17,237
This happens by chance,
and no one is at fault.

199
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,782
There's nothing that could
have been done to prevent it.

200
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,285
I'll leave you for now.

201
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,415
Ma...

202
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,335
Mama, my baby can't be gone.

203
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,212
My baby--

204
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,882
My baby can't be gone, Ma.

205
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,683
You!

206
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,187
This is your fault!

207
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,982
Because of you,
my child is gone!

208
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,195
Princess, you heard
what the doctor said.

209
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,490
Even now, you still
won't admit it's your fault?

210
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,783
You won't stop, will you?

211
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,288
You won't stop until you've
destroyed this whole family!

212
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,082
First, Papa...

213
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,585
now my child!

214
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,379
You're a curse to this family.

215
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,882
Oh, and what now?

216
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,552
You're going to run away again?

217
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,098
You're going to abandon
your mess again?

218
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,018
I just don't want
your situation to worsen,

219
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,896
It's already been terrible,
Anna.

220
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:37,108
Ever since Papa died
because of you.

221
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,112
You abandoned us.

222
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,699
We relied on you,
but you left us.

223
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,326
What kind of sister are you?

224
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,702
Princess...

225
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,997
Princess, get some rest first.

226
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,585
Why don't you tell them why
things ended up this way, Anna?

227
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,381
Why we're fighting?
All your lies!

228
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,217
Why is it you get to have a child?

229
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,010
You don't deserve
to be a mother.

230
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,305
Why did my child have to die

231
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,516
because of the child
you're hiding?

232
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,311
Child?

233
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,403
Anna?

234
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,618
Do you have a child?

235
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,206
Anna, you don't have to hide it.

236
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,708
Why didn't you tell us?

237
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,710
Maybe because it's a bastard.

238
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,796
That's why you left us.

239
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,632
Just to fool around in Manila.

240
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,633
That's not true.

241
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,635
Then why are you ashamed
of your child?

242
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,805
Why didn't you tell us?

243
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,393
The child's already grown up,
why bring him here only now?

244
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,983
The child's already grown?

245
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,279
How old?

246
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,198
Mama is asking you!

247
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:10,910
Eight.

248
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,081
Eight?!

249
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,423
Miss Miranda.

250
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,799
What are you doing here?

251
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,635
Uh, I was worried because

252
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,803
you weren't answering
my calls, Ma'am.

253
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,515
After watching that video,
how do you expect me to react?

254
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,392
I'll explain.

255
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,394
What I watched was clear.

256
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,148
You're using my sympathy
to gain pity from people.

257
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,900
instead of looking
for your child,

258
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,318
you're out having fun.

259
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,111
That's not true, Miss Miranda.

260
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,407
You broke my trust.

261
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,577
Let's go.

262
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,794
Who's the father of the child?

263
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,800
Anna...

264
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,220
who is the child's father?

265
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,013
Ma...

266
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,016
I'll explain it to you in time.

267
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,197
Grace? Grace? Wake up.

268
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,408
We need to leave now.
Get ready.

269
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,952
Why? What's happening?

270
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,579
My family knows about you now.

271
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,331
Huh?

272
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,709
Are the cops looking for me?

273
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,838
No, but they think
you're my daughter.

274
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,590
They keep asking questions
I don't know how to answer.

275
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,012
Grace?

276
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,684
Are you okay?

277
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,606
We're leaving again?

278
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,192
Aren't you tired?

279
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,491
Are you getting tired?

280
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:21,791
It's okay to be tired,
but we won't give up.

281
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,884
You understand
why I'm doing this, right?

282
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,097
My family wouldn't get
what I did for you.

283
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,601
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

284
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,062
As long as
we're together, Mama...

285
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,399
we'll be fine wherever we go.

286
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,817
Stay positive!

287
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,581
Put that on.

288
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,713
Wilson.

289
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,508
Wilson, I'm sorry!

290
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,926
It's okay.

291
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,803
Please don't be mad
at me, okay?

292
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,930
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

293
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,723
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

294
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,391
Stop crying, please.

295
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,519
It's okay.

296
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,813
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,899
Julius.

298
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,903
Can I talk to you for a moment?

299
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,656
About what?

300
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,575
About Anna.

301
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,592
Auntie, what is it?

302
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,305
I'm...

303
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,143
I'm really sorry
to bring this up,

304
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,063
but...

305
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,525
but do you remember what
happened between you and Anna

306
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,818
eight years ago?

307
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,785
When we lost our child.

308
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,792
You were with Anna
at the time, weren't you?

309
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:38,303
But you didn't break up
with her right away, right?

310
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,181
A few weeks passed first, right?

311
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,644
Why are you asking?

312
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,564
What's going on?

313
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,235
Nothing, nothing.

314
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,779
Auntie, come on,
please tell me.

315
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,997
Are we not getting married
anymore?

316
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,250
What happened to you
wasn't easy, Princess.

317
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,669
You need to recover.

318
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,172
Regain your strength.

319
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,091
We'll plan the wedding

320
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,593
-when you're better.
-Wilson.

321
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,389
Wilson, look me in the eye.

322
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,310
Repeat everything you just said.

323
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,687
I have to go.

324
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,398
Wait, hold on.

325
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,817
Don't do this to me!

326
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,694
I didn't want any of this
to happen.

327
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,237
It's not my fault!

328
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,989
I'm not blaming you.

329
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,201
Then why are you
calling off the wedding?

330
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,702
I just need time.

331
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,496
Time for what?

332
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,331
-I'm sorry.
-Wilson.

333
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,917
-I'm sorry.
-Wait, where are you going?!

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,586
Wilson, what's going on?

335
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,464
It's Anna!

336
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,425
This is Anna's fault!

337
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,637
You should blame her, not me!

338
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,515
If she hadn't fought with me
to hide her child,

339
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,266
I wouldn't have had
a miscarriage!

340
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,102
W-Wait, what?

341
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,604
Anna has a child?

342
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,156
Where are you going?

343
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,786
Why did you come back?

344
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,832
Mama, she's the one
who treated me,

345
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,667
that's why I got better
so quickly.

346
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,419
Thank you again.

347
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,171
Where are you taking the kid?

348
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,092
Ma--

349
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,511
What's your name?

350
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,478
Hmm...

351
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,605
I'm B-Bright.

352
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,733
Where's your father?
Is he with you?

353
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,818
Ma, please just let us go.

354
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,319
Where are you going?

355
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,321
Where are you taking
my granddaughter?

356
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,614
Ma, please.

357
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,491
No, you can't!

358
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,290
I have so many questions
that you need to answer, Anna.

359
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,877
Especially about that child.

360
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,383
Is she the reason why you
disappeared for eight years?

361
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,344
And why you needed money?

362
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,225
Do you really think I wouldn't
look for you if you left?

363
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,810
I'd search the world for you.

364
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:36,606
I'd go to the police, TV,
and media!

365
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,899
Whatever it takes.

366
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll do all of it
just to find you.

367
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,706
Oh, here's the key.

368
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,961
If you need anything,
tell Charlie.

369
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,673
But give the kid more
fever medicine, okay?

370
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,509
I'll just go back to--

371
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,802
Ma.

372
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,055
We really can't stay here.
It'll just cause problems.

373
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,808
Huh? Problems like what?

374
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,727
So people will gossip
about us?

375
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,522
You know how they are
around here.

376
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,316
If they find out
that's your daughter

377
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,485
and you don't live here,

378
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,487
what do you think they'll say?

379
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,322
That I disowned you?

380
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,283
I don't accept my grandchild?
That I left you behind?

381
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,911
You're worried about rumors?

382
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,580
Because we're family.

383
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,751
Families stick together
and help each other out.

384
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,630
We need you, Anna,
and you need us.

385
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,799
That child needs a family.

386
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,596
All I'm asking is...

387
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,600
please don't tell anyone
about the kid.

388
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,436
And don't ask me
about the father.

389
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,688
Why?

390
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,070
If you don't want to explain,
fine, I won't push you.

391
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,407
But let me just say this...

392
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,784
you're lucky.

393
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,704
We thought...

394
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,749
you'd never have a child
after what happened,

395
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,086
but here you are...

396
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,380
blessed with one.

397
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,218
You've been given another
chance to have a family,

398
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:35,391
to have a child who will
never leave you no matter what.

399
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,105
Alright. I'll go now.

400
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,288
Erin.

401
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,667
How's Princess?

402
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,380
She went to lie down
when Mama arrived.

403
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,800
Erin.

404
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,556
It's been so long
since we last saw each other.

405
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,144
Are you back here for good,
Anna?

406
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,107
Will you and your child
be living here now?

407
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,695
Just temporarily.

408
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,200
What's his name?

409
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,370
Bright.

410
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,748
How old is he?

411
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,043
Eight years old.

412
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,924
Erin, why?

413
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,968
I just remembered...

414
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,804
when I was eight too.

415
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:59,892
Bright was my age
when you left me.

416
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,313
Didn't Mama explain
everything to you?

417
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,065
She did.

418
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,109
But...

419
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,195
I didn't understand because...

420
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,699
I was just a kid back then.

421
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,202
I remember crying nonstop

422
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,414
because I never saw you again.

423
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,000
Anna...

424
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,211
I always looked for you.

425
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,180
-Erin.
-What?

426
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,516
Anna, please...

427
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,312
always take care of Bright.

428
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,689
Promise me you won't leave him.

429
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,289
We need to talk.

430
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,917
Who's the child you're with?

431
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,005
You know me, Anna.

432
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,549
I won't leave here
without an answer.

433
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,802
Julius, don't make things
more complicated. Just leave.

434
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,512
Who's the kid?!

435
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,099
My son.

436
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,812
You got the answer
you wanted, now go.

437
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,814
Your son?

438
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,649
Who's the father?

439
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,572
What, do you think
there's a chance it's you?

440
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,326
You know what happened
to our child.

441
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,704
Everyone I talked to about you

442
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,207
said nothing about you
having a child with you!

443
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,919
Why? Do you think I owe you
every detail of my life?

444
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,879
Even my personal life?

445
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,714
No, we ended things
a long time ago.

446
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,674
You have a lot to explain.

447
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,219
You've been keeping
so many things from me.

448
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,597
Your name's being dragged into
the case of a missing child.

449
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,226
Where is your child?
I want to see him.

450
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,727
No.

451
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,021
Do you think he's Grace?

452
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,731
Have you gone mad?

453
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,608
You will never
get near my child.

454
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,152
Then answer my question!

455
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,698
Why are you hiding him?
And who's the father?!

456
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,578
Do you want to know
the truth?

457
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,874
I went to Manila
when I got pregnant.

458
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,337
Things didn't work out
between us.

459
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,215
Who's the father? Give me a name!

460
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,927
Even if you try,
you wouldn't be able to.

461
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,513
You think I didn't try
looking for him?

462
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,058
I tried to track him down
so he could take responsibility,

463
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:49,603
but no, he left me
to raise our child alone.

464
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,815
Where is the child?
I want to see him.

465
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,650
Can you just stop?!

466
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,237
Leave!
You're only making things worse!

467
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,823
And you will never get
near my child.

468
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,074
Leave.

469
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,869
-I said leave!
-Where is the child?

470
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,288
-Ma'am?
-Matty, escort him out.

471
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,497
-Sir, this way.
-Leave.

472
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,915
-Leave!
-Sir.

473
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,750
-Leave!
-Let's go.

474
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,596
Where have you been?

475
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,432
Just somewhere nearby.

476
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,435
Chito! Our lives
are already falling apart,

477
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,229
and you still had the nerve to
spend your day gambling?

478
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,814
What?

479
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:36,400
-You think I wouldn't know?
-Please stop nagging.

480
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,526
Hey!

481
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,820
The whole neighborhood's
gossiping about us

482
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,489
because of this!

483
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,535
Why do we care
about those people?

484
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,996
Don't believe a word they say.

485
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,917
They're just jealous because
we're doing better in life now.

486
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,629
What "doing better"
are you talking about?

487
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,380
Because of the donations.

488
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:05,638
Did you get anything? Huh?
Lend me some money.

489
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,599
There's no more donations
coming our way.

490
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,519
They thought
we were just wasting

491
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,522
the donation money
meant for Grace.

492
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:18,317
They think we're only
spending it for ourselves.

493
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,779
They said we're useless parents,
do you understand?

494
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,617
You talk too much.
You're so chatty.

495
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,577
You're so stingy.

496
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,579
Where are you going?

497
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,665
Hey!

498
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,917
Hello?

499
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,253
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,547
I need your help.

501
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,384
What kind of help, dear?

502
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,597
I need the focus of the
investigation shifted off me.

503
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,108
I told you to rest.

504
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,902
Now, your stomach
hurts again from stress.

505
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,030
I'm fine, thank you.

506
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,781
How's Julius doing?

507
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,283
Hmm.

508
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,579
No updates yet.
Just a second.

509
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,169
Thank you.

510
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,219
Hello, Julius.

511
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:12,306
So, what's the news on
your investigation about Anna?

512
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,016
She has a kid with her.

513
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,810
Grace? Is she the one
who took Grace?

514
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,480
It's her child.

515
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,482
Anna has a child?

516
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,151
I just found out myself.

517
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,780
And she won't show me the kid.

518
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,825
Miranda, don't worry.

519
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,578
I'll make sure
I get to the bottom of this.

520
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,220
Hello, Miss Helena.

521
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,014
Grandma. Grandma Helena.

522
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,398
Oh. You know
how to fold clothes?

523
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,024
Positive.

524
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,402
I'm good at house chores.

525
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:11,031
I'm good at sweeping,
cooking rice,

526
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:14,201
washing the dishes,
and doing the laundry.

527
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm also great at selling stuff.

528
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,499
Sell?

529
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,919
Oh... Ma, it's just...

530
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,713
a pretend shop.

531
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,717
I taught him
how to do house chores.

532
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,803
So he could help me
since it's only the two of us.

533
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,518
Uh, Princess will be home soon.

534
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,770
Is the food ready?

535
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,897
I'll just check the kitchen.

536
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:47,025
Also, take care of the guests
who are checking in.

537
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,194
Charlie isn't here.
He's with your sister.

538
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,612
Okay, I will.

539
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,449
Don't forget
to pay the bills too.

540
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,325
You know that, right?

541
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,745
-I'll handle that.
-Okay.

542
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,706
Mama is amazing.

543
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,500
She can do
everything you ask her.

544
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,180
"All you need..."

545
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,309
"...k-k..."

546
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,603
All you need to know.

547
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,981
I already taught you that,
remember?

548
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:30,360
In English,
some words have silent letters.

549
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,738
Oh, right!

550
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,699
Mama, let's read this
later, okay?

551
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,118
Sure.

552
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,579
Mm-hmm.

553
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,499
I need to do my tasks now.

554
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,834
Behave, okay?
Remember what I told you.

555
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,085
Yes, Ma.

556
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,811
Have a seat.
Sorry about the mess.

557
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,314
Hang on.
I'll make you some juice.

558
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,816
How are you doing?

559
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,737
When I saw

560
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,406
your picture
spreading on social media...

561
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,993
Oh, that's fine.

562
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,538
I'm used to it.

563
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,498
I can't blame them.

564
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,208
This is how I dress.

565
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,336
And I also work at a bar.

566
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,713
They would really think
I'm a prostitute.

567
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,509
Is it true?

568
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,806
No.

569
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,185
Even though it's hard
to raise Grace,

570
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,855
I never thought
of selling my body.

571
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,733
I know.

572
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,610
That's why I'm here.

573
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,114
I realized that I judged you

574
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,158
because of a short clip.

575
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,538
From the short time
I've known you,

576
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,291
I felt like
you weren't that kind of person.

577
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,548
Thank you so much
for trusting me.

578
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:20,888
Honestly, I thought
we'd never talk again.

579
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,807
My heart is so happy right now.

580
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:28,562
Ma'am, I'm really sorry
for everything I've done.

581
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:35,944
I've made a lot of mistakes
in life too.

582
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,072
But I didn't let
them affect me.

583
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:44,286
I used them to grow stronger
and improve my life.

584
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,915
I want to help you, Sarah.

585
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,418
But you also have to help yourself.

586
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,801
Oh, wait right there.

587
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,514
Hello, sir?

588
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,808
Ma'am, we got a tip
from an anonymous source.

589
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,102
Someone saw Grace
in Batangas.

590
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:20,781
Here.

591
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,620
Maybe you're missing
your friends?

592
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,332
Is that why you don't want
to play with the kids outside?

593
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,626
I don't have friends.

594
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,795
I don't have friends. Why?

595
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:42,803
Nobody likes me
because I always ask for stuff.

596
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,431
What do you ask for?

597
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:50,310
Paper, sometimes food.

598
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:56,024
Doesn't your mother
pack you food?

599
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,193
Uh-- Hmm...

600
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,905
She does.

601
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:05,701
But sometimes
I forget to bring it.

602
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,332
This was her place.

603
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,501
She rented it for almost a year.

604
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,587
Was she living here with someone?

605
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,297
No, just her.

606
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,052
Why?

607
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,808
I just noticed...

608
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,602
you're still having
a hard time reading.

609
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,105
Do you want to go back
to school?

610
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,900
Do you want me to enroll you?

611
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,696
Oh! I know the principal there.

612
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,407
I just need your documents.

613
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,618
You brought your
birth certificate, right?

614
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,078
Uh...

615
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,833
No, it's okay.

616
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:55,959
Huh?

617
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,878
So, she doesn't have
a kid at school?

618
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,214
All her co-teachers
thought Anna was single.

619
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,800
There's no record of her
having a kid in school,

620
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:06,386
and no sign of a child
living with her.

621
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,430
Maybe she left it with someone else?

622
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,017
My source also found
Anna's insurance documents.

623
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,812
She only listed herself,
no dependents.

624
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,731
And her medical records say

625
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,816
she's never given birth.

626
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,695
Are you sure Anna has a child?

627
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,531
The child is with her
family now.

628
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,909
Sorry, but based on
the limited time we had,

629
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,119
I don't think the child is hers.

630
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,537
If it were,

631
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,790
why did it seem like the child
didn't exist?

632
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,501
Okay, Tommy, thanks.

633
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,590
We're here.

634
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,596
What is she doing here?!

635
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:54,518
Didn't I tell you I let them
stay here for now?

636
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,812
I just wanted to be with my--

637
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:03,026
Oh! I remembered
what I forgot to do!

638
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,028
We still don't have
a display picture

639
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,696
of our new family member.

640
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,033
Hey, Bright! Let me take
your picture.

641
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:11,076
Strike a pose!

642
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,245
There! Mr. Handsome pose.
Try another one.

643
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,704
Other pose! There!

644
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,833
I'll hang this picture
on the wall for--

645
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,794
Charlie? What are you doing?

646
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,088
I'm taking pictures of him
so we can display-

647
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,214
Give me that.

648
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:31,179
Why are you deleting
the pictures?

649
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,308
Look at how dirty he is.

650
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,227
If people see those pictures,

651
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,187
they might think
I'm neglecting him.

652
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,401
Ma, I'll just go out
to pay the bills.

653
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,111
I'll be right back.

654
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,322
Oh no, Mama.
You're already tired.

655
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,616
Get some rest first.

656
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,580
Can Mama get some rest first?

657
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,832
He has a point.

658
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,711
None of us asked Anna
if she was still doing okay.

659
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,214
Don't worry, I'm fine.

660
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,800
Ma, I'll get going now
so I can return early.

661
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,886
Bright, I'll be right back,
okay?

662
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,395
Matty, please put my stuff
in the room. Thank you.

663
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,985
It's your fault!

664
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,321
Uh...

665
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,615
Charlie, please take Princess
to her room.

666
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,116
Go ahead and rest.

667
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,409
Matty!

668
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,580
-Bring her some water.
-Okay, ma'am.

669
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,583
Oh, dear.

670
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,920
You got drenched.

671
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:49,132
Let's get you changed
and all cleaned up.

672
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:51,509
Your mother said
you looked dirty.

673
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,386
Come on.

674
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,806
You're all wet!

675
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,725
Let's get you changed, okay?

676
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,019
-Alright.
-Okay.

677
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,479
Come here. Hmm?

678
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,940
Let's take this off first.

679
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,734
Oh, why won't you let me help you?

680
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,070
No. I can do it myself!

681
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,072
-I'll take a bath anyway.
-Just let me-

682
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,114
I said no!

683
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,200
I can do it myself!

684
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,202
Okay, fine.

685
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,413
He must be feeling shy.

686
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,499
Oh.

687
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,292
Hey!

688
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,087
You didn't get any clothes!

689
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,031
What the heck?

690
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,700
I already warned you, didn't I?

691
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,327
-Want to get dragged out?
-Ma?

692
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:00,912
I want to see your child.

693
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,664
If you don't leave, I'll scream.

694
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,332
If you don't show me the child,

695
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,792
I'll call the police.

696
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,424
What for?

697
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,092
Is it a crime to have a child?

698
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,470
Are you really the mother
of that child?

699
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,723
Or is that what you
want us all to believe?

700
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,808
-Charlie.
-Yes?

701
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,934
Where's Anna?

702
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:24,477
I saw her go out the back.

703
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,313
Perhaps she's in the alfresco area.

704
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,480
Okay.

705
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,400
I had you investigated.

706
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,611
And there's not even
one document

707
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,113
saying you have a child!

708
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,618
Come on, Anna!
I know that child is Grace!

709
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:41,828
You kidnapped her!

710
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,413
I didn't kidnap anyone.

711
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,707
Well then, show me the child.

712
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,002
Prove to me it's not Grace!

713
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,963
Otherwise, I'm seriously
going to call the police.

714
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,424
And you'll be sent to jail
for what you've done!

715
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,717
Jail?

716
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,595
Who'll be sent to jail?

717
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,518
Hello?

718
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,521
There are reported sightings
of Grace in Batangas just now.

719
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,981
You need to come back here.

720
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,274
What?

721
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,735
That's impossible.

722
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,404
What do you mean?
I need you here now!

723
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,122
I'll be back.

724
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,708
Julius? Julius!

725
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:32,504
Anna!

726
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,089
What's going on?

727
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,425
Why would Julius want you
to go to jail?

728
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,302
Who is Grace?

729
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,311
Anna has a child?

730
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,021
I don't know.

731
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,315
But that's what Julius asked me to do.

732
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,485
Why would he want
to know the truth?

733
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,906
Maybe Julius is in Palawan...

734
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,992
because he's the father
of the child.

735
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,705
Hey, I was just kidding, Jess.

736
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:11,626
I think he suspects
that child is Grace.

737
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,379
I'm not sure because
he didn't really tell me.

738
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,550
But you have a point.

739
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,802
That's the only reason
why Julius would want

740
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,679
to go to Palawan. Because...

741
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,181
he discovered something.

742
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:26,516
I guess so.

743
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,602
That there's a possibility...

744
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,980
they do have a child.

745
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,482
Hmm?

746
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:38,111
Answer me, Anna!

747
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,322
Ma, he just mistook Bright
for the child he's looking for.

748
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,490
Grace?

749
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,703
Is that why Julius
is accusing you

750
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,413
of kidnapping a child?

751
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,209
It's not true,
so he just left.

752
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,213
Was he really wrong?

753
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:01,509
Anna, is Bright
really your child?

754
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,099
Is Bright really your child?

755
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:11,436
Oh, come on, Ma!
Are you doubting me, too?

756
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,229
You just suddenly left!

757
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,398
And you didn't contact us
for a long time!

758
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,901
When you called,
you wanted to borrow money.

759
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,903
You're rushing to leave the country

760
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,613
as if you're hiding
from someone!

761
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:23,823
Bright is my child!

762
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,325
Why do I have to prove that?

763
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:29,204
The landlady said you lived
alone in that apartment!

764
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:33,416
It took a long time before
you introduced that child to us.

765
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,628
And yet you deleted
the pictures Charlie took?

766
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,507
It's like you're so afraid of
showing that child to everyone!

767
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,717
Because I'm his mother!

768
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,595
I will do what's best
for my child

769
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,138
and what will make him happy!

770
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,182
The only thing
that matters is...

771
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,100
the two of us!

772
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,186
Nothing else!

773
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,193
Then explain this!

774
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,403
Anna!

775
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:04,781
Explain it to me!

776
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:11,079
Why is there a girl's underwear
in Bright's stuff?

777
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,707
Tell me!

778
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,710
Is Bright really your child?

779
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,214
Is she Grace?

780
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,095
Did you kidnap her?

781
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,019
Yes.

782
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,480
I took her.

783
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,780
You took someone else's child?

784
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,200
The child was being
mistreated, Ma.

785
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:51,703
-I just didn't want--
-What you did is wrong!

786
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,706
Very wrong!

787
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,837
Have you lost your mind, Anna?

788
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,715
It's not just simply wrong.
It's a crime!

789
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,633
Ma, I had no choice.

790
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,719
They were hurting her!

791
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,887
She's not your child!

792
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:14,017
You didn't even think
about us, your family.

793
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,020
We have a business.

794
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,022
What will happen to your siblings?

795
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,983
Princess is about to get married.

796
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:24,736
Ma, I'm sorry.

797
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,030
I didn't mean to do it. I'm really sorry.

798
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,698
That's the problem, Anna!

799
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,200
You only think about yourself!

800
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,207
Sir Jimenez?

801
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,293
-Uh...
-Any news?

802
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:43,880
Still nothing?

803
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:47,717
This is the house the tipster told us.

804
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,637
We are currently conducting
an investigation here.

805
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,680
Who is that tipster?
Where are they?

806
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:54,432
They didn't give any information.

807
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,684
They just told us
Grace was often seen here.

808
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,229
Sir.

809
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:03,107
I searched through the back,
but I didn't see anyone.

810
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,400
I only found...

811
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,694
-Wait a minute.
-Mrs. Banaag.

812
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,124
This belongs to my child.

813
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,209
Huh?

814
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,128
This is Grace's.

815
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:25,880
Miss Miranda, I'm sure of it.

816
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,807
Hold on.

817
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,102
I only think about myself?

818
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,813
Ever since Papa died,

819
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,108
I've done nothing
but help you out.

820
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,779
From building and running this inn...

821
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,906
...to taking care of Erin.

822
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,199
I've done my best

823
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,910
and you've never heard me
complain, right?

824
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,416
You think I owe you
because of those favors?

825
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:05,503
I never asked you
to do any of those.

826
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,130
Yes.

827
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,716
I did those things because
I know you're blaming me

828
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,551
for Papa's death.

829
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,097
And because I'm just adopted.

830
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,110
-How-
-When...

831
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,113
While I was looking
for some documents

832
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,699
that were needed for
my marriage with Julius...

833
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,411
I saw the adoption papers.

834
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:41,706
When I saw it,

835
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,792
I realized why
after Papa's death,

836
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,796
I felt like I was no longer
part of your family.

837
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,008
I felt like I was alone.

838
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,815
At that time, your father and I
had been married for years,

839
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,193
but I couldn't get pregnant.

840
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,618
I lost hope.

841
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:25,500
But my life changed when you came.

842
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,881
My hope was rekindled.

843
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:37,887
Your father and I found you
in an orphanage.

844
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,809
Because of you...

845
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,813
I became a mother.

846
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,276
I managed to become a mother...

847
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:54,278
to Erin...

848
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,198
...and to Princess.

849
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,287
You made me whole.

850
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,499
I'm not a perfect mother.

851
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,380
But I'm doing everything I can.

852
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,092
However...

853
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,681
However, when your father died...

854
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,687
I don't know.

855
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:33,818
It's like...

856
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,778
I felt lost.

857
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,910
I tried my best.

858
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:50,126
But I didn't feel worthy to
be a mother to you three.

859
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,211
Ma, no...

860
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,588
That's not true.

861
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,383
Ma, listen.

862
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:59,176
You're worthy.

863
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,684
You're enough.

864
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,395
But you left me.

865
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,319
Ma, I left because...

866
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,114
I wanted all of you
to live in peace.

867
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:26,412
I knew Papa didn't mind me
staying here,

868
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:29,582
but I feel ashamed
around my siblings.

869
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:32,710
They're the ones who...

870
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,420
have a right to your love

871
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,589
because they're
your real children.

872
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,384
I don't want to take
a part of their share.

873
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,513
I'm sorry because...

874
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:47,099
when Grace came into my life,

875
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:49,310
everything seemed to change.

876
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:54,106
Finally, I feel like
someone understands me.

877
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,902
There's someone like me.

878
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:03,407
I hope you understand
why I can't let her go.

879
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:08,204
Even if you can go to jail?

880
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:11,999
Anna...

881
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,712
Don't ruin your life.

882
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,967
Are you willing to do that
for Grace...

883
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,389
...even though you know
it's wrong?

884
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,185
Think about it carefully.

885
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:35,189
You need to return her.

886
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,493
Grace?

887
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:54,083
Grace?!

888
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,213
Grace?

889
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,019
I'm sorry, Mama.

890
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,813
I don't want you to go to jail.

891
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,399
I'll leave you
in Pipo's care.

892
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,484
I love you, Mama.

893
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,408
Grace!

894
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:28,993
Yes, Tommy?

895
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,078
Your flight to Manila
has been confirmed.

896
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,205
Someone will pick you up at the airport.

897
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,915
You can go straight to Batangas.

898
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,834
Have you heard from Miranda?

899
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,128
Well, she just told me
to be on standby.

900
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,380
But she said she needs you right away

901
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:15,998
Mister.

902
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,417
Mister, can I ride
on your boat?

903
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,420
Miss, did you see a boy
about this tall?

904
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,798
-No, I didn't.
-Maybe he went there.

905
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,136
Mister, did you see a boy
about this tall?

906
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,805
No, ma'am.

907
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,728
Ma'am, did you see a boy
about this tall?

908
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,230
No, ma'am.

909
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:42,191
-Are you sure?
-I didn't see him.

910
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,526
Like I said, I can't let you
hop on my boat.

911
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,902
You're too young.

912
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:30,114
I'm begging you, mister.

913
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,616
I really can't.
Where is your mother?

914
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,077
-Mister, please!
-Grace?

915
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,913
Grace! Grace!

916
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,504
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

917
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:50,301
I heard that man say
he'd call the police on you.

918
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,805
I don't want you to go to jail.

919
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,599
So, you're going to leave me?

920
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:01,896
Sorry, Mama.
I didn't mean to leave you.

921
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:06,817
I just don't want you
to get arrested by the police.

922
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,991
Grace?

923
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:16,702
Grace!

924
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:18,412
I knew it.

925
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,208
Grace, let's go. Come with me.

926
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:25,628
I'm not Grace. I'm Bright.

927
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,713
Grace, you don't have
to pretend anymore.

928
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,799
You know, your real mom
is waiting for you.

929
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,801
And she's really
worried about you.

930
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:35,804
Come on, I'll take you home.

931
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:40,434
No. Please don't take me home.

932
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,936
Grace.

933
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,396
Everyone is so worried
about you.

934
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,607
And they should know
where you are.

935
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:47,816
Come on.

936
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,570
No. Please don't tell them
where I am.

937
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,115
Anna.

938
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,035
Don't make this difficult.

939
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,787
Surrender her now.

940
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,300
Julius said you have a child.

941
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,302
Why are you prying
on my personal life?

942
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:18,097
Julius, what did you find out
about the child?

943
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:22,226
Aren't you scared?

944
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,019
I'm not doing anything wrong.

945
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:27,106
Are you ready to lose
everything you have?

946
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:30,317
Tell me the truth.

947
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,111
Are you here to get back at me?

948
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,988
Anna Sarmiento...

949
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,907
I'm giving you another chance.

950
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:39,118
I'm willing to give a reward.

951
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,412
I'm offering one million pesos

952
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,831
to anyone who can
answer the question:

953
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,791
Where is Grace?
