1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,929
You have the right to remain silent.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,515
Anything you say will be used
against you in court.

3
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,559
You have the right to an attorney.

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,311
If you cannot afford a lawyer,
you'll be provided one.

5
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,980
Atty. Jessica Valdez.

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,024
Your Honor, after everything
Ms. Sarmiento has gone through,

7
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,277
it's possible
that she's mentally unstable.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,403
I'm not crazy!

9
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,322
Now, I'm calling for both
parties to present evidence.

10
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,032
I think we should--

11
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,492
Mama?

12
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,287
Oh, Grace! My goodness!

13
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,113
Okay, okay.

14
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,531
Okay.

15
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:13,991
I'm on my way to court.

16
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,410
I told Grace I was leaving.

17
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,121
I told her I'd go grocery shopping.

18
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,207
She'll be safe, she'll be safe.

19
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,416
Okay? Bye.

20
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,934
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,894
You shouldn't be here.

22
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,021
You told me…

23
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,399
…you'd come back for me, right, Mama?

24
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,404
I'm sorry, dear.

25
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,325
Order in the court.

26
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,286
Ms. Sarmiento, please go back
to your seat.

27
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,497
Hold on.

28
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,415
Excuse me.

29
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,000
Grace, my dear.

30
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,503
Where have you been, huh?

31
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,296
Are you okay?

32
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,298
Did they do anything to you?

33
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,925
Did they hurt you?

34
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,802
Did Anna hurt you?

35
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,930
Tell me what happened. I missed you, dear.

36
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,807
I missed you so much.

37
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,685
Don't fight my Mama Anna.

38
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,023
I don't want her to go to jail.

39
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:31,986
You even told me you'd
give me to her, remember?

40
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,030
I never said that!

41
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,699
I told you that lying is bad!

42
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,033
Why are you lying?

43
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:41,120
Stop lying!
I never said anything like that!

44
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,498
-Ma'am, please calm down.
-I never said that! Let go!

45
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,417
Grace, I never said that!

46
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,836
Your Honor,

47
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,796
in light of these events,

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,965
we request permission for Grace

49
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,717
to testify in front of the court.

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,303
She can shed light to this whole issue.

51
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,138
Jessica no. Don't do that.

52
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,931
She'll just get traumatized.

53
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,600
It will help your case, Anna.

54
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,226
I don't care if I go to jail.

55
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,519
I won't let that happen.

56
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,021
I don't want her to testify.

57
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,564
-Please don't let her.
-Mama.

58
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,316
It's okay.

59
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,610
I'll help you.

60
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,028
Grace, no.

61
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,195
You don't have to.

62
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,198
I can handle it, Mama.

63
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,618
I'm stronger now.

64
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,786
I'm brave now.

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,205
I promise.

66
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to protect you.

67
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,611
The judge has given Grace
permission to testify.

68
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,115
Anna, don't worry.

69
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,410
The court will make sure
Grace won't get traumatized.

70
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,204
Social services will also assist her

71
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,372
during her testimony.

72
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,916
I'll also help in questioning her.

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,502
We need to do this, Anna.

74
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,213
But, Attorney, where's Grace?

75
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,798
Why isn't she with you?

76
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,009
She's considered a kidnapping victim.

77
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,720
She can't be with Anna.

78
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,889
Oh, Anna, I'm sorry.

79
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,975
Did they give her back to Sarah?

80
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,686
What do you mean they won't
give me back my daughter?

81
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,897
The court has ordered child
services to take care of her.

82
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,817
She'll also undergo some
tests, like a physical exam,

83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,195
and a psychological evaluation,
to make sure she's okay.

84
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,115
They'll interview her,
to make sure she's okay,

85
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,118
to ask her what happened
before testifying in court.

86
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,828
No! They can't do that!

87
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,413
If you really want her back,

88
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,291
we have to prove in court
that what Anna did was wrong.

89
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,043
That you're truly a good mother.

90
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,003
You should seem like the perfect mom,

91
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,671
so they'll trust you.

92
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,007
How can I do that?

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,093
You should pray that Grace
doesn't speak against you.

94
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:48,807
But Grace doesn't know
anybody in child services.

95
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,726
The child must be scared.

96
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,228
Can I, at least, visit her?

97
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,731
Follow the court's order, Anna.

98
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,317
Or else, you might lose this case.

99
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,005
You must be Grace.

100
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,132
My name is Mama Sally,

101
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,635
and I'm in charge of this shelter.

102
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,805
And Grace, from now on,
you'll be living here.

103
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,015
Welcome home, Grace.

104
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,809
Don't be afraid.

105
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,228
Come on. I'll show you your room.

106
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,312
Come with me.

107
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,609
I'm fine.

108
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,237
You don't need to give me a room.

109
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,781
I'm not staying here for too long.

110
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,118
Not going to stay here?

111
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,913
When I tell them that
Mama Anna is nice to me.

112
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,332
she won't go to jail.

113
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,417
And we'll be together again.

114
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,895
Seriously?

115
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,107
You've got to be kidding me.

116
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,317
Ouch! Ouch!

117
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,820
That hurt!

118
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,509
Hello?

119
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,802
Sarah?

120
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,934
Chito.

121
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,229
Hey, are you crying?

122
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,690
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,818
Please forgive me for what I did.

124
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,570
My emotions got the better of me.

125
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,113
I just got mad at you.

126
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,907
Chito.

127
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,995
I'm all alone.

128
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,707
I miss you so much.

129
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,004
When will you get out?

130
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,299
I don't know.

131
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,510
My lawyer just abandoned me.

132
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,929
No.

133
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,513
Don't worry.

134
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,308
You'll get out soon.

135
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,227
I found Grace.

136
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,688
Anna's on trial now.

137
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,399
When she's in jail,

138
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,109
I'll try to do something.

139
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,612
I'll get your sentence reduced.

140
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,616
Chito, I'll give you all my money.

141
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,201
Really?

142
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,536
When?

143
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,121
Just trust me.

144
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,166
I'll give it to you soon.

145
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,502
Make sure of it, okay, love?

146
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,714
I love you so much.

147
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,592
I love you too, Sarah.

148
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,810
We just want to ask you, Grace,

149
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,604
how do you know Miss Sarmiento?

150
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,488
She's my teacher.

151
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,034
She always gets mad at me in class,

152
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,286
because…

153
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,998
…I always fall asleep.

154
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,711
And I fight the other kids.

155
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,588
But even though she scolds me,

156
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,428
she always shares her food with me,

157
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,722
and asks me how I'm doing.

158
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,518
Do your other teachers do that for you?

159
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,117
No, they don't.

160
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:23,999
All of them think I'm a troublemaker.

161
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,711
Sometimes…

162
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,007
…she even combs my hair.

163
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,220
And…

164
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,100
…she gives me things
to keep myself clean.

165
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,021
Why? Doesn't your mom do that for you?

166
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,037
I heard you have a pet chicken.

167
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,497
His name's Pipo, right?

168
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,917
Who gave that to you?

169
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,337
I won him in the fair.

170
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,215
Who gave you the money to go there?

171
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,135
Mama Sarah did.

172
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,887
Aside from that,

173
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:23,016
what else does your Mama buy for you?

174
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,021
Clothes.

175
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,689
Mhm- hmm.

176
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,193
Food.

177
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,114
And…

178
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,700
…and things I use in school.

179
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,494
Do you think…

180
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,122
…your Mama loves you?

181
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,922
She loves me, but--

182
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,507
That's all, Your Honor.

183
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,096
Hold on. Wait.

184
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,890
You didn't let me finish.

185
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,019
Little girl, what did you want to say?

186
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,815
I think she loves me.

187
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:18,405
But I'm not sure.

188
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,413
Why did you say you're not sure, Grace?

189
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:30,584
Because I don't feel it.

190
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,718
We're poor.

191
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,888
I know…

192
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,391
…Mama Sarah gets tired.

193
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,102
So she's always angry.

194
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,606
But…

195
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,986
…why doesn't she
sleep next to me at night?

196
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,284
Why doesn't she comb my hair?

197
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,997
Why doesn't she hug me?

198
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,708
Why doesn't she kiss me?

199
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,795
Doesn't she like me?

200
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,134
I mean…

201
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:25,180
…a mom should do
all those things for her child?

202
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,892
Doesn't she like me?

203
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,402
When Uncle Chito hurts me…

204
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,406
…she never protects me.

205
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,911
Sometimes,

206
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,205
I feel like…

207
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:54,000
…she loves Uncle Chito
more than she loves me.

208
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,507
She said I'm just a burden to her.

209
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,385
That's not true!

210
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,012
I love you!

211
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,600
Grace, you can't tell them
that I'm a bad mother to you.

212
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,894
Miss Banaag, calm down.

213
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,316
Grace, you can't tell them
I'm a bad mother.

214
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,402
Because I did everything.

215
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,613
I did everything I could
to raise you properly.

216
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,908
I protected you from your Uncle Chito.

217
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,911
We always fought because
I was protecting you.

218
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,621
You just never saw it.

219
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,708
Sometimes, you're just so stubborn.

220
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,002
You say you protect me.

221
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,213
But why do I have this?

222
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,800
And this.

223
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,680
And this?

224
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,229
Grace, you know I didn't do that to you.

225
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,023
You know that's not true.

226
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,899
Take back what you said.

227
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,819
Grace, take it back.

228
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,404
Take it back!

229
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,281
Even you, Mama!

230
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,118
You also hurt me!

231
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,413
Why did you do that to me?

232
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,207
That's not true!

233
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,209
Grace, take back what you said!

234
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,211
I didn't do that to you!

235
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,215
Grace! Grace, my dear!

236
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,601
-Miss Sarah, any comment?
-Miss Sarah?

237
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,811
-Please!
-Attorney.

238
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:41,483
Will Grace's testimony
prove that Anna's innocent?

239
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,902
We can't be sure yet.

240
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,529
But Grace has a strong testimony.

241
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,283
Actually, Grace is Anna's
biggest hope right now.

242
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:55,330
We just have to be
prepared for all possibilities.

243
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,499
Hold on. So Anna will still go to jail?

244
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,628
In the eyes of the law,
she still kidnapped the child,

245
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,005
even if she did it in good faith.

246
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,801
I just hope the judge sees that…

247
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,595
saving Grace's life was the motive.

248
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,015
We're hoping for leniency.

249
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,186
But that's still six to twelve years
in prison.

250
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,693
But let's wait for the judgment
in the next hearing.

251
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,820
I'm ready to go to prison.

252
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,279
Even if it's for life.

253
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,410
I just want justice
for what happened to Grace.

254
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,620
And to make sure she's safe.

255
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,707
Mama!

256
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,794
Grace.

257
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,304
Mama, can we stay
at Mama Sally's house?

258
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,683
It's nice there,
and I have a lot of friends.

259
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,603
It's like Mama Lucy's orphanage,

260
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,898
but with more trees and flowers.

261
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,611
And there's more food, too.

262
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,409
I can tell.

263
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,703
Looks like you've gained weight.

264
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,913
And you're so tall now.

265
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,999
And…

266
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,625
you're so beautiful.

267
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,919
How are your friends?

268
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,213
Positive.

269
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,798
They're nice.

270
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:33,011
At first, I was shy,
but they're fun to be with.

271
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,306
They always invite me to play with them.

272
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,391
Play?

273
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,020
Maybe all you're doing there is play?

274
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:47,317
No, I can count now. Over 100!

275
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,902
And not just that,

276
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:54,616
I'm good at multiplying too. Up to 5!

277
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,909
Really?

278
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,827
Okay, what's 5x3?

279
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,120
Fifteen!

280
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,081
I'm also good at reading English.

281
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,420
See?

282
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,631
Regional…

283
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,924
Trial…

284
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,091
Court!

285
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,386
You're really good.

286
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,431
Let's go, Mama.

287
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,682
Uh, Grace.

288
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,938
Uh…

289
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,690
since you're good now,
you don't need me anymore.

290
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,485
You can do it on your own.

291
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,961
So, what's going to happen now, attorney?

292
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,921
I can still get my child back, right?

293
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,715
They probably won't believe
whatever the kid is saying.

294
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,302
I'll be honest with you, Sarah.
Because of Grace's statements,

295
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,013
there will be an investigation
into child abuse.

296
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,933
Anna's camp has already filed a case
against you.

297
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,102
What? That can't be!

298
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,603
Find a way, Attorney!

299
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,105
I can't be investigated!

300
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,524
I need to get my child back!

301
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,818
You know, I just need to talk to that kid.

302
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,945
Once I talk to her, I'll explain to her

303
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,947
that she was just fooled by that Anna!

304
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,199
What she's saying isn't true!

305
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,535
You need to clear
yourself of the allegations

306
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,829
if you want to get custody of Grace back.

307
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,706
What if I don't get cleared?

308
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,125
Child abuse is a crime!

309
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,585
You could face prison time!

310
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,215
Mama, I need you.

311
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,009
Grace, you just think you need me.

312
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,302
You don't anymore, dear.

313
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,512
Your life is better there.

314
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,890
Besides, I need to fix my life…

315
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,683
on my own.

316
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,896
Mama, I can help you.

317
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,606
No.

318
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,107
Your life is fine there.

319
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,234
They'll give you everything you want.

320
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,321
Everything you need,
they'll give it to you.

321
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,407
You're the only one I need, Mama.

322
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,202
Even if it's hard,
even if we always have to hide,

323
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,496
as long as I'm with you.

324
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,999
Grace…

325
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,709
you don't need me anymore.

326
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,085
You're strong now.

327
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:14,088
Remember what you told me before?

328
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,299
Do you remember…

329
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,718
you said you were tired of hiding?

330
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,720
This is it, you're free now.

331
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,097
You can do anything you want.

332
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,099
You want to go back to school, right?

333
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,518
You can play now, too!

334
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:33,024
But Mama, I want to do it with you.

335
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,401
Grace, don't be stubborn. Please, go now.

336
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,196
Aren't you my mother? Aren't I your child?

337
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,615
Don't you love me anymore?

338
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,124
No, I don't love you anymore.

339
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,710
Go ahead… take her.

340
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,212
-No--
-Grace, come on!

341
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,799
It's not true, you love me!

342
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,968
Didn't you hear me? No!

343
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,220
Take her already,
what are you waiting for?

344
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,222
No! That's not true!

345
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,517
You love me!
And I love you so much too!

346
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,812
You told me we'll be together
until the end, right?

347
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:15,108
Mama! You said we'll be together
until the end!

348
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,235
Mama!

349
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,822
You promised!

350
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,282
Mama!

351
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,105
Wait.

352
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,315
What are you doing? Don't touch her!

353
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,317
We're not done yet.

354
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,111
We're far from done.

355
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,113
There's still a case you need to face.

356
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,490
You really don't know me, Anna.

357
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,328
Grace is mine. Even if you bring
my daughter to hell,

358
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,788
I'll get her back from you.

359
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,082
Let's see each other in hell.

360
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,294
Because I'll do anything to protect Grace.

361
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,212
-Come here, you…
-Ma'am! Ma'am!

362
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,922
-You witch! Come here!
-Stop it!

363
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,091
-Don't touch me!
-Let go of her!

364
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,324
Isn't that Sarah, Grace's mother?

365
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,326
My god, why did they let her in here?

366
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,328
Right? They should've put her in jail.

367
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,455
She did terrible things to her daughter.

368
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,210
Sarah, we need to talk.

369
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,755
I hope it's good news.

370
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,216
The investigation of your case
is still ongoing.

371
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,384
-Then?
-It's not really in your favor.

372
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,970
Someone gave me a tip

373
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,764
that they'll issue a warrant soon.

374
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,933
They're going to arrest you.

375
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,601
But we'll prepare for it.

376
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,192
Can I…

377
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,694
just adopt Grace?

378
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,697
I know that's what Anna wants.

379
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,991
Grace too.

380
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,494
She already knows me.

381
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,830
And we have a good relationship.

382
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,415
I'll make sure to take good care of her.

383
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,084
I know.

384
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,503
But, I'm sorry, Julius,

385
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,421
that doesn't seem possible.

386
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,506
Why?

387
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,466
Adoption has to go through a process.

388
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,927
We need to look
for the child's relative first.

389
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,637
Blood-related or extended family

390
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,305
who can take care of her.

391
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,307
If they can't find anyone,

392
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,310
there will be a matching process

393
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,355
which the childcare agency will do.

394
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,733
There is a law
that prohibits direct adoption.

395
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,611
This means that you can't choose
a child to adopt.

396
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,906
The child also cannot choose
which parent they want.

397
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,408
You have to apply first

398
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,951
then the matching process,

399
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,995
of the child with the adoptive parents.

400
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,497
Another thing, Julius,

401
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,916
because of your association with Anna,

402
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,502
it'd be harder for you to get Grace.

403
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,130
It's hard to accept

404
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,132
but what she did was still kidnapping.

405
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,301
I just want…

406
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,597
to pursue my dreams.

407
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,184
And, Anna, she deserves to be with Grace.

408
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,479
Both of them,
they both deserve to be happy.

409
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,903
There are many other ways
to make her happy.

410
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,200
Jess.

411
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,579
I'm really sorry that I hurt you.

412
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,082
I'm sorry too.

413
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,711
For giving you a hard time.

414
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,008
I became too selfish.

415
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,093
My love was suffocating.

416
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,682
But let's forget about that.

417
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,186
I just really hope…

418
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,231
that we can forgive each other

419
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,774
for everything that happened.

420
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,819
And most importantly,

421
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,405
I hope we remain friends.

422
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,792
Sarah Banaag, open up
or we'll kick the door down!

423
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,298
Go! Search the area!

424
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,802
Is the food delicious?

425
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,719
Very good.

426
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:57,098
Yes! I finally replicated Aunt's recipe!

427
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,809
We'll launch that in our food cart.

428
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,103
How's that going?

429
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,106
Oh, it's getting popular, Anna.

430
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,023
Don't worry.

431
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,400
When you get out of here,

432
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,694
we'll have more food carts running.

433
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,532
And we all promise to
welcome you back outside

434
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,201
when you get released.

435
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,414
I hope that happens soon.

436
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,000
May the hearing's result be in your favor.

437
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,796
I'm ready to face the court's decision.

438
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,882
I hope you are too.

439
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,220
Anna.

440
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,805
Anna? Anna.

441
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,017
Sarah's been issued
with an arrest warrant.

442
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,102
But she's nowhere to be found.

443
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,479
The cops suspect she ran away.

444
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,265
Sarah's been issued
with an arrest warrant.

445
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,892
But she's nowhere to be found.

446
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,311
The cops suspect that she ran away.

447
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,771
Grace is my daughter.

448
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,815
Even if you bring her with you to hell,

449
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,400
I'll take her back.

450
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,205
Damn it. We got a flat tire.

451
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,915
I need to change it.

452
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,333
Call for backup.

453
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:33,504
Copy. I'll report what happened
and request for reinforcements.

454
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,007
Don't move!

455
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,343
I never wanted this,
but my daughter needs me.

456
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,637
I'm begging you, please don't move!

457
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,014
Give me the keys.

458
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,684
Hurry up! Hand them over!

459
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,020
Don't do anything funny.

460
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,318
Put it on.

461
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,404
Hurry!

462
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:05,494
Rivera! Sarmiento escaped!

463
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,920
Don't push, okay?

464
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,297
Okay, keep going.

465
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,186
Do I really have to go?

466
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:35,524
Grace, you need people
to take care of you.

467
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:40,821
Your foster family will give you
all the love you need.

468
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,323
Foster family?

469
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,033
Yes, foster family.

470
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:48,787
You will stay with them until
the court issues a verdict.

471
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,208
Isn't Mama Anna
going to be released today?

472
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,128
I heard it on the news.

473
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:59,507
The judge will make his decision today.

474
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:04,136
Will they let Mama Anna go, Mama Sally?

475
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,930
I don't know, Grace.

476
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,098
Please don't send me away.

477
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,435
I'll just wait for Mama Anna here.

478
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,521
I'm sure she'll come get me.

479
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,606
I'll go with her.

480
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,707
Breaking news!

481
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:39,922
Prime suspect for Grace Banaag's
kidnapping case, Anna Sarmiento,

482
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:44,802
attacked her guards and escaped
on the way to the court

483
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,513
before her final hearing.

484
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,182
Authorities are now hunting her down.

485
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:53,894
Miss, I…

486
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,864
They said they're almost here. Get ready.

487
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,033
Hey. Tsk.

488
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,994
Have a seat.

489
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,913
Don't be sad.

490
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,707
Hm?

491
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,294
Can I not go with them?

492
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,714
Oh, they're here. Let me get them.

493
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,881
Wait here.

494
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,083
Good day.

495
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,895
Grace?

496
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,108
Dear…

497
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,110
Grace.

498
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,613
Grace… Grace, my dear.

499
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,325
Come on. Let's go. Come with Mama.

500
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,035
Let's go home together.

501
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,828
No!

502
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:35,913
"No"?

503
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,290
You can't say no to me! I'm your mother!

504
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,627
I told you not to listen
to what others say, right?

505
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,923
They don't know anything.
They're just making me look bad.

506
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,133
You love me, right?

507
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:51,804
If you really love me, you'll
take back everything you said.

508
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,097
Do you understand?

509
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,933
I took care of you, didn't I?

510
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,019
We also made good memories together.

511
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:02,022
No! You'll just hurt me again!

512
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,816
I won't!

513
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,610
Unless you're stubborn!
So you listen to me!

514
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,321
No matter what, you're coming with me!

515
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:12,116
And you'll do as I say! Now, let's go!

516
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,536
-I don't want to!
-You are my daughter!

517
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,829
Mine! So, come on!

518
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,623
-No! Let go of me!
-Walk!

519
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,000
-I said, walk!
-I'll shout!

520
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,628
Are you threatening me?
You think I'm scared?

521
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,797
Just go!

522
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,716
I won't shout if you leave.

523
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,927
If they find you here,
you'll be in trouble.

524
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,723
You think I care? No! Let's go!

525
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,225
-Help!
-Shut your trap!

526
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,309
Walk!

527
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,812
-Let go of her!
-Mama Anna!

528
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,607
Get away from her!
Get away from that criminal!

529
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,651
Have you no pity? Just leave her alone!

530
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,903
She's doing much better here,
so give it up!

531
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,904
No!

532
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,699
I'm not leaving this place
without my daughter!

533
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:57,494
Worry about yourself!
You're the wanted criminal here!

534
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:58,829
Give me back my daughter!

535
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,707
-Ow!
-Give me my daughter!

536
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,125
-Argh!
-Let go!

537
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,501
Damn you!

538
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,588
Take that, Anna! Take that!

539
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,836
Grace.

540
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,421
Grace, just go.

541
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,673
Go back inside.
I'll handle things here. Go.

542
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,509
What are you going to do?

543
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,927
I don't know.

544
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,638
But Sarah won't leave you alone,
so just go.

545
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,390
No! I'll help you!

546
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,100
What?

547
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,894
Grace.

548
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,479
Grace!

549
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,816
Mr. and Mrs. Santos!

550
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,234
Welcome!

551
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,735
Hello, Sally! Good morning!

552
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,904
-Good day! Good day!
-Good morning.

553
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,405
This is my wife.

554
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm Oscar Jimenez from NLEA.

555
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,123
How can I help you?

556
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,208
Is Grace here?

557
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,293
Why? What do you need from her?

558
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,462
I just want to make sure that she's safe.

559
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,798
Her biological mother, Sarah,
is on the loose.

560
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:33,715
What?

561
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,509
Grace!
Sir, over there!

562
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,718
Over there!

563
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,805
I just left her there, sir.

564
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,098
Grace!

565
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,391
Grace?!

566
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,726
Grace!

567
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,811
Grace…

568
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,313
Sir, wait! Grace!

569
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,410
Help!

570
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,704
Somebody help!

571
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:04,913
Help!

572
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,415
Help me!

573
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,625
They locked me up here! He--

574
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,918
Stop yelling.

575
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,211
You witch!

576
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,130
Let me go!

577
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,923
I don't want to eat!

578
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,217
I said let me go!

579
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,763
You know, if you'd just let things be,
we won't be in this situation.

580
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,974
What are you going to do to me?

581
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,309
I won't hurt you.

582
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,603
I'll try not to.

583
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:32,024
Then untie me so we can
settle this once and for all.

584
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,110
I guess you won't change at all.

585
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,404
You just won't leave Grace alone.

586
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,324
Because my daughter is mine.

587
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,701
That kid has ruined my life!

588
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,202
I can't go to jail!

589
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,913
No way!

590
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,414
Really?

591
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,999
Do you hear yourself?

592
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,126
Is that how you see your daughter?

593
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,503
That she's the cause of your suffering?

594
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:57,215
Is that why you're hurting her
and making her suffer?

595
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,009
Grace didn't do anything wrong.

596
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,136
And no matter what you did to her,

597
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,930
she loves you so much.

598
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:08,018
Just admit that you're jealous
because I have a daughter.

599
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,729
Unlike you, I'm a mother.

600
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,107
You have no children,
and no one loves you.

601
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,526
You're alone in life, Anna.

602
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,487
Poor you.

603
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:23,325
You know, if you had
told me you love your daughter,

604
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,828
and that you'd do anything to get her back

605
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,915
and change for the better,

606
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,708
I might have felt sorry for you.

607
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,627
I don't need your pity!

608
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,003
Here's the plan.

609
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,297
You're not leaving this place…

610
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,801
until I'm sure that Grace is okay,

611
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,221
and she's under the care of a good family.

612
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,224
You'll never see her again.

613
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,726
Leave me out of your plans.
You can't do that!

614
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,229
I won't let you win! Never!

615
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,313
Shut up!

616
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,900
After that, I'll give the police
our location.

617
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,318
We'll turn ourselves in.

618
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:01,029
We have to face the consequences
for what we did.

619
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,824
You're the only one who's at fault!

620
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,201
It's all your fault! Hey! Come back!

621
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,327
Anna!

622
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,121
The search for Anna is ongoing.

623
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,331
They'll call once they have an update.

624
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,501
Why did Anna do that?

625
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,128
Tell me about it, Auntie.

626
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,297
Anna might face more
charges because of this.

627
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,800
I can't help but think it's my fault.

628
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,636
Why do you think it's your fault, Julius?

629
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,305
I told Anna that Sarah escaped.

630
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:30,100
And now, Grace is also missing.

631
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:34,312
So, you're saying that Anna
might have went to Grace

632
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:35,605
and kidnapped her again?

633
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,232
I hope not.

634
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:42,154
Julius, why don't we help
in looking for Anna?

635
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,200
It's confirmed that Sarah Banaag is hiding

636
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,411
to escape arrest.

637
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,414
And we're currently hunting
down Anna Sarmiento.

638
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,125
The entire police is in full force.

639
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,627
The President has issued an order

640
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,504
to conduct a national manhunt.

641
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,799
Sir, do you have any leads
about their location?

642
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,593
We're following several leads.

643
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,305
Rest assured we're doing everything we can
to find them.

644
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,308
But what exactly is the reason
they both escaped?

645
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,226
That's what we'll find out

646
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,729
once we have them in our custody.

647
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,523
We also heard that Grace is missing.

648
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,902
Does it have anything to do
with Anna and Sarah's escape?

649
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,697
That's one of the possibilities
we are looking into.

650
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,408
But let me also inform everyone

651
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:31,620
that a reward of one million pesos

652
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,707
will be given to whoever
can give us their location.

653
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:40,087
You can call the police station
nearest you.

654
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,632
This is an urgent call for cooperation,

655
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,885
so we can solve Grace
Banaag's case immediately.

656
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,704
Grace.

657
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:23,922
Let's go.

658
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,216
I'll take you to the shelter.

659
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,009
Mama.

660
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,804
Can I stay here tonight?

661
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,600
I promise I'll go with you
to the shelter tomorrow.

662
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:40,188
I want to sleep beside you tonight.

663
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,821
Just one last time.

664
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:53,618
I just want to experience
sleeping beside you again.

665
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,787
Please, Mama?

666
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,726
I don't want to forget you.

667
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:22,397
I'll hug you tight over and over again.

668
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,779
Do you see the moon over there?

669
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,411
We don't always see it, right?

670
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,081
But it's always there.

671
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,126
Just think of me as the moon.

672
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,378
I'll always be there guiding you.

673
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,383
I want that when you look at the moon,

674
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,388
you'll remember that I love you so much.

675
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,982
I love you so much too.

676
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,016
Mama.

677
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,603
Grace.

678
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,400
We need to go. Please?

679
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,417
You're not going anywhere.

680
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,294
Grace is mine!

681
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:10,797
Grace, run!

682
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,924
Mama, she might get in!

683
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,884
I got this. Go!

684
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,305
Just pretend that we're
playing a game.

685
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:22,600
A game? How could this be a game, Mama?

686
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,936
Just go. Trust me. Hide in the room.

687
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,105
You listen to me and not her, okay?

688
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,482
When I say run, you run.

689
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,027
Take this.

690
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,821
Don't come out unless I call you.

691
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,406
Open the door!

692
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,117
I'll come find you, okay?

693
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,202
Run!

694
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,709
Anna, come out here!

695
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,004
Grace, hurry!

696
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,590
I said open the door! Grace!

697
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,305
Grace.

698
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,391
Grace?

699
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:06,895
Grace!

700
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:16,905
Grace!?

701
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,410
You witch!

702
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,207
Grace!

703
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:31,795
Ow!

704
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,727
Please pick up.

705
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,604
Pick up.

706
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,694
Hello? Please help us.

707
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,211
It's your fault.

708
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,506
You were trying to stop me.

709
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,301
You wouldn't have gotten hurt
if you had given Grace to me.

710
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:22,887
Grace?

711
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,597
Aah!

712
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:27,225
Hey! Let go of me!

713
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,603
I said let go of me!

714
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:31,688
Ma?

715
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,732
Mama.

716
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,026
-Grace.
-Grace.

717
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,612
-Mama.
-Grace.

718
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:41,531
Run! Hurry!

719
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,533
I'll be fine! Go!

720
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,703
-Don't come near her!
-You're a bad person!

721
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,622
Why did you do that to Mama?

722
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:53,001
I'm your mother, not her! Stay there!

723
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,128
-You're bad!
-No.

724
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,797
You said you love me.

725
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:01,301
Why did you do that to someone I love?

726
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,886
-Mama!
-Ow!

727
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:06,598
Don't hurt my daughter!

728
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,104
Mama!

729
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,905
I was selfish my whole life.

730
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,909
I distanced myself from others.

731
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:29,204
Grace was the only one who
taught me how to open myself up.

732
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,289
Please set her free.

733
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,500
Mama!

734
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,127
You're willing to give your life
for my daughter?

735
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,212
Yes.

736
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,297
I'm willing to give my life for her.

737
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,132
I don't care if you kill me.

738
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:43,384
But please set her free.

739
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,931
Set Grace free. I'm begging you.

740
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,599
Set her free?

741
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,935
Why would I do that?
Grace is my daughter.

742
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,312
Our connection runs deep, Anna.

743
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,231
You can't separate us.

744
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,816
Yes, I can't cut the connection
between you two.

745
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,402
But a child is not a parent's property.

746
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,862
Yes, you gave birth to her.

747
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,948
But you don't get to make her miserable!

748
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,282
Miserable?

749
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,200
Huh?

750
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,702
I'm a good mother, Anna!

751
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,913
I can even be considered as an angel!

752
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:16,459
Have you any idea how my mom was?
She's the one who didn't know how to love!

753
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,796
She didn't feed me!

754
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,798
She didn't send me to school!

755
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,633
Look at me!

756
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,426
I got sworn at every morning

757
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,512
and beaten up every night.

758
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,015
I did everything I could for Grace.

759
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,225
But what?

760
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,310
I'm still a bad mother, huh?

761
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,687
I'm still a bad mother?

762
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,023
Even though Grace's father died,

763
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:42,151
I still did my best
to keep our family whole.

764
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,112
I sent her to school

765
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,406
because I didn't want her
to end up like me

766
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,116
who works in a bar.

767
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,535
I just wanted her to be happy!

768
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,120
You wanted her to be happy?

769
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:56,708
No. You just wanted
to make yourself happy!

770
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,626
What are you saying? Huh?

771
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,212
What are you saying?

772
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,880
Come here!

773
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,134
Mama!

774
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,011
What did you just say?

775
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,100
It hurts to hear the truth, right?

776
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,519
But that's the truth.

777
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,314
You're too selfish.

778
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,733
You only think about yourself.

779
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,526
You stayed with Chito

780
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,070
not because you wanted
to give Grace a family

781
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,156
but because you didn't want to be alone!

782
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,533
-No. No!
-That's the truth!

783
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,827
No! That's not true!

784
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,704
That's not true!

785
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,581
That's not true! Take it back!

786
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,626
I said take it back!

787
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,836
Sarah, you're not a perfect mother.

788
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,921
Nobody is.

789
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,716
But if you really love Grace,

790
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,218
you'll set her free.

791
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,428
If you really love her

792
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,722
and you're not only thinking
about yourself,

793
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,932
you'll set your daughter free.

794
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,226
You'll let her have a good life.

795
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,312
-Think about it!
-No!

796
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:02,106
Shut up! Shut up!

797
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,692
-Mama!
-Shut up!

798
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,783
That's enough! Please stop!

799
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,577
Move! Move!

800
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,504
Please stop.

801
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,006
Don't try to escape.

802
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,593
Let's put an end to this, Mama.

803
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:37,892
That's enough. Please stop.

804
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,481
Anna! Anna?

805
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:45,733
Anna!

806
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:46,818
Anna.

807
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,291
Here you go.

808
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,793
This is for you.

809
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,505
Always listen to it, okay?

810
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,009
So you can recover quickly.

811
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,304
Does this have healing powers?

812
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,515
Yes, of course.

813
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,018
Just stay positive.

814
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,194
Here's my notebook.

815
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,113
You can have it, too.

816
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,327
But why?

817
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,412
It's my gift to you.

818
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,083
Thank you for saving me.

819
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,599
You're the one who saved me.

820
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,601
You know, I used to think

821
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,103
I'd be alone for the rest of my life.

822
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:50,107
But you came into my life.

823
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,113
I learned to face everything.

824
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,200
All the pains.

825
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,701
All the hardships.

826
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,706
Now, I have a family.

827
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,086
I'm finally with them.

828
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,592
All thanks to you.

829
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,098
Mama, close your eyes.

830
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,105
I…

831
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,608
I love you so much.

832
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:38,614
Don't worry about me.

833
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,408
From now on,

834
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,995
you won't get hurt anymore.

835
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,332
Thank you for everything, Mama.

836
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,793
You saved me.

837
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,705
Mama, just close your eyes
so you won't get hurt.

838
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,004
"Be happy."

839
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,089
"Smell of rain."

840
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:31,519
The birds…

841
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,731
Flying in the sky

842
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:39,527
Are dear to God

843
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,823
His love doesn't fade

844
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:49,704
The birds that fly in the sky
Are dear to God

845
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,914
His love doesn't fade

846
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:55,501
Don't be sad

847
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,587
Stay positive

848
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,212
Everybody, pass your papers.

849
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,216
How was it? Did you answer everything?

850
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,718
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

851
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,804
It's easy. I'm sure you all did well.

852
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,890
Yes, ma'am. Positive.

853
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:56,187
Teacher Anna, the warden is here.

854
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,400
Teacher Anna.

855
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,903
You're free.

856
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,033
-Teacher Anna, you're free!
-Yay!

857
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:13,079
-I'm happy for you!
-That's good news!

858
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,096
Ma.

859
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:29,280
We have a surprise for you.

860
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:45,713
Mama.

861
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,283
Grace.
