1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,545
Come back to Karamay.

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,840
Help me change
the public's opinion of Anna.

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,717
Help me get the truth out.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,053
Miranda is covering for Anna

5
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:15,641
because Anna is the ex
of Karamay's producer,

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,518
Julius Hernandez.

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,521
I want you to revoke her
access to this building.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,148
I want her fired!

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,526
Before Chito went to Palawan,
he left his truck here.

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,820
I need you to run another blood analysis.

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,364
This is possible evidence
for Grace Banaag's case.

12
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,825
I'm sorry about the news that came out.

13
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,244
I didn't mean for you
to get dragged into this.

14
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,127
Ma, what are you doing here?

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,712
Did you follow me?

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,715
Come on. Let's get out of here.

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:48,841
Ma, wait.

18
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:52,136
Miss Miranda helped us get out of Palawan.

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,639
Didn't I tell you not to trust this woman?

20
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,850
There's no reason for her not to trust me.

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,519
Really, Miranda? Are you sure about that?

22
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,730
Look, this isn't your TV show.

23
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,734
I'm not as easily fooled as your audience!

24
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,320
Weren't you the one who
branded her as a kidnapper?

25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,697
You had the police hunt her down.

26
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,741
You twisted her words in the interview.

27
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,328
And now you're telling me
that she should trust you?

28
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,499
Yes, I've made some mistakes,
and I'm correcting them now.

29
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,335
How about you, Helena?

30
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,422
Have you ever tried
to correct your mistakes?

31
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,097
You're not safe here. Let's go.

32
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:41,811
You're the one who compromised
her safety by coming here!

33
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,729
If I was able to follow you here,

34
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:47,107
what makes you think others can't?

35
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,152
You can't stay here. Come on.

36
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,321
-Where is Grace?
-Mama, calm down.

37
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,323
-Where is she?
-Where else would we go?

38
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,116
Anywhere!

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,036
There are plenty of places you can hide!

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,622
If you want, you can come back to us!

41
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,916
Ma, I've made my decision.

42
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,752
I left Palawan so you could have peace.

43
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,838
So you won't get dragged into my mess!

44
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,798
Just leave me here!

45
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,442
You think Miranda believes you're sorry?

46
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,526
No.

47
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,111
In fact, she's avoiding me.

48
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,654
She left when I spoke to her.

49
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,739
What now?

50
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,825
How can you prove
that your hunch was right?

51
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,119
I wanted to follow her,

52
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,913
but I didn't have a car.

53
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,041
Then you should've rode a broom!

54
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,501
There are other ways
to keep tabs on her, Sarah.

55
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,754
Use your head, you fool!

56
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,714
You're calling me a fool?

57
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,217
Aren't you the one
who hatched a stupid plan

58
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,928
and made yourself wanted?

59
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:40,721
Alright! Fine!

60
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,306
I'm the fool!

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,934
But don't you forget

62
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,519
that we got into this mess
because of your kid.

63
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,355
That's why I'm looking for her!

64
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,316
What, you think
I'm not doing my part here, Chito?

65
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,820
I want to get this over with.
I'm tired of you blaming me.

66
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,823
Who are the people close to Miranda?

67
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,075
What's it to you, huh?

68
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,618
You can't follow her, right?

69
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,204
Then start with those close to her.

70
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,914
That's what I'm trying to say.

71
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,125
Try to get information from them.

72
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,127
All you do is scream.

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,513
What are you planning?

74
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,432
I will clean Anna's name.

75
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,934
Is that really all?

76
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,229
Is that why you hid her from me?

77
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,732
It was her decision
not to tell you where she was.

78
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,652
Because after everything
that has happened,

79
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,237
she still worries about you.

80
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,447
She doesn't want to put you in harm's way.

81
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,199
That's not the reason.

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,410
Anna is different.

83
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,412
You are different.

84
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,205
What is this?

85
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,418
Are you angry? Upset?

86
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,420
You're jealous, aren't you?

87
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,924
Do you think that after just
a few days with you,

88
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,927
Anna will love you the way she loves us?

89
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,555
This conversation is going nowhere.

90
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,514
Let go of me.

91
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,808
Don't be delusional, Miranda.

92
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,312
You can't even tell her the truth.

93
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,649
Yes, I lied.

94
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,903
But you decided to throw her away.

95
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:24,825
You keep rubbing it in my face
that my daughter loves you.

96
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,327
But did you ever love her?

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,540
Because if you did, she wouldn't
have ended up like this.

98
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,043
She doesn't trust anyone.
Not even herself.

99
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,628
She put up such high walls
and won't let anyone in.

100
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:40,424
She's filled with fear and resentment.

101
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,136
Isn't that all because of you?

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,014
Because of what happened with Antonio?

103
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,515
That's not true!

104
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,436
She keeps saying

105
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,023
that she has to atone
for what she has done to you.

106
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,610
What has she done
for you to make her pay, Helena?

107
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,946
What did you do to my daughter?

108
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,825
I never once blamed her
for what happened to Antonio.

109
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,620
I can't do that. I love Anna.

110
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,831
If you really loved Anna, she
wouldn't be in this situation!

111
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,833
Do you understand?

112
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,629
I'm not going
to let her keep beating herself up

113
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,548
over whatever you made her
believe was her fault!

114
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,300
Especially not Antonio's death!

115
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,137
And I'll do whatever it takes
to rid her heart

116
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,808
of all the anger and pain
you caused.

117
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,249
Who is it?

118
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,416
Boss Peke?

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,710
I need you to make
some fake documents.

120
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,630
You got the wrong number.

121
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,048
Boss, I'll do anything.

122
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,216
You can trust me.

123
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:08,137
If I have to call you every day,
hour, or minute, I'll do it.

124
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,555
I'll find you.

125
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,391
My child and I just really need
to leave the country.

126
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,936
Boss?

127
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,604
I'll contact you.

128
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,524
Wait for my message.

129
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,901
Okay.

130
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,498
Who were you talking to?

131
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,709
Who's that "Boss"?

132
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,131
Anna, don't start another problem.

133
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,010
I'm finding a solution.

134
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,602
Anna is with Miss Miranda?

135
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,230
So, what did you do?

136
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,149
What do you think?

137
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,109
I told her to come with me.

138
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,528
But she didn't want to.

139
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,032
She said she and Grace are safer there.

140
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,618
Has Miss Miranda told her the truth?

141
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,827
Not yet.

142
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,707
Miranda must be scared
of how Anna would react.

143
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:25,047
That's why I need to convince
Anna to leave that place.

144
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,343
But if Anna thinks that
she and Grace are safer there,

145
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,136
why tell her to leave?

146
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,555
Because they can't be together.

147
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,644
What if Miranda poisons Anna's mind?

148
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,021
What if they dig up things from the past

149
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,731
that are better off buried?

150
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,316
Like what, Auntie?

151
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,819
Uncle Antonio
and Miss Miranda's relationship?

152
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,822
That's long over, Auntie.

153
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,825
And Uncle Antonio has long been gone.

154
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,328
Still!

155
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,831
They must be separated.

156
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,334
For everyone's sake.

157
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,424
Where's Mommy?

158
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,884
She didn't come in today.

159
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,803
She has something to take care of.

160
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:13,929
That's odd.

161
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,932
We left the house together.

162
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,600
Maybe she's with Miss Carmen.

163
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,519
You think so?

164
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,646
Julius is here.

165
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,439
But he said he's going home early.

166
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,234
Maybe this is the right time
for you to talk.

167
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,444
Okay.

168
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,445
I'll wait for him.

169
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,822
I have to go.

170
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,726
Jess.

171
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,519
What are you doing here?

172
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,606
I…

173
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,444
I was thinking of…

174
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,323
inviting you to dinner
if you're free later.

175
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,035
Maybe next time.

176
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,497
I have a meeting later.

177
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,718
Oh.

178
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,726
Search warrant?

179
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,104
We found a bloody sack in Chito's truck.

180
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,357
A witness also testified that

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,610
they heard Grace screaming the
night before she disappeared.

182
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,196
We just want to find out the truth.

183
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,239
How will you do that?

184
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,533
You think we have surveillance cameras
here?

185
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,702
We have our ways.
Just let us do our jobs.

186
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,038
-Boys.
-Yes, sir.

187
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,343
I found nothing, sir.

188
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,636
Me neither, sir.

189
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,598
See? There's nothing here.

190
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,227
I told you, but you still
made a mess of my room.

191
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,729
You can go now.

192
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,349
I've been waiting here for ages.

193
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,144
I just made sure you didn't bring a cop

194
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,146
and if I could trust you.

195
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,605
Come on. Get in.

196
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,132
Alright.

197
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,926
She's here.

198
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,560
What do you want?

199
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,271
I need a birth certificate
and passport for my child.

200
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,856
That would be 400,000 pesos.

201
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,525
Wait, you said it was only 300,000 pesos.

202
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,319
Let's honor our original deal.

203
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,320
Well…

204
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,447
That's not how we do things.

205
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,616
Now, give me the money.

206
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,537
-Boss, I caught him outside.
-Wait!

207
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,831
-He said he's with her.
-Wait! Wait!

208
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,708
He's with me.

209
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,599
Anna.

210
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,352
What you're doing is dangerous.

211
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,938
I'm aware of that.
But why did you follow me here?

212
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,024
If something happens
to you, what becomes of Grace?

213
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,734
I'm doing this for Grace.

214
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:39,903
Hey.

215
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,324
What, are you just going to
chitchat in front of me, hm?

216
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,118
What did you come here for?

217
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,997
If you'll give me nothing,

218
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,500
I'll just get rid of you.

219
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,627
Sir…

220
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,422
Wait.

221
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,510
How about this? Would this be enough?

222
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:08,723
I'll accept that.

223
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,517
As down payment.

224
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,228
When will I get the documents?

225
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,107
You're still 200,000 pesos short.

226
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,443
But I'll collect that later.

227
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,614
Once your documents are ready,

228
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,700
I'll call you.

229
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,453
Now…

230
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,913
Hand over the watch.

231
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,630
Let me just remind you
that watch has a serial number.

232
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,550
We can report that stolen.

233
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,926
You're quite smart.

234
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,138
Wait for my call.

235
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,646
I'll take any job, ma'am.

236
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,734
If you want, test me.
I'll work for free for a day.

237
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,820
I'll show you how hardworking I am.

238
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,532
How many times do I have to
tell you that we're not hiring?

239
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,243
And even if we were, I won't hire you.

240
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,912
I don't want my bar
to get dragged into your issues.

241
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,832
If only you could bring us
good publicity, but no.

242
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,628
Please don't believe
what you see on TV, ma'am.

243
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:23,131
Those are just made-up stories
to ruin my image.

244
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,843
Miss Miranda will never do that!

245
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,553
That's why she's my idol!

246
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,639
You know what? You should just go.

247
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,432
You're giving me a headache!

248
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,024
Is it true?

249
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,609
The cops searched our house?

250
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:51,034
Mama, Miss Miranda and I
made the spaghetti.

251
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,452
Is it good?

252
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,121
It's too sweet. It might give me diabetes.

253
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,333
We have plenty of other food, Helena.

254
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,751
Just take your pick.

255
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,503
No one's forcing you to eat that.

256
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:05,131
Or better yet, why don't you
just eat dinner at home?

257
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,719
I don't see anything wrong with
wanting to eat with my daughter.

258
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,931
So, I'll do whatever I want
whenever I want.

259
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:19,020
Mama, our teacher chose me
to perform at our school event.

260
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,398
She said she'd put me in front.

261
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,611
She's also inviting the parents
to come and watch.

262
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,740
Oh!

263
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,951
But you don't have to go.

264
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,828
There will be too many people.

265
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,914
No.

266
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,333
I'll go.

267
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,127
Positive, Mama?

268
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,212
Of course. Positive.

269
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,799
Go on. Eat up.

270
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,928
Jessica?

271
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,353
Is this the reason
you're always missing, Mom?

272
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,230
Why you left Palawan?

273
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,233
To protect and help this woman escape?

274
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,736
Jess, let's talk outside.

275
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,113
All my suspicions were true, weren't they?

276
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,532
-This woman is a kidnapper!
-Jessica!

277
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,325
Jess…

278
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,245
I was going to tell you. Believe me.

279
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,538
I tried.

280
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,415
You made me doubt myself.

281
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:25,754
And all along,
you're protecting this criminal!

282
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,131
I wanted to tell you, Jess.

283
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,549
I really tried.

284
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,135
You tried? No, you couldn't!

285
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,345
Because you knew I wouldn't understand!

286
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,640
Because no matter how you
look at it, this is wrong!

287
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,226
Jess, look. Please calm down.

288
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,020
And you're all in on this!

289
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,646
Jessica, that's enough.

290
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,316
Don't blame them. Blame me.
I started all this mess.

291
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,526
Damn right, I'm blaming you!

292
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,030
You put my mom in danger!

293
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,240
You won't get away with this.

294
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,325
Jess?

295
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,035
Jess.

296
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,245
-Je--
-Let me talk to her.

297
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,206
Jess? Jessica!

298
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:02,916
Jess!

299
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,129
Jess, dear. Let's talk this out.

300
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,923
Jess, please!

301
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,343
-Shoot! Damn it!
-Jess! Jess!

302
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,929
Jess! Jess, please, let's talk this out.

303
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,013
Please.

304
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,808
Stop.

305
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,018
Let's talk.

306
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,147
Do you think I'll tolerate this
foolishness from you and Julius?

307
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm calling the police.

308
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,942
Oh, Jess. Jess, no.

309
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,152
No, dear. Stop. Please stop, Jess.

310
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,446
Jess, please let me explain.
Let me explain.

311
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,739
Dear, let me explain.

312
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,200
Alright then. How are you
going to explain this?

313
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,036
What kind of explanation
do you have for what you did?

314
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,997
All your life,

315
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:48,545
you've always prided yourself
on being a good journalist.

316
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,798
You've always been upright
and fearless.

317
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,551
But look what you're doing.

318
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,720
You're not just covering up
for a criminal,

319
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,807
you're also harboring one!

320
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,936
I'm sorry, Jess.

321
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,106
I was scared.

322
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,609
Anna only did…

323
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,737
what she thought was right

324
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,614
in order to save Grace.

325
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,242
She rescued Grace
from Sarah and Chito

326
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,536
because they've been abusing the kid.

327
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,038
Dear…

328
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,331
Is that how it is?

329
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:32,213
You'll cover up a mistake
with another mistake?

330
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,925
Why do you have to
get involved in this, Mom?

331
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,931
Jess, I made a big mistake.

332
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,226
What I did to Anna was a big mistake.

333
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,022
It's my fault she became
a suspect in this case.

334
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,818
I believed Sarah and I helped her.

335
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,821
So before all of this gets out,

336
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,699
I want to clear Anna's name because…

337
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,621
I will not allow my mistake
to be the reason

338
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,123
an innocent person will be punished.

339
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,210
And you think I wouldn't understand that?

340
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,715
This isn't just about Anna.

341
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,427
You lied to me.

342
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,097
You'd rather lie to me
than think about how I'd feel.

343
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,936
Of all people, I'm the one
who can understand you.

344
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,147
I'm the one who can
understand you best, Mom!

345
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,024
Because I'm your daughter!

346
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,151
I'm so sorry. But, dear…

347
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,319
Jess…

348
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,406
I'm begging you, dear.
Please.

349
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,620
Let me fix this, okay?

350
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,539
Please, dear…

351
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,000
Don't tell anyone about what you saw.

352
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,920
I'm begging you, Jess.

353
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,298
Do it for me, dear. Please do it for Mama.

354
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,218
Jess, I love you, my dear.

355
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,636
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,305
I'm so sorry.

357
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,017
I'm so sorry, dear.

358
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,231
The sweetness of Miranda's spaghetti

359
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,651
is the exact opposite
of her daughter's attitude.

360
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,654
Ma, you can't blame Jessica.

361
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,489
She looks up to her mother a lot.

362
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,033
And then she finds out
she's harboring a criminal.

363
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,702
Besides,

364
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,954
her reaction is normal.

365
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,747
It hurts to know that your parents

366
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,416
have lied to you.

367
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,419
That's why you need to leave this place.

368
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,839
First, it was Julius. Then, Miranda.

369
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,882
Now, it's Miranda's daughter.

370
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,759
Stop daydreaming

371
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,012
that they can be trusted.

372
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,514
Ma, I'm not daydreaming.

373
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,975
But you've already made
yourselves at home here.

374
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,643
Grace went back to school

375
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,938
and she even helped Miranda cook.

376
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,149
That Miranda thinks…

377
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,776
she's such a good mother.

378
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,071
Ma, I still haven't changed my mind.

379
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,575
We're still going to move abroad.
But, of course, it's not that easy.

380
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,827
Because you need money.

381
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,039
I was already on it,

382
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,623
but things happened.

383
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,045
Let me see what I can do.

384
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,548
No, Ma. I've already
caused you enough trouble.

385
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,133
Don't worry about it.

386
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,927
Then who are you going to ask for help?

387
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,013
That Miranda again?

388
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,432
Anna.

389
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,726
Will you please listen to me?

390
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:36,230
That Miranda has always
been a horrible person.

391
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,609
Ma, I've been meaning to ask you this.

392
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,196
Did something happen
between you and Miss Miranda?

393
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:50,119
Didn't I tell you that we were
in the same audition before?

394
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,830
It seems like there's more to that story.

395
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,918
Let's not bring back the past.

396
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,130
There are some things
that should just stay there.

397
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,806
Did Grace get scared of Jessica earlier?

398
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,600
Even if she was scared,

399
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,520
I'm sure she wouldn't show it.

400
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,313
Don't worry.

401
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,107
I'm going to talk to Jessica.

402
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,111
No need. It seems like
Miss Miranda has convinced her.

403
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,322
Maybe that's just how it is.

404
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,909
It's hard to convince someone
who's been deeply hurt.

405
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,497
I think we really need to get out of here.

406
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:38,835
We need to get those papers
as soon as possible.

407
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,796
I'm sorry, Anna. But I don't agree
with what you did.

408
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,801
You know, Julius,
if only there was another way.

409
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,432
I'm sorry about your watch. Don't worry.

410
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,351
I'll find a way to get it back.

411
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,562
No, no. That's not what I'm worried about.

412
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,317
What if this situation escalates further?

413
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,113
What if they do something to harm you?

414
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,741
Where will you even get
the money you need?

415
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,034
From Mama.

416
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,413
She said she'll lend me money.

417
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,000
That's what I'm going to use
for the meantime.

418
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,801
Do you have to go now?

419
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,723
Yes, I have to go.

420
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,517
You should go back to sleep.

421
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,520
You're not going to stay
with me and Mama?

422
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,318
Don't worry.

423
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,112
I'll come back, okay?

424
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,823
Come on, go back to sleep.

425
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,513
Miss Jessica.

426
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,642
I'm sorry for the trouble.

427
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,519
I'd just like to ask about Miranda.

428
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:37,912
You?

429
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,706
Why are you together?

430
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,719
I'm sorry, I--

431
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:57,223
I was so busy, I didn't get
to talk to Mom.

432
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,808
Is that so?

433
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,354
It's okay. There's always
another time, right?

434
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,939
Do you need anything else?

435
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,108
I need to get to work.

436
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,818
No.

437
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,406
-What about…
-What is it?

438
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,408
A job opening?

439
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,327
I'm looking for a job right now.

440
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,913
Maybe you know any vacancy.

441
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm a diligent worker. Any job will do.

442
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,222
You know what?

443
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,433
Just stay put.

444
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,228
I'm sure your daughter
will go back to you soon.

445
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,024
Just wait.

446
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,618
Come on, hurry!

447
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,120
Get ready.

448
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,539
Go, go, go. There.

449
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,501
Thank you! That was
a wonderful performance!

450
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,329
What are you doing?

451
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,499
I need a ride. I can't get one.

452
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,417
This isn't a jeepney.

453
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,836
See, I don't want you
to have a hard time.

454
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,713
You've been following me, right?

455
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,382
There's a lot you want to know.

456
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,384
Go on, ask away
while we're on the road

457
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,135
so we can both enjoy the ride.

458
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,930
Gee, thanks. Here, you might be thirsty.

459
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,726
It's not cold.

460
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,816
Remember Grace's clothes
we found in Batangas?

461
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:12,942
Mm.

462
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,735
We found blood on it.

463
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,906
Really?

464
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,409
I just want to know

465
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,619
what exactly happened
on her disappearance.

466
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,454
Why was there blood on her clothes?

467
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,622
I don't know.

468
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,126
I have no idea.

469
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,336
Who knows? Maybe Anna hurt her.

470
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,630
That's why there was blood on her clothes.

471
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,216
I'll give you one last chance, Sarah.

472
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,717
Tell me the whole story.

473
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,720
Did Chito hurt Grace and got carried away?

474
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,099
No. Nothing like that happened.

475
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,935
I'm about to close this case.

476
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,521
If you don't speak up,
you'd better not regret it.

477
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,816
You know what? Forget it.

478
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,526
You're such a party pooper.

479
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:01,907
Hmph!

480
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,409
You guys go ahead.

481
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:47,828
I think they've started.

482
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,707
Hello?

483
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,418
Yes, sir.

484
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,212
Yes.

485
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,798
Okay, sir.

486
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:02,718
Copy that.

487
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,224
Got it.

488
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,624
I'm Principal Suarez.

489
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,336
Miss Valdez called me to help you get in.

490
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,921
I've been looking for you.

491
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,925
Come, I'll show you the way.

492
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,010
-Follow me.
-Okay, thank you.

493
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,015
That cop was just trying to scare you.

494
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,225
He knows nothing.

495
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,852
No, he was acting different today.

496
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:57,606
It's like he's got evidence against us.

497
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,650
What evidence?

498
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,944
Are we hiding Grace? No, right?

499
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,114
Because he thinks you killed the kid!

500
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,198
What?

501
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,243
I killed the kid?

502
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,745
-Yes.
-What do you mean yes, hm?

503
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,039
Why am I the only one
getting blamed for it?

504
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:15,916
Shouldn't it be us?

505
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,627
It's the two of us! You're involved too!

506
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,924
-Does it even matter?
-Yes, it does!

507
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,802
It matters to me, Sarah!

508
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,347
You snitched on me when I got caught.

509
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,515
Remember?

510
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,601
So, who knows?

511
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,812
You might do it again.

512
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,441
No.

513
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,942
I won't do that to you.

514
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,527
Oh, really? Liar!

515
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,823
It just feels like everything
is going wrong.

516
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,743
Grace didn't come back.

517
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:54,705
Miss Miranda doesn't trust me anymore.

518
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,626
You're all I have left, Chito.

519
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,254
I can't lose you.

520
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:05,507
I can't handle losing you too.

521
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,929
Fine.

522
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,224
We'll get through this.

523
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:15,809
Stop crying.

524
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,479
You'll see your daughter soon.

525
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,398
What did the lawyer say?

526
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,611
I don't know.

527
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,032
All she said was to wait.

528
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,618
Grace will come back.

529
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,746
But I've got a bad feeling, Chito.

530
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,706
I think Miss Miranda…

531
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,710
…has something to do
with Anna's disappearance.

532
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,839
That cop is acting suspicious.

533
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,801
We need to know what Jessica knows.

534
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,596
Before it's too late.

535
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,933
For our next performers,

536
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,353
let's all welcome the group
led by Bright Sarmiento,

537
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,521
The Bright Kids.

538
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,439
Let's give them a round of applause.

539
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,900
Go, kids! You can do this!

540
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,306
Go, Bright!

541
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,308
Stay positive!

542
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,104
Come on! Follow me!

543
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,126
Thank you, Bright Kids,

544
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,254
for such an energetic performance!

545
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,131
Now, for our next performer,

546
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,800
let's all welcome the Dino Kids!

547
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,144
You were so good!

548
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:26,231
I thought you weren't coming, Mama.

549
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,817
I promised I would come.

550
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,319
And here I am.

551
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,321
You were amazing!

552
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,913
Good job.

553
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,832
Thank you, Miss Miranda.

554
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,502
What matters is you and Grace are happy.

555
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,545
I'm very happy.

556
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,007
No one has ever watched me
perform at school before.

557
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,219
Sarah didn't come before?

558
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,806
She didn't want to.

559
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,266
She said people would just gossip
about her.

560
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,144
And she was always busy.

561
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,439
I would only waste her time.

562
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,233
But that was before.

563
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,735
Now, I have my Mama Anna.

564
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,403
Thank you.

565
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,824
I'm sorry I couldn't come, Grace.

566
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,910
I had something important to take care of.

567
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:23,205
That's okay.

568
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,208
Thank you again, Miss Miranda.

569
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,712
Not just for getting Grace
into this school,

570
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,258
but for helping me fulfill
my promise to her.

571
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,302
You're welcome.

572
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,014
I'll do anything for you two.

573
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:45,936
Miss Miranda, are you okay?

574
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,105
I'm okay.

575
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,274
Um, I just have
an important call to make.

576
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,900
Sorry. I have to go.

577
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,529
Bye, Miss Miranda! Take care.

578
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,932
I've spoken to the inn's buyer.

579
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,519
You're selling the inn?

580
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,106
They agreed to the price I want.

581
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:35,611
We'll meet in the morning
to settle the payment.

582
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,323
Once I come here with the money

583
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,033
you and Grace should be ready.

584
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,620
Does Princess and Erin
know about this?

585
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,997
The inn is the last thing Papa left us.

586
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,751
I'll explain it to them.

587
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,421
If they find out you're doing this for me,

588
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,632
this will further strain our relationship.

589
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,635
Why? Are you still going to see them?

590
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,096
Isn't this what you want?

591
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,516
To leave us for good?

592
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,353
I thought you wanted to help us.

593
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,520
Why does it seem like

594
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,898
you just want to get rid of us?

595
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,485
I'm doing this to save you.

596
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,446
Ma, don't sell the inn anymore.

597
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:23,033
I'll find a way to get money.

598
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,328
What are you saying?
This is what you want.

599
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,706
I'm giving you a chance, Anna.

600
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,335
I'll give you the money back.

601
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,630
The inn is more important.

602
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,132
Forget about the inn.

603
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,301
We need to focus on

604
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,804
getting you out…

605
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,432
…of Miranda's house.

606
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,686
You don't need that woman's help.

607
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,022
Ma…

608
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,941
Miss Miranda is a good person.

609
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,818
She has done so much for us.

610
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,611
She's been kind to me.

611
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,907
Did you ever wonder why she's being nice?

612
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,618
She needs something from you.

613
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,745
Open your eyes, Anna.

614
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,038
Ma, tell me the truth.

615
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,499
Why do you seem so angry
at Miss Miranda?

616
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,835
What is going on?

617
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:18,547
Because I can't just turn my back

618
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,508
on a person who has helped me so much.

619
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,516
Do you really want to know?

620
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,812
She was your father's mistress.

621
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:44,698
Anna.

622
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,033
Here's the money.

623
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,577
-Where's Grace?
-She's upstairs. I'll wake her up.

624
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,120
Get her later. We have to go.

625
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,329
What's going on?

626
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,042
They're leaving.

627
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,419
Wait. Anna, what's wrong?

628
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,421
Why did you really help us?

629
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:03,300
You still don't trust me?

630
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,968
Come on, Anna. Let's get Grace.

631
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,219
Wait, hold on, Anna.

632
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,096
Let's talk about this.

633
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,808
Were you my father's mistress?

634
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,521
Is that why you're helping me?

635
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,233
Hmm?

636
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:25,405
Are you doing this so I'll forgive you?

637
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,699
That's not true.

638
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,619
You know, I believed you.

639
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,953
I trusted you.

640
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,706
You should've told me
the truth from the start!

641
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,209
I am not a homewrecker.

642
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,629
Yes, your father and I had an affair.

643
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:44,007
But I never became his mistress.

644
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,384
You were his mistress!
You stole him from me!

645
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,220
Do not speak to my mother that way!

646
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,514
I said nothing to Anna
about what happened.

647
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,932
I stayed quiet.

648
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,518
But you had to go and smear my name?

649
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,604
Now you're dragging Anna
into your web of lies!

650
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,648
You want me to tell her the truth about

651
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,024
who Antonio loved first?

652
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,651
Don't listen to her. Let's go.

653
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,821
I have let this slide
far too many times!

654
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,823
But Anna should know the truth!

655
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,032
The whole truth!

656
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,909
Alright! What's the truth?

657
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,429
Miss Miranda?

658
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,723
Hi. Good afternoon, sir.

659
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,401
Ashley?

660
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,029
Carmen.

661
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,031
What are you doing here?

662
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,618
Ah…

663
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,453
What can I do for you?

664
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:59,833
I heard you're one of
the best private investigators.

665
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,543
You have high profile clients.

666
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,796
Politicians, celebrities, reporters.

667
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,216
I can't confirm that.

668
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,718
I know. I know.

669
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,553
That's why you're one of the best.

670
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,306
Because you're very professional,
very discreet.

671
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,309
Alright. Sit down.

672
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:18,810
Have a seat.

673
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,899
So…

674
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:26,943
What's the case?

675
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,320
My boyfriend.

676
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,032
I think he's cheating on me.

677
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,117
And I need you to follow him.

678
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,452
Can you do that?

679
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,828
That's easy.

680
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:37,829
Really?

681
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,207
Oh, thank you.

682
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,543
Thank you.

683
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,045
-Oh my gosh!
-Hey!

684
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,130
I'm so sorry!

685
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,341
-I'm so sorry!
-It's okay. It's okay.

686
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,342
-I'm sorry.
-Uh…

687
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,509
Excuse me.

688
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,320
Hello?

689
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,113
Ms. Jessica Valdez?

690
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,240
Yes, speaking.

691
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,824
According to our file,

692
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,244
you are Miss Miranda's
emergency contact.

693
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,120
She's in the hospital now.

694
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,830
What? What hospital?

695
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,750
Don Diego General Hospital at Rizal.

696
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,210
Yes, I know where that is.

697
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,595
Thank you.

698
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,814
Get in!

699
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,320
Follow Jessica!

700
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,426
Is this the fastest you can go, RJ?

701
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,344
We're going to lose Jessica.

702
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,848
Did you really have to get
such a junk car?

703
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,099
Wow, really?

704
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,768
Can you afford a nicer car?

705
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:27,689
You're lucky I convinced
someone to drive us.

706
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,441
Sorry.

707
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,151
You know what's at stake.

708
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,320
If Jessica is going to see Miss Miranda,

709
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,530
then it's possible that we'll find Anna.

710
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,700
Turn left! Turn left!

711
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,371
This can't be!

712
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,831
Where are you going?

713
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,750
-I need to follow her!
-Sarah!

714
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,418
I need to follow Jessica!

715
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,712
-Taxi!
-You wrecked my car!

716
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,630
Look at my car!

717
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,633
Follow that black car!

718
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,220
You look familiar.

719
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,514
I saw you on TV!

720
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,726
You're that wanted kidnapper!

721
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,022
What's going on here?

722
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:10,607
Go after him.

723
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:19,949
Anna.

724
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,201
What happened to Mommy?

725
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:22,452
She's in pain.

726
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,829
But don't worry,
the doctor is examining her.

727
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:27,415
Uh, miss, I have a question.

728
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:28,625
What's that?

729
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,709
Uh…

730
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,507
Did people see you here?

731
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,134
No. My mom brought her here.

732
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,512
I just came to make sure
Miss Miranda is safe.

733
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,098
What really happened? Why is she sick?

734
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,683
I don't know.

735
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,519
There was a commotion back at home,

736
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,312
then her stomach started to hurt.

737
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:52,524
A commotion? So this is your fault?

738
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,859
No one wanted this
to happen.

739
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,821
Can we wait till what the doctor says
before you blame me?

740
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,280
When are you going to stop?

741
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,990
Once my mom is dead?

742
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,535
Leave the rest house.

743
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,745
I don't care where you end up.

744
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:08,415
Sleep in the fields of
San Rafael for all I care.

745
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,625
But I want you out of the house.

746
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,419
Get out of our lives.

747
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,255
Don't worry, we won't be
staying in your lives for long.

748
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,049
This is not a warning, Anna.
This is a threat.

749
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,220
Mister.

750
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,264
Do you know where San Rafael is?

751
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:28,143
If I see even a strand
of your hair or that kid's,

752
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,812
I won't hesitate to have you arrested.

753
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,440
After everything I've been through,

754
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:35,525
do you really think your words scare me?

755
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,527
My life's at risk, but I'm here

756
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,113
to make sure Miss Miranda is safe!

757
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,907
She showed me kindness,
so I'm doing the same for her.

758
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:03,636
Hey!

759
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,055
-Where are you going?
-Don't try to fight back!

760
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:11,603
Anna!

761
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,903
You know, Julius, I don't want trouble.

762
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:25,033
I just want to know
how Miss Miranda's doing,

763
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,327
but I know Jessica won't agree.

764
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,539
I'll do whatever it takes
to find out Miranda's condition.

765
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,624
Don't worry.

766
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,337
You know what? Let me
take you to the rest house.

767
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,132
We'll be leaving soon anyway.

768
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,094
Just tell Miss Miranda thank you.

769
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,021
Grace's and my papers are finalized,

770
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,689
and they want to meet up today.

771
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,108
But, Anna, I've thought it through.

772
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,738
I want to use my savings for that.

773
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,906
Julius.

774
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,409
Don't do that. That's your savings.

775
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,412
I told you already, Mama's helping me.

776
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,122
It's covered now.

777
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,500
Anna, return that to Auntie.

778
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,627
I'll take care of it.

779
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,424
I got myself into this mess anyway.

780
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,302
Anna, you don't have
to do this alone, okay?

781
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,306
I'm with you.

782
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,272
I just don't want you caught up
in this mess.

783
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,731
Anna.

784
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,821
I'm not asking for anything in return.

785
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,824
Please, let me help you…

786
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,327
and stay by your side.

787
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:54,497
Please.

788
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,519
Are we leaving now?

789
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,314
Yes, you're heading to Hong Kong.

790
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:23,610
How? Mama's not here yet.

791
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,738
She'll be back soon.

792
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,656
She's just taking care of something.

793
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,826
I'll wait for her outside.

794
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,831
Okay, but call me
as soon as she gets here.

795
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:38,708
I'll just finish this.

796
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,426
Anna, we've been here for long.

797
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,012
They'll be here soon.

798
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,225
Sir, I've spoken to my informant.

799
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,228
I'll send you their location pin.

800
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:04,025
I'm sure the person making
fake documents is with them.

801
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,236
Thank you, sir.

802
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,030
Make sure they'll get caught.

803
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:11,616
Who are you talking to?

804
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,876
No one followed you, right?

805
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,684
Are you having someone arrested?

806
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,018
I heard everything!

807
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,021
Mom, please stay out of this!

808
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,232
What did you do?

809
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,442
Miranda, Jessica, can you not fight here--

810
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:49,445
Tell me! What did you do to Anna?

811
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:50,822
It's too late, Mom.

812
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,616
They've already made
fake papers for Grace.

813
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,535
The police know their location!

814
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:56,911
She's getting arrested!

815
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,544
Stop this madness!
Call the police back now!

816
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:05,545
-Hurry up!
-No!

817
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,213
No! I won't do it!

818
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,549
That woman has blinded you,

819
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,135
and I won't let her drag you down too!

820
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:13,928
What are you doing?

821
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,222
Stopping you from making a huge mistake!

822
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:17,724
Huge mistake?

823
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,440
-Hello, Julius!
-Mom!

824
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,733
Get out of there--

825
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:27,900
Jessica!

826
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,319
Mom, why?

827
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,822
Boss, the cops are here!

828
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,198
Bullshit.

829
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,533
Give me that!

830
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,534
-Wait!
-Let's go!

831
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,910
-Wait!
-Come on!

832
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,749
Why do you care so much about Anna?

833
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,625
I don't understand you anymore!

834
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,128
Because Anna is my daughter!

835
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,796
She's your sister!

836
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:06,647
W-What--

837
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,524
W-What are you talking about?

838
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,318
Anna is not my sister.

839
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,028
Dear.

840
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,030
She is your sister.

841
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:18,159
I hired an investigator
and Helena confirmed it.

842
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,327
-No--
-It turns out…

843
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,412
…her father took her from the orphanage

844
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:24,248
No! No! This cant be!

845
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:25,249
I'm sorry.

846
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,126
Dear…

847
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,505
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you sooner.

848
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,007
I know how much you hate her.

849
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,010
I don't hate her…

850
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,346
I despise her!

851
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,223
I despise her, Mom!

852
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:41,933
I can't accept her!

853
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,143
Anna is not my sister!

854
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:46,604
She is not my sister!

855
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,231
No!

856
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,610
I need to talk to Anna.

857
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,826
Men, check the area.

858
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,799
Is this the place?

859
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,228
Mama?

860
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:31,524
Grace!

861
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,027
Dear…

862
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,617
Grace!

863
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,794
You've been caught planning
Grace's kidnap-for-ransom.

864
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,798
You even said you'd kill her
if you didn't get the money.

865
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:59,510
Torture me all you want…

866
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:02,013
but I can't give you Grace.

867
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,723
She disappeared from me.

868
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,725
Sarah herself said it!

869
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:07,435
Here!

870
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:11,898
This is her daughter's clothing,
and there's blood on it.

871
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:16,402
That means she was injured or hurt!

872
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:22,199
Are you saying I hurt her?

873
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,329
Here, this sack was found in your van,

874
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:28,414
also with bloodstains.

875
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:32,001
It matches the blood found
on your clothes!

876
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,714
We ran a DNA test on all the evidence,

877
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,215
and it's all the same blood.

878
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:42,887
Grace's blood, the sack,
and the blood on your clothes!

879
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,224
What now? Are you still going to lie?

880
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:48,935
You can't escape this, Chito!

881
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,728
Tell us, where did you take Grace?

882
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,396
I didn't take her anywhere!

883
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,027
Yes!

884
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,112
I put her in the sack!

885
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,199
But she disappeared.

886
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:07,328
She just vanished! I have
no idea where she went!

887
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,913
What's that? Magic?

888
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,707
Chito, you're going to jail!

889
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,294
Tell us what you did to Grace!

890
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,631
It was Sarah.

891
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:26,347
Sarah was the one who hurt Grace!

892
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,934
She beat the child that day.
She nearly killed her.

893
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,436
She's the real culprit, not me!

894
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,313
It's her, not me!

895
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,907
Grace! Dear!

896
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,411
Grace!

897
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,705
Grace, dear!

898
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,253
Uh, Grace, do you want
to play hide-and-seek?

899
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,629
Come on, let's play!

900
00:54:58,713 --> 00:54:59,714
We can play it.

901
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:00,840
Uh…

902
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,925
I'll be the one to seek, okay?

903
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,427
No, I don't want to.

904
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:09,223
You won't see Grace anymore.

905
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,520
What do you mean?

906
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,231
I'm not Grace.

907
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,111
I'm Bright.

908
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,908
Grace, stop playing around!
Come out right now!

909
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,494
Stop messing around!

910
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,748
Come out now before I lose my temper!

911
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:34,832
Let's go home!

912
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,501
Grace is gone.

913
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,300
She's dead.

914
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,803
She's in heaven.

915
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,224
She fell into the sea during a storm.

916
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,517
Cut it out!

917
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,311
You are my daughter!

918
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,439
Don't you know how much
trouble you're causing?

919
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,525
My mother is Mama Anna!

920
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:03,819
Anna?

921
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,907
After everything I've sacrificed for you?

922
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,744
After I raised you alone when
your father died in an accident,

923
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,537
this is what I get?

924
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:14,830
Get out of there!

925
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:21,003
Aren't you happy that Grace is gone?

926
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:25,424
Didn't you always say she was a burden?

927
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:26,926
Yes!

928
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,428
But what did I do?

929
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:32,640
I raised you, I cared for you!

930
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,101
You left me alone.

931
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,063
You let me go hungry.

932
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:44,026
You let me live filthy.

933
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,696
You let Uncle Chito hurt me!

934
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:51,117
He even beat me up!

935
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:54,829
So, what now? You mad at me? Huh?

936
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,288
You don't love me anymore?

937
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm not mad at you…

938
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,337
…but I don't love you anymore.

939
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,340
Because you're not my mother anymore!

940
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,717
You're just Miss Sarah now.

941
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,431
I'm happy with Mama Anna.

942
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:21,897
You can now be happy too
because I'm no longer with you.

943
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:24,733
That's what you want? Huh?

944
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,902
You think I'll stop you?

945
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,363
You ungrateful brat!

946
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,825
Don't you dare come back to me!

947
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,244
Don't ever come back! I won't accept you!

948
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,121
I won't take you back!

949
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:57,933
I know where Anna is.

950
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:00,603
Grace, come with me.

951
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,024
No!

952
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,612
Sir, don't take me from my mama, please.

953
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:13,407
You asked for evidence, right?
I've got it now.

954
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:17,912
This is my chance to fix things
before it's too late.

955
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,039
1997?

956
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,625
Jessica is almost the same age as me.

957
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,543
That's not Jessica.

958
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:26,212
Something happened to Mama.

959
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,546
Who are you messaging?

960
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,215
You know, I'm so sick of you!

961
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:32,927
When Papa died,
you should've thrown her out!

962
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,846
It wasn't her fault Papa died!

963
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:36,931
It was Mama.

964
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,141
I know you're overwhelmed

965
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:41,352
with everything you've learned about me.

966
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:45,022
I'm the one who kidnapped Grace Banaag.
