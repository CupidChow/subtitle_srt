1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:02,044
Hello?

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:03,295
I know where Anna is.

3
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,714
She's still in San Rafael.

4
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,632
Did you tell him where my sister is?

5
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:09,301
Grace, come with me.
I don't want you to get hurt.

6
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:14,140
Sir, don't take me away from Mama.

7
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,726
If you plan to give me away,

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,853
can you just give me back to her, sir?

9
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,438
You're ruining your career.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,151
This is my chance to make
it up to her, while I still can.

11
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,736
1997?

12
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,447
So Jessica and I are almost the same age.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,532
That's not Jessica.

14
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,117
Who are you texting?

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,618
I'm getting tired of you!

16
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,328
When Papa died,

17
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,539
you should've abandoned us!

18
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,750
Stop blaming Anna,

19
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,836
because she had nothing to do
with what happened to Papa!

20
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:44,837
It's Mama's fault!

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,131
Anna, forgive me.

22
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,843
I know you're confused
about what you heard about me.

23
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,928
But that's not true.

24
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:57,433
I kidnapped Grace Banaag.

25
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,944
You found yourself in a tight spot, huh?

26
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,529
Anna is here!

27
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,656
She's here!

28
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,825
You liar!

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,120
You told me you'd let Grace and I go!

30
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,248
You've brought so many people into this.

31
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,834
I lost everything because of you.

32
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,419
I lost my child!

33
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,754
I lost Chito!

34
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,755
Now, he's in jail!

35
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,590
I won't let you get away with this.

36
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,841
If I'm miserable,

37
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,427
I'll make all our lives miserable as well!

38
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,387
I'll ruin your life too!

39
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,431
You know, I used to feel sorry for you,

40
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,184
because I thought you just
made some wrong decisions.

41
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,936
I thought you could still change.

42
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,980
But after everything you've done,
I realize you're hopeless,

43
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,315
because you're selfish!

44
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,734
All you think about is yourself!

45
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,111
That's why your child
turned her back on you!

46
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,324
Ouch!

47
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,452
What?

48
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,663
Do you enjoy hearing the harsh truth, huh?

49
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,624
You're a worthless mother!

50
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,251
Let your child go!

51
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,335
Shut your mouth!

52
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,921
I won't let you get away,
because whatever you say,

53
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,422
you took my child from me.

54
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,634
And you still broke the law!

55
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,554
Fine. I may be wrong.

56
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,347
But the difference between the us,

57
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,642
is I did everything for Grace,
for your child.

58
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,853
I wanted to save her. What about you?

59
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,230
What did you do?
You were ruining her life!

60
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,399
You made her miserable!

61
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,110
Anna Grace?

62
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,947
Stay here!
Where do you think you're going?

63
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,907
Huh? Stay here!

64
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,329
Anna is here!

65
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,416
Anna's right here! Help!

66
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,001
Anna!

67
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,845
You didn't do anything wrong.

68
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,597
It's Mama's fault!

69
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,935
It's her fault that happened to Papa.

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,131
Uh, you should get some rest, Ma.

71
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,927
Dear, please forgive me.

72
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,312
I'm still hurt, Ma.

73
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,900
But I know…

74
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:39,029
…that someday, I'll forgive you.

75
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,908
Because you're still my mother.

76
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,328
And, Ma, I love you so much.

77
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,497
But I also love Anna.

78
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,710
And I'll forever be guilty
for what happened to her.

79
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,004
I'm scared.

80
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,133
I'm afraid of…

81
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,510
…what Anna will do next.

82
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,637
Why, Ma?

83
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,307
Because you're afraid she'll tell on you?

84
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,022
I'm afraid…

85
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,400
…we'll lose her.

86
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,612
Yes.

87
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,824
I admit…

88
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,329
…I blamed her for everything
that happened to us.

89
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,918
There's a part of me that used to think,

90
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,004
would that have happened to us…

91
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,799
…if she was never with us.

92
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,012
Why would you think that, Ma?

93
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,431
Is it because she's adopted?

94
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,933
That's not her fault.

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,938
Erin,

96
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,733
whether you believe it, or not,

97
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,735
I love your sister.

98
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,912
Hello?

99
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,415
Uh, Miss Sarmiento,
have you heard from Anna?

100
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,750
Why?

101
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,335
Sarah saw her.

102
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,920
What happened?

103
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,964
She escaped. But the
police are looking for her.

104
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,843
Please tell me when you find Anna.

105
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,137
Update me when you find her.

106
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,722
All right.

107
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,724
Thank you.

108
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,228
Ma.

109
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,107
You need to see what Miss Miranda did.

110
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,235
Huh? What did she do?

111
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,029
I did it.

112
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,742
I kidnapped Grace Banaag.

113
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,245
No! What is she doing?

114
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,247
I've been trying to call her.

115
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,832
Everyone's looking for her.

116
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,750
But she won't answer my calls.

117
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,127
Jess, this is bad.

118
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,421
I understand Miss Miranda's
trying to protect Anna.

119
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,298
But this is on a different level.

120
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,551
She admitted to committing a crime.

121
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,219
She could end up in prison.

122
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,847
I need to talk to Mommy, Thomas.

123
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,223
How?

124
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,519
I think I have an idea where she is.

125
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,609
Mommy.

126
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,197
Mommy!

127
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,021
Where have you been? It's late.

128
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,116
I know you're upset with me.

129
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,828
But you'll have to talk to me eventually.

130
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,914
Please, talk to me.

131
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,546
You want to know where I was?

132
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,298
I met with a lawyer, Ma.

133
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,636
And I told him what you did.

134
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,727
So you want me to go to jail?

135
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,938
Because of you…

136
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,940
…Papa died.

137
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,901
-I didn't say that!
-Oh, please, Ma!

138
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,237
Do you think…

139
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,324
…it's easy for us
to get over Papa's death?

140
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,535
All right.

141
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,334
I understand.

142
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,215
But please take care of Erin, okay?

143
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,928
When will the police get here?

144
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,021
The police won't arrest you.

145
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,234
The lawyer said…

146
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,905
…they can reopen
the case on Papa's death.

147
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,201
But I can't prove what happened…

148
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,037
…if there are no other witnesses.

149
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,916
And I'm sure Erin won't do that to you.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,627
Because no matter what you did,

151
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,715
she still loves you.

152
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,013
Are you happy now, Ma?

153
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,017
You're safe, and you won't go to jail.

154
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,936
How can you say that?

155
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,106
Ever since your father died,

156
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,401
my conscience has been bothering me.

157
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,821
So now, whether I go to jail or not,

158
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,700
what I've been experiencing
is worse than serving life.

159
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,833
Princess?

160
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,211
Princess.

161
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,132
Forgive me.

162
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,926
Please forgive me.

163
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,430
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,029
Miss Miranda?

165
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,322
Grace?

166
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,451
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,828
The nerve of you to ask me that.

168
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,331
This is our family's home.

169
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,042
Jessica, I don't want to argue with you.

170
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,335
Why?

171
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,128
Are you still not satisfied?

172
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,214
Mommy already cleared your name.

173
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,258
I didn't know she would do that.

174
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,720
I don't know what you did to trick my mom.

175
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,431
Jessica, you know your mom.

176
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,641
She's smart.

177
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,226
Do you think I can trick her?

178
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,936
Enough, Anna!

179
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,731
How can you let this happen?

180
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,401
Why do you have to ruin my mom's life?

181
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,278
-I didn't ask her to do that.
-But she did!

182
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,656
Because you don't want to leave!

183
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,616
As long as you're her responsibility,

184
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,992
she'll cover for you!

185
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,621
Are you going to use her
until nothing's left to her,

186
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,914
not even her dignity?

187
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:46,998
That's not true!

188
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,043
All you do is take, take, take!

189
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,628
From Julius, Mommy,

190
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,547
and from all the people around you!

191
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,548
Don't worry!

192
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,758
I will make sure to reciprocate your help!

193
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,844
I know how to repay debt of gratitude!

194
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,929
-Grace!
-They're not there!

195
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,931
Mommy isn't here, neither is Julius!

196
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,516
Grace!

197
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,518
I told you they're not here!

198
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,112
Miss Miranda?

199
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,698
Are you just going to leave?

200
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,825
Yes.

201
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,327
Sorry if I made you worry, Grace.

202
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,539
Where's Julius?

203
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,001
He's talking to the doctor.

204
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,044
Why?

205
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,130
Does anything hurt?

206
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,799
I really made you worried, huh?

207
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,509
Sorry.

208
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,804
Why are we in the hospital?

209
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,098
I'm sick.

210
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,517
But I will recover soon.

211
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,935
Really?

212
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,731
While I'm recovering,

213
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,651
can you keep this for me?

214
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,236
The bracelet?

215
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,406
-Yes.
-This is our secret, right?

216
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,201
Yes, it's still a secret.

217
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,203
Just in case…

218
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,624
I can't tell Anna…

219
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,503
I also have a bracelet like hers,

220
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,506
can you tell her for me

221
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,799
when I'm not with you anymore?

222
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,718
Why?

223
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,347
Are you leaving? Where are you going?

224
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,431
No.

225
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,226
No, I'm not going anywhere.

226
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,437
Just in case.

227
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,732
Can you promise me?

228
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,400
Okay. Positive.

229
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,237
Thank you, Grace.

230
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,837
Hello, Julius?

231
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,297
Why weren't you answering?

232
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,882
I kept calling you last night.

233
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,551
Even Jessica called you.

234
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,219
Julius, where are you?

235
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,845
You're with Jessica?

236
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,389
Yes, she's here at the house.

237
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,392
I'm sorry. I had a lot to take care of.

238
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,519
We're in a hospital.

239
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,104
Grace and Miranda are with me.

240
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,147
Hospital?

241
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,899
Why are you there? What happened?

242
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,109
Is Grace alright?

243
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,652
Yes, she's okay.

244
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,114
I'll message you the address.

245
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,199
Julius, how's Mommy?

246
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,828
Jess, you need to get here
as soon as possible, okay?

247
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,413
Let's talk here.

248
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,207
I have to go.

249
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,298
Did you tell anyone that we're here?

250
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,215
No!

251
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,134
But the police are looking for you.

252
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,428
So it's possible
that the police are checking

253
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,638
all the properties connected to my mother.

254
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,724
Bring your car to the back. Now.

255
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,912
Did you call Jessica?

256
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:14,706
Yes.

257
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,125
She and Anna are together.

258
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,169
They're on their way here.

259
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,795
Julius.

260
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,548
Why did you do that?

261
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,300
Miranda, Jessica needs…

262
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,636
…and deserves to be by your side.

263
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,014
Look, I know you're sick.

264
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,933
I've talked to Carmen.

265
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,437
She told me to bring you here.

266
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,731
-Julius--
-I talked to your doctor.

267
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,107
Julius…

268
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,943
I don't need pity.

269
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,446
You just don't want to look weak
to other people.

270
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,323
But Jessica is your daughter.

271
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,533
Miranda, you need to let her help you.

272
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,702
Mom?

273
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,246
Mom, are you okay? What happened?

274
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,915
-Are you okay?
-Ah…

275
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,917
Yes, dear.

276
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,214
I'm just dizzy. I'm really…
I'm really fine.

277
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,716
Julius is just a bit…

278
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,011
dramatic. So he brought me here.

279
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,349
But I think it's for the best

280
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,851
because I'm friends with the doctor here.

281
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:21,398
The doctor let me stay here.

282
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,150
We can hide here.

283
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,736
Why did you say you kidnapped Grace?

284
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,906
You only made it worse for yourself.

285
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,537
Because I realized that…

286
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,209
I have seen everything.

287
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,920
I have been through my own…

288
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,134
highs and lows, but Grace…

289
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,097
Her life is just beginning.

290
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,103
When I helped you,

291
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,398
I wasn't just helping you.

292
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,526
I thought I would also try to…

293
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,531
…give Grace the kind of life
that she deserves.

294
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,117
Is that really it?

295
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,122
Anna, what's going on?

296
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,834
I don't know who to trust anymore.

297
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,337
Uh, did something happen when you left?

298
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,299
Anna…

299
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,014
Y-You can trust me.

300
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,102
Mama.

301
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,812
Grace.

302
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,737
I know you were so worried

303
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,530
that we took her.

304
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,033
I'm glad you're safe.

305
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,037
The police came to the house
but we were able to escape.

306
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,708
Mama, did you miss me?

307
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,629
So much.

308
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,728
Mama?

309
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,605
Why are you sad?

310
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm just sad…

311
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,534
I'm just sad because…

312
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,623
my loved ones,
the people I owe my life to…

313
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,628
They…

314
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:54,008
They chose to hurt me
to protect themselves.

315
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,346
Did someone pick a fight with you?

316
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,308
Tell me who it is.
I'll get back at them for you.

317
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,103
You don't have to do that.

318
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,734
But Grace?

319
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,822
Can you promise me

320
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,908
that no matter what happens…

321
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,829
you'll tell me everything?

322
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,916
Don't ever lie to me, okay?

323
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,052
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

324
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,596
We're excited for you, ma'am.

325
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,055
-Thank you.
-You deserve it.

326
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,724
-Thanks!
-Congrats again!

327
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,850
-Excuse us.
-Thanks.

328
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,934
Sarah.

329
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,936
-Mm! Nice!
-Hi.

330
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,939
They got your face on a huge screen!

331
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,774
They even made standees of you!

332
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,484
You're going to replace Miranda?

333
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,944
Well, who else could it be?

334
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,322
She admitted to have kidnapped
your daughter,

335
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,824
so that is a no-go for our show.

336
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,409
Aren't you going to thank me?

337
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,536
For what?

338
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,996
Acting clueless, are you?

339
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,206
You don't remember?

340
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,584
You destroyed Miranda's image

341
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,252
because I told you everything.

342
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,921
Mm-hmm. You're right.

343
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:13,922
Uh…

344
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,549
Of course.

345
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,927
But can you keep it down?
What do you want?

346
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,219
Why are you here?

347
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,096
I need your help.

348
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,849
This can't end with Miranda
taking all the blame.

349
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,186
Anna can't get away with this.
She deserves jail time.

350
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,896
Okay. What do you want me to do?

351
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,022
I don't know.

352
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,567
I can't do all the thinking, Ashley.
You're smart, right?

353
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,819
Well, what I know is she had
an investigator

354
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,738
do a background check on Anna.

355
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,823
I found some documents…

356
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,409
in her investigator's office.

357
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,411
I can check them.

358
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,080
I'll get back to you

359
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,290
if I find anything we can use
against Anna.

360
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,625
Good enough for you?

361
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,502
Mm-hmm. I'll come with you.

362
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,008
Grace?

363
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,135
Mama.

364
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,429
What's that?

365
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,348
Huh?

366
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,808
It's nothing.

367
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,147
Grace, remember our promise?

368
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,358
You promised not to hide anything from me.

369
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,530
But…

370
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,118
I also promised her…

371
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,621
that I'll only tell you our secret

372
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,917
if she doesn't get the chance
to tell you herself.

373
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,837
Sorry, Mama.

374
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,798
Who are you talking about?

375
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,219
Miss Miranda.

376
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,036
Who were you talking to, dear?

377
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,622
What happened?

378
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,917
Is it true?

379
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,297
You have cancer?

380
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,216
Jess…

381
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,721
I asked a doctor about your meds.

382
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:31,100
They said those meds
are prescribed to patients…

383
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,020
with colon cancer.

384
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,230
Jessica…

385
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,901
Mom, please don't lie to me.

386
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,403
Dear…

387
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,997
I am so sorry, dear.

388
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,336
I didn't want you to find out this way.

389
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,715
How could you keep this from me?
Why didn't you tell me?

390
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,427
I could've helped you through this.

391
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,431
I didn't want to burden you.

392
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,729
It's not as if I'm going to die.

393
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,733
I'm going to get treatment.

394
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,402
When?

395
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,200
You've been spending
all your time with Anna.

396
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,412
You know why I'm doing this, right?

397
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,331
But she put herself in that mess!

398
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,125
You didn't need to get involved!

399
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,212
I'm just making it up to her
while I still can.

400
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,926
She wouldn't be in this situation

401
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:51,097
and she wouldn't have had
to suffer all her life…

402
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,226
had I…

403
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,814
had I not given her away.

404
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,527
I'm a mother, Jess.

405
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:10,032
A mother who made a huge mistake.

406
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:14,620
One day, you'll understand…

407
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,416
-…when you become a mom.
-No.

408
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:23,421
I would never understand you, Mom.

409
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:29,135
Because now, you're not thinking clearly.

410
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,804
You're in pain.

411
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,934
You need to focus on your treatment,

412
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,020
not on Anna.

413
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,816
If I fail to help her,

414
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,197
please help her, dear.

415
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,034
I know this is asking a lot.

416
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,328
But, dear…

417
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:01,417
I want you two to patch
things up before I'm gone.

418
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,127
Ma.

419
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,216
Please, baby.

420
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,011
Do it for me, dear.

421
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,812
Here's the boyfriend's photo.

422
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,314
His name is--

423
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,319
Ma'am, I'm sorry but…

424
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,821
I know you.

425
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,826
You're the one who replaced
Miranda Valdez, right?

426
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,830
I know that you're here

427
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,917
because you want to get
information about her.

428
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,426
It's not about Miranda.

429
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,096
It's about Anna.

430
00:25:56,097 --> 00:26:00,226
Miranda asked you
to investigate on Anna, right?

431
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,603
What do you know about her?

432
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,733
And why should I tell you?

433
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,653
Because I'm hiring you. It's your job.

434
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,948
Don't worry, I'll pay you
just like Miranda did.

435
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,032
Ma'am.

436
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:19,829
My job is to get information,
but not this way.

437
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,415
This could damage my reputation.

438
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,500
She'll pay you threefold.

439
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,046
Stop playing hard to get, sir.

440
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,008
Come on. Tell us.

441
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,012
What does Miranda know about Anna?

442
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,725
Miranda didn't hire me
to investigate on Anna.

443
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,352
It's the orphanage.

444
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,646
You mean, Forever Loved
Home orphanage?

445
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,731
But why?

446
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:51,527
Because Miranda put up
her child for adoption.

447
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,613
She wants me to look for her child.

448
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,616
Wait. I'm confused.

449
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,329
We're only asking about Anna.

450
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,125
She is her missing child.

451
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,337
Anna is Miranda's daughter.

452
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,146
What are you doing here?

453
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,900
Anna, can we talk?

454
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,111
I can't.

455
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,826
What should I do for you to forgive me?

456
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,915
So I should forgive you
because you apologized?

457
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,918
It's not that easy.

458
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,338
What you did greatly affected me.

459
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,298
Believe me.

460
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,635
You're still my daughter no matter what.

461
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:58,803
"Daughter?"

462
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,851
No mother would do that to her child.

463
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,937
I took care of you.

464
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,649
I loved you the same way
I love your siblings.

465
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,944
But you stopped loving me when Papa died.

466
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,821
That's not true.

467
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,032
That's not true, Anna.

468
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,828
Ma, all my life, you made me believe

469
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,622
over and over again that you loved me.

470
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,833
I didn't abandon you.

471
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,504
I've helped you
with your problem about Grace.

472
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,842
I covered up for you
and protected you,

473
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,804
even though it meant
making a lot of sacrifices…

474
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,725
…and your sisters are upset with me.

475
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,521
I did all that.

476
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,110
I did all of that because I love you.

477
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,696
You call that love?

478
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,699
How long will I be in debt to that love?

479
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,498
Do you just feel guilty
for what you did to me?

480
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,127
It's not love.

481
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,297
You're just guilty.

482
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,216
Anna, dear.

483
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,325
Anna.

484
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,830
Did Helena do anything to you?

485
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:55,127
The nurse said you two
were arguing earlier.

486
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,219
It was because my mother lied.

487
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,933
It turns out it was her fault
my father died.

488
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,643
What?

489
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,020
They got into a fight that day.

490
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,233
I don't know what they fought about.

491
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,196
My mother accidentally hurt my father.

492
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:28,536
So, he was injured before he saved me.

493
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,001
But my mother made me believe that…

494
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:47,304
She made me believe that
my father died because of me.

495
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:01,110
I endured all the hate they threw at me.

496
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,824
It even came to a point
where I started thinking that…

497
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,120
that I don't really deserve to be happy.

498
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,333
That I don't deserve to be loved.

499
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,046
So I pushed people away.

500
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,134
I pushed them away because
I felt like I didn't deserve it.

501
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,523
Anna…

502
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:45,195
If only I could get rid of
all the pain you're feeling…

503
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,115
I will do anything.

504
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,510
Don't forget our deal.

505
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,305
Just let us know once you get the results.

506
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,015
Okay.

507
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,017
Thank you.

508
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,108
Lando!

509
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,735
Hey.

510
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,112
Oscar.

511
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,822
What's up? Has your shift ended?

512
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,033
How about you? What are you working on?

513
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,201
Of course…

514
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,620
it's a secret.

515
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,247
So, how are you?

516
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,625
Do you need extra income?

517
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,503
Aren't you Miranda's private investigator?

518
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:47,132
Does she know you're meeting
with Sarah and Ashley?

519
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,803
Huh? Oh.

520
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,888
We just talked.

521
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,140
What did you talk about?

522
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,310
Not much.
We just caught up with each other.

523
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,938
Tell me the truth, Lando.

524
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,107
Or else I'll tell Miranda about this.

525
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,819
Hold on, man.

526
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,114
Aren't we friends?

527
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,699
I'll repeat my question.

528
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,034
What did you talk about?

529
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,625
How long will you be here?

530
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,422
Mommy has told all the doctors
and staff to keep this a secret

531
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,842
and lie if someone asks where you are.

532
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,511
Who else will you drag into your mess?

533
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,555
Don't worry.

534
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,724
We'll find a way to leave at the soonest.

535
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:37,808
When?

536
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,936
Mommy has sacrificed a lot for you.

537
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,647
She even took responsibility
for your crime.

538
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,900
Don't you have any shame
or conscience at all?

539
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,154
Look, I tried to leave a lot of times

540
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,574
because I don't want to drag people
and I don't want to owe anyone.

541
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,326
Then leave! It's as simple as that.

542
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,413
Don't worry about my mom
because I'll take care of her.

543
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,875
All her sacrifices will be
in vain if you get caught.

544
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,753
I never asked her to take
responsibility for what I did.

545
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,212
But she did it anyway.

546
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,924
Don't worry,
I'll clear your mother's name.

547
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,386
And I'll do that without your help

548
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,722
because I don't want
to owe anyone a thing.

549
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,233
Grace, let's go.

550
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,153
-But, we're still playing--
-You need to rest.

551
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,739
-Wait!
-Grace, come on!

552
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,616
I told you to rest.

553
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,409
Hey, is there a problem?

554
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,830
I don't want her to get used to this
because we're leaving.

555
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,415
He's just going to be hard.

556
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,083
We've talked about this, right?

557
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,752
I'll go with you.

558
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,295
Julius, will you please stop?

559
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,714
First of all, I didn't say you could come.

560
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,717
It's my problem, so leave us alone.

561
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,885
Hold on.

562
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,970
After everything Julius did to help you,

563
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,972
you got nerve to talk to him that way?

564
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,849
Stop venting your anger on Julius.

565
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,143
You've got no one else
to blame but yourself!

566
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,311
Jessica.

567
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,399
Why are you talking to Anna like that?

568
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,903
So, I'm the bad guy now, Mom?

569
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,096
Hello?

570
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,098
I just want to confirm something.

571
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,850
What is it?

572
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,894
What do you know about Miranda
and Anna's real relationship?

573
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,729
"Real relationship"?

574
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,024
I just talked to Miranda's
investigator a while ago.

575
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,236
He said Anna is Miranda's daughter.

576
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,530
Do you know anything about it?

577
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:05,914
Jessica.

578
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,126
Find Anna.

579
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,004
Talk things out.

580
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,799
Mom, I don't think we could fix anything

581
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,259
if we talk now.

582
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,595
She's too angry.

583
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,432
How could she blame
the people who helped her?

584
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:27,603
I feel bad for you and Julius, Ma.

585
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,399
Jess, Anna is going through
something right now.

586
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,944
She found out that her father died…

587
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,322
was actually because of Helena.

588
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,617
She's very upset right now because…

589
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,828
she blamed herself for it for a long time.

590
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,416
Put yourself in her shoes, dear.

591
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:54,421
I'm sure she feels like no one
in this world is on her side.

592
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,884
Let's not upset her even more.

593
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,722
Miranda, Sir Jimenez called.

594
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,140
We have a problem.

595
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,309
He talked to your private investigator.

596
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,103
She found out about you and Anna.

597
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,522
What do you mean?

598
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:13,982
That Anna is your daughter.

599
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,325
I can explain.

600
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,993
That's not even the worst part.

601
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,121
Before Sir Jimenez found out,

602
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:32,125
he saw Sarah and Ashley talking
to your private investigator.

603
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,628
They also know the truth now.

604
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,882
Well, we have to do something about it.

605
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,434
-This is it, Sarah.
-Mm-hmm.

606
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,436
-This is the moment.
-Mm-hmm.

607
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,272
Don't forget all my instructions,

608
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,775
especially on how to act
so you'll look credible.

609
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,859
Act?

610
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,946
I won't be acting, girl.

611
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,615
I'm mad as hell.

612
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:07,619
I'm make sure they'll both fall
and never rise again from this.

613
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:09,496
It's not enough.

614
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,542
Sending them to jail is not
enough to punish both of them.

615
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,293
That's my girl.

616
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,715
-Uh, excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

617
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,050
Ms. Banaag, let's rehearse
the blocking.

618
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,553
-Blocking?
-Yes, this way, please.

619
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,430
My left side looks better.

620
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,514
Sure. No problem.

621
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,932
-So, this is my seat?
-Yes.

622
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,102
Hello?

623
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,814
Think hard about
what you're going to do, Ashley.

624
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:40,027
Well, well, well, how's life in hell?

625
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,030
I've been waiting for your call, Miranda.

626
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,948
This is not a game, Ashley.

627
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,826
You'll ruin a lot of lives if you do this.

628
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:51,038
That's the point. I want
to ruin your and Anna's lives.

629
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,123
Actually, this is what you do, right?

630
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,751
In fact, this is a tribute to your legacy.

631
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,836
Reuniting families.

632
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,048
But this time, it would be
Miranda Valdez herself

633
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:04,217
reuniting with her
long-lost daughter, Anna.

634
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,220
A family of kidnappers.

635
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,722
Okay, go ahead.

636
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,016
I'll air your dirty laundry too!

637
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,643
Does Galvez know about
what you're going to do?

638
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,520
Oh, come on, Miranda.

639
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,230
Your threats don't work on me.

640
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,441
Do you really think I'll be scared?

641
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,526
What's an affair that's hard to prove

642
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,321
compared to you being a kidnapper

643
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,114
and what you did to your daughter?

644
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,241
Imagine, the Nation's Mother

645
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:31,828
abandoned and put up
her own daughter for adoption.

646
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,246
Go for it.

647
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,207
You think you have the upper hand?

648
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,502
Let's see. You are so wrong.

649
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,510
Yes, Miranda?

650
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,762
Do you know about
what Ashley's going to do?

651
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,724
She wants to destroy me?

652
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:57,229
Then my next call will be
to your wife and children.

653
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,523
Let's ruin each other's lives.

654
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,905
Mama.

655
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,534
I have something to tell you.

656
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,494
Please don't get mad.

657
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,704
What is it?

658
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,999
Grandma Helena called yesterday.

659
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,418
I was the one who picked up.

660
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,838
She wanted to know how you were doing.

661
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,714
But she sounded sad.

662
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:30,428
Did you tell her where we were staying?

663
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,433
She just wanted to talk to you.

664
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,020
Why? Did you two fight?

665
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,901
Please don't be sad anymore.

666
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:48,196
So many people love you.

667
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,952
Grace…

668
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,497
about that secret Miss Miranda told you…

669
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,834
Can you tell me what it is?

670
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,632
I just want to know if we can trust her.

671
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,927
-But…
-Grace.

672
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,013
Come on.

673
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,433
Mama, can you give me more time?

674
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,144
I'll talk to her first.

675
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,396
I made a promise to her.

676
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:26,234
So she can tell you herself.

677
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,002
I'm begging you.

678
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,630
Miranda…

679
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:51,259
if there was at least
an ounce of sincerity

680
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,803
in the kindness you
showed me back then,

681
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,807
please give me back my daughter.

682
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,102
Stop this.

683
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,317
Stop spreading lies and slandering me.

684
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,030
You're throwing all sorts
of wild accusations against me.

685
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,618
It's clear which of us is right and wrong.

686
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,705
Grace is my daughter.

687
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,042
A child should be with their mother,

688
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,335
and that's me.

689
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:32,801
Whether or not your appeal
will reach Miranda,

690
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:35,553
we're here for you.

691
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,848
I assure you that the police
are doing everything they can

692
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,809
to get Grace back.

693
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,312
Trust me.

694
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,023
We will get justice.

695
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,901
I'm confused.

696
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,698
I don't understand
why Miranda's so confident.

697
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:58,618
Where does she get the nerve to accuse me?

698
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:04,332
But she's doing all that
behind the camera.

699
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,751
Face me!

700
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,920
Show me my daughter.

701
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,299
See you in court.

702
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,012
You and Anna are ganging up on me.

703
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,014
Why?

704
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,225
-Is it because--
-What a bold statement!

705
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:26,438
Thank you very much
for your courage, Mrs. Banaag.

706
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,524
Stay tuned. Karamay will be right back.

707
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,122
-Ashley!
-Yes?

708
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,540
What happened?

709
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,916
Why did you do that?

710
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,711
We agreed to tell the whole truth.

711
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,047
Sarah, I'm not the only one
making decisions

712
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,340
about these things.

713
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,799
Let it go. Okay? Let it go.

714
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,010
The show was good.
We got our point across.

715
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:00,013
And we don't have to drag them lower
than they are now.

716
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,223
What nonsense is this? That's not enough!

717
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,727
We agreed to reveal Anna
and Miranda's real relationship.

718
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,145
What are you doing?

719
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,315
We should ruin their image,
just like how they ruined mine!

720
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,318
Just be grateful, okay? Don't be greedy.

721
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,402
Greedy?

722
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:15,779
You're calling me greedy?

723
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,864
Why? Because you got
the show you wanted?

724
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,908
-Don't--
-You'll throw me under the bus?

725
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,160
Don't cause a scene, Mrs. Banaag. Guard!

726
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,205
I haven't even done anything.
You want to see me do trouble?

727
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,540
Alright, let me show you. Don't touch me!

728
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,334
-Come with me, ma'am.
-Let go!

729
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,127
I can walk myself out!

730
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,295
Alright, ma'am.

731
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,224
What did you do?

732
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,433
It worked.

733
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,019
For now.

734
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:51,231
Miranda, you know that
the truth will come out someday.

735
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,817
Until when would you hide this?

736
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:42,717
Mama?

737
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,932
You found the bracelet?

738
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:53,436
Grace, why are there two of these?

739
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,607
Mama, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

740
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,735
I just asked Miss Miranda.

741
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,030
But she said I shouldn't tell you yet.

742
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,033
So, this belongs to Miss Miranda?

743
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:14,207
Yes. She said she'd give it to you.

744
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,943
You're making a fool out of me!

745
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,028
Let's see who'll look like a fool now.

746
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,033
Good evening!

747
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:52,912
Many people watched
today's episode of Karamay.

748
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,622
I just wanted to say

749
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:58,042
that they didn't tell the whole truth!

750
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:03,840
I know Miranda Valdez's
connection to Anna Sarmiento.

751
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,925
Auntie! Auntie, watch this.

752
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:06,926
What is it?

753
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,345
Sarah is talking nonsense.

754
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:12,849
Miranda Valdez
is covering up for Anna

755
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,517
because the truth is…

756
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:16,519
Anna is her daughter.

757
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:21,232
Anna was the baby
she gave up for adoption.

758
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,900
Ma, what's the meaning of this?

759
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:25,028
Wait a minute.

760
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,240
Hey! What are you going to do?

761
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,701
I need to tell Anna.

762
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:38,041
Anna, there's something you need to know.

763
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:41,753
Julius. Julius, help me.

764
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,630
Anna might leave.

765
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,131
Grace said…

766
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:50,345
Grace said Anna became anxious
when she saw the bracelets.

767
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,723
I need to explain it to her, Julius.

768
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,644
Julius, she might leave. Please help me.

769
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,021
Find her.

770
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:03,733
Miranda Valdez is covering up for Anna

771
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,443
because the truth is…

772
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,029
Anna is her daughter.

773
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:12,325
Anna was the baby
she gave up for adoption.

774
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:33,930
Anna?

775
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,822
Anna.

776
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,329
It's you?

777
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,629
Ho-- How?

778
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,633
Why?

779
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:16,139
Believe me.

780
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,307
I was going to tell you.

781
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:22,228
When were you planning
to tell me the truth?

782
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,398
Should I include you in the list

783
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,316
of people who kept secrets from me?

784
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,901
Anna.

785
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,617
How long have you known?

786
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,622
I found out when we were in Palawan.

787
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:46,043
Is that why you helped me?

788
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:49,422
Because you wanted to make it up to me?

789
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:50,715
Is that it?

790
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:57,722
I'm helping you because I know
you're not a bad person.

791
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,934
And I want to be with you.

792
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:03,352
Anna…

793
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:06,522
All those times we were together,

794
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,151
we would look at each other
straight in the eyes.

795
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,945
I opened up about my feelings

796
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:15,114
and shared my thoughts with you.

797
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:21,829
But you knew you were lying
to me all this time.

798
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,834
I got scared.

799
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:29,295
No! You got scared?

800
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,840
You were scared because
you did something wrong.

801
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,342
Anna, no…

802
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:38,012
You were scared because you gave me away!

803
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,515
You gave me away, right?

804
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:45,394
Anna, I didn't want that to happen.

805
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:49,649
I wasn't ready that time.

806
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:53,444
I thought… I thought I was alone.

807
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:56,239
I gave in to fear.

808
00:51:56,322 --> 00:52:01,118
I let the people around me
get into my head.

809
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,748
You have no right to blame others

810
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:07,500
because it was your decision.

811
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:10,419
Being a mother is a decision,

812
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:13,214
just like how I chose
to be a mother to Grace.

813
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,801
The truth is…

814
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:22,223
you wanted to get rid of me
and be out of your life.

815
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,017
What I can't understand and accept

816
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,729
is that no mother would want
to be away from her child!

817
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,943
-No…
-You know what?

818
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,821
I would've given you respect

819
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,116
if you admitted you were
wrong and selfish.

820
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,951
That you don't care about me!

821
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,619
No, that's not true.

822
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:46,038
That's not true, Anna.

823
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:48,833
Anna, please…

824
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,043
Let me help you.

825
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:54,130
That's all I ask.

826
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,216
Anna…

827
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,430
Do you think after everything you've done,

828
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,225
I'd just forget what you did to me?

829
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,815
You can't just choose…

830
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:17,194
when it's convenient for you
to become a mother.

831
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,617
And you can't just come to me…

832
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,330
and choose when you'll ask
for forgiveness.

833
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:30,333
Anna. Anna, please…

834
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,210
I know that. I know.

835
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:39,800
I'm not asking you
to forgive me right away.

836
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,138
Just give me a chance.

837
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,140
That's all I'm asking.

838
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:51,228
Please give me a chance
to make things right for you.

839
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,231
Please, dear.

840
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:58,027
Anna.

841
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,829
Anna, please. Please don't go.

842
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,123
-Anna.
-You've helped me enough.

843
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:15,503
I'll make sure to return the favor.

844
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,422
But remember this.

845
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,802
No matter what you do,

846
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,014
I'll never consider you my mother.

847
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,018
You're not my mother.

848
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,021
You only gave birth to me.

849
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,537
She's a worthless mother!

850
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,621
You ingrate!

851
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:34,123
What do you want, huh?

852
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,501
She's not well, and we might
lose her at any moment!

853
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:43,716
You have the right to remain silent.

854
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,343
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

855
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,095
You have the right to a lawyer.

856
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,848
If you can't afford a lawyer,
you'll be appointed one.

857
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,642
Your Honor, with everything
Ms. Sarmiento went through,

858
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:56,020
it's possible her mental
health was affected.

859
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,521
I'm not insane!

860
00:55:58,898 --> 00:55:59,899
Mama.
