1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:02,253
Vincent?

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,963
Wait, you also go here?

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,340
You thought we'd never see
each other again?

4
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,843
I left Palawan quite suddenly.

5
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,136
Can you believe it?

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,346
We meet again here of all places.

7
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,350
We found a bloody sack in Chito's car.

8
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,686
A witness said they heard Grace screaming

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,604
on the night before she disappeared.

10
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:21,939
It's too late, Mom!

11
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,734
They've already made fake documents
for Grace.

12
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,485
The police know their location.

13
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:27,528
She'll be arrested.

14
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,612
The police are here!

15
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,614
-Let's go!
-Wait! Wait!

16
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,450
Why do you care so much about Anna?

17
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,034
I don't understand you!

18
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,245
Because Anna is my daughter!

19
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,830
She's your sister!

20
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,248
You hate me?

21
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,625
I'm happy with Mama Anna.

22
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,420
You can be happy too.

23
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,422
Don't come running back to me.

24
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,924
Don't ever come back! I won't accept you!

25
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,303
Do you think they followed us?

26
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,722
I don't think so.

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,315
Miranda.

28
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,317
Julius, where are you?

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,527
We're on our way back to the rest house.

30
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,362
Are you guys okay? I'm going there.

31
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,156
Are you still with Anna?

32
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,741
Yes, we're fine.

33
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,745
Julius, tell her not to leave yet.

34
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,206
I really need to talk to her.

35
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,715
Hello? Hello?

36
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,101
It's Sarah. It's Sarah! Stop the car!

37
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
Where is Grace?

38
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,199
What did you do to your daughter?

39
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,951
She said it herself.

40
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,119
We are dead to each other.

41
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,414
If she hates me, then I hate her more.

42
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:03,833
She's all yours!

43
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,251
You deserve each other!

44
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,836
That's where you're mistaken.

45
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,420
Do you think it's that easy?

46
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,965
That you can just take her back
and give her away?

47
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,634
Remember, you don't own your child.

48
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,804
Grace.

49
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,014
Grace?

50
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,599
Grace!

51
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:26,230
Mama...

52
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,314
Grace?

53
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,738
Mama? Mama?

54
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,532
Mama, is she gone?

55
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,825
She's gone.

56
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,036
Did she do anything to you?
Did she tell you anything?

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,288
Are you okay?

58
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,124
She won't come back for me, right?

59
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,002
You're now my mama, right?

60
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,132
Told you before,
I'm with you till the end.

61
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,633
I won't leave you.

62
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,931
We're going home, dear.

63
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,521
I'm here now.

64
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,900
Mama…

65
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,737
Shh…

66
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,713
Mrs. Banaag, can we talk
to you for a minute?

67
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,006
What is it this time?

68
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,676
We're inviting you to the police station.

69
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,345
Can we not do this now? I'm tired.

70
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,013
We've arrested Chito.

71
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,225
He said you're the one who abused Grace.

72
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,602
What exactly did you do to Grace?

73
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,522
Are we still looking
for a missing kid, or not?

74
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't make this harder, Mrs. Banaag.

75
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,025
Tell us the truth.

76
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:36,944
Where is your child?

77
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,404
Did you kill Grace?

78
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,198
I didn't kill her! Why are you blaming me?

79
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,451
Why me and not Anna? Anna has my child!

80
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,121
Don't look for them here.
Miranda's hiding them.

81
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,622
She's alive!

82
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,753
I'm sorry, Vincent.

83
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,547
We don't have food yet.

84
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,134
But I'm sure Charlie
is going to prepare some.

85
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,928
I can order some food if you want.

86
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,013
Okay.

87
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,932
I was about to go and get you, Auntie.

88
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:10,019
Why couldn't Anna leave?

89
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,312
It's dangerous there. They're not safe.

90
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,398
They're having some problems.

91
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,026
That's not the only problem right now.

92
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,778
Matty came and told Princess.

93
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,572
There was nothing else I could do.

94
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,407
I told her you've sold the inn.

95
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,909
You sold the inn, Ma?

96
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,120
We're sorry, Vincent.

97
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,622
Could you give us a minute to talk?

98
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,127
Erin…

99
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,838
Where's the money you received, Ma?

100
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,298
Did you give it to Anna?

101
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,925
Your sister needs money.

102
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,927
So she can hide from the law?

103
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,138
You don't understand me!

104
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,348
Your sister needs me now!

105
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,018
She's wanted to leave us for a long time!

106
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,728
The inn!

107
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,981
That was the only thing
we had left from Papa!

108
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,649
That's where we lived together.

109
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,902
But you sold it just for Anna?!

110
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,528
Why?

111
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,324
Do you think if your father were alive

112
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,826
he wouldn't do it for Anna?

113
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,039
He loved Anna as much
as he loved the both of you.

114
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,041
But Papa is gone, Ma!

115
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,626
And it's because of Anna!

116
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,504
So we don't owe her anything!

117
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,714
I didn't give it all to Anna.

118
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:24,426
I kept enough for us to start over.

119
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,015
Until when do Erin and I
have to adjust for her?

120
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,437
When are you going to put us first?

121
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,909
Auntie, are you sure
Anna is safe in San Rafael?

122
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,913
Erin.

123
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,714
We managed to escape
before the police arrived.

124
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,508
They didn't see us.

125
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,928
The people we were with also escaped.

126
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,930
What?

127
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,099
Jessica?

128
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,310
I can't believe it.

129
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,022
Alright, Miranda. I'll talk to you later.

130
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,316
Was that Miranda?

131
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,528
Yeah, she's just checking up on us.

132
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,698
And I told her
we didn't get the fake papers.

133
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,952
Sorry, I heard something about Jessica?

134
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,621
Jessica was the one
who tipped off the police.

135
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,623
What?

136
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,918
Why would she do that?

137
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,753
I don't know.

138
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,132
But Miranda said it's not safe
for us to stay here.

139
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,635
The people who are after you
know about this place.

140
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,471
Sarah even managed to come here.

141
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,140
But Sarah and I already talked.

142
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,392
She's left Grace to me.

143
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,686
Do you think after everything
that's happened

144
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,229
you can really trust her?

145
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,901
Anna, she won't let go
of her child just like that.

146
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,534
Sir.

147
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,536
I sent you something just now.

148
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,538
We just received this report.

149
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,925
This is Grace?

150
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,509
Why are the details different?

151
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,638
A syndicate had an operation
in San Rafael yesterday, sir.

152
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,640
The group that makes
fake documents.

153
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,017
The cops got hold of this
and sent it to us

154
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,519
so we can identify if it's Grace.

155
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,521
Did they arrest the group?

156
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,522
No, sir.

157
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,316
But someone said

158
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,610
there was a woman and a man.

159
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,321
But they weren't identified.

160
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,198
The clients managed to escape.

161
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,200
Send them Anna Sarmiento's photo

162
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,493
for them to verify.

163
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,620
Let me know what they say, okay?

164
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,622
I'm on my way to the office.

165
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,417
Hello, son?

166
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,627
Hello, Pa?

167
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,254
I know where Anna is.

168
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,630
She's in San Rafael, Pa.

169
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,632
Go there before they escape.

170
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,633
San Rafael?

171
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,426
Yes, Pa. San Rafael.

172
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,512
This will help you close your case.

173
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,223
They'll finally stop belittling you.

174
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,516
Thank you, son.

175
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,518
Vincent.

176
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,604
Who were you talking to?

177
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,231
Your dad?

178
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,024
He's a cop?

179
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,445
You told him where my sister is?

180
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,697
Sorry, Erin.

181
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,824
Ma!

182
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,828
Are you thinking about her?

183
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,831
Your mama.

184
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,042
Did I do something bad?

185
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,627
Am I a bad child?

186
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,504
Is that what she told you?

187
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,008
Isn't a child…

188
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,303
supposed to love their mama?

189
00:09:55,429 --> 00:10:01,018
I told her you're my mama now, not her.

190
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,606
I know I've hurt her.

191
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,526
Grace.

192
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,196
I know it's not easy.

193
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,616
Because no matter what,
she is your mother.

194
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,328
And I know you love her very much.

195
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,707
What is it?

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,210
I love Mama.

197
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,299
But when things get difficult,

198
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,927
she becomes bad.

199
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,723
But with Uncle Chito…

200
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,352
Even though they always fight,

201
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,604
just one look from him

202
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,525
and she will smile
and even laugh out loud.

203
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:59,701
I'm not the one who makes Mama happy.

204
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:06,625
But you always tell me positive things.

205
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,130
That I'm good, I'm cute, I'm kind.

206
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,343
I can't reach Julius either, Ma.

207
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,553
Maybe he's in there too.

208
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,139
There's no signal in that house.

209
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,350
We need to beat the cops to them.

210
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,229
Why didn't you get to know
that Vincent well first?

211
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:31,316
It's like we let in a snake
into our own house.

212
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,237
I had no idea.
But that doesn't matter now.

213
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,032
We need to get there
before his father does.

214
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,535
Mister, can you drive a little faster?

215
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,206
Shh.

216
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,835
Because that's the truth.

217
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,423
But I also scold you sometimes, right?

218
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:02,305
But even if things get tough,
you don't hurt me.

219
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,023
I'm in San Rafael,
the place Sarah told us.

220
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,817
But I have to confirm it

221
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,735
before we request a search warrant.

222
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,612
Stand by.

223
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,538
I know I haven't told you this, but…

224
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,208
I am so proud of you.

225
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,421
Because even after everything
you've experienced,

226
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,298
all the hard times,

227
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,216
all the pain,

228
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,137
you've become a brave and good child.

229
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,806
That's not easy, Grace.

230
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,812
That's why I promise you

231
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,524
that I'll always be here
to look after you.

232
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,027
I will guide you until the end.

233
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,821
Even when you get old?

234
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,908
Even when my body becomes frail
and my hair becomes white.

235
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,328
I'll be your mama until the end.

236
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,330
Mama…

237
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,124
I love you.

238
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:17,297
I love you very much. All gas, no brakes.

239
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,018
So what are you saying?
That's all you got?

240
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,437
I won't accept that! Find a way!

241
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,649
They have strong evidence
against you, Chito.

242
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,653
Your only chance is if the kid gets found

243
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,822
and she admits that Sarah hurt her.

244
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,325
But what if they don't find the kid?

245
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,826
We're going in circles here!

246
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,828
What if they never find the kid?

247
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,623
I'm going to rot in jail. Is that it?

248
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,041
Attorney.

249
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,627
They're going to jail me in two days time.

250
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,587
I'll be transferred to the city jail!

251
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,839
My life there will be a living hell.

252
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,716
Don't let them take me there!

253
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,555
I can't promise you anything
without the child.

254
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,515
Once she is found,

255
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,351
I'll take care of your case
right away, okay?

256
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,603
-I'll keep you posted.
-What do you mean?

257
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,897
Attorney! Attorney!

258
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,904
You're a bastard, Chito.

259
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,531
Judas!

260
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,411
Who between us
is the real Judas? Huh?

261
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,330
You abandoned me!

262
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,833
That's why I ended up in this situation.

263
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,838
But I won't be the only one
who gets locked up.

264
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,132
I'll drag you down with me.

265
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,427
Is this what we've become?

266
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,804
Huh?

267
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,016
You're making up stories about me?

268
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,518
That I abuse Grace?

269
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,315
Are you an angel now, huh?

270
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,735
You don't have wings. You're a demon.

271
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,196
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

272
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,954
You are the reason
I'm in this hell right now.

273
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:13,997
Hey, Chito!

274
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,334
You're in this hell because you're stupid!

275
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,127
I warned you, didn't I?

276
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,545
But you didn't listen!

277
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,130
And now it's my fault?

278
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,549
Between the two of us,
you're the bigger moron!

279
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,634
Idiot!

280
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,553
Hey! Stop that!

281
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,638
Call the medic!

282
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,599
-That's enough!
-Sarah?

283
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,142
Sarah?

284
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,226
Sarah!

285
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,104
Anna.

286
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,023
Jimenez is downstairs.

287
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,025
-What?
-Jimenez is here.

288
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,235
Hide yourselves.

289
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:26,903
Hurry!

290
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,130
Sir Jimenez, you don't have
to bang on my door!

291
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,297
What do you need?

292
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,801
Miss Miranda, I didn't know you were here.

293
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,345
Of course,

294
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,430
it's my house.

295
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,517
You have a nice house, Miss Miranda.

296
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,730
This is my rest house. A private property.

297
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,690
You haven't answered my question yet.

298
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,400
What are you doing here?

299
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,195
Someone gave me a tip…

300
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,824
that Grace and Anna are here.

301
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,118
Huh?

302
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,622
Why would Grace and Anna be here?

303
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,333
That's my question too.

304
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,420
Well, the answer is no.

305
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,796
They're not here.

306
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,011
Miss Miranda, can I use the washroom?

307
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,430
I had a long journey.

308
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,309
I'm sure you don't mind, do you?

309
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,228
Follow me.

310
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,742
This is the bathroom.

311
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,243
These are the bedrooms.

312
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,536
Go ahead.

313
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,534
Sir Jimenez, I don't have all day.

314
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,577
I have a lot of things to take care of.

315
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,916
Sir Jimenez is here.

316
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,501
-He's here?
-Yes. Sir Jimenez.

317
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,012
Hurry. Faster.

318
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,523
Grace.

319
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,696
Grace, come with me.

320
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,615
-No. Sir, I can explain.
-Don't touch me.

321
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,827
I don't want to hurt anyone.

322
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,328
Give me the kid.

323
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,832
Grace, come with me.

324
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,292
Sir, no. You can't do that.

325
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,127
You don't understand the situation.

326
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,920
You're the one who doesn't get it!

327
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,881
What you're doing is against the law.

328
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,425
If you don't want to get arrested,
out of the way!

329
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,718
-Sir, you can't!
-Move!

330
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,802
Sir!

331
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,848
-Anna, go!
-Let go of me!

332
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,434
I'll stop him. Go after Grace!

333
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,228
Let go of me! I said let go!

334
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,316
Grace!

335
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,609
-Anna!
-Anna!

336
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,028
Ma? Erin?

337
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,031
What are you doing here?
You need to leave.

338
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,824
We should all go.

339
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,619
The police already know
you're hiding here.

340
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,537
They're coming to get you. Let's go!

341
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,414
Anna, what are you going to do now?

342
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,334
I don't know, escape probably?
But I need to find Grace.

343
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,627
I told her to run away.

344
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,711
Grace!

345
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,714
-Grace!
-Grace!

346
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,424
Anna, there she is!

347
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,426
Grace!

348
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,553
Mama!

349
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,804
Grace.

350
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,600
Grace!

351
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:31,940
Anna!

352
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,024
Sir Jimenez!

353
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:34,817
Hold on to me.

354
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,120
Anna, are you okay?

355
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,417
Are you okay?

356
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,835
-Help!
-Sir Jimenez.

357
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,087
-Wait!
-Come with me.

358
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,755
-Wait! No!
-I'm getting you out.

359
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,714
No!

360
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,132
No, don't take her!

361
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,134
Don't make this worse!

362
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,719
Please. I'm begging you!

363
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,429
I'll take her with me!

364
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,430
-Sir!
-No!

365
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,932
Sir.

366
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,517
Grace.

367
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,729
Are you okay?

368
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,814
You okay?

369
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,316
Anna!

370
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,824
Sir Jimenez.

371
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,703
Erin!

372
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,996
What's happening to you?

373
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,832
Erin…

374
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,836
Erin, dear…

375
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,677
Your wound looks a bit swollen.

376
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,722
Why not use a cold compress
and have it checked?

377
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,724
to make sure it's not infected.

378
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,435
Thank you.

379
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,897
Even though you see me as an enemy.

380
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,319
I'm not as bad as you think I am.

381
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:06,617
If you need anything else,
just let me know, okay?

382
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,996
I'll just check on my sister.

383
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,498
I'll be going now.

384
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,732
Sir, Mama didn't mean to do it.

385
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,941
Mama?

386
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,943
Did she force you to call her Mama?

387
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,236
No.

388
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,322
I wanted to.

389
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,910
She's not your Mama. She kidnapped you.

390
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,498
She just helped me, sir.

391
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,502
I couldn't live in my house anymore.

392
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,214
Was it because Sarah and Chito hurt you?

393
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,515
Don't worry, both of them are in jail now.

394
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,433
They can't hurt you anymore.

395
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:16,020
Come with me so
we can put an end to all this.

396
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,816
If I go with you, what will happen to me?

397
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,195
A government agency will take care of you

398
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,240
until they find a family to adopt you.

399
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,033
You're putting me up for adoption?

400
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,452
What if they hurt me too?

401
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,121
I won't let that happen.

402
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,749
Besides, I already have a mom, Mama Anna.

403
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:41,337
Why are you so sure?
I'm not even related to you.

404
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,550
Isn't that how grown-ups are?

405
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:49,345
They don't care unless you're family.

406
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,222
They get nothing out of it.

407
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:57,019
After this, you'll probably
forget about me.

408
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:04,402
Our neighbors knew I was being hurt,

409
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,323
but no one helped me.

410
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,618
But Mama Anna, she's different.

411
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,745
She was the only one who listened to me.

412
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,833
She takes care of me.
She never neglects me.

413
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:25,006
So, sir, please don't
take me away from Mama.

414
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,134
If you're going to give me away,

415
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,013
can it just be to her?

416
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,528
Do you want me to get you a good lawyer?

417
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:48,946
Yes.

418
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,448
I need a good lawyer

419
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,450
to clear me of the charges against me.

420
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,619
Yeah, that's easy.

421
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,621
I have a lot of connections.

422
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,834
But first,

423
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,712
you've got to give me something.

424
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,798
What's in it for me if I help you?

425
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,679
You want to take Miranda down, don't you?

426
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:14,931
Mm-hmm.

427
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,515
I can help you.

428
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,725
How?

429
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,230
Go to San Rafael.

430
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,023
There's a rest house there.

431
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:28,236
You'll find not just Miranda
but also Anna and Grace.

432
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,613
She's the one hiding both of them.

433
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,126
How's Miranda?

434
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,920
She's okay.

435
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,839
Just stressed
from everything that happened.

436
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,050
She said she just needs some rest for now.

437
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,052
If that's the case, I'll head out now.

438
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,930
Sir, aren't you going to take Grace?

439
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,142
If she doesn't want to come,
I won't force her.

440
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,436
She might just get even more traumatized.

441
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,649
My son was exactly like that
when he was young.

442
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,109
I didn't force him either.

443
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,488
But just because
she wants to stay with you

444
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,198
doesn't mean I'll let it happen.

445
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,202
-Sir.
-Grace is still a minor.

446
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,246
She's not of age yet.

447
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,832
She doesn't fully understand
what's right or wrong.

448
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:26,419
But you're adults. You know this is wrong.

449
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,005
You'll have to face the consequences.

450
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,507
I know everything I've done,

451
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,926
and I'm ready to face all of it.

452
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,430
I just want to make sure Grace is safe.

453
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,224
Grace is such a sweet girl.

454
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,601
All I want is to give her a good life.

455
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,313
As much as I want to,

456
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,940
I can't just agree to what you want.

457
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,608
Even if I don't arrest you now,

458
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,069
someone else will eventually come
to take you in

459
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,405
because Sarah already
told them where you are.

460
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,656
Sarah?

461
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,328
She said she's leaving Grace in my care.

462
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,413
Don't trust her.

463
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,623
I don't know any mother

464
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,917
who wouldn't fight like a lion
for her child.

465
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,423
I talked to your doctor.

466
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,508
You can go home anytime today.

467
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,720
Then what?

468
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,638
I'm going back to jail.

469
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:22,308
The evidence used against you
was not enough.

470
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,728
And Chito's words don't mean anything.

471
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,189
They're just baseless accusations.

472
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,691
So you were allowed to post bail.

473
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,526
You can finally go home.

474
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,696
That's good.

475
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,116
What's going to happen to Chito?

476
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,035
He was transferred to the city jail.

477
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,333
Anna.

478
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,252
Anna, you're leaving?

479
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,004
We have to get out of here.

480
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,715
The police have already
found out about this place.

481
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,217
Anna.

482
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,719
Anna, sorry. It's my fault.

483
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,514
I befriended Vincent.

484
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,433
I didn't know his father was a cop.

485
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,519
He lied to me, Anna.

486
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,646
Erin, it's okay. It's not your fault.

487
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,815
It was Sarah who told them where we were.

488
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,734
You should focus on recovering, okay?

489
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,738
I'm fine, I'm not sick.

490
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,533
No. You still need to see a doctor.

491
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,910
What happened to you wasn't normal.

492
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,330
Anna.

493
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,750
We're ready. We have to go.

494
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:30,835
Alright.

495
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,220
Anna, my doll fell!

496
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,304
What?

497
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,308
Anna!

498
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,520
How could you?

499
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:58,154
Mama, why did you and Papa fight?

500
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,907
He had blood on his head.

501
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,909
Erin.

502
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,829
Nothing like that happened.

503
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,747
Don't let someone hear you say that.

504
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,625
But, Mama, I saw it.

505
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,044
No. That didn't happen.

506
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,754
Erin, never tell that to anyone.

507
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,923
Especially the police.

508
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,426
Do you want me to go to jail?

509
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,303
Do you want Mama gone too?

510
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,733
Erin?

511
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:37,902
Erin, dear…

512
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,345
Miss Miranda, are you okay?

513
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,014
Yes. Don't worry about me.

514
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,933
Where's Julius?

515
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,726
He went out.

516
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,897
He took Mama home, but he'll be back soon.

517
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,652
Miss Miranda, I want you to know
that we'll be leaving too.

518
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,905
Huh? What do you mean?

519
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,951
Many people already know about this area.

520
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,828
It's dangerous. Even the police know.

521
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,831
I've thought about that too.

522
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:38,003
I prepared a place you can go to.

523
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,422
My childhood home.

524
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,552
I'm sorry, but I have to refuse.

525
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,804
You've already helped us a lot.

526
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,349
I shouldn't have gotten you
involved in the first place.

527
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,433
Anna…

528
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,231
We haven't cleared your name yet.

529
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,652
Let me keep all my promises.

530
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,320
Let's do it all first.

531
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,699
Please give me a chance…

532
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,201
to make up for everything.

533
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:14,540
Mama, we might get caught here.

534
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,252
Why don't we accept Miss Miranda's help?

535
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,504
We can go there. Now.

536
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,178
Okay.

537
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,016
But if Grace and I think of another way,

538
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,601
I hope you understand.

539
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,413
So? Any news?

540
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,082
This has been going on
for a while. Still no update?

541
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,709
Where is Grace?

542
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:04,632
Sir, you're asking me for evidence, right?

543
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:05,799
I have it.

544
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,927
Sarah, if this is another
baseless accusation…

545
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,227
Where did you get this?

546
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,229
That's not important.

547
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,939
That's should be enough evidence

548
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,524
for you to believe me, right?

549
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,943
Anna has Grace.

550
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,488
My daughter is alive
and Miranda is an accomplice.

551
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,949
I'll have this picture verified.

552
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:37,122
Do you think Sarah is capable
of altering a picture?

553
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,124
My gosh! Use your brain, Jimenez!

554
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,877
I will request
a search warrant immediately.

555
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,545
And I want it done now!

556
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,969
Julius, I went
to my mom's rest house earlier.

557
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,180
She wasn't there, not even Anna and Grace.

558
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,640
Do you know where they are?

559
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,308
She's not answering my calls.

560
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,935
I also don't know, okay?

561
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,229
Why do I find it hard to believe that?

562
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,732
Know what? Everything bad
that's happened between us…

563
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,528
I know that trust
would be a problem for us.

564
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,948
The police came to our house.

565
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,659
There's a search warrant
for Mommy and even for Anna.

566
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,832
They already found evidence
that they have Grace.

567
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,319
This is the poster that has been spreading

568
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,738
where we can see

569
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,741
that Anna Sarmiento and Miranda Valdez

570
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,744
are the accused kidnappers
of Grace Banaag.

571
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:59,747
Anna Sarmiento is said
to be Grace's teacher

572
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,331
and Miranda Valdez

573
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:04,334
is The TV host who kept track of the story

574
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,420
of the child's disappearance.

575
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,923
Currently, the investigators
are thoroughly examining

576
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,050
all the possible angles

577
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:15,929
to find out how the crime
actually happened.

578
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,902
I really don't know where Anna is.

579
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,947
Then why did your family move to Manila

580
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,117
when she left Palawan?

581
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:40,120
You even sold your inn, right?

582
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,246
Why?

583
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,123
To be with your firstborn?

584
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,502
Ma'am, I just want you to know

585
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,421
that if we find out that you're lying,

586
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,257
you'll get involved
in the case of your child.

587
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,552
Our kids are in the same class.

588
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:58,263
They transferred their youngest
to a different school

589
00:34:58,347 --> 00:34:59,932
because she was being bullied.

590
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,017
Hey! I'm not asking you!

591
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,435
That is true.

592
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,229
Anna wasn't the reason

593
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,648
why we decided to move here to Manila.

594
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,942
She just went to Palawan to visit us.

595
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,528
She already moved out
of our house a long time ago.

596
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,116
I'm Detective Soriano from
NLEA Heinous Crimes Unit.

597
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,327
What are you doing here? This is our case!

598
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,538
It's confirmed. Grace Banaag was kidnapped

599
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,122
so we're taking over the case.

600
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,123
You can't do that!

601
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,793
-We've worked so hard--
-Just talk to your superior.

602
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,379
It's turned to a bigger case,
so we're taking over.

603
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,429
I already went to all the places
Mommy could've gone to.

604
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,431
I still can't find her.

605
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,851
Has she not called you?

606
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,435
Not yet, Jess.

607
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,813
You should get some rest too.

608
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,940
I'm sure your mom will come back soon.

609
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,317
Okay. Thank you, Tommy.

610
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,208
Mom?

611
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,544
Jess, dear.

612
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,296
Mommy, where are you?

613
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,424
Are you still with Anna?

614
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,801
Yes.

615
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,220
Mom, please.

616
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,513
Please stop this.

617
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,099
You don't have to do this.
Just leave Anna.

618
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:25,809
Dear…

619
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,437
You know I can't do that.

620
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,898
Your sister needs me.

621
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,235
You're choosing her over everything?

622
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,616
You're already
on the police's wanted list.

623
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,243
We're hearing nasty things about you.

624
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,120
You're ruining your career.

625
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,830
Years ago, Jess…

626
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,334
I chose my career over her.

627
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:55,005
This is my chance to make it up to her.

628
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,925
I'm going to be here for her.

629
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,136
This time, I'll put her first.

630
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,305
What about me, Mom?

631
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,808
What's going to happen to me?

632
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,897
Do you have to leave me?
Will I ever see you again?

633
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:13,607
Jess…

634
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,026
Dear…

635
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,321
I love you very, very much.

636
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,115
But I'm so sorry.

637
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,826
I've neglected Anna for far too long.

638
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,412
Your sister needs me.

639
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,999
And I will be here for Anna…

640
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,711
…while I still have time.

641
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,006
W-What do you mean
while you still have time?

642
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,800
Mommy, what are you talking about?

643
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,717
I'm sorry, Jess.

644
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,219
I love you very much.

645
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,221
But I have to go, dear.

646
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,514
I'm sorry.

647
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,266
Mom!

648
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,123
Listen, guys.

649
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,126
Honestly, I don't believe it.

650
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,254
I've known Miranda Valdez.
She can't do that!

651
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,214
She's too righteous to do that.

652
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,343
Oh, dear. That's what you think!

653
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:26,138
Sometimes, those who seem perfect…

654
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,222
My goodness!

655
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,019
They turn out to be the worst!

656
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,021
Oh!

657
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,649
-Juicy!
-Juicy!

658
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:41,653
I guess it's not impossible.

659
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,448
-You see, I have a theory.
-Oh? What theory?

660
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,533
-It's just my theory.
-Let's hear it.

661
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,618
I think she's the one behind all this.

662
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,749
-Juicy!
-Juicy!

663
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,417
You better sit down for this.

664
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,045
-I am seated.
-Brace yourselves, everyone.

665
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:02,340
I heard Karamay was on the brink
of getting axed.

666
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:06,636
Ratings were dropping,
sponsors were pulling out…

667
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,222
-I see!
-Yeah!

668
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:12,726
Is that why they added
Ashley, the pretty co-host?

669
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,810
Oh!

670
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,522
They're not the only ones
talking about you.

671
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,399
You're the talk of the town.

672
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,235
Miss Miranda…

673
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,321
I'm really sorry.

674
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,573
I don't know how to make it up to you

675
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,408
after everything that has happened.

676
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,621
You have nothing to apologize for.

677
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,957
I've prepared myself
for the backlash I might receive

678
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,418
the moment I decided to help you.

679
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:41,421
I knew the risks, and I would do it again.

680
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,799
I don't regret helping you.

681
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,219
But this is too much.

682
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,678
They're dragging your name.

683
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,765
You don't have to go this far
for me and Grace.

684
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,226
You worked hard
for everything you have now.

685
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,729
All they have is a picture, right?

686
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:01,233
Why don't you tell them it's all fake?

687
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,030
Carmen.

688
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,115
Miranda?

689
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,825
People are getting crazy!

690
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,870
They're starting to believe
the rumors about you.

691
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,998
We all know it's not true.

692
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,543
Not for the management!

693
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:23,630
They're summoning Julius
and the rest of your staff

694
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,508
to conduct an investigation.

695
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,345
They want to sue you for defamation

696
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,307
because you ruined
the reputation of the network!

697
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,643
They want you…

698
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,353
…to compensate for the losses!

699
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,021
I don't know what to do!

700
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,441
Carmen, calm down.

701
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,526
Calm down.

702
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,199
Call Jessica.

703
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,910
Have her help you.

704
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,627
The headlines are damaging,
not only to your mother,

705
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,921
but also to our firm.

706
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,631
And, unfortunately,

707
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:09,217
you being the daughter
of a high-profile kidnapper

708
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,845
is affecting our credibility.

709
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,722
Wait, kidnapper?

710
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,433
As far as I know, no court
has made that verdict.

711
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,852
Jessica, everyone has seen the picture

712
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,228
of your mom and the kid.

713
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:23,148
And it's not helping that she's hiding.

714
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,942
Why won't she just
come forward and explain?

715
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:29,112
We need to distance ourselves
from this situation.

716
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,032
So, what are you planning to do?

717
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,951
Many of our clients
have pulled out their accounts.

718
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,913
No one wants to hire you as their lawyer.

719
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,706
It is out of our hands.

720
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:46,421
Princess, what's the situation outside?

721
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,925
Aside from the angry mob,
the media has also arrived.

722
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,845
This is exactly why we left Palawan.

723
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,056
Where do we go now?

724
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,725
Don't worry. There are cops
looking out for us here.

725
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,101
For how long?

726
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,522
This is all Anna's fault.

727
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,233
Don't blame Anna.

728
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,818
Who else should I blame?

729
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,737
She is the root of all our problems.

730
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,447
She always has been.

731
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,449
Do you think she wanted this?

732
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,951
She's struggling too!

733
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,537
All her life, she's been paying
for a crime she didn't do!

734
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,623
Hey! What are you arguing about?

735
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:23,917
Stop it!

736
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,921
Stop right there!

737
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,840
What's going on with you, Erin?

738
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,134
What did Anna tell you?

739
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,929
Because it seems like
she has brainwashed you too.

740
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,138
How about you?

741
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,933
-How long will you hate her?
-For the rest of her life!

742
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,228
That's how much I hate her!

743
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:47,440
Have you ever considered to
talk to her and hear her side?

744
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:50,819
No! Because you've always
been jealous of her,

745
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,237
even way before Papa died!

746
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,155
Because you think Papa loved her

747
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,324
-more than he loved you
-What did you say?

748
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,450
It's true, isn't it?

749
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,328
And you so badly wanted me
to take your side.

750
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:04,124
That's why you kept badmouthing Anna.

751
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,751
So now, tell me.

752
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,336
Between you two, who is worse?

753
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,629
-Take that back!
-Ow!

754
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,840
-Princess, stop it!
-What do you know, huh?

755
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,508
-Take that back!
-Enough-- Ah!

756
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,760
-What do you know about me?
-Hey, enough!

757
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,804
Stop it, you two!

758
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:19,806
Ma!

759
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,518
Grace?

760
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,824
Sorry, I was looking for Grace.

761
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,620
Oh. She's playing in the backyard.

762
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,999
I was making the bed then I saw this.

763
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,920
It's okay. I…

764
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:36,508
I was just reminiscing
old memories earlier.

765
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:43,223
I noticed the photo was taken in 1997.

766
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,810
I didn't know Jessica and I
were the same age.

767
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,232
That's…

768
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,319
That's not Jessica.

769
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,824
Do you have another child?

770
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,501
My career was just starting then.

771
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:18,508
I met a guy who loved me so much.

772
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,805
But he said we can't be together…

773
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,600
because he's married.

774
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,023
My…

775
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,611
My mother became very sick so I…

776
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,622
I didn't know how I'd raise my child.

777
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,712
I had no one to help me.

778
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,716
Plus, I'd lose my job.

779
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,930
So, I agreed…

780
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,643
to let my parents put my
daughter up for adoption.

781
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:11,728
I…

782
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,023
I don't know where they took her.

783
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:22,697
I thought it was probably for the best…

784
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,995
because if given the choice,

785
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:36,211
she might not want me as her mother.

786
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:43,009
Her life would be miserable with me.

787
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:49,432
That's why even though it hurts so much,

788
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:58,525
I decided to give her up.

789
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,696
It's for her own sake.

790
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:10,912
I did it so she'll have a good life.

791
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,918
I hope…

792
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,509
I hope she could forgive me.

793
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:28,346
I'm sorry, dear.

794
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,306
I'm really sorry.

795
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,901
Sorry, I have to take this.

796
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,322
Hello, Ma?

797
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,326
Princess?

798
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,245
Why do you have Mama's phone?

799
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,747
We're here at Orense Hospital.

800
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,499
Something happened to Mama.

801
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:58,918
What?

802
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,142
Sir.

803
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:18,021
We received a tip about
Anna Sarmiento's location.

804
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,023
The task force is on their way.

805
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,232
Where is she?

806
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,850
I'm already doing my share.

807
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,936
I'm the one who released
Miranda and Anna's photos.

808
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,147
You got your revenge because of me.

809
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,108
Let's not be quick to judge.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

810
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:08,029
Who do you think is dealing
with Miranda's bashers?

811
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,323
I have an army, darling.

812
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,951
Fine. You have an army.

813
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:17,538
But you're right. We need to do something.

814
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,332
They won't just back down easily.

815
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,751
We can't let them outsmart us.

816
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:22,835
Exactly.

817
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,545
So we need a Plan B.

818
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,714
Or at least, we should be one step ahead.

819
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,051
Okay, so what do we need to do?

820
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,177
The question is,

821
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,596
what's the connection
between Anna and Miranda?

822
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,932
Why are they suddenly helping each other?

823
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:43,439
"Do you want to have Anna arrested?
She's on her way to Orense Hospital."

824
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:52,198
Their happy days are over.

825
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,726
Auntie, what are you looking at?

826
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,314
Why is Princess
talking to Jimenez outside?

827
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,942
You mean Oscar Jimenez,
the police officer?

828
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:28,901
Yes.

829
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,532
Ma, how are you feeling?

830
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,952
Why am I here? What happened to me?

831
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,413
The doctor said it was a minor injury.

832
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:43,124
We might as well go home, right?

833
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,005
Uh...I asked them to conduct
other tests to be sure.

834
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,718
Princess, what is
Oscar Jimenez doing here?

835
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,928
Why are there cops here?

836
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,515
Did you ask Anna to come here?

837
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,646
You shouldn't have let Anna leave!
What if something happens to her?

838
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,231
I tried to stop her,

839
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,817
but she was very worried about her mother.

840
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:12,820
I can easily send someone to check on her.

841
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,323
I don't think we can stop her.

842
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,533
What do you mean?

843
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:19,952
My god.

844
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:21,329
Hold on.

845
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,247
-It's Sir Jimenez.
-What?

846
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,332
Hello?

847
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,417
What?

848
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:29,587
Alright. Thank you.

849
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,255
What happened? What did he say?

850
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,633
Someone tipped them off
about Anna's location.

851
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,802
The police are on the way for entrapment.

852
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,053
Oh my God! No!

853
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,055
-We have to stop them, Julius!
-I know.

854
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,516
We can't let that happen!
We need to help Anna!

855
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,518
We need to help her!

856
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,021
Julius! You need to help Anna! Julius!

857
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:50,608
Why? Why did you do that?

858
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,319
Why?

859
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,288
Can you just come back later?

860
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:05,915
Ma.

861
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,919
Oh, Anna.

862
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,712
What are you doing here?

863
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:12,839
You should leave--

864
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,340
Ma, I was worried about you.

865
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,218
Princess texted me saying
something bad happened to you.

866
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,062
Who are you texting?

867
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,939
You know, I've run out of patience!

868
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,983
Why did you betray me and helped Sarah?

869
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:34,652
You want to know why?

870
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,738
Because I'm tired of you running away!

871
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,783
You think you're so brave
and tough, right?

872
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,370
Then take responsibility
and stop dragging us into your mess!

873
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,330
-You crossed the line!
-What? Come on!

874
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,124
-You're so shameless
-Stop it!

875
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,418
Anna, Princess, that's enough!

876
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,920
Someone might hear you outside!

877
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,715
Please just leave now, Anna.

878
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,300
-Go.
-What, Ma?!

879
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,510
You'll cover up for her again?

880
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:04,140
All my life, you've done nothing
but protect Anna!

881
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,850
When are you going to stop, Ma?

882
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,935
Once our family gets completely ruined?

883
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,022
You know, after Papa died,

884
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,566
you should've thrown her
back where she came from!

885
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,944
Don't talk about your sister like that!

886
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,112
"Sister"?

887
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:22,617
What kind of sister would do what she did?

888
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:26,913
She's making all of us suffer!

889
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,749
Princess, that's enough!

890
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,043
Stop blaming Anna!

891
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,129
What happened to Papa wasn't her fault!

892
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,632
Erin, stop it.

893
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,636
Let's stop talking about this.
Anna, just go.

894
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,013
-Go on, Anna.
-Ma, wait.

895
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,765
Erin, what are you talking about?

896
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,808
It wasn't your fault, Anna.

897
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,602
It was Mama!

898
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:54,815
Papa died because of her.

899
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,319
Erin…

900
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,612
Erin, that's enough.

901
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:03,532
I saw them.

902
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:07,036
They were fighting before Anna fell.

903
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,746
Mama accidentally pushed Papa.

904
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,665
That's why he had blood on his head.

905
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:14,126
He was already injured when he saved Anna!

906
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:20,716
Please stop…

907
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,677
Why are you only telling us this now?

908
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:26,931
Anna… Anna, I'm sorry.

909
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,935
I was so confused back then.

910
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,145
I asked Mama…

911
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:35,690
I asked Mama about the blood,

912
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,942
but she told me
not to tell anyone about it.

913
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,111
Right, Ma?

914
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:43,906
That's why I tried to forget everything.

915
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,831
But everything's become
clearer to me now, Anna.

916
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,420
Sorry.

917
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,718
It was an accident.

918
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,220
I didn't…

919
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,931
-Anna, I'm sorry…
-No, wait.

920
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,518
I…

921
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,116
Got it, sir.

922
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:50,723
I know you're confused about
the things you heard about me.

923
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,310
But none of them is true.

924
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:56,937
I'm not…

925
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,898
harboring a criminal.

926
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:03,527
I'm not Anna's accomplice.

927
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,123
The truth is…

928
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:21,212
I'm the one who kidnapped Grace Banaag.

929
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:26,133
Karamay was about to be…

930
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,094
cancelled.

931
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,015
The initial story about Grace…

932
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,018
saved our program.

933
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,523
But when I found her,

934
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:42,817
I got scared.

935
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,906
I got scared that our ratings
might drop again.

936
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:52,910
And so I decided to keep her.

937
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:58,833
I had to milk the story.

938
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,920
But more than the ratings,

939
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:08,425
there's another reason why I hid Grace.

940
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,304
It's because I found out…

941
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:17,017
Grace's real situation at home.

942
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:22,314
Sarah Banaag was abusing her.

943
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:27,027
And I couldn't let the child go back

944
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,612
to that kind of life.

945
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,410
I take responsibility for everything.

946
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,622
I have no regrets.

947
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:43,794
And I will continue to keep Grace safe.

948
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:51,510
Anna Sarmiento is innocent.

949
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:56,015
I'd like to apologize to her

950
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,604
because her life was ruined by me.

951
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,525
I…

952
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:12,198
I'm the one who planned everything.

953
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:19,330
I hope you can forgive me.

954
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,500
It's okay.

955
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:35,930
Can you keep this for me
while I'm recovering?

956
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:40,351
The bracelet? Isn't this
supposed to be a secret?

957
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,811
What does Miranda know about Anna?

958
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,772
Anna is the girl she was looking for.

959
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,315
Anna is Miranda's daughter.

960
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,235
What do you know about Miranda
and Anna's relationship?

961
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:50,527
Sir Jimenez called.

962
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:53,948
He saw Sarah and Ashley talking
to your private investigator.

963
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,033
Grace, why do you have two of these?

964
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,327
I asked Miss Miranda.

965
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,247
She told me not to tell you.

966
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,998
So, this is Miss Miranda's?

967
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,544
Miranda Valdez is covering up for Anna

968
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:10,339
because Anna is the child
whom she put up for adoption

969
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:11,340
a long time ago.

970
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,217
She is her daughter.

971
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,301
Anna?
