1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:12,596
The birds that fly

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,183
are dear to God.

3
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:19,520
it doesn't fade

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:24,692
the birds that fly are dear to God

5
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,402
it doesn't fade

6
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,113
so don't be sad

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,490
stay positive!

8
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,811
Hurry up, everyone!

9
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,188
The storm is coming!

10
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,482
Come on!

11
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,776
Hey, move it!

12
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:10,821
Hey, missy!

13
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,406
What are you doing there?

14
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,283
The storm is coming. Go home!

15
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,286
Grace!

16
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,377
Did you hear that?

17
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,384
Missy?

18
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:34,804
Missy!

19
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,073
Grace!

20
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,991
Excuse me.

21
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,076
Grace?

22
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,494
Oh!

23
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,789
Sir! Do you remember me?

24
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,292
I'm Sarah. Do you have any
information about my daughter?

25
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,005
Why did they let the kid wander off?

26
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,676
There's a thunderstorm
and the waves are strong.

27
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,805
I heard it's not an accident.

28
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,181
The kid might've jumped.

29
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,100
Seriously? A kid would jump?

30
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,810
That's not an accident at all.

31
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,020
Who knows?
It could have been premeditated.

32
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,189
That's right. Someone pushed her.

33
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,284
That must be her stuff.

34
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,496
Yes. Don't worry.
I will not miss my flight.

35
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,501
I'll have everything ready by then.

36
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,088
The grant is very important to me.

37
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,382
Thank you. Thank you so much.

38
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,591
Yes I will.

39
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,093
Yes.

40
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,605
Kids get ready. You're up next.

41
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,108
Hang on. Where's Grace?

42
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,110
We haven't seen her, ma'am.

43
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,903
She hasn't shown up.

44
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,573
That's your cue. Do your best, okay? Go.

45
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,451
So, you're going for it?

46
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,245
Teacher Patty,
Happy Teacher's Day!

47
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,204
Thank you.

48
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,873
My proposal was approved.

49
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,042
I'll be leaving for Hong Kong next month.

50
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,295
Are you sure about that? Thank you, dear.

51
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,091
You really want to study migratory birds?

52
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,384
Won't that be boring?

53
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,511
Thank you, dear. Thank you, thank you.

54
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,513
I've always into ornithology.

55
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,682
I just didn't have the money.

56
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,517
I worked hard on that proposal.

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,893
I'm glad it was approved.

58
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,603
Hey Anna.

59
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,482
You also worked hard
to get a teaching license.

60
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,819
Are you saying the year
you spent here meant nothing?

61
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,281
I only became a teacher
to fund my studies.

62
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,033
It wasn't meant to be long-term.

63
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,200
Thank you.

64
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,166
That's a shame.
You're such a great teacher.

65
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,294
The kids listen to you.

66
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,504
They listen because they're scared of you.

67
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,968
But seriously Anna, the kids need us here.

68
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,598
You spoke to the principal about this?

69
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,475
You know you're his favorite.

70
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,395
I'll speak to him soon.
But he can't change my mind.

71
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,899
Thank you. Thank you so much.

72
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,595
Let us give a round of applause

73
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,681
for Section Acacia!

74
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,370
Oh no! They're not in sync!

75
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,001
Classmates, follow me!

76
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,798
Grace? Grace, what are you doing?

77
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,972
Grace! You don't even have a costume!

78
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,394
Aah...

79
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,690
Aah!

80
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,693
My water just broke!

81
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,612
Uh!

82
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,490
Aah!

83
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:35,998
Call for help!

84
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,593
Mm. What are the five senses?

85
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:34,097
Hearing, smelling, tasting, um...

86
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,682
Common sense?

87
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,394
Sh!

88
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,400
I just taught you that yesterday.

89
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,570
I want to go home.

90
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,787
"Acceptance Letter"

91
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,299
Hello?

92
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,310
Thanks for answering my call!

93
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,605
Auntie has something important
to tell you.

94
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,691
Charlie! Charlie, wait,

95
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,276
hello?

96
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
Anna!

97
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:29,820
Mama.

98
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,989
Why aren't you answering my calls?

99
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,409
Did you receive your sister's invitation?

100
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,703
She sent it to your email last week.

101
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,621
Yes I got it.

102
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,790
So, when are you coming home?

103
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,917
I'm sorry Ma.

104
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,003
I won't be able to come home yet.

105
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
What?

106
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,088
Why?

107
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,590
I still have school.

108
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,967
You have school?

109
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,594
Are you taking up your PhD?

110
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,681
No I mean at an elementary school.

111
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,017
I work there.

112
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,476
What happened?

113
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,188
I thought you're working
as a research assistant

114
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,690
at a university?

115
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,692
It's a long story Ma.

116
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,403
Can I tell you next time?

117
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,700
Anna, this is a special occasion.

118
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,702
We must be complete.

119
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,996
You haven't been home in ages.

120
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,291
You need to be at your sister's wedding.

121
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,880
Oh Princess, talk to her.

122
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,716
If she doesn't want to come,
don't force her.

123
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,509
We'll be fine without her.

124
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,219
Oh my goodness.

125
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,596
Anna...

126
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,183
Please, for my sake.

127
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,684
Come home.

128
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,271
We also have to file the inn's income tax.

129
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,066
I need you here.

130
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,486
What happened to the accountant I hired?

131
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,987
I fired him.

132
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,697
I didn't like his attitude.

133
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,908
And besides,

134
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,202
you always did
our income tax returns before.

135
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,703
Don't pass it on to others.

136
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,164
You know I only trust you.

137
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,999
Alright.

138
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,668
I'll do it myself.

139
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,297
But Ma, about the wedding...

140
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,215
Alright.

141
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,674
Think about it.

142
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,886
Next week Charlie and Princess
will be there.

143
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,263
Princess will have her dress fitting.

144
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,391
Pick them up at the airport.

145
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,975
Spend some time with them.

146
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,186
That might change your mind.

147
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,572
Why are you forcing her
to come to my wedding?

148
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,992
Princess I'm doing this for you.

149
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,913
I don't want Wilson's parents
to think negatively of us.

150
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,832
They might think we're complicated.

151
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,542
How exactly are we complicated?

152
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,420
We're doing perfectly fine
without Anna here.

153
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,005
Hey Princess, stop that!

154
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,590
Anna is still your sister.

155
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,217
Doesn't seem like it.

156
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,095
She hasn't been home in… what?

157
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,471
Eight years?

158
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,306
Erin barely remembers her.

159
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,516
Right Erin?

160
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,934
You know, if I were Anna,

161
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,686
I wouldn't want to go home either

162
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,521
because of that attitude of yours.

163
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,190
Charlie Princess
don't fight at the dinner table.

164
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,484
There's nothing wrong with my attitude.

165
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,987
You people, are the problem.

166
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,905
You guys are too nice.

167
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,283
You still treat her like family.

168
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,701
You keep reaching out

169
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,703
even though she clearly abandoned us.

170
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,121
She doesn't care about us.

171
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,289
How can you say that?

172
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,708
She's the one giving solutions
for the inn.

173
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,918
She fixes everything
though she's far away.

174
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,463
Because Mama tells her to.

175
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,216
Other people can help us Ma.

176
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,010
We don't need her here anymore.

177
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,512
It would still be better
if we're all here.

178
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,389
How will that happen Ma?

179
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,600
Dad's gone.

180
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,394
-Princess.
-We'll never be complete again.

181
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,604
-Enough. Why?

182
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,481
I'm telling the truth!

183
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,316
Geez, here we go again!

184
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,567
Enough.

185
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,777
Enough arguing.

186
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,587
Okay. Finished or not finished,

187
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,589
pass your papers forward.

188
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,601
Miss Sarmiento.

189
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,895
-Sir?
-May I have a word with you?

190
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,898
I intend to go to your office

191
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,192
to tell you something.

192
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,069
If it's about you resigning,

193
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,406
teacher Patty already told me
about your plan.

194
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,117
But before you leave,

195
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,786
could I ask you a favor?

196
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,999
While Teacher Thelma
is on maternity leave,

197
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,002
could you momentarily take over her class?

198
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,879
I need you to focus on Grace Banaag.

199
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,881
She's a bit problematic.

200
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,385
She's stubborn
and likes to fight with others.

201
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,471
She also sleeps in class
and often comes in late.

202
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,766
I hope you can help her.

203
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,893
Thank you, bro!

204
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,312
Thank you!

205
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,188
What's going on here?

206
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,399
Grace is being mean to us, ma'am!

207
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,985
Yes, ma'am! Grace is being mean!

208
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,988
Grace Banaag?

209
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,286
I am Ms. Anna Sarmiento.

210
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,789
I'm the substitute teacher
for Ms Thelma Reyes.

211
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,085
Now, I would like to speak
with your parents.

212
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,212
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

213
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,881
But, Teacher…

214
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:23,798
What?

215
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,216
Is it okay if you don't?

216
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,802
I'll just apologize on their behalf.

217
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,392
You know what,

218
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,187
you shouldn't apologize
just to get out of trouble.

219
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,565
Do it because you
did something wrong.

220
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,112
I still want to speak
with your parents.

221
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,280
Understood?

222
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,075
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

223
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,786
Okay, moving forward,

224
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,372
I want you to group yourselves into five.

225
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,582
Discuss what you've learned
in the chapter.

226
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,584
Then, you will present it to me.

227
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,419
Understood?

228
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,088
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

229
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,881
Do it, then.

230
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,305
Can I join you?

231
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,184
No, you might infect us with lice
if you join us.

232
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,020
Can I join you?

233
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,772
There are five of us already.

234
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,487
Can I join you?

235
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,782
We don't like you. Go away.

236
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,470
Good morning, Grace.

237
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,974
Is my class boring?

238
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,102
No, ma'am.

239
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,603
Shh!

240
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,357
Why aren't you joining
the group work?

241
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,192
Can I just do it by myself?

242
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,195
You think you can do it alone?

243
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,072
Of course.

244
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,993
Get a piece of paper.

245
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,953
Write down everything
you need to do.

246
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,472
Can I just memorize it?

247
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,600
Alright.

248
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,811
If you don't want to participate
in today's activity,

249
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,188
you get a zero.

250
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,773
Pipo!

251
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,483
Pipo?

252
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,873
Eat it, Pipo.

253
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,004
Let's eat, Dad.

254
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,467
Grace, where's my coffee?

255
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,763
My goodness!

256
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,601
Didn't I tell you not to bring
your chicken inside the house?

257
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,936
Pipo is nice, Ma.

258
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,815
If you hadn't won
that chicken at the fair,

259
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,401
I wouldn't have let you
bring it home.

260
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,819
What time is it?

261
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,905
Didn't I tell you
to wake me up at five?

262
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,907
I'm going to be late for work.

263
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,702
It's not five yet, Ma.
Pipo hasn't clucked yet.

264
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,621
Damn it, Grace!

265
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,081
You still can't read time?

266
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,250
What are you even
learning at school then?

267
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,794
-I've learned some things, Ma.
-What then?

268
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,923
I danced really well
on Teachers' Day, you know.

269
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,966
They loved my performance!

270
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,801
Teachers' Day?

271
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,012
Isn't that what you needed a costume for?

272
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,681
It's okay, Ma. It's over now.

273
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,395
But I was still the best
among them.

274
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,688
I take after you.

275
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,106
Shh!

276
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,483
Don't say that.

277
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,610
Don't be like me.

278
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,487
We shouldn't be the same.

279
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,613
You understand?

280
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:47,789
Ma...

281
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,374
What now? I don't have money.

282
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,920
No. My teacher just wants
to talk to you.

283
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,589
No way. What did you
do again this time?

284
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,675
Just make something up.
I don't want to.

285
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,721
Oh.

286
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:04,681
Chito!

287
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,599
Where have you been?

288
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,894
Hey, why come home late?

289
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,690
-To make some money.
-Huh?

290
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,899
Here.

291
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,485
For the household expenses.

292
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,613
Let me see.

293
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,492
Oh, you're the best, honey.

294
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,995
Wow, four thousand.

295
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,580
Grace, serve your uncle food
so he can eat.

296
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,418
You're serving me
just rice and soy sauce?

297
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,585
Nothing else?

298
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,008
That's all we have.

299
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,509
Don't worry. Hold on.

300
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,594
Grace, buy some food
at the eatery.

301
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,098
Just buy one order of adobo, okay?

302
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,099
Oh!

303
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,183
Son of a--

304
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,564
Oh!

305
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,276
What's with that glare?

306
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,070
-She's not--
-Be quiet!

307
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,991
You think you're so tough now, huh?!

308
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,909
Why are you glaring at me?

309
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,121
You want me to pluck your eyes out?!

310
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,582
-Chito. Grace, just go.
-Huh?

311
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,584
-Answer me!
-Ah! Grace!

312
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,502
Grace!

313
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,714
-What?!
-Chito!

314
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,007
What?!

315
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,968
Discipline your daughter!
Look how rude she is!

316
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,696
Grace!

317
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,282
What are you doing?!
My lipstick's expensive!

318
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,701
Stop playing with it!
Put it back where it was!

319
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,286
Put it back!

320
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,871
I said put it back!

321
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,542
What?

322
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,294
That doesn't hurt, right?

323
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,421
It doesn't hurt at all, Ma.

324
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,007
Don't worry.

325
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,384
Once I make some money,

326
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,512
I'll take you to the fair.

327
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,305
Who knows? You might win again.

328
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,682
I'll buy you a chick
so Pipo won't be lonely.

329
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,184
Really, Ma?

330
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:17,105
Do I need to say it again?
I just said I will, didn't I?

331
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,482
I'll take you there
as long as you behave.

332
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,400
The problem is you never listen!

333
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,194
Stop being rowdy when he's around

334
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,779
especially when he's drunk.

335
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,949
But, Mama, I'm not rowdy.

336
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,201
Uncle Chito is just scary,

337
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,870
especially when he glares like this.

338
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,498
See? You're doing it again.

339
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,584
You keep getting in trouble
because you always do that.

340
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,504
I'm not doing anything wrong.

341
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,507
We're lucky he's helping us raise you.

342
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,509
I'm grown up, Ma.

343
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,302
I'll help you.

344
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,221
My goodness, stop that.

345
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,181
Your Uncle Chito loves me
very much.

346
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,183
I gave birth to you
when I was only 15,

347
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,603
and your bastard of a father
died too soon, right?

348
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,690
We wouldn't have survived
if not for your Uncle Chito.

349
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,610
I'm so happy to be
with your Uncle Chito.

350
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,281
I wouldn't know what to do
if he left us.

351
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,491
I wouldn't be able to bear it.
I might die.

352
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,910
I love you, Mama.

353
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,417
You love me too, right?

354
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,002
Here's some money.

355
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,753
That should last you
until dinner.

356
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,174
That's enough for you.
Just buy what you want.

357
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm leaving.

358
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,482
La la la la la

359
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,985
Mister! Mister!
Please buy some.

360
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,320
That doesn't taste good.

361
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,198
I'm telling you, this is really good!

362
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,075
La la la la la

363
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,119
Alright. You got me with your cuteness.

364
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,829
-Here you go.
-Thank you, mister!

365
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:57,747
You're so kind.

366
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,582
Yes!

367
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,293
Miss! Miss! Please buy some.

368
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,712
Hey, Grace!
What's on your face?

369
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,505
Why are you wearing lipstick?

370
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,675
Aren't you too young
to be using makeup?

371
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,470
Hello, ma'am.
Could I get your order?

372
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:14,680
Hotsilog.

373
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,392
You're just jealous because I'm pretty.

374
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,688
You know how to
clap back now, huh?

375
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,398
Well, I wouldn't be surprised.

376
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,692
She probably learned that
from her mother.

377
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,402
-Let's go.
-Come on.

378
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,280
You little rascal!

379
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,585
Are they gone?

380
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,506
What you did to her was wrong.

381
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,967
I was just joking.

382
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,096
Are you alone, Teacher?

383
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,689
Come this way, Teacher.

384
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,565
It's cooler here.

385
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:09,986
Hmm?

386
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,698
You're right, Teacher.
It really is cooler here.

387
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,285
Here's your order, ma'am.

388
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,494
Thank you.

389
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,501
Is that yummy?

390
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,003
Is that bright?

391
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:29,505
Bright?

392
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,007
Just like in the commercial.

393
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,049
Bright hotdog.

394
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,719
The hotdog of bright kids!

395
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,263
I don't know. I don't cook.

396
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,681
How does it taste?

397
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,600
Bright hotdog has cheese inside.

398
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,186
Or is that one chicken-flavored?

399
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,900
Don't you eat at home?

400
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,902
I do.

401
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,696
Well, that's what I ate earlier.

402
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,781
Mama cooked it for me.

403
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,117
But it's been hours since I last ate.

404
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,120
Then go back home so you can eat again.

405
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,580
Uh...

406
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,583
I ate all our hotdogs.

407
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,295
Mama might not be able
to buy till tomorrow.

408
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,902
Thank you.

409
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,779
Thank you, ma'am.

410
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,781
You should learn to talk politely,

411
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,367
especially when you're speaking
with someone older.

412
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,494
Didn't your mother teach you that?

413
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,872
Of course, she did... ma'am.

414
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:49,210
Is it okay if she visits you tomorrow?

415
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,670
She's got something important to do today.

416
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,383
Oh, what's the matter?

417
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,676
Nothing. It's just hot.

418
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:17,071
Ma'am, how do you spell the word bright?

419
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,408
Why do you ask?

420
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,868
I like writing down things
that make me happy.

421
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:27,289
So whenever I'm sad, I just read them.

422
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:33,087
My dad used to say
that I should always stay positive!

423
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,298
Where's your dad now?

424
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,010
My mom said that God claimed him.

425
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,179
How about you? Where's your dad?

426
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,391
He's gone.

427
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,686
Where do you live?

428
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,273
Who do you live with?

429
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,484
No one. I live alone.

430
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,112
Where's your mom?

431
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,697
Why isn't she with you?

432
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,366
Doesn't she love you?

433
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,704
The bank is asking us to pay up.

434
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,664
If we fail to settle this,

435
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,711
we might lose our house, too.

436
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,796
We've already sold a lot of our stuff.

437
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,382
Even our car has been taken away.

438
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,301
We have no choice.

439
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,181
This is your fault!

440
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,018
If it weren't for you,
Papa wouldn't have died

441
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,396
and we wouldn't have
suffered like this!

442
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,399
This is your fault! You hurt Mama!

443
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,485
You ruined our family!

444
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,614
As for me, my mom loves me.

445
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,992
She doesn't like it when I leave
because she misses me a lot.

446
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,709
Grace, you're a thief!

447
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,170
-You stole from me!
-No, I didn't!

448
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,379
-Hey!
-You're a thief!

449
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,297
I'm not a thief!

450
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,298
That's enough!

451
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,509
-You're a thief!
-Let go of each other!

452
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,302
Stop it. I said stop it!

453
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,514
Sir, Grace stole my wallet.

454
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:09,391
Sir, I didn't steal anything.

455
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,893
You're a liar, Grace.

456
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,687
I saw all the money in your bag.

457
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,190
It's mine! That's my money!

458
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,816
How is that possible?

459
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,819
You can't even afford to buy snacks.

460
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,696
I saved up that money.

461
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,408
No one believes you because you're a liar!

462
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,701
That's enough.

463
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,078
Stop fighting.

464
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,997
I've called for your parents.

465
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,375
Let's wait for them to come.

466
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,378
Go back to your classroom.

467
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,588
Alright.

468
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,173
Come on.

469
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,096
That's mine!

470
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,097
This is mine!

471
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,098
That's mine!

472
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,891
-This is mine!
-Stop it.

473
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,311
Grace?

474
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,813
Grace.

475
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,189
-Grace? Grace!
-Grace?

476
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,566
Grace. Grace.

477
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,367
Grace.

478
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,080
The nurse said you were hungry.

479
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,666
My savings...

480
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,589
Don't worry.

481
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:23,799
Hmm.

482
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,595
They've found your classmate's wallet.

483
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,764
I've also explained to them
that you have money

484
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,391
because you're working.

485
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,829
You believe me?

486
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,963
Fix yourself and we'll go.

487
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,383
Here.

488
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,597
I bought you these. Use them, okay?

489
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,103
You know, you should take a shower
every day.

490
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,694
Wake up early so you can do all that.

491
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,489
So that you don't get sick.

492
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,876
Don't forget to use these, okay?

493
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,504
Your hands are dirty.

494
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,700
Thank you ma'am.

495
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,323
Yes, Grace told me she fainted at school.

496
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,993
Don't worry about it.

497
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,411
It's nothing.

498
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:01,415
Maybe it was because of
iron deficiency, dear.

499
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,209
You see, we have relatives who are anemic.

500
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,919
It's called "anemic," right?

501
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,172
I'll cook some liver later.

502
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:11,717
It's not just that, ma'am.

503
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,803
We saw some bruises on her body.

504
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,472
-Bruises?
-Mm-hmm.

505
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,977
Is that right, dear? You have bruises?

506
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,105
Where? Let me see.

507
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:26,690
Here?

508
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,195
Oh.

509
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,782
How did you get these bruises?

510
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,700
You got this while at the park?

511
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,578
You fell off the swing, didn't you?

512
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,290
Tsk. I warned you about this.

513
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:47,002
I told you to stop playing
with the swing, remember?

514
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,379
You'll just hurt yourself.

515
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:55,302
Ma'am, Grace didn't get those bruises
from the swing.

516
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,386
Oh.

517
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,098
What are you trying to say?

518
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,309
That I'm hurting my daughter?

519
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,896
No, we're just looking out for her.

520
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,108
We want to know how she's doing
when she's with you.

521
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,985
You're saying she got these here?

522
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,196
When a child has got bruises,

523
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,698
you'd blame the parents immediately?

524
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:21,495
Ma'am, my daughter spends more time
at school than here.

525
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,790
Who knows?
Maybe you're hurting her at school.

526
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,500
We're not hurting her.

527
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,671
Grace, can you tell us
where you got those bruises?

528
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,593
At the park, ma'am. I fell off the swing.

529
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:43,392
My mom is a nice person. She loves me.

530
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,769
She doesn't hurt me.

531
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,483
So, um…

532
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,319
We're good now, right?

533
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,780
You heard my daughter.

534
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,534
You can both go now.

535
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,494
We're done here.

536
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,495
What's going on?

537
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,998
What's this about?

538
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,499
It's nothing, hon.

539
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,919
Grace's teachers came here
asking questions.

540
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,297
But they're leaving.
You're leaving, right?

541
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,299
Let's go.

542
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:27,185
My gut tells me
that Grace is covering up for her mom.

543
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:30,814
Plus, the man who came in
seemed suspicious.

544
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,900
How is she related to him?

545
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,279
I know that Grace's father is dead.

546
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,782
Do you think he's hurting Grace?

547
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,202
You heard what Grace said earlier.

548
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:47,497
Whatever our hunch is,
be it right or wrong.

549
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,499
she would just cover for her mother.

550
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,085
So we'll just let it slide?

551
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,296
Anna, we're teachers, remember?

552
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,091
Our job is more than just
teaching a subject.

553
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:01,511
You know, Grace's mom has some attitude.

554
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,764
She even wanted to put the blame on us.

555
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,391
She's annoying!

556
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,772
We need to do something.

557
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:18,695
-Come on!
-Hon.

558
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,114
-Let's talk first.
-What is it?!

559
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,617
It's about Grace.

560
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,203
Can you take it easy on her?

561
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,206
Her teachers are getting suspicious
about her bruises.

562
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,792
That's the reason they were here earlier.

563
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,710
Grace told them?

564
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,212
What did she say?

565
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,089
Damn that kid!

566
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,799
-No!
-Grace!

567
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,593
Chito, calm down. She didn't tell them.

568
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,804
She won't say anything.

569
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,181
Her teachers noticed her bruises.

570
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,768
Her teachers came here
because she told them.

571
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,397
No, she didn't. Grace didn't
say anything to them.

572
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,900
Besides, the teachers wouldn't
be here if you didn't hurt her.

573
00:37:56,984 --> 00:38:00,404
What are you trying to say, Sarah?

574
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,991
That I'm the bad guy? Is that it?

575
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,283
Unbelievable!

576
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,704
Tell me, Sarah. What exactly
is my role in this house, huh?

577
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:14,292
Am I just here to give you
money and provide food?

578
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,294
When we decided to live together,

579
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:20,716
you begged me to take
that rotten child as mine.

580
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,093
Just tell me
if you no longer want me here.

581
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,096
That's not what I was saying.

582
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,305
It's not like that.

583
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,516
I'm just telling you to stop hurting her.

584
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,895
You even hurt her nonsensically.

585
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,690
Why can't you understand that?

586
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,984
-So you're blaming me, huh?!
-Ouch!

587
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,318
-Stop it!
-Ow!

588
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,570
You bitch!

589
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:51,288
I don't know why I put up
with you and your kid.

590
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,292
I took responsibility
for you and your kid,

591
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,710
and yet I get blamed.

592
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,172
Isn't that great! Fantastic!

593
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,801
You're not the only woman
in the world, Sarah.

594
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,889
There's a lot out there who are prettier,

595
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,392
with no baggage,
and not a used up whore like you!

596
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,395
So what do you want?

597
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,273
Someone younger?!

598
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,984
-With no kid?!
-Yes!

599
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,612
-Then find one!
-I will!

600
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,198
That's what I'll do!
I don't want to be here!

601
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,992
I'm so sick of you and your daughter!

602
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,619
You two belong together!

603
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,081
Wait a minute! Where are you going?!

604
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,614
We'll find a way.

605
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,992
Sir, is there anyone else we can talk to?

606
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,411
It's really crowded here,
and it's really late.

607
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,205
We have something to report.

608
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,999
Uh, there's no one else. We're all busy.

609
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,417
Look, we're understaffed.

610
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,586
And the chairman is on leave.

611
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,004
Is that so?

612
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:27,384
You see, we're here
to report a kid, our student.

613
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,802
We are her teachers.

614
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,387
She's being abused.

615
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,181
She urgently needs help.

616
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:36,268
Okay. Here's what we'll do.
Write down her name.

617
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,981
Hey! Why are you prioritizing them?!

618
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,067
-We came here first!
-That's right!

619
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,820
Yes, sir?

620
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,196
Another bucket.

621
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,698
Okay, sir. Anything else?

622
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,868
Miss, what's your name?

623
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,619
Sarah, sir.

624
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,205
We'll move somewhere else later.
Want to join us?

625
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,207
No, sir. I don't want to.

626
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,419
Come on! We're the good guys.

627
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,589
Besides, we're fun to be with.

628
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,591
Don't worry, ne--

629
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,384
You pervert!

630
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,678
You got some nerve!
You're just a waitress!

631
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,680
Hey!

632
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,183
Chito! Wait a minute.

633
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,101
Guard! Guard!

634
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,065
Come on.
Let's see how tough you are.

635
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,695
Thank you, boss.

636
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,697
Oh, don't worry about it.

637
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,782
They started it.

638
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:37,287
Sarah, this is Boss Chief Roman,
my mom's childhood friend.

639
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,705
Thank you very much, sir.

640
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,915
Don't mention it.

641
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,292
Now, Chito, you stay out of trouble.

642
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,377
I thought you had changed.

643
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,380
But they started it!

644
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,885
Don't worry, I'll buy us drinks later.

645
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,887
-You will?
-Yeah!

646
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,764
Can we join you guys?

647
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,061
This way, Anna. Come on.
So we can finish up soon.

648
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,395
Let's go. We're leaving.

649
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,397
-"Leaving"? But--
-Let's go.

650
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,685
Oh, come on!

651
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,479
Oh.

652
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,106
Why are you still up?

653
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,774
Go to sleep.

654
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,867
-Wait for me!
-You're tickling me!

655
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,620
Stop tickling me!

656
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:07,669
Hold on a sec! Wait a minute.

657
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:15,885
Teacher, Pipo has gotten fat.

658
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,887
He used to be this small.

659
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:21,391
Maybe tomorrow he'll be this big!

660
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,894
What's that?

661
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,315
My plane ticket to Hong Kong.

662
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,108
I'm going to work there.

663
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,569
Isn't that far?

664
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:39,117
Why are you leaving, Teacher?
Are you not happy here?

665
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,996
What about your family? They'll miss you.

666
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,585
Grace.

667
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,004
When you need something,

668
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,798
don't be ashamed
to tell Teacher Patty, okay?

669
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,178
I hope you'll be happy there.

670
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,064
All you do is cause trouble.

671
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,608
Oh come on, boss.

672
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,693
I was the one
who got harassed, remember?

673
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:14,778
So what?

674
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,864
You act as if…

675
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,867
You know I'm raising a child.

676
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,495
That's your child.

677
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,789
Was I the one who gave birth?

678
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,500
That's not my responsibility.

679
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:32,087
Go ahead. You may leave.

680
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,683
Pipo, I brought food for you.

681
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,584
You're back.

682
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,295
Are you hungry?

683
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:15,964
Come.

684
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,800
Let's eat.

685
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:22,720
This is good.

686
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,390
What did you do to Pipo?

687
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,187
What are you talking about, huh?

688
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,190
Pipo's somewhere out there.

689
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,192
I saw that bird earlier.

690
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,027
I think…

691
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:40,697
it's over here…

692
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,782
in my…

693
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,369
...in my belly!

694
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,794
You bastard!

695
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,589
What did you do to Pipo!

696
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,467
What?
Are you going to rat me out?

697
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:04,012
We're hurting you?
Well, now look what happened!

698
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,098
Poor Pipo, I ate him because I got hungry!

699
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,394
Try telling again!

700
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,062
Do you understand me?

701
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,567
Grace!

702
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,902
Mama!

703
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,905
Mama! He ate Pipo!

704
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,781
What did you do to your uncle?!

705
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,492
But Mama!

706
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:29,996
You're fighting back?!

707
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,501
You stupid child! You're a curse!

708
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,794
You ruined my life!

709
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,171
-You're a curse!
-Mama!

710
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,881
-Curse!
-You're such a problem!

711
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,716
Let go of me! Don't touch me!

712
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,093
Let go of me! Argh!

713
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,887
My life is ruined because of you!

714
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,390
Please, stop!

715
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,017
You're a mean kid!

716
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,602
-You never learn!
-Sarah!

717
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,066
Everything's ready.

718
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,903
I'll see you at the airport,
thank you.

719
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,681
Ma'am.

720
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,100
-Thank you.
-Where's your child, ma'am?

721
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,020
She's not my child.

722
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,273
Oh, and by the way,
you left this last time.

723
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:31,409
I remember when you said,

724
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,369
"Hey, take it easy on Grace!"

725
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,580
Look at what you did
to the kid

726
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:37,790
she's all battered.

727
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,085
We should take her to the hospital.

728
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:43,796
Well, aren't you dumb?

729
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,008
How will you explain what happened?

730
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,093
You never think!
Don't give me that look,

731
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,303
or I'll slap you.

732
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,180
This is the child's house.

733
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,807
Mrs. Banaag!

734
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,310
Mrs. Banaag! Mrs. Banaag!

735
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,228
Anyone home? Open the door!

736
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:02,065
Hello, Mrs. Banaag!

737
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:06,486
You again?

738
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,196
I'm with the social services.

739
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,198
They want to talk to Grace.

740
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,991
Why, though?

741
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,868
You got a problem with my daughter?

742
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,496
We just need to talk to her.

743
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,873
S-she's not here.

744
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:26,673
Grace!

745
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:39,519
If you really aren't hurting Grace,

746
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,105
why won't you bring her out to talk to us?

747
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,899
And you? Why are you causing trouble?

748
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,984
Ma'am, my daughter already spoke to her.

749
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,612
She herself said that we don't hurt her.

750
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,906
I don't know what's come to her mind.

751
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,701
You're just wasting your time.
Ma'am, please leave.

752
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,798
If you really haven't done
anything to Grace,

753
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,718
then why won't you bring
her out so the social workers

754
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,886
can talk to her and find out the truth?

755
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,180
No.

756
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,688
Stay quiet, stay quiet!

757
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:26,399
Grace!

758
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,192
-Grace!
-Hey, where are you going?

759
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,111
-Grace! Grace!
-Stop, no!

760
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,613
-I told you to leave, didn't I?
-Grace!

761
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,407
-Don't come any closer!
-Grace!

762
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,284
-Grace!
-I said wait!

763
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,285
Grace!

764
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,911
Let go of me!

765
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:41,164
-Grace! Grace!
-Hey!

766
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,916
-Grace!
-I said wait--

767
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,293
Grace?

768
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,101
It hurts...

769
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,863
-Chito.
-What?

770
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,282
They already left.

771
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:00,284
Where's Grace?

772
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,161
Over there.

773
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,163
Dear...

774
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:07,500
Where's Grace?

775
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,585
She was just here.

776
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,547
Chito, what the heck?

777
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,673
Where's my daughter?

778
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,094
Do they always do that to you?

779
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,101
Grace.

780
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,186
I'm okay.

781
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,398
Grace, come on.

782
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,110
You can tell me if you're hurt.

783
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,195
You can cry, you can get angry.

784
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,365
You don't have to lie.

785
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:44,245
There's nothing wrong
in saying you're in pain.

786
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,295
Don't be afraid of me.

787
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,171
I'll help you.

788
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,592
We'll go to the police and tell them.

789
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,260
all the things they did to you.

790
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,178
They...

791
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,307
They might hand me back to Mama!

792
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,100
-Wait!
-I don't want to go back!

793
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:11,480
I don't want to!
Don't send me back to them!

794
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:14,108
I don't want to go back there!

795
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,902
I don't want to!

796
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,488
-What do you want to do?
-I don't want to!

797
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:22,909
Can you stay with me

798
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,578
even just for a moment?

799
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,864
"Teresa Lorenzo"?

800
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,618
She's my dad's aunt.

801
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,287
That's her address

802
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,998
in the letter she sent to dad before.

803
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:14,585
Dad said that I should go to her.

804
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,797
How would you do that?

805
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,260
I saved some money.

806
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,480
Do you think this is enough

807
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,316
for me to go to Quezon?

808
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:56,168
Teacher, why are they flying together?

809
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,297
They're look out for each other.

810
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:02,591
They're still far from their destination.

811
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,719
When they are together,

812
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,762
they can protect each other.

813
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:15,771
Take me with you!

814
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:21,068
Let me come with you!

815
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,661
Take me with you!

816
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:59,899
Teacher, why did they put me in a sack?

817
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,402
Why did they throw me away?

818
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:05,988
Am I trash?

819
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:10,493
Doesn't my mother love me?

820
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,794
Will you be leaving today?

821
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,763
Do you have to leave now?

822
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:33,993
Don't worry because
I will call Teacher Patty.

823
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:34,994
So you'll have--

824
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,581
Please don't worry about me.

825
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,500
I can take care of myself.

826
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:59,101
I'll miss you.

827
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,488
I'll miss you!

828
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,880
B-Bye, Teacher!

829
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:31,300
Bye, Teacher!

830
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,887
Stay positive, Teacher!

831
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:43,270
Stay positive, Teacher! Bye!

832
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,568
Teacher, stay positive!
Bye, Ma'am!

833
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,587
The search continues

834
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,006
for the child who fell into the water.

835
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,591
Cases likes this...

836
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:13,801
You think she's gone?

837
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,513
Are you Sarah Banaag?
My name is Miranda Valdez.

838
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:19,306
Look at all this money!

839
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,599
A lot of people donated

840
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:22,893
after my interview
with Miss Miranda.

841
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:25,479
Can it just be the two of us?

842
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,691
I promise I'll be good.

843
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,693
Get ready, Grace.

844
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,194
I'm going to kidnap you.

845
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,572
Grace?
