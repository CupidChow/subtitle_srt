1
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,086
It's her!

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,714
You came to us before,
you were Grace's teacher.

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,591
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,301
I have nothing to do with Grace.

5
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:11,721
I don't know why I'm getting
dragged into this.

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,390
Anna, I want to interview you,

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,601
you know, to get your side
of the story. Please.

8
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,603
To the person with Grace,

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:24,692
I'm giving you a chance to
fix this before it gets worse.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:29,196
Return Grace to us
within 24 hours.

11
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,495
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,875
She didn't give a new number.

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,585
She didn't even give
an address.

14
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,672
Are you still suspicious of her?

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,966
Why, sir?

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,968
Do you have other leads?

17
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,679
Sir?

18
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:56,098
Sir, what should I do?

19
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:59,185
Please help me, because Grace called me.

20
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,103
I spoke to my daughter.

21
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,271
When?

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,398
Just now.

23
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,609
She was crying I'm going crazy.

24
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,694
I don't know what to do.

25
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,363
I feel…

26
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,657
My instincts were right.

27
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,284
Someone kidnapped my daughter!

28
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,786
Someone took her!

29
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,496
Please help me!

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,123
Sir, please help me, sir!

31
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,460
Please, help me!

32
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,760
Grace I'm sorry.

33
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,597
Please, don't apologize.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,557
You mean so much to me.

35
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,988
But it was wrong.

36
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,574
It was wrong that I got scared.

37
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,161
We're okay now.

38
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,622
Just promise you won't leave me anymore.

39
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,379
I won't.

40
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,173
I promise you, from now on...

41
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,344
I'll be your mom,
and you'll be my daughter.

42
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,347
We'll never be separated again.

43
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,693
Sarah.

44
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,194
Ms. Miranda.

45
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,905
Ma'am...

46
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,990
Ma'am Grace called.

47
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,493
Julius told me, so I rushed here.

48
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,079
Grace was the only one who called.

49
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,289
What did she say?

50
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,291
Nothing.

51
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,252
Come on, let's sit down here.

52
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,465
She didn't say anything?

53
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,675
She didn't.

54
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,220
I just heard my daughter crying.

55
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,182
I heard her sobbing but…

56
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,392
The call got disconnected.

57
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:50,689
Maybe the kidnapper caught her
that she was on the phone,

58
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,484
that's why she couldn't speak.

59
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,195
Sarah, are you sure it was Grace?

60
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,491
I'm sure.

61
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,243
I'm sure it was my daughter, ma'am.

62
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,204
There's no way I won't recognize her.

63
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,748
You believe me, don't you?

64
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,001
Don't worry Sarah.

65
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,046
The police are doing everything they can.

66
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,090
They've already requested a court order

67
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,300
to trace the call.

68
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,678
We will find her Sarah.

69
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,850
Are we going to live here again?

70
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,771
Just temporarily.

71
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,358
Bobby said he won't demolish
this house yet.

72
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,866
Wait here.

73
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,579
There is no power.

74
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,756
Give me that.

75
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,492
That's enough.

76
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,704
There's something I'd like to show you.
Look.

77
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,587
Wow! That's awesome!

78
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,673
Where are they going?

79
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,884
To Hong Kong.

80
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,094
That's where they're going.

81
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,476
Am I coming with them?

82
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,564
Of course.

83
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,275
When we get there,

84
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,694
you can do everything you want to do.

85
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,613
You can eat what you want to eat.

86
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,740
If you want to play, you can play.

87
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,159
No one can follow us there.

88
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,792
When are we going there?

89
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,962
Soon.

90
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,673
Just wait a bit more.

91
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,176
Don't worry.

92
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,805
I'll do anything to get us there.

93
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,181
I promise you.

94
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,780
-Sir, about Sarah-
-You're here again.

95
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,490
Any update on the case, sir?

96
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,200
They issued the warrant.

97
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,994
We got the caller's location
from the phone company.

98
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,079
We're going there.

99
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,205
Where exactly?

100
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,082
An orphanage in Batangas.

101
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,875
Orphanage?

102
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,210
I'm going with you.

103
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,087
It's not like I can stop you.

104
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,630
Just don't cause any trouble.

105
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,099
Yes Julius?

106
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,935
The police got the address
of Grace's possible location.

107
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,770
Text me the address. I'll go there.

108
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,567
Come on.

109
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,281
What are they doing here?

110
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,201
What's going on?

111
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,911
You didn't have to come here.

112
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,831
She's the child's mother.
She has every right to be here.

113
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,584
Keep an eye on them.

114
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,378
Don't do anything without my signal, okay?

115
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,880
Yes, sir.

116
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,089
Anyone home?

117
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,508
Anyone there?

118
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,677
Open the door, it's the police.

119
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,095
Hello?

120
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,597
Anyone home?

121
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,392
Open the door!

122
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,772
-Wait! Chito, let's go!
-Hey!

123
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,482
-Grace!
-Watch it.

124
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,942
Grace!

125
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,652
Officer, you're hurting my wife.

126
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,488
Grace! I need to go inside!

127
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,200
Grace, dear! I'm here!

128
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,409
Grace!

129
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,077
Hey, you're hurting my wife!

130
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,579
Chito...

131
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,788
Sarah!

132
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,957
Grace!

133
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,293
Oh! Damn it!

134
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,295
-Why did you let her in?
-Grace, dear!

135
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,380
-Mama's here!
-Unbelievable!

136
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,798
Grace!

137
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,884
I'm going inside with my wife.

138
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:29,968
Grace!

139
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,481
"Clouds."

140
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,361
"Candles."

141
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,864
"Bird."

142
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,868
These are Grace's drawings.

143
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,169
Grace.

144
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,263
I'll wait here outside, okay?

145
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,587
"Anna, how are you?
You're not answering our calls.

146
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,465
Is there a problem? I'm
worried about you. Call us."

147
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,275
Grace drew these.

148
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,694
Are you sure?

149
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,279
I know my daughter.

150
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,573
This is her handwriting and drawing.

151
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,074
Sarah, this is an orphanage.

152
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,659
A lot of kids draw like that.

153
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,661
These belong to my daughter!

154
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,668
When we were at the orphanage,
did you call someone?

155
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:30,797
Grace...

156
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,382
Tell me. I won't get mad.

157
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,760
I just really need to know.

158
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:44,394
I thought you were going to leave me,

159
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:48,565
so I called Mama.

160
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,486
What did you say? Did you tell
her where you are?

161
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,073
No I didn't.

162
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,284
I heard Uncle Chito's voice,

163
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:03,538
so I hung up immediately.

164
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,292
Did I do anything wrong?

165
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,591
I'll just make a call, okay?

166
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,563
Ma, you have a phone call.

167
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,694
Anna.

168
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,905
Ma.

169
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,575
Ma I need your help.

170
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,288
Why does it seem you're not on our side?

171
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,583
You've been indifferent
to us from the start.

172
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,004
Officer, our child is missing.

173
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,965
This is painful for us.

174
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,386
I'm sure these belong to my daughter.

175
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,013
Trust me, ma'am.

176
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,473
Chito...

177
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,271
Come on.

178
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,406
What's going on here?

179
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,408
Are you the owner of this house?

180
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,076
It's my mother's. Why?

181
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,203
Is your mother Lucia Calinao?

182
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,580
Yes.

183
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,584
We're investigating a kidnapping case.

184
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,879
The person connected to the case

185
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,090
has their phone number
registered in this address.

186
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,675
Kidnapping?

187
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,678
Have you seen a woman
with a kid around here?

188
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,681
Here.

189
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,195
My mother used to stay here,

190
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,906
but I had her move in with me.

191
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,992
She didn't mention if she had guests.

192
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,578
She lived here alone.

193
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,207
I'm really sorry.

194
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,083
I don't know anything.

195
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,794
Actually, we're going to
demolish the house

196
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,671
because we sold this property.

197
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,090
No, this can't be.

198
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,592
My daughter is here.

199
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,094
She probably got scared
when she saw the cops.

200
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,013
I'm sure she's just here somewhere.

201
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,389
Chito, come on.

202
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,266
-Grace!
-Wait!

203
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,185
Grace, dear!

204
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,562
Grace!

205
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,278
I'll take the crew.

206
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,489
We'll follow Sarah.

207
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,782
Let's go.

208
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,106
You'll see behind me the proposed site

209
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,692
for the new luxury condominium project…

210
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,903
Which is being denounced
by the people of San Rafael.

211
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,864
According to them, hundreds of...

212
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,410
Miranda? Miranda!

213
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,370
What's going on with you? Miranda!

214
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,085
What happened?

215
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,879
He cheated on me.

216
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,882
I knew it.

217
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,303
I really don't trust that guy.

218
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,179
I was right all along.

219
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,975
Alright. Don't cry, okay?

220
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,104
I'm sure you confronted
him and that woman.

221
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,272
Right?

222
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,068
Hu? Why?

223
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,155
What's the point?

224
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,782
He won't take responsibility anyway.

225
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,410
Well, are you ready to take
the responsibility?

226
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,995
What do you mean?

227
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,582
You have an offer to undergo
training in LA next year.

228
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,001
If they find out that you're pregnant,

229
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,170
they'll give your spot to others.

230
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,882
Plus, people are going to
question about the father.

231
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,177
And of course, that means
your career could be ruined.

232
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,266
Carmen...

233
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,812
-I can't lose my job.
-I know.

234
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,690
My whole family depends on me.

235
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,359
That's exactly what I'm saying.

236
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,861
So you have to make a decision.

237
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,866
Here's your baby, ma'am.

238
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,385
What's your plan, dear?

239
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,305
People are wondering why
you suddenly went on hiatus.

240
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,101
NTV keeps calling me and
asking when you'll be back

241
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,311
because they're finalizing the list

242
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,522
of the people who'll go
to LA for training.

243
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,273
I told you, Miranda.

244
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,693
A lot of things are at stake here.

245
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,370
I'm going back to work...

246
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,248
as soon as possible.

247
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,583
How about your child?

248
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,585
You can't hide it anymore.

249
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,504
If NTV finds out,

250
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,589
they'll fire you.

251
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,091
Your mother is sick.

252
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,677
Your siblings are at school.

253
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,388
You can't lose your job.

254
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,852
That child will just bring
trouble to our family.

255
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:01,980
Why did you--

256
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,898
No one else will know
about this, Pa.

257
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,483
How are you sure of that?

258
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,573
Because I'll put her up
for adoption.

259
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,454
Miss Miranda, you're still here.

260
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,748
Uh...

261
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,629
What will happen now?

262
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,632
I told them
to stop the demolition for now.

263
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,301
We should scour the place first

264
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,803
to make sure we find Grace.

265
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,181
Why do you think Grace
ended up in here?

266
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,683
That's what we're trying to find out.

267
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,810
But based on what we have

268
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,022
this was a legitimate orphanage
when it was still operating.

269
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,192
Did Sarah and his partner
mention anything

270
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,985
about this orphanage?

271
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,782
It's been over 24 hours
since I called for Mila on TV

272
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,492
to bring Grace back.

273
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,245
Do you think it's related
to Grace's phone call?

274
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,956
Are you saying...

275
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,502
that Mila might have
returned Grace?

276
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,381
Sarah told me
Grace was crying.

277
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,177
Maybe she's alone now.

278
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,055
If that's the case,
where is Grace now?

279
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,060
Mama, where are we going?

280
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,478
I'll explain to you later.

281
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,271
We should get out of here first.

282
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,067
Excuse me, ma'am.

283
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,111
-Have you seen this girl?
-Listen.

284
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,322
Don't take this off
no matter what happens.

285
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,783
Excuse me.

286
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,201
I'll just take this call.

287
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,874
She's about this tall.

288
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,272
Mama?

289
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,658
Grace?

290
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,703
Grace!

291
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,456
Hold on.

292
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:29,961
Grace!

293
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,045
Grace, wait!

294
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,885
Sarah! What's wrong with you?

295
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,303
Grace...

296
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,262
What?!

297
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,560
Grace.

298
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,063
Come on, let's go.

299
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,698
Are you okay?

300
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,285
It's a good thing
they didn't see you.

301
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,705
Did you run
because of me?

302
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,292
If they see us together,

303
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,961
they'll have the police
arrest you.

304
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,475
We need to leave this place now.

305
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,560
Okay.

306
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,587
Are you sure you don't
want to stay at the inn?

307
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,506
There's no need, ma'am.

308
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,258
Grace might come back here.

309
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,179
You still believe
she was kidnapped?

310
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,473
Why are you asking that?

311
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:06,849
Sarah,

312
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,936
Be honest with me.

313
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,190
Is there a chance
she ran away from home?

314
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,485
That's the only possible reason

315
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,654
why she would run away
when she saw you.

316
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,157
No, ma'am.

317
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,954
There must've been
another reason.

318
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,206
No way.

319
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,584
I think the reason Grace
got scared and ran away

320
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:37,380
was because the kidnapper
was around at the time,

321
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,508
That's how my daughter is.

322
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,971
She always puts me
before herself.

323
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,559
That's the only
possible reason, ma'am.

324
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,812
My daughter would never
run away from me.

325
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,773
She was just trying
to protect me.

326
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,986
My daughter loves me
very much.

327
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,989
She wouldn't...

328
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,366
She would never leave me.

329
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,915
Yes, that's my number.

330
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,044
But I don't know anything
about that phone call.

331
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,171
I don't use that phone.

332
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:25,094
Has no one come here
these past few days?

333
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:29,390
Or is there anyone else
who stays in your house?

334
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,476
No.

335
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,812
And when that phone call
you mentioned was made,

336
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,773
I was no longer
living there.

337
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,983
I'd moved into my son's house.

338
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,405
Do you have your phone?

339
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,991
She didn't have her phone
when I brought her here.

340
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,452
She doesn't remember where it is.

341
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,757
You'd better go home.

342
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,383
We'll let you know right away

343
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,885
when we get
new information.

344
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,178
I don't want to.

345
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,888
What if my daughter comes back?

346
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,515
When your daughter comes back,

347
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,891
you're the first to know.

348
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,310
But for now it seems
they have escaped.

349
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,062
No, what if my daughter
needs me?

350
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,480
I should be here!

351
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,274
You know, I understand
your situation.

352
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,860
But you can't just
stay here forever.

353
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,364
Teves, let's go.

354
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,243
Did you hear the police?

355
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,577
Let's go home.

356
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,662
No!

357
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,747
Let's wait a little longer.

358
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,542
Don't you get it, Sarah?

359
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,211
If you want to see
your child,

360
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,879
she would've come here already.

361
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,174
She was kidnapped.

362
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,468
That's why she
can't come here!

363
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,805
Then wait for her here alone.

364
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,391
I'm done. We have nothing
to gain from this.

365
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,280
It's really beautiful
here, Mom.

366
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,199
We won't stay long here.
I still need to talk to someone.

367
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,494
Will they help us?

368
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,793
If we'll stay here
for a while,

369
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,504
we can go around, right?

370
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,965
Please?

371
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,188
I went after her, but...

372
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,856
she ran away.

373
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,067
She was just one street away.

374
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,154
I told you...

375
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,532
she has no plans of coming back.

376
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,702
No, that's not true.

377
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,787
Maybe something
just happened.

378
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,706
Grace won't simply run away from me.

379
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,583
She ran away?

380
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,793
That means she left.

381
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:07,089
It means she doesn't want
to be with you anymore.

382
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,176
It's fine, she doesn't need
to come back here for now.

383
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,971
What did you say? Huh?

384
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,101
Do you see me that way too? Huh?

385
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,562
What?!

386
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,273
-My daughter loves me!
-You jerk!

387
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,275
She would never
do that to me!

388
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,194
Take back what you said!

389
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,779
-Take it back!
-What the--

390
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,406
-I said, take it back!
-You're crazy!

391
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,700
-Take back what you said!
-You're losing it!

392
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,369
-You're crazy!
-Aah!

393
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,621
You're saying that because

394
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,873
you take advantage
of my daughter for money!

395
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,875
All you do is talk!

396
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,502
I'm sick of you!

397
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,379
I'm sick of you too!

398
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,131
-Don't come back here anymore!
-I won't!

399
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,394
Oh, Erin.

400
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,104
-Yes?
-Since you're here...

401
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,356
-please try the stew.
-Sure.

402
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,403
Is it too sour?

403
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,363
-Not really, it's okay.
-Are you sure?

404
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,781
-Yes.
-Alright.

405
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,700
Uh, where are the--

406
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,077
Charlie!
Where's the extra electric fan?

407
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,162
Here it is, Auntie!

408
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,581
We have so many
electric fans here,

409
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,083
they'll blow us all away!

410
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,794
I don't want us
to feel hot later.

411
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,422
It would be embarrassing
with Wilson's family here!

412
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,757
-Charlie?
-Alright, I'll handle it.

413
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,384
-Anna?
-What else is missing?

414
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,927
Anna? Hey!

415
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,387
Oh, Anna!

416
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,976
Welcome back.

417
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,271
I won't stay long. I just need
to speak with Mama.

418
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,106
Ma.

419
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,778
Wilson's family
is arriving soon.

420
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,365
I'll come back later.

421
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,576
Come and join us.

422
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,954
We're a family, and we'll face
Wilson's family together.

423
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,918
Charlie, set a place for Anna.

424
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,712
I'll get something from the room.

425
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,005
-I'll help.
-Wait.

426
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,393
Erin, how are you?

427
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,647
I'm-- I'm okay, Anna.

428
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,153
Hold on--

429
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,073
Sorry, sorry.

430
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,783
It's okay, I'll take care of it.

431
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,934
Excuse me, you must be
one of the staff here.

432
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,479
Please let Mrs. Sarmiento
know that we're here.

433
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,568
How are you, Uncle?

434
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,278
Auntie.

435
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,279
Anna?

436
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,281
What are you doing here?

437
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,867
We thought you were in Manila.

438
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:26,455
The last time we saw you
was before you got married...

439
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,459
I'm so sorry, Anna.

440
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,503
I didn't recognize you.

441
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,879
It's okay.

442
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,260
Anna?

443
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,181
In-laws!

444
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,559
You're already here.

445
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:48,978
Mrs. Sarmiento.

446
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:50,855
Princess.

447
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,567
Anna, what are you waiting for?
Let's go.

448
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:02,992
Please, have a seat.

449
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,879
Auntie, where should Anna sit?

450
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,380
Seat her at the end.

451
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,077
Of course, you're late.

452
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,164
Your investigation hasn't
borne any fruit yet.

453
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,584
Until now, you don't have
a clear outcome?

454
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,753
-We've been searching.
-That's all you do.

455
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,422
When are you going
to bring back the kid?

456
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,924
The more you look for her,

457
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,885
people will think
that cops are useless!

458
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,054
Miranda Valdez
is always on our backs.

459
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,474
Don't drag us down
with your incompetence.

460
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,767
Don't be so harsh, sir.

461
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,687
Boys, listen, this one
wants to get a promotion.

462
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:14,980
But he's all talk.

463
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,858
Let's go, Castro.

464
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,366
So, Anna, I assume you're
attending the wedding.

465
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,994
She missed us so much.

466
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,164
She was just too busy
with her work in Manila.

467
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:35,876
But, of course, she won't miss
her sister's wedding.

468
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,172
I hope, uh...

469
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,132
everything will be okay.

470
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,054
Julius is going to be
Wilson's best man.

471
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,976
You know they
are best friends, right?

472
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,686
That's not going
to be a problem.

473
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,854
Right, Anna?

474
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,775
Of course. Past is past, right?

475
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,571
Isn't it fascinating?

476
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:08,075
Our family's union
didn't push through once,

477
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:12,079
but now it's going to happen
because of Princess and Wilson.

478
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,455
Of course, Uncle.

479
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,585
I'm not like other people

480
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,671
who don't care
if they hurt anyone.

481
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,591
I'm not going to just leave.

482
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,886
Come on. Let's take a photo.

483
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,389
I almost forgot.
Everyone look here.

484
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,184
You have great timing,
don't you, Anna?

485
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,479
Just in time
when Wilson's family is here.

486
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,149
Princess. I heard you were going
to Hong Kong.

487
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,275
What happened?

488
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,194
What went wrong?
Because I don't believe

489
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,072
that you came here
for my wedding.

490
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,783
-Princess.
-And where were you?

491
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,285
Because Mama went to Manila.

492
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,703
She couldn't reach you.

493
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,872
Now, you'll suddenly
show up here.

494
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,457
Did you think you were a hero?

495
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,585
Princess, we have visitors.

496
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:03,547
Mama...

497
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,758
I'm sorry. I'll go back
another day.

498
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,385
Of course,
she's going to leave again!

499
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,678
Princess, that's enough!

500
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,180
That's what you want, right?

501
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,182
-What did you say?!
-Princess, stop it.

502
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,155
Anna.

503
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:38,791
What happened there?

504
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,629
You should've just ignored her.

505
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,173
You even walked out.

506
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,009
Think about what
our guests would say.

507
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,761
Come on, let's go back upstairs.

508
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:51,762
Mama.

509
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,098
Princess and I are only going
to argue more.

510
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,809
I'll talk to Princess.

511
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,185
Please don't.

512
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,562
I understand why she's angry with me.

513
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,815
Besides, your guests
are waiting for you.

514
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,525
Don't let me ruin your day.

515
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,277
Where are you going?

516
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,073
I checked in at another inn.

517
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,158
You won't stay here?

518
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,661
Ma, it'll just make
our situation worse.

519
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,039
Besides, I only came here

520
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,750
because I need your help.

521
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,254
Don't worry about that.
I'll help you.

522
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,881
But on one condition.

523
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,591
I want you

524
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,344
to stay here
until your sister's wedding.

525
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,304
Ma...

526
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,682
I already told Wilson's family

527
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,559
that you're here
for the wedding.

528
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,769
I don't want to get humiliated.

529
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,565
I want you and Princess
to make up.

530
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,069
I don't want them to think
that our family is a mess.

531
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,869
Grace?

532
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,957
Grace!

533
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,378
Boo!

534
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:07,880
You're so silly!

535
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,383
You got scared, didn't you?
You thought I was gone.

536
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,305
You're always pulling
pranks on me.

537
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,973
Were you okay on your own here?

538
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,892
More than okay!

539
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,186
I kept my promise.

540
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,438
Don't go outside.

541
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,859
Because you're a good girl,
I have a gift for you.

542
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,570
Here, I have some cashews,

543
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:34,823
bean pastry, and some tarts.

544
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,992
These are the specialties
here in Palawan.

545
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,786
If we have time, we'll roam around

546
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,579
and eat some good food.

547
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,458
Where did you go?

548
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,585
Is it nice there?

549
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,590
I visited my adoptive mother.

550
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,177
Your family is here?

551
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,472
Why don't we stay with them?

552
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,309
They might recognize you.

553
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,562
Will they take us
to the police?

554
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,274
Aren't they your family?

555
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,987
My family and I
are not on good terms.

556
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,573
They may not understand
what I'm doing.

557
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,785
Don't worry about your family,

558
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,204
I'm here.

559
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,456
I'll stay by your side.

560
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,878
Hmm...

561
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,588
Did you draw this?

562
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,675
All of this?

563
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,888
Oh, I bought something
for myself. Look.

564
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,181
Isn't it pretty?

565
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,599
So pretty!

566
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:44,893
I have another surprise.

567
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,777
He looks like Pipo!

568
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,580
Thank you, Mama Positive.

569
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,508
It doesn't make sense.

570
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:20,012
If they were in Quezon,
why did they go to Batangas?

571
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,680
What's there?

572
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,766
Maybe the woman with
the kid is from Batangas.

573
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,687
The cellphone Grace used

574
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,064
is registered to the
orphanage's owner.

575
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,984
What are they doing there?

576
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,780
Look into the
Forever Love Orphanage.

577
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,991
Find out what's going on there.

578
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,994
I have a feeling they
were there for a reason.

579
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,287
Yes, sir.

580
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,588
How's Wilson?

581
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,010
You should've said
Anna was coming.

582
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,054
So I wouldn't be surprised.

583
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,933
I didn't know that
would happen.

584
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,896
Why did she even come home?

585
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,481
Why now?

586
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:16,693
Your sister won't be
staying for long.

587
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,363
Can you at least
try to get along?

588
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,283
I have to adjust for her, Ma?

589
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,496
Please, Princess.
Just until your wedding.

590
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,791
So she's coming to my wedding?

591
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:38,465
What will Wilson's family think
of you if she doesn't come

592
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:42,970
after arguing with her
in front of them?

593
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,557
If your sister doesn't come
to your wedding,

594
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,811
it's going to look
very bad for you

595
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,689
and for our family.

596
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,068
It's normal for a family
to fight.

597
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,489
Did you explain to them
why you were fighting?

598
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,369
Please.

599
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,789
Let her come.

600
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,167
Do it for me.

601
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,176
But after the wedding,

602
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,971
I don't want to see her anymore.

603
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,604
-Bro, take a selfie.
-Alright.

604
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:35,856
Come on.

605
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,191
-Okay.
-Nice.

606
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,486
Oh, Sister Erin is here.

607
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,904
I don't get it.

608
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,698
She's always hanging out
with us,

609
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,784
but she doesn't
smoke or drink.

610
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:51,580
She just eats our food.

611
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,498
She just doesn't
want to go home.

612
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,376
I'm just passing time.

613
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,671
Why? Is something
wrong at home?

614
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:01,882
Yeah.

615
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,594
Anna is home.

616
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,304
That's it?

617
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,472
Come on!

618
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,682
Leave me alone.

619
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,143
Drink this.

620
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,770
It will take the sadness away.

621
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,355
-Uh, I'll be over there.
-Cheers.

622
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,288
That's mine!

623
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,500
Excuse me? I was going
to return it to you.

624
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,752
Oh, really? Or were you
going to steal it?

625
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,378
What did you say?

626
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,671
Cut the act.

627
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,590
You're with them, right?

628
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,675
You all look like troublemakers.

629
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:50,972
Wow! So you're ungrateful
and judgemental?

630
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,682
What's wrong with you?

631
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,601
Do you only see the worst in people?

632
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,603
Why shouldn't I?

633
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,481
They never give me
a reason to trust them.

634
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,984
Whatever.
I'm wasting my time.

635
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,862
You want your phone?

636
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,405
-Give it to me.
-There!

637
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,573
Go fetch.

638
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,283
It's all yours.

639
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,785
Hey!

640
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,373
Where is it?

641
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,961
We haven't seen you
in a while.

642
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,463
You must've raked in some serious cash.

643
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,007
My luck finally came back.

644
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,468
I want to continue
my winning streak here.

645
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,887
Are you sure about that?

646
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,307
Don't you need the money
to find that kid of yours?

647
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,560
I saw on the news
that she was kidnapped.

648
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,478
This is my money.

649
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,690
Don't tell me how to spend it.

650
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,650
Watch me double it

651
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,193
so I can have more to spend.

652
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,486
Hey!

653
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,404
Relax!

654
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,989
Chill out.

655
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,490
Don't fight.

656
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:51,992
I was just asking.

657
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,078
Back off, alright?

658
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,290
As long as Grace is missing,

659
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,083
the money will keep coming.

660
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,169
Now, show your cards.

661
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,088
Quadro.

662
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,300
I got nothing.

663
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,384
Okay.

664
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,969
Hold your horses.

665
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,762
Hands off.

666
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,475
Royal flush.

667
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,688
I'll take this.

668
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,566
You are on a winning streak.

669
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,318
Alright, place your bets.

670
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,490
After I finish this,
we're going to change shifts.

671
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:37,579
Ah, yeah. Alright.

672
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:38,955
Take a break after.

673
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,790
You'll be okay here, sir?

674
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:41,791
Yeah.

675
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,461
Good morning?

676
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,755
Is that a question?

677
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:30,590
After what happened
last night,

678
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,968
I'm not sure if
you'd have a good morning.

679
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,470
Have you spoken to Princess?

680
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:39,933
Yes, we cleared things out.

681
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,810
What about you and Anna?

682
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,603
What happened to her?

683
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,772
Did you know
she was coming home?

684
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,983
Yes, she called me.

685
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,863
Is she not coming back
to live with us again?

686
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,908
You know Anna.

687
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,495
I don't understand her.

688
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,497
Why would she stay
at that inn in town

689
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,666
when she could just
stay here?

690
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,001
What inn?

691
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,086
At Shell We Stay.

692
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,754
A friend of mine saw her there.

693
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:11,381
You want me to visit her?

694
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,466
I'll do it.

695
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,053
We have a lot of problems
to deal with.

696
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,808
I won't be staying much longer.

697
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,810
I left you some food.

698
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,063
Remember everything I told you.

699
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,567
Lock the door.

700
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:34,070
Don't talk to strangers.

701
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,783
Make sure no one...

702
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,577
...sees me.

703
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,495
Are you okay?

704
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,164
You don't look well.

705
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:47,876
I'll be fine, especially since
I have Pipo.

706
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,382
Okay. I'm leaving.

707
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:56,468
Mama!

708
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,304
Smile!

709
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,555
Stay positive.

710
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,770
Don't forget my reminders.

711
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:15,987
Pipo.

712
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,989
Hang in there.

713
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:20,575
Once Mama gets money...

714
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,079
...and things get better

715
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,291
we can go out again
and play.

716
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,412
I'm here to visit
one of your guests.

717
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,372
Her name is Anna Sarmiento.

718
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,498
I'm her mom.

719
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,583
Oh, okay, ma'am.
I'll check our system.

720
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,592
I'll ring her room.

721
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,203
Why is this on a short notice?

722
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,122
Why didn't you discuss this with me?

723
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,874
Look, I found out Anna's there.

724
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,877
If I don't get there right away,
she could get away again.

725
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,754
But what about our meeting
with the wedding coordinator?

726
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:57,881
It's tomorrow too.

727
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,799
Well, postpone it for now.

728
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,176
Until when?

729
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,012
Jessica, I thought we agreed that

730
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,055
we're postponing the wedding?

731
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,183
What?

732
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,435
We did not agree on that.

733
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,895
Remember?

734
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,605
We won't get married

735
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,690
until your mom
is okay with me.

736
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,775
But that's almost impossible!

737
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,070
So, you're saying
I won't get her approval?

738
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,198
No, that's not what I meant!

739
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,451
That's not the issue,
it's you leaving.

740
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,244
Why are you turning this on me?

741
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,996
You know this is for work.

742
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,457
For work?!
Or to see Anna?

743
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,585
Since when did you
become jealous?

744
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,505
I've always been
the jealous type.

745
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:41,466
But you're never
given me a reason, until now.

746
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:44,177
Now choose.

747
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:49,390
Stay and prepare
for our wedding.

748
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,894
Or you'll go to Palawan
and we'll break up.

749
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,270
What?

750
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,193
You are being ridiculous.

751
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,154
I'm serious.

752
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,893
Housekeeping.

753
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,068
Little girl?

754
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:45,154
You okay, little girl?

755
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,699
I-I'm okay.

756
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,785
Are you alone?
Where are your parents?

757
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:56,791
Uh-- Um...
They just went out for a second.

758
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,002
Are you sick?

759
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,587
I'm not sick.

760
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,879
We have a clinic here.

761
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,673
Why don't I take you?

762
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,675
-Please don't. Please!
-Hmm?

763
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,275
No one picked up, ma'am.

764
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,610
You can have a seat.

765
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,154
I'll call you once she answers.

766
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,489
Thank you.

767
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:29,574
Okay, ma'am.

768
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:54,682
Little girl?

769
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,684
Are you okay?

770
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,187
All good.

771
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,655
Can I touch your forehead?

772
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,406
Okay.

773
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,411
-Oh…
-Oh, see?

774
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:17,455
You got a fever.

775
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:21,000
Where are your parents?

776
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,086
Do you want me to
take you to the clinic?

777
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,881
No, I'll just go back
to our room.

778
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,758
-Ow.
-Oh!

779
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:30,593
What's wrong?

780
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:34,263
Are you scared
to see a doctor?

781
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,808
Okay, I won't take you
to the clinic.

782
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,811
But I'll take you to
your room, alright?

783
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,187
I'll accompany you.

784
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,110
Thank you.
Come again.

785
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,569
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

786
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,408
-Charlie, where's Mama?
-Oh, Anna!

787
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,325
Huh?

788
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,660
She went to see you.

789
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,078
Where?

790
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,080
Where you're staying at
in town.

791
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,790
You could've just stayed here.

792
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:01,958
Hey, Anna!

793
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,794
What's her problem?

794
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:05,795
I don't know.

795
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,797
She must've missed Auntie.

796
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,091
She didn't even stay.

797
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,262
There.

798
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,474
All right, there we go.

799
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:19,976
You know,

800
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:24,272
I could tell that you're sick
with just one look.

801
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,483
Good thing I always keep
some medications in my bag.

802
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:31,404
Thank you.

803
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,656
Oh, let me just get a towel.

804
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:39,954
You know...

805
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,374
Back when my children
were still young,

806
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,465
I'd always feel restless
when they were sick.

807
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,802
You must be a good mother.

808
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:59,265
You're taking care of me
even though you don't know me.

809
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,982
Where are your parents?

810
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,193
Do they know you're sick?

811
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,197
No.

812
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,699
Well, do you know their number?

813
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,992
Let's give them a call.

814
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,994
Oh, there's no need.

815
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,664
My mom just went out,
but she'll be back soon.

816
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,584
Are you sure?

817
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,799
You're amazing.

818
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,301
I feel so much better now.

819
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:38,179
Mm...

820
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:02,870
Seriously, Sarah...

821
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:07,083
You should eat. You're going
to starve yourself to death.

822
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,383
Knock it off, okay?

823
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,759
Where did you go?

824
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,887
Didn't you tell me
to get out?

825
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,974
So we'd stop arguing
about your child.

826
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,477
If something bad
happens to Grace...

827
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:34,485
If I end up losing her,

828
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:39,073
there's nobody else
to blame but you.

829
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,786
It's your fault that
she's missing right now.

830
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:12,773
Oh!

831
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:13,858
Ma...

832
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,988
I'm glad you're finally here.
I've been waiting for you.

833
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,575
Where were you?
Why do you seem to be in a rush?

834
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:23,993
I was at the inn.

835
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,704
Charlie said
you were looking for me.

836
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,498
So I rushed back here
to catch up to you.

837
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,584
Why are you looking for me?

838
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,878
We need to talk.
Come on. Where's your room?

839
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,879
No!

840
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:39,008
Uh...

841
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,509
The room is a mess.

842
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:43,095
Maybe you'd like to
go to the restaurant

843
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,181
so we can talk properly?

844
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,113
-Are these from the orphanage?
-Yes.

845
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:03,449
We're still waiting for
the rest of the files.

846
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,660
But these are
the adopted children's files.

847
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,577
Yes.

848
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,245
Okay, let's start with this.

849
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,581
Get the children's names
and their background.

850
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:13,167
If you find anything suspicious,
report it to me.

851
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,627
-Yes, sir.
-We're on it.

852
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,881
"Certificate of Adoption"

853
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,561
Ma...

854
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,065
This isn't what we agreed on.

855
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,275
-It's not enough--
-Like I said,

856
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,779
you need to attend
your sister's wedding.

857
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,491
Then, I'll give you the rest
of the amount you asked for.

858
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,701
Ma.

859
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,203
You've been gone
for a long time, Anna.

860
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,205
You didn't hear anything
from me.

861
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,082
Nor did I reprimand you.

862
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:56,085
And now, you can't even
give me this?

863
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,587
Don't you feel sorry for me?

864
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,381
I'm the one who's
managing the inn

865
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,758
and taking care
of Princess's wedding.

866
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,887
Can't you help me out
at the very least?

867
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,475
I'll think about it.

868
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,187
That's all I'm asking for.

869
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,774
Be there at your
sister's wedding,

870
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,486
and I'll give you
what you want.

871
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,697
Excuse me.

872
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,991
Are you the mother
of the little boy?

873
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,577
Here.

874
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,079
He needs it.

875
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,499
When I was cleaning the room,
he looked sick.

876
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,167
He was coughing and burning up.

877
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,586
But when I was about
to take him to the clinic,

878
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,088
he suddenly ran away.

879
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,466
A-All right, thank you.

880
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,385
Princess?

881
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,680
What are you doing here?

882
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,057
Do you have company?

883
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:17,977
No.

884
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,770
I heard you talking to someone.

885
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,566
Maybe it's from the television.

886
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,073
Aren't you going
to let me in?

887
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,953
Can we just talk outside?
Let's go.

888
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,790
Why are you here?

889
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,376
How much did you
ask from Mama?

890
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,380
Did Mama tell you?

891
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,090
How much is it?

892
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:50,759
I'll give it to you
so you can leave.

893
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,269
What was that?

894
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,773
What was that noise?

895
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,777
What do you mean?

896
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,696
I heard a noise inside.

897
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,907
Don't tell me that sound came from the TV.

898
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:19,371
Can we just talk
some other time?

899
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:22,583
Hold on.

900
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,378
Who are you?

901
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:29,924
Who is this?

902
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,592
Can you please leave, Princess?

903
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,469
-Let's talk next time.
-No, no!

904
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,972
We'll talk now!
Who is that kid?!

905
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:39,183
Ma...

906
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,853
Mama?

907
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,566
That's your kid?

908
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:49,860
How?

909
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,868
We need to get out of here.
My family knows about you.

910
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,373
How is your investigation
on Anna going?

911
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,583
-She's got a kid with her.
-Is it Grace?

912
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,378
These are Grace's clothes.
They're my daughter's.

913
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,588
I'm sure of it, Miss Miranda.

914
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,091
Is she Grace?!

915
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,968
Did you kidnap her?!

916
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,888
Come on, Anna!
That kid with you is Grace!

917
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,473
You kidnapped her!

918
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,892
Prove to me that it's not her!
