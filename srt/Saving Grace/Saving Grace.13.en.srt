1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,713
What do you know about Miranda
and Anna's relationship?

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:04,922
Sir Jimenez called.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,133
He saw Sarah and Ashley talking

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,926
to your private investigator.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,304
The reason Miranda Valdez
is covering for Anna

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,099
is because Anna is her daughter

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,935
that she put up for adoption.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,522
I'm not asking you
to forgive me right away.

9
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:25,526
All I ask is you give me a chance.

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:32,408
A chance for me
to fix your situation, my dear.

11
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:39,498
What was that?

12
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,625
I told you, remember?

13
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,420
We're not going to release
everything we know!

14
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,422
Why should I listen to you?

15
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,632
We made a deal, remember?

16
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,427
To destroy Anna and send her to jail.

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,636
This is our chance.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,806
You really don't get it, do you?

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,016
Huh?

20
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,019
What you did won't only ruin Anna.

21
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,229
You've also put me in trouble.

22
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,398
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,233
Miranda knows one of my secrets,

24
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:10,029
and if she reveals it,
I won't only lose my job.

25
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,616
My whole career will be ruined
because of you!

26
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,201
That's your problem.

27
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,119
How dare you!

28
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:19,789
How dare you?

29
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:22,625
I thought we were on the same side.

30
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,627
That's what I thought too.

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,212
Until you betrayed me.

32
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,799
You had me thrown out of NTV, remember?

33
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,425
You had me dragged away.

34
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,177
Because you were causing trouble.

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,430
Is that so? How should I have reacted?

36
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:39,308
We made a deal to ruin Anna.

37
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,727
Turns out you're only
looking after yourself.

38
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,938
You're no different from Miranda!

39
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,607
Don't you dare compare me to Miranda.

40
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,400
Ashley.

41
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,196
If you really want us to work together,

42
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,281
there's only one thing I want.

43
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,412
To ruin Anna's life.

44
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,082
Chito is in jail.

45
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,502
And my daughter is gone.
She's been taken away from me!

46
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,589
I won't be the only one who is suffering.

47
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,801
We're all going to be miserable.

48
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,720
Not one of us will have a happy life!

49
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,180
No one.

50
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,897
Anna, do you really need to do this?

51
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,401
I can't stand seeing her.

52
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,111
I can't stay here anymore.

53
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,991
Fine. I'll go with you.

54
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,538
I rather you didn't.
I don't want anyone get involved.

55
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,083
I don't want to owe anyone anything.
I can't take it anymore. So stop!

56
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,167
Anna, Anna…

57
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:53,716
With everything that's happened,
I realized that…

58
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,388
my feelings for you haven't changed.

59
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,017
Anna, I still…

60
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,395
I still love you.

61
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:10,900
Okay?

62
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,611
Now that the past has become clearer…

63
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,615
I just want to start over again.

64
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,998
No. We can't.

65
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,503
You don't love me anymore?

66
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,595
I need to save Grace first.

67
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,599
Anna, you can't save Grace
by running away.

68
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,396
Yes, you could hide from the police.

69
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,815
But you won't be able to give…

70
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,319
the life that Grace deserves.

71
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,697
You need to stop pushing people away.

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,411
You need to let people into your life.

73
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,331
Don't run away.

74
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,791
Face the problem.

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,588
Look, Anna.

76
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:20,302
Don't deny Grace
the people who will love her.

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,122
I wouldn't be talking to you
if it weren't for Mommy.

78
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,625
Don't worry. We're leaving.
We won't bother you anymore.

79
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,918
How dare you?

80
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,380
Do you think I'll let go
of everything you've done?

81
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,009
You've got some nerve to act all proud.

82
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,012
Jessica, I don't know
what to say to you right now.

83
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,390
I don't know if you understand me.

84
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,186
Do you know what I've been through?

85
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,399
Do you know how it feels
to be put up for adoption?

86
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,485
Huh?

87
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,238
That ever since you were a child,

88
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,282
no one has wanted you.

89
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:12,581
You don't know if anyone wants you.

90
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,002
Because even your own parents
do not want you.

91
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,297
Do you know what Mommy went through

92
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,007
and why she did that?

93
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,303
Do you think it was easy for her
to make that decision?

94
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,598
She's paid for it all her life.

95
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,227
She was never truly happy

96
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,521
because there was always
something missing.

97
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:40,317
And all my life,
I've tried to fill that gap.

98
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,320
All my life, I've always been
the second choice

99
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,531
even though I've always been with her.

100
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,616
I'm the daughter she's always had.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,410
Do you know how hard it is

102
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,704
to be the child of a broken mother?

103
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,833
It's not just Mom who's struggled, Anna.

104
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,918
I've also struggled because of you.

105
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,880
You know, when I found out I was adopted,

106
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,884
I kept asking myself,

107
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,388
is there something wrong with me?

108
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,015
What is wrong with me?

109
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,436
Don't I deserve to be loved?

110
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,481
Because my own parents abandoned me.

111
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,818
And then what?

112
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,487
I find out that Miss Miranda,

113
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,701
the person who's made my life
a living hell…

114
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,620
She lied to me and made a fool of me.

115
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:37,291
Now tell me. Say it to my face!

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,003
Isn't she a bad mother?
She is a bad mother!

117
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,296
You ingrate!

118
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,800
Mommy did everything to keep you safe.

119
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,720
For you to be comfortable
while you're in hiding.

120
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,014
She even owned up
to your crime, didn't she?

121
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,268
She couldn't tell you
that you were her daughter

122
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,104
because she knew you'd react this way.

123
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,107
What more do you want?

124
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,901
Is it not enough?

125
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,695
Isn't it enough that she is ill?

126
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:11,116
She's not well,
and we can lose her at any time!

127
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,913
Anna, Anna…

128
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,082
Anna…

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,709
Please…

130
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,087
Please, please…

131
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,885
I know…

132
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,012
Anna,

133
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,099
it's not easy to forgive me.

134
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,519
I accept that.

135
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,817
No explanation will ever be enough

136
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,987
for you to forgive me.

137
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,115
I know…

138
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,784
I don't deserve it.

139
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,998
For years, I…

140
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:47,296
I prepared for this day for many years.

141
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
But I hoped that…

142
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,221
it wouldn't be this painful.

143
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:00,892
I didn't know it would be this painful.

144
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,814
I'm not a bad person.

145
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,862
I just want to thank you
for all the help you gave me.

146
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,409
If I could make up for it, I would.

147
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,415
I have to go.

148
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,208
Anna! Anna…

149
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,919
J-Just a moment.

150
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,299
Wait a minute.

151
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,099
I've taken care of everything.

152
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,894
All the documents

153
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:50,317
t-that you and Grace
need to leave the country.

154
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,319
Here.

155
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,613
Anna.

156
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,407
Anna!

157
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:02,120
Please take it. I'm begging you.

158
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,582
This is the last one.

159
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,712
I'm hoping this could…

160
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,382
e-ease…

161
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,804
the pain that we both feel.

162
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:24,601
I'm begging you, Anna.
This is the last one.

163
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,395
Please.

164
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,189
For you and Grace.

165
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,612
T-Thank you. Thank you.

166
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,418
Oh, God, I hope…

167
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:54,005
I make it until the end.

168
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,092
Please, God. Oh, God.

169
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,303
I'm begging you.

170
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,183
Anna and Jessica are speaking
with the doctors.

171
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,703
Thank you.

172
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,091
I came by to visit.

173
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,680
I wanted to…

174
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:37,400
thank you for helping Anna
and everything else.

175
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,781
Like I've always said,

176
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,411
there's nothing for you to worry about.

177
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:56,002
I'll do everything for Anna.

178
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,506
For our daughter.

179
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,511
I just hope we get another chance

180
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,389
to talk again.

181
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,392
Do you think she'll forgive us?

182
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,187
It won't be easy.

183
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,194
But the moment I spent time with Anna,

184
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,116
I knew she had a good heart.

185
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,118
You know her better.

186
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,204
You've spent more time with her.

187
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,583
Antonio and I…

188
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,505
we couldn't have a child for a long time.

189
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,012
Anna was already four years old

190
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,682
when she came into our lives.

191
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,729
The first time…

192
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,608
The first time I held her, I knew…

193
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,819
I felt she was my child

194
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,615
I felt like I was her mother.

195
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:12,287
I loved her from the start.

196
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:19,502
I felt so betrayed by Antonio…

197
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,257
when I found out…

198
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:31,014
you and he were Anna's real parents.

199
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,018
I was overwhelmed with jealousy and anger

200
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,104
because I thought…

201
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,403
I thought Antonio had forgotten about you.

202
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,117
But it turns out,

203
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,997
Anna would be the reason…

204
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,294
you'd still be part of our lives.

205
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,299
My feelings toward Anna changed.

206
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,305
Every time I looked at her,

207
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,685
I saw you.

208
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,814
I'm jealous of you, Miranda.

209
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:27,779
Your life was perfect, your career,

210
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,991
everything.

211
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,995
Why couldn't I have that?

212
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,290
You're wrong, Helena.

213
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,295
I'm the one who's jealous of you.

214
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:50,385
You got to raise Anna,
to be with her as she grew up.

215
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,014
You felt…

216
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,393
You felt my daughter's love for you.

217
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:04,315
You experienced having a happy family,

218
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,317
while I…

219
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,698
I was just the town's so-called mother,

220
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,995
but my family isn't complete.

221
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:24,794
I even gave away my own daughter.

222
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,090
I'll do everything I can

223
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,886
to ask for forgiveness,

224
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,893
even with my last breath.

225
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,190
I hope…

226
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,488
I hope you forgive me too, Helena.

227
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,114
Miranda…

228
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,910
I'm the one who should apologize to you

229
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,915
for all the pain I've caused you.

230
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,089
Pa, is it true?

231
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,217
Is Mrs. Miranda's daughter

232
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,052
really the one who kidnapped Grace?

233
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,179
Is that why you took on the case?

234
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,514
Why do you ask?

235
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,309
I'm worried about Erin.

236
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,687
Anna's sister?

237
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,607
She loves her sister so much.

238
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,693
She'll be devastated
if Anna gets imprisoned.

239
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,612
Are you going to arrest her?

240
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,614
That's no longer up to me, son.

241
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,785
But if you ask me, of course not.

242
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,497
Not everything in life has
a clear law to follow,

243
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,000
like Grace's case.

244
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,086
Sometimes,

245
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,214
just because something is lawful

246
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,591
doesn't mean it's right.

247
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,386
That's why we need
to weigh things carefully.

248
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,183
What's just or what's good.

249
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,020
I know you're a good man, Pa.

250
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,398
Even when people look down on you,

251
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,942
you've always done what's right.

252
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,735
You worked with honor.

253
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,490
You didn't do wrong or
step on others to rise above.

254
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,910
Because of that, I'm so proud of you, Pa.

255
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,496
You are still my idol.

256
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,109
Pa…

257
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,195
Pa, no. I don't want to.

258
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,114
I don't want to.

259
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,991
I don't want to!

260
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,786
Please stop.

261
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,414
I don't want to.

262
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,707
No.

263
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:13,713
I won't abort my baby, Pa.

264
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:18,217
Even if you kill me.

265
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,386
Pa…

266
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,306
I don't want to.

267
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,602
I love my baby, Pa.

268
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:32,690
I don't want to. I won't abort my baby.

269
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,487
I don't want to, Pa.

270
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,703
I don't want to my baby.

271
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,207
I love my baby, Pa.

272
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,418
Shh.

273
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,007
I'm here.

274
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,594
I'm here!

275
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,980
I see you're awake now.

276
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,985
How are you feeling?

277
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,196
Do you need anything?

278
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,284
Just a moment.

279
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,801
You know, someone…

280
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,096
Someone once told me that…

281
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,017
being a mother is a decision.

282
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,484
I sometimes wonder…

283
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:50,203
can a child choose their parents?

284
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,123
If you hadn't been my mother,

285
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,292
this situation wouldn't have happened.

286
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,921
If none of this had happened,

287
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,886
maybe I'd be facing
a different Anna right now.

288
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,809
Everything that happened to you…

289
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,730
made you who you are.

290
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,693
Strong.

291
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,614
Brave.

292
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,411
Full of love.

293
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,414
You became a teacher.

294
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,211
You met Grace.

295
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:44,006
And because of Grace, I met you.

296
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,388
Maybe I met Grace…

297
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:56,102
so that all the anger and pain
in my heart would go away.

298
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,982
So I wouldn't blame myself anymore.

299
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,696
So I could learn to forgive.

300
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,913
Mama.

301
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,597
My daughter.

302
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,811
Thank you, dear.

303
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,585
Ma.

304
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,712
Ma!

305
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,297
Ma.

306
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:07,882
Ma?

307
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,009
Ma.

308
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,595
Hey… Ma! Ma!

309
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,192
Mama!

310
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,986
Ma!

311
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,409
I'm sorry.

312
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,536
I'm sorry!

313
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,914
I'm sorry.

314
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,119
Who are you?

315
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:22,581
I'm here because we received a
tip that Miranda Valdez is here.

316
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,584
Oh, ma'am,
we didn't know that.

317
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,255
Don't worry. We're not going to
report you to the police.

318
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,215
I'm just here to interview her.

319
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,884
She knows me. We're friends.

320
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,428
You can't go inside.

321
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:39,015
-Maybe it's better if you leave, ma'am.
-I can't? So she's really here.

322
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,599
-Ma'am!
-Hey, don't touch me!

323
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,184
Get the head of your hospital.

324
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,936
-Ma'am!
-Don't touch me!

325
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,022
You'll get us into trouble ma'am!

326
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,106
Don't touch me!

327
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,359
-Ma'am, it's better if you leave.
-Get the head of your hospital

328
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,904
or I'll expose that
you're hiding Miranda Valdez.

329
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,116
-Uh…
-Ma'am, which room is it?

330
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,619
I'm just visiting someone, but…

331
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,331
I forgot the room number.

332
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,416
Ah, what's the name?

333
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,418
Miranda Valdez.

334
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,300
We don't have anyone
named Miranda Valdez here.

335
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,696
Thank you.

336
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,908
Thank you, Anna.

337
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,703
For what?

338
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,083
You forgave Miranda,
even though it was hard.

339
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,797
She's my best friend.

340
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:58,302
We've been together our whole lives.

341
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,599
We stayed next to each other
through thick and thin.

342
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,685
From high school,

343
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,898
when she started at NTV,

344
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,318
even when she got pregnant with you.

345
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,278
You were there?

346
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,863
Not a single day--

347
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,282
not a single day passed
where she didn't regret

348
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,659
giving you away.

349
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,995
She loved you so much, Anna.

350
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:31,210
Even in her dying days,
you were on her mind.

351
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,716
Everything has been arranged…

352
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,096
everything needed for your
departure with Grace.

353
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,516
She made me take care of it.

354
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,312
You won't have to worry
about anything anymore.

355
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,609
She also left some money
for you to start anew.

356
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,113
She didn't want to leave…

357
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,116
without ensuring
you were taken care of.

358
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,788
You can leave whenever you're ready.

359
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,500
Anna!

360
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,128
I saw Sarah.

361
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,214
She's here at the hospital,
you need to leave now.

362
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,186
Grace…

363
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,316
You don't have a mom anymore.

364
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,905
Do you think she'll meet
my father in heaven?

365
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,699
I'm sure they're watching over all of us.

366
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,785
Really?

367
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,704
Papa…

368
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,914
Pipo…

369
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,000
please take care of my grandma, okay?

370
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,128
I love her so much.

371
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,006
She took care of me here.

372
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,180
Grandma…

373
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,017
thank you for everything.

374
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,480
I'll never forget you.

375
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,899
Grace,

376
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,111
we have to go.

377
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,489
Where are we going?

378
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,784
We can finally leave the country.

379
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,203
We're leaving this place.

380
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,082
Miranda!

381
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:16,917
Anna!

382
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,212
What are you doing here? Anna isn't here!

383
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,215
And neither is my mom!
Can you just leave already?

384
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,385
What do you mean?
Where is Miss Miranda?

385
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,513
This is a prank, right?

386
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,307
Miranda! Anna!

387
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,434
We're live here with everyone--

388
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,227
We're not playing games with you,

389
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,021
so get out of here!

390
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,023
Sorry.

391
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,108
I'm really not buying it.

392
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,612
If what you're saying is true,
why are you all together?

393
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,196
You know, you're right.

394
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,198
Why are you all together?

395
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,117
You're not even friends, right?

396
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,785
Now you're acting like a group?

397
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,412
There's only one connection--

398
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,706
Can you stop? Leave already!

399
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,000
Show some respect for Miranda!

400
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,628
If you're not here to sympathize,

401
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,130
leave because you're just causing trouble!

402
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,924
Okay, sorry. I actually like this scene.

403
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,636
Pretend Miranda's dead
so she can escape her crimes,

404
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,305
and then people will pity her--

405
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,931
how pathetic.

406
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,100
How dare you!

407
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,436
My mother may not be perfect.

408
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,313
But one thing's for sure…

409
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,191
no matter what you do,
you're nothing compared to her!

410
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,818
You will never achieve
the level of success she had

411
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,196
in her career and her life. You know why?

412
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,615
Because you're just an ambitious bimbo!

413
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,493
You have none of the compassion
or goodness she had!

414
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,037
So, what's it going to be?
Are you leaving,

415
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,706
or do I have to charge you
with multiple lawsuits?

416
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,209
I'm not as kind as my mom!

417
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,502
Hey!

418
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:45,130
Stop dragging this out! Bring out Anna!

419
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,632
What's wrong with you?

420
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,635
How many times do I have
to tell you she's not here?

421
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:50,928
And you?

422
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,806
How many times are you going to lie, huh?

423
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:57,810
Talking like this--
you should all be in jail!

424
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,937
Oh, really? Do you have proof?

425
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,398
Might as well say happy family reunion!

426
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,983
You witch!

427
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,287
Sir Jimenez, we have an emergency.

428
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,747
What's going on?

429
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,583
Sir, the task force searching
for Grace requests backup.

430
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,961
Sarah and the reporter
are at Venosa Hospital.

431
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,131
Most likely, Anna Sarmiento and
Miranda Valdez are there too.

432
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,591
Report this to Sir Roman immediately.

433
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,802
Assemble a team-- I'll head there first.

434
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,390
Julius, are you sure it's here?

435
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,642
This is where we agreed to meet.

436
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,484
Ma, it looks like
there are a lot of police.

437
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,280
Stay in my car.

438
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,408
Wait, I think this is it.

439
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,830
-Come on! Hurry!
-Anna, come on!

440
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:00,998
Let's go!

441
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,584
-Let's go, quickly!
-Come on!

442
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,212
Anna, what's wrong?

443
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,213
Come on!

444
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,882
Come on! Hurry!

445
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:15,512
Anna?

446
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:16,597
Hey!

447
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:19,183
Anna, get down from there!

448
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,894
Hey! Anna!

449
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,022
Get back here, for crying out loud--

450
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,982
Hey, why are you just standing there?

451
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,902
Over there, in the black car-- hurry up!

452
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,991
Julius, what's going to happen to us
after this?

453
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,993
There's a car waiting.

454
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,996
You'll transfer to it,
then you'll leave immediately.

455
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,790
Don't lose sight of them.

456
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,714
Seems like someone's following us.

457
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,803
Julius, speed up.

458
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,638
Just keep tracking them!

459
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:58,806
Hold on tight.

460
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,481
They're overtaking us! Don't let them!

461
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,903
Base! Base! We need backup!

462
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,609
I need to surrender.

463
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,695
Anna, don't.

464
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,415
You have the right to remain silent.

465
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,626
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

466
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,298
You have the right to an attorney.

467
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,093
If you cannot afford one,
the state will provide for you.

468
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,803
Grace?

469
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,389
Grace!

470
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,187
Where's my daughter?

471
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,029
There she is!

472
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,114
She's here! That's the kidnapper!

473
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,116
-Anna, where's the child?!
-Excuse me!

474
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,409
Kidnapper!

475
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,998
You have no pity for the child!

476
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,917
-You deserve to die!
-Stop it!

477
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,793
You're shameless.

478
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,214
You're shameless!

479
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,597
Anna, are you really the one
who kidnapped Grace,

480
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,098
or was it Miranda Valdez?

481
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,601
Where is she?

482
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,312
When did you find out
that Miranda was your real mom?

483
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,732
Anna, we received reports
that she died of cancer.

484
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,816
Is this true?

485
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,235
Is Miranda Valdez really dead?

486
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,237
If so, where is Grace?

487
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,614
Where did you take her?

488
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,616
Get those people out of here!

489
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,117
-Yes, sir!
-Remove them!

490
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,202
Anna!

491
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,787
Anna, is this true?

492
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,414
Where did you hide Grace?

493
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,919
We'll handle this.

494
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,004
Heinous Crime Unit.

495
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,729
Ms. Sarmiento, I know
you're grieving right now.

496
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,189
We'll keep this brief.

497
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,150
I just want to know the truth
about what happened.

498
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,612
I have to be here before
she gives any statements.

499
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:03,115
I'm Attorney Jessica Valdez, her lawyer.

500
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,701
Don't answer any of their questions

501
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:06,910
until I say so.

502
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,499
Hey! Bring out my daughter!

503
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,751
Stand up! Bring out my daughter!

504
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,837
-I said, bring out my--
-Enough!

505
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,380
-Where is she?
-That's enough!

506
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,298
Ah!

507
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,425
Anna!

508
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,926
Aah!

509
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,594
Ow!

510
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,180
-You're shameless!
-That's enough!

511
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,725
Go ahead! Try hurting me again!

512
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,727
Show everyone your true colors!

513
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,229
Show them why Grace
shouldn't be returned to you!

514
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,732
If Grace goes back to someone like you,

515
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,608
I hope she never sees you again!

516
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,902
I hope you're out of her life for good!

517
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,913
Mama…

518
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,002
Grace?

519
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,005
Don't be afraid.

520
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,091
I'm here to help you.

521
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,601
What are you doing? Come on, let's go!

522
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,894
Hurry!

523
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,605
Take Grace inside.

524
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,733
Please take care of her. Go, quickly.

525
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,985
What do you mean?
You're not coming with us?

526
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:25,614
No, there are too many police officers.

527
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,783
They'll catch us this way.

528
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,911
I just want to make sure Grace is safe.

529
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,913
-Leave now.
-Anna, what are you saying?

530
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,122
Anna?

531
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,334
I'll distract them
while you escape. Just go!

532
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,504
That's dangerous! What if they catch you?

533
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,007
I don't care, as long as
Grace is safe. Please, just go!

534
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:47,094
Mama, I want to come with you!

535
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,722
No, you need to go with them.

536
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,641
You'll be safer with them, trust me.

537
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,935
But, Mama…

538
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,020
Dear, please…

539
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,397
please don't make this harder for Mama.

540
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,525
Go with them, you'll be safer there.

541
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:02,609
Please!

542
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,820
We'll see each other again, okay?

543
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,823
I'll come back for you, I promise.

544
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,116
Grace.

545
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,832
What exactly is my client
supposed to admit?

546
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,793
You didn't see her with a child
when you found her, right?

547
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,129
That's not our only basis.

548
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,714
We have a photo showing her and Miranda

549
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:25,924
with Grace!

550
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,927
That photo could easily be manipulated!

551
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,139
Didn't my mother admit that
she orchestrated the kidnapping

552
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,224
and that Anna had nothing to do with it?

553
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,017
That's her dying declaration!

554
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,811
The court will prioritize that

555
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,980
over the photo you're talking about!

556
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,816
Perhaps they'll prioritize this instead.

557
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,907
This was taken from the hospital's CCTV

558
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,326
where Miranda Valdez hid.

559
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,204
It clearly shows you with Grace.

560
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,623
Where did you take her?
Where did you hide her?

561
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:01,835
I don't know--

562
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,212
You still deny
when we've already caught you!

563
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,798
How long are you planning
to keep her hidden, huh?

564
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,134
Don't waste your life!

565
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,344
What are you even getting out of all this?

566
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,513
You're not just ruining your own life,

567
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,098
but the child's as well!

568
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,518
Ruining?

569
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,730
Wait, I'm ruining the child's life? Me?

570
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,398
You kidnapped her, Anna.

571
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,817
You took her away from her mother!

572
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,110
Mother?

573
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,237
Sarah may have given birth to Grace,

574
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,323
but she was never truly a mother to her!

575
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,826
She might as well have left
the child on the streets

576
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,829
she would've survived on her own!

577
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,331
But to hurt her?

578
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,499
To the point where the child almost died?

579
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,793
If you had seen what I saw in that sack…

580
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,171
you wouldn't be able to bear it either!

581
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,132
Do you think that's
what motherhood looks like?

582
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:51,635
But you still shouldn't have interfered!

583
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,636
You're a teacher!

584
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,721
That's not part of your job!

585
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,514
Then what should I have done?

586
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:00,018
Tell me, what should I have done?

587
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,269
Nothing?

588
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,396
If you had seen the state of that child,

589
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,731
crammed into a sack,

590
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,234
her body covered in bruises and welts,

591
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,319
would you have done nothing?

592
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:13,114
The child's situation nearly killed her!

593
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,287
Tell me, what should I have done?

594
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,415
You? Nothing!

595
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,585
Maybe you can handle that, but I can't!

596
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:30,298
Yes, Sarah is Grace's biological mother,

597
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,094
and for you, justice means
giving the child back to Sarah.

598
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:36,096
But what about the child?

599
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,015
What about the child?!

600
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,903
-Sarah!
-Sarah!

601
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,406
What can you say now that
Anna has been arrested?

602
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:55,907
I'm happy.

603
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,492
Of course, I'm happy.

604
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,577
She deserves it.

605
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,663
How can you say you're happy

606
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,748
when you still haven't found your child?

607
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,628
I'm not done yet.

608
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:10,213
Can you let me finish, please?

609
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,009
I'm happy that Anna is in jail.

610
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,928
I trust our police force.

611
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:21,391
I'm sure they won't stop
until that woman talks.

612
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,518
I'll find my daughter.

613
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,229
No matter where they hide her.

614
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,605
I believe...

615
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,483
I'll get my child back.

616
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,398
I bought all the stuffed toys!

617
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,233
Look, there's a pig!

618
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,235
There's a tiger!

619
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,822
And I also bought
a bunch of different dolls.

620
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,324
Look!

621
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,827
Oh, there's a princess, and a fashionista!

622
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,834
And look, there's a doctor
and a teacher, too!

623
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:36,716
See? Dolls can do any profession now!

624
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,719
Thank you for the toys, Aunt Carmen.

625
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,429
You're welcome, darling.

626
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,889
Aunt Carmen…

627
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,101
when is Mama Anna coming?

628
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:51,689
I haven't seen her in so long,
and I miss her.

629
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:53,983
Well…

630
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:59,114
It's just that… Uhm…

631
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,828
She's still working on things
for your move.

632
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,996
But she's not even calling me.

633
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,583
Can we call her instead?

634
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,711
I just really want to talk to her.

635
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,005
Uhm…

636
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,884
Hold on.

637
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,315
Uh…

638
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,487
Well, uhm…

639
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,614
Seems like she's busy.

640
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,201
Or maybe her phone is broken.

641
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,914
Don't worry too much.

642
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,501
Aunt Carmen is here for you.

643
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,713
We did everything we could.

644
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:00,925
We went to the barangay office,
but there were so many problems.

645
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:03,219
It wasn't just Grace
they had to deal with,

646
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:04,721
so we went to the police.

647
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,098
When we got there,

648
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,227
Mrs. Banaag was already with Chito.

649
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:14,522
They were so chummy with the officers,

650
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,107
so we decided to leave.

651
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:19,736
Anna realized they'd side with the adults

652
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,113
over the child being abused.

653
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,283
So, do you think this is why
she kidnapped the child?

654
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:29,496
Ma'am, I've only known Anna for a year,

655
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,499
but I know she's focused on teaching.

656
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,919
She doesn't have many friends either.

657
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,714
She doesn't need them
since she's leaving soon.

658
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,090
So…

659
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:46,804
Back then, she only took on Grace's case

660
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,182
because she was the kid's
assigned teacher.

661
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,142
The kid didn't want to be left behind

662
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,520
since she was already prepared to leave.

663
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:56,981
Anna came to our house.

664
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:02,695
She was complaining,
saying we were hurting my child.

665
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,698
But it turns out, she was spying on us.

666
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:09,202
I found out from Jimenez
that Anna is actually a suspect.

667
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,787
She kidnapped my daughter.

668
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,916
As a mother,
I immediately went to Palawan,

669
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,793
straight to her house.

670
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,879
That's when I discovered
she supposedly has a child,

671
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,423
but she never shows them to anyone.

672
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,092
That's when I got suspicious.

673
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,302
I felt like the child
she was talking about

674
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:27,637
was actually my daughter.

675
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,431
What did you do next, Mrs. Banaag?

676
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,183
I didn't back down.

677
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,811
I observed carefully.

678
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,896
I kept calling their inn.

679
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:41,693
One time when I called,
my daughter answered.

680
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,404
It was Grace.

681
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:46,823
I'm sure it was her.

682
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,409
That's why I went after them
even harder.

683
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,787
Even if it ruined my reputation,
I still went there.

684
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,498
I even found my daughter's notebook.

685
00:47:57,292 --> 00:48:00,211
But they're good at slipping away.

686
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,297
They went to San Rafael.

687
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,008
Did they think I'd give up?

688
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,301
I'm a mother.

689
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,097
I followed them there and
saw where they were hiding.

690
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,516
With my own eyes,

691
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,518
I saw the house where they stayed.

692
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:18,396
I saw Anna and Grace there.

693
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,315
And what did Anna Sarmiento do?

694
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,116
My daughter didn't want
to come with me anymore.

695
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,412
That woman brainwashed her!

696
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:41,210
She planted all these ideas

697
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,587
in my daughter's head,

698
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,299
My daughter's furious with me
and even pushed me away

699
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,426
because of all the things
Anna told her!

700
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,470
Making her think I'm a terrible mother.

701
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,809
How's Anna doing?

702
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,311
She seems fine.

703
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:01,105
Calm and quiet most of the time.

704
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,107
But she is ready.

705
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:06,402
So far, she's been cooperative
in all our talks.

706
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:08,613
That's good to hear, Jess.

707
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,490
How about Grace?

708
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,784
She's fine.

709
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,413
But keeps asking for Anna.

710
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,499
She really wants to talk to her.

711
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,544
Maybe there's a way
to make that happen, Jess?

712
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:26,005
I feel bad for the kid.

713
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,715
That would be difficult, auntie.

714
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,592
This hearing is crucial.

715
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:33,304
We can't risk exposing Grace.

716
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:35,598
I understand.

717
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:38,810
Anyway, I'll try to visit there.

718
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:44,482
Grace is napping now,
so I'll leave her with someone.

719
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,819
If not, I'll just come
to the next hearing.

720
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,487
No worries, auntie.

721
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:32,447
Latest update
from the Navotas Regional Trial Court,

722
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,699
where Anna's first hearing
is taking place.

723
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:44,917
Mama...

724
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,884
Let's talk about your role as a teacher.

725
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:57,430
We've gathered statements
from your students.

726
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:58,931
What can you say about this?

727
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:04,103
They describe you as strict,
terror, even a witch--

728
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:06,814
Objection! The prosecution is leading.

729
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,233
Okay, let me rephrase.

730
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:12,904
Why do you think your students
see you as strict?

731
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,200
Maybe it's just my teaching style.

732
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:21,496
I'm not the kind of teacher who plays

733
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,581
or jokes around with students.

734
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,628
I believe studying
should be taken seriously.

735
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,297
And when they don't take it seriously,

736
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:34,509
you punish them? Hurt them?

737
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,427
No.

738
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:38,429
I don't hurt children.

739
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:41,015
I'm willing to face anyone
who claims otherwise

740
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,975
because I'm not that kind of person.

741
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,519
I'm not like others.

742
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,479
Let's talk a bit about your past.

743
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,231
You're adopted, right?

744
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,608
Objection! This is irrelevant.

745
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:53,611
I'm establishing character, Your Honor.

746
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:54,946
Yes.

747
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,197
But that doesn't mean--

748
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,699
Does that explain…

749
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,369
why you sometimes feel alone?
Like no one wants you?

750
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,204
Or you don't belong?

751
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:08,709
Most adoptees probably feel that way,

752
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:12,213
especially if they don't know
where they came from.

753
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:16,717
But was it a traumatic experience?

754
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:23,432
Trauma can sometimes lead
to mental instability.

755
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:26,602
Being adopted does not equate
to mental instability.

756
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,729
We must consider motive!

757
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,315
Ms. Sarmiento took the child
from her parents!

758
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,734
Her troubled past is relevant here.

759
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:37,780
Wait! I didn't take Grace
just because of my past!

760
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,408
No one was listening
to that child!

761
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,786
She just needed someone to save her.

762
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:47,999
If you'd seen her bruises and wounds,

763
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:52,086
neighbors, the barangay,
even the police ignored her!

764
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:55,089
She just needs someone to save her,

765
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,425
especially from her own parents.

766
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:04,015
Didn't I tell you not to let
your emotions take over?

767
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,310
What you did is like
putting yourself in jail.

768
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,478
They're painting me as a villain.

769
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,731
Yes, but still--

770
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,692
Grace's life was hell
because of her parents.

771
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,988
Now they're dismissing all that
by seeing me as crazy?

772
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,616
I won't turn a blind eye
for that child.

773
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,992
I won't do that.

774
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,536
Attorney, Anna has a point.

775
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:30,499
Maybe we should focus
on Sarah's abuse of Grace.

776
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,710
I know and I understand.

777
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,504
But we need to approach
this calmly and strategically.

778
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:38,299
Every move has to be calculated.

779
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,010
Anna had a hard time in the courtroom.

780
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:45,681
Anyone in her position would be emotional.

781
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,684
Anna…

782
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,312
take a breather, okay?

783
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,314
Just…

784
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:55,399
clear your head.

785
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,195
I believe you can get through this.

786
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,083
Everyone heard what you said earlier

787
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,502
about taking the child.

788
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:18,631
The way you explained it
supports my point.

789
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,299
Your Honor, the prosecution

790
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,343
is resorting to
character assassination.

791
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,302
Alright,

792
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,096
let's talk about something else.

793
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,808
I've received information that…

794
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:32,520
in your early twenties,
you had a miscarriage.

795
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,397
Again, this is irrelevant!

796
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,817
Your Honor, I'm trying to determine…

797
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:42,697
if this influenced her decision
to kidnap the child.

798
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:44,407
Overruled.

799
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,118
Proceed, but tread carefully.

800
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,495
Ms. Sarmiento, please answer.

801
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:54,709
Yes.

802
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,003
I had a miscarriage.

803
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:01,882
You were adopted,
felt abandoned all your life,

804
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,636
lost a child, and even
ran away from your wedding?

805
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,930
Objection! This is pure speculation!

806
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:13,394
Your Honor, her history could
explain mental instability.

807
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,313
Who wouldn't go crazy with
everything she's been through?

808
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,565
She lost a child,

809
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,192
which could've driven her
to kidnap Grace Banaag!

810
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,986
-Objection!
-That's enough!

811
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,281
You can't accuse her
of something like that!

812
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,824
Anna is not insane!

813
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,617
Order in the court!

814
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,828
Sit down, or I'll cite you in contempt!

815
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,788
Your Honor, to settle this matter,

816
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,540
the defense would like to request

817
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,459
a psychological evaluation.

818
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:53,017
Aquino, we got a report
from social services.

819
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,602
It might help Anna's case.

820
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,312
Tsk! Jimenez!

821
00:55:56,896 --> 00:56:00,024
-Can you not complicate things?
-But, sir--

822
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,359
We've already arrested Anna Sarmiento.

823
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,570
You were the one who caught her, actually.

824
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,281
Our reputation's good again.
Don't ruin it!

825
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:09,700
Stop acting up!

826
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:18,334
After conducting a series of

827
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,420
psychological assessments and interviews

828
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:22,505
with Ms. Sarmiento,

829
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:27,593
I have concluded
that she is mentally stable.

830
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:31,180
However, of course, we have
to consider the trauma

831
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,307
from the loss of her child

832
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,103
and other experiences
she went through in her youth.

833
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:43,109
This has not made her incapable
of making rational decisions.

834
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:44,902
As a matter of fact,

835
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,988
in my professional opinion,

836
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,408
her coping mechanisms are well-developed.

837
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:55,412
While she carries
emotional scars from her past,

838
00:56:55,496 --> 00:57:01,502
she does not show signs
of any severe mental disorder.

839
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:05,005
She has also demonstrated resilience

840
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:08,884
and remains psychologically sound.

841
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:14,014
Dr. Martin, you stated that…

842
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,101
Ms. Sarmiento is mentally stable?

843
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:19,812
Yes.

844
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,606
But would you agree…

845
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:26,402
that trauma can manifest
in unpredictable ways?

846
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:31,782
Yes. Trauma can affect
individuals differently.

847
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,577
So it's fair to say…

848
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:40,499
that someone with unresolved trauma

849
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,003
might act impulsively years later?

850
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:47,798
Especially if they didn't
undergo counseling or therapy?

851
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,592
Uh, it's possible.

852
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,595
-Yes.
-So…

853
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:54,680
Is it possible…

854
00:57:55,806 --> 00:58:00,019
that her kidnapping of Grace
wasn't to protect Grace

855
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,898
but rather a manifestation
of her unresolved trauma

856
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,191
from losing a child?

857
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,401
What if…

858
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,698
she sees Grace as the one she lost?

859
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:15,284
Or maybe she sees herself in her.

860
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,787
And by thinking she's saving Grace,

861
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:21,582
she feels like she's also saving herself.

862
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,502
Her unresolved trauma
made her obsessive

863
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:29,381
and overprotective of Grace,
without any logical reason?

864
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,634
-Possible.
-Thank you, Dr. Martin.

865
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,510
-Question--
-Wait! I'm not insane!

866
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,887
Order in the court!

867
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,434
Attorney Valdez,
tell your client to sit down.

868
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,687
I will not allow that in my court.

869
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:48,609
Attorney,

870
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,028
does the defense have any evidence

871
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,322
that you would like
to present in this court?

872
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,916
We have presented all
our evidence, Your Honor.

873
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:07,920
Since neither side wants to
present any more evidence,

874
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,088
I think we--

875
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:22,935
Mama?

876
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,019
Grace.

877
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,479
Grace!

878
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,534
The judge has allowed Grace to testify.

879
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,036
I'm defending you from your Uncle Chito.

880
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,997
Then why do I have this?

881
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,416
And this? And this?

882
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,335
There will be an investigation
for child abuse.

883
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:51,130
Anna's team has filed charges
against you.

884
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:56,135
Sarah is missing. Police suspect she fled.

885
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:59,596
It's confirmed, Sarah Banaag
escaped before her arrest.

886
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,599
And Anna Sarmiento is currently
being searched for as well.

887
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:03,726
Run!

888
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,105
Mama!
