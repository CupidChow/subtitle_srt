1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:03,337
I need you to focus on Grace Banaag.

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,839
She's a bit problematic.

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,633
I hope you can help her.

4
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,009
Mrs. Banaag!

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,219
Open the door!

6
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,722
If you haven't done
anything wrong to Grace,

7
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:17,601
why won't you bring her out to talk to us?

8
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,313
Why did they throw me away?

9
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,607
Am I trash?

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,736
I'll miss you!

11
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,738
B-Bye, Teacher!

12
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,323
Stay positive, Teacher!

13
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:33,701
B-Bye!

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,002
Hey, hurry up!

15
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,714
Hey, little girl!

16
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,424
What are you doing there?

17
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,593
The storm is coming. Go home!

18
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,581
Grace!

19
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,715
Grace!

20
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,219
Grace?

21
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,303
Grace!

22
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,515
Grace!

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,016
Stop the car, sir.

24
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,782
Grace!

25
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:35,990
Ouch!

26
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,998
Did you hear that?

27
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,499
No.

28
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,087
Little girl?

29
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,423
Little girl?

30
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,552
Oh, dear God. Little girl?

31
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,028
I think that's the kid's mom,

32
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,404
Sarah Banaag.

33
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,698
Grace!

34
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,116
Oh!

35
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,911
Sir! Do you remember me?

36
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,329
I'm Sarah.

37
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,915
Do you know what happened to my daughter?

38
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,675
Two tickets to Quezon,
one adult, one child.

39
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,013
You must take after your father.

40
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,182
Because you don't look like them.

41
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:39,321
The first bus won't leave until 5 am.

42
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,493
Thank you.

43
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,917
Are we going to take the bus?

44
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,380
Not yet. The next trip is tomorrow.

45
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,926
Are you sure you'll come with me?

46
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,388
Don't you have a flight to catch?

47
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,521
Don't worry I'll accompany you first.

48
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,190
I want to make sure you're safe.

49
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,200
I've never ridden a bus before.

50
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,199
Grace?

51
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:07,993
Grace?

52
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,996
Goddammit!

53
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,914
Hey!

54
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,624
Are you trying to kill yourself?

55
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,250
How about I kill you instead?

56
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,379
Grace!

57
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,309
Hello?

58
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,020
Calm down! I don't understand you!

59
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,107
Fell into--

60
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,404
All right, I'll be there.

61
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,916
Why did they let the kid wander off?

62
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,503
There's a thunderstorm
and the waves are strong.

63
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,298
I heard it's not an accident.

64
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,591
The kid might've jumped.

65
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,512
Seriously? You think a kid would do that?
Oh, but it's not an accident.

66
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,722
Who knows, it could
have been premeditated.

67
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,683
-That's right.
-Someone pushed her.

68
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,987
That must be her stuff.

69
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,791
Come.

70
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,419
The search is still ongoing

71
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,671
for the child who fell
into water yesterday.

72
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,924
Authorities are still trying to figure out
what really happened,

73
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,385
and if it was accidental
or there was foul play.

74
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,099
I'm sorry, ma'am, sir.

75
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,893
We're just looking for someone.

76
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,296
Sir, we found the snatcher
hiding in the other bus.

77
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,590
All right.

78
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,884
Sorry for the trouble.

79
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,695
He even accused me of having a lover.

80
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,200
He has no idea about all
the hardships I went through

81
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,702
while working abroad.

82
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,124
You haven't seen
your child in seven years.

83
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,209
Yes.

84
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,836
If she were here today,

85
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,797
what would you like to tell her?

86
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,092
Dear, wherever you are right now,

87
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,386
if you're listening,

88
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,223
remember that I love you very much.

89
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,809
Mama misses you so much.

90
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,019
Jasmine, dear, come on out.

91
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:27,401
Oh, my dear daughter!

92
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,826
Oh, my dear...

93
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,537
I've missed you so much.

94
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,748
Thank you for joining us today.

95
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,208
Let's meet again tomorrow.

96
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,835
This has been Miranda Valdez.

97
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,421
The nation's mother!

98
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,716
Your confidant for life.

99
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,016
When was the last time you saw Grace?

100
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,017
Uh...

101
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,602
Yesterday.

102
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,604
Yesterday morning.

103
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,897
How was she?

104
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,819
What do you mean how was she?

105
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,615
Sir, what kind of a question was that?

106
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,827
Will that help find Grace?

107
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,204
Where's Uncle Roman? Bring him here!

108
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,123
These are standard questions.

109
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,417
We just want to know
what happened to Grace.

110
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,626
It wasn't like that.

111
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,295
We were okay before she left.

112
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,797
If that is so, what was she
doing at the port?

113
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,507
That kid's always sneaking out.

114
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,926
But she eventually comes home.
She always does.

115
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,722
Come on Sarah. Stop covering up for her.

116
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,016
Sir, that kid is really stubborn.

117
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,601
She never listens to us.

118
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,312
She just runs off
and does whatever she pleases.

119
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,731
When we tell her off, she throws a tantrum

120
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,358
and acts up even more.

121
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,026
She's such a pain to deal with.

122
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,738
But if you're thinking we neglected her,

123
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,114
you're gravely mistaken.

124
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,326
We are her parents.

125
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,496
No matter what Grace does,
we love her very much.

126
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,499
Okay I'll talk to Mom.

127
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,836
Good evening Aunt Carmen!

128
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,213
-Hi, baby.
-Hi!

129
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,341
I heard you won an award again.

130
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,259
I did!

131
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,302
-Congratulations Mom.
-Thank you, baby.

132
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,387
Thank you so much.

133
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,888
Thank you, thank you.

134
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,601
Who were you talking to
on the phone earlier?

135
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,020
Oh! That was Uncle Delfin.

136
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:09,938
Oh.

137
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,857
He's eyeing a vacant lot in Batangas

138
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,900
that he wants to develop into a resort.

139
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,320
He's asking if he could
borrow money from you.

140
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,405
Sure.

141
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,614
Mom!

142
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,116
Here you go again.

143
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,326
Dear, he's family.

144
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,121
We're working hard
for our family, aren't we?

145
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,414
Give him the money.

146
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,207
Fine! Fine.

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,001
But...

148
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,794
-Mm?
-I'll have to check...

149
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,630
The lot first okay?

150
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,300
I have to make sure the title is clean.

151
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,512
I don't want them getting
scammed again like last time.

152
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,932
They can't always rely on you.

153
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,434
Thank you, dear.

154
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,604
I'll leave you two alone.

155
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,608
I need to have a word with security.

156
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,318
Oh, she never changes.

157
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,402
My goodness.

158
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,700
So I have a case you can use on your show.

159
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,702
-Hm?
-I've mentioned it to Julius.

160
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,913
-That's good.
-Speaking of which…

161
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,833
-hm?
-Can we have dinner with him?

162
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,085
I just need to tell you something.

163
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,213
Sure.

164
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,508
But I don't think I'll be free
anytime soon.

165
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,010
It's important Mom.

166
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,680
Speak of the devil.

167
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,600
-Miss Miranda.
-Hello.

168
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,270
Babe, you're too formal.

169
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,523
You don't have to treat
Mommy like your boss

170
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,857
when it's just us around.

171
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,317
Jessica.

172
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,487
I was just telling Mom about dinner.

173
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,781
Well, that can wait.

174
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,408
The higher-ups want to see you.

175
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,535
Ah.

176
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,911
I think I know why.

177
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,207
They probably want to congratulate us
because I won another award.

178
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,500
I'll just change.

179
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,507
Miranda.

180
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,511
This is Ashley Santillan, our new host.

181
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,389
Hi.

182
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,307
Hi Madam Miranda.

183
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,101
'Miss Miranda' is fine.

184
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,062
What show is she doing?

185
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,605
Yours.

186
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,025
Is this a joke? It's not funny.

187
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,902
Just one segment Miranda.

188
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,654
While you're the Nation's Mother.

189
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,824
Ashley is the Nation's Big Sister.

190
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,910
She will be the voice of today's youth,

191
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,704
providing a different perspective.

192
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,999
Plus, she has a good following
on social media.

193
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,500
Haven't you heard already?

194
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,628
Miranda just won an award

195
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:42,299
as the best public affairs program host.

196
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,010
-For ten consecutive years.
-Yes.

197
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,012
But have you seen the ratings?

198
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,599
There are days when you lose
to your rival show.

199
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,518
We suggested that you copy their format,

200
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,896
but you opposed to it strongly
because you didn't want any fights.

201
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,108
To be honest, the format
of your show is outdated.

202
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,111
Where's the grit? Where's the vigor?

203
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,905
But it's still better than
an all-gimmick, rigged show.

204
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,782
It's fine Julius.

205
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,910
Let me just tell you one thing.

206
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,540
There's a reason why my show
has been going on for so long.

207
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,209
And ever since,

208
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,129
we never had to resort
to cheap gimmicks or tricks

209
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,589
to keep the show on top.

210
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,303
It's public service.

211
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,721
Not circus.

212
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,687
Uh...

213
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,023
Hurry.

214
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,108
Uh I'm begging you.

215
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,027
Please help me look for my daughter.

216
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,655
The authorities have stopped
their rescue efforts.

217
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,032
We're willing to help you look for her,

218
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,618
but as you can see,
the weather is very bad.

219
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,037
We might end up in danger.

220
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,498
We also have families that rely on us.

221
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,500
You might be able to save my daughter.

222
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,710
-Please help me.
-You see...

223
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,004
We've been fishing for many years.

224
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:06,383
And in cases like that,
it's most likely that...

225
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,426
Most likely what?

226
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,636
Hu?

227
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,388
Most likely, my daughter is dead?

228
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,598
My daughter is not yet dead!

229
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,059
Otherwise, you should've
already found her body.

230
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,852
Take back what you said.

231
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,604
-Take back what you said!
-Sarah!

232
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,898
-What?
-Come here. Calm down.

233
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,901
No! You just want something from us!

234
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,112
What do you want? Money?

235
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,113
-Stop this!
-No!

236
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,197
They want extortion!

237
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,532
-Shut up!
-Why?

238
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:34,035
Don't lash out at them.
That won't be of any help!

239
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,705
No! I won't stop
until my daughter is found.

240
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,206
You hear that?

241
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,708
-Ouch!
-Stop this!

242
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,418
What's with you?

243
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,294
Get a hold of yourself!

244
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,633
I won't stop.

245
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,886
I'll keep searching
until I find my daughter.

246
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,725
Ever since I got pregnant
with Grace, what happened?

247
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,394
People kept saying nasty things about me!

248
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,190
"Oh Sarah? She's been a flirt
since she was young."

249
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,695
"Sarah is so stubborn and stupid!"

250
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,947
"She won't amount to anything!"

251
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,198
And now what?

252
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,326
My daughter is missing.

253
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,497
Stop crying. Don't waste your tears, okay?

254
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,333
What if...

255
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,794
Your daughter didn't really
fall into the water?

256
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,713
What if she's just wandering around?

257
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,132
Someone saw my daughter
fall into the water!

258
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,801
What if they were mistaken?

259
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,512
Couldn't they have seen wrong?

260
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,223
Don't yell at me!

261
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,768
You're acting strange.
Do you know anything? Hu?

262
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,936
Is there something you're not telling me?

263
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,817
Earlier, you called me, right?

264
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,111
You said your daughter
fell into the water.

265
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,821
I saw her Sarah.

266
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,491
I think I saw her… alive.

267
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,497
You bastard!

268
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,000
You saw my daughter,
but you didn't tell me?

269
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,919
Didn't you say on the phone

270
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,129
that your daughter fell into the water?

271
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,714
What did you expect?

272
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,508
Of course I second guessed myself!

273
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,510
What if I was mistaken?

274
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,428
You shameless bastard.

275
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,305
Look at you. You're so stupid!

276
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,390
You're driving me crazy!

277
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,936
I've been going crazy
looking for my daughter,

278
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,938
but you didn't even bother to tell me?

279
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,105
You just kept silent?

280
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,941
You didn't intend to say anything?

281
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,859
What if that really was my daughter?

282
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,321
Well then, congrats!

283
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,198
Okay? Your daughter is alive!

284
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,201
But I'm telling you Sarah...

285
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,204
Don't you dare tell the police.

286
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,622
Do you understand?

287
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,917
-And why is that, hu?
-You want to know why?

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,836
What if they do find Grace?

289
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,631
How would you explain
all the bruises on her body

290
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,509
caused by your beating?

291
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,720
If the police ask her Sarah,

292
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,431
we'll end up behind bars.

293
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,683
Do you understand me?

294
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:28,418
Teacher I need to pee
and drink some water.

295
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,212
Alright.

296
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,091
Come on.

297
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,804
Don't leave my side, okay?

298
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,599
Come on.

299
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:44,809
Hold my hand.

300
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,687
-I'm getting squished!
-Wait a minute.

301
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,522
Hold on, you're squishing the kid!

302
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,399
-Mind the kid!
-Hey! Hey!

303
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,985
Hey! That's mine!

304
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,695
Give it back!

305
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,697
Go ahead! I dare you!

306
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,784
-Look over there.
-Teacher, are you okay?

307
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,418
Take all my money. Just don't hurt us.

308
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,600
Grace.

309
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,397
Are you okay?

310
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,899
Who was that man?

311
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,694
Why did you give your wallet to him?

312
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,337
Give me good stories!

313
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,214
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

314
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,134
-Miranda.
-Hm?

315
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,303
You're looking for an engaging story?

316
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,389
Check this out.

317
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,433
A missing child.

318
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,685
A distraught mother…

319
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,603
looking for her daughter.

320
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,105
It's part of your advocacy.

321
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,026
But they've already confirmed
that the kid is missing, right?

322
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,904
Where's the heartwarming reunion?

323
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,614
This is too depressing Julius.

324
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,199
Yes, but because of this news,

325
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,203
we can explore other kids
from similar backgrounds.

326
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,498
Why was the kid there in the first place?

327
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,003
From what I learned, the kid was working.

328
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,507
That's why she was at the port
despite the bad weather.

329
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,217
Excuse me?

330
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,052
Are you trying to blame the victim?

331
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,097
Is that what you want to convey Julius?

332
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,599
That it was the mother's fault?

333
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,103
Do you know their lives?

334
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,105
You don't know them.

335
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,609
You don't know what
they are going through.

336
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,903
You don't know every
sacrifice and decision

337
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,530
a mother has to make.

338
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,116
Not just every day or every minute

339
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,826
but every second.

340
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,621
Miranda, that's not what
I was trying to say, okay?

341
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,999
Yes, maybe they have a reason.

342
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,502
But why was the kid put in that situation?

343
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,213
That's not what our viewers
want to see Julius.

344
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,132
Yes, they want drama.

345
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,301
But they also want to be inspired.

346
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,512
Maybe this is why our show's
ratings are plummeting.

347
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,016
Because our show has become too soft!

348
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,728
Miranda, that's not how the world is.

349
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,021
The world is cruel!

350
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,107
So, you think I don't know that?

351
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,109
That's why we're here.

352
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,779
That's why we do what we do.

353
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,991
Miranda, please, give this a chance, okay?

354
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,620
I assure you, this is the story
we're looking for.

355
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,707
Well then, give me more
about this story Julius.

356
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,419
Because as it is? My answer is no!

357
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,301
Ma'am, this is really a problem nowadays.

358
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,637
We're doing everything
we can to keep watch,

359
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,639
but some still manage to slip through.

360
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,724
But don't worry, ma'am.

361
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,643
We have plenty of CCTV cameras here.

362
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,938
I'm sure we captured the thief's face.

363
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,818
I've also called the police,
they're on their way.

364
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,616
Uh, what was your name again, ma'am?

365
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,992
Ma'am?

366
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,580
Uh... M-Mila.

367
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,500
And you, boy?

368
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,712
You seem brave, hu? Weren't you scared?

369
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,297
What's your name?

370
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,221
Bright I'm Bright.

371
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,682
Oh Bright. You really are brave.

372
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,227
What's he doing in Navotas?

373
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,729
Please wait for the police,
they're on their way.

374
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,189
Alright.

375
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,288
Is Bright okay, teacher?

376
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,206
Does it suit me?

377
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,506
Yes,

378
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,217
it's probably better for them
to think you're a boy.

379
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,099
So I'm going to pretend?

380
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,814
Just think of it as a game.

381
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,399
Like when we play house?

382
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,735
You're the child, and I'm the mother.

383
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,404
From now on,
don't call me teacher, alright?

384
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,992
Can I not call you 'mama'?

385
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,336
Up to you, whatever you like.

386
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,379
After all, we're just playing, right?

387
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,299
Auntie instead.

388
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,303
Auntie.

389
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,722
From now on…

390
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,808
don't forget to call me auntie, okay?

391
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,368
Good day.

392
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,703
Oh, handsome, what's up?
What brings you here?

393
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,830
Do you know Sarah Banaag?

394
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,917
Oh, yes. Why? Who are you?

395
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,920
I'm Julius Hernandez.
I'm a producer at NTV.

396
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,507
We want to cover what happened to Grace.

397
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,217
Oh, is that so?

398
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,719
What happened to the child
was really tragic.

399
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,096
May she rest in peace.

400
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,016
Uh, are you sure she's gone?

401
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,311
Well, we've lived by
the seaside for a long time.

402
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,814
Given the weather conditions that day,

403
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,691
it's unlikely she'll be found.

404
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,902
-Hm.
-But in a way,

405
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,529
maybe it's better that way.

406
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,990
At least her suffering ended early.

407
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,119
What do you mean?

408
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,997
Oh, not that we're gossips,

409
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,709
but we noticed the child was neglected.

410
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,504
Always out on the streets, so dirty,

411
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,131
not eating properly.

412
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,509
And we've even heard that
Chito would always hurt her.

413
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,220
You gossip! What nonsense are you saying?

414
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,722
-Why?
-I hurt Grace?

415
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,433
Isn't it true? Why are you mad?

416
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,435
Didn't a social worker
even come to your house-

417
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,519
you're crazy!

418
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,812
This one's crazy!

419
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,732
Why don't you make your brain
as big as your mouth?

420
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,483
-You're spreading fake news-
-Hey!

421
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,996
Enough!

422
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,212
He got mad because
I talked to his neighbor.

423
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,299
Sir I wasn't doing anything wrong.

424
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,092
Then he suddenly attacked me.

425
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,094
What's this about?

426
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,513
About what happened to Grace Banaag.

427
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,098
Why are you asking about that?

428
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,225
Sir I'm a tv producer.

429
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,311
I'm just trying to find out what happened.

430
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,896
Trying to find out or meddling?

431
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,816
This jerk is just causing trouble,

432
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,110
saying all kinds of things.

433
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,195
Why?

434
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,198
Maybe you're just afraid
that the truth will come out.

435
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,116
That you were hurting the child!

436
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,118
-Were you hurting Grace?
-Sir...

437
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,578
That's not true, sir.

438
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,081
You're making this up, you bastard.

439
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,709
Hold on, hold on, this is another matter

440
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,504
what we're discussing here is your case.

441
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,006
Are you going to press charges?

442
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,717
Of course, we're pressing charges.

443
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,719
I'm Attorney Jessica Valdez.

444
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,931
I'm Mr. Julius Hernandez's lawyer.

445
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,101
A lawyer? It's just a scratch!
You're weak.

446
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,603
The charge will be
Slight Physical Injuries.

447
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,399
There are witnesses
who saw you start the fight.

448
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,734
I can present them all here.

449
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:17,113
Mr. Hernandez only acted in self-defense.

450
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,201
Really?

451
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,203
Another story about a possessed woman?

452
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,999
If it's not a monster, it's a ghost.

453
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,210
Come on, guys.

454
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,130
Do I look like a faith healer? It's close.

455
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,632
Don't you have any better story ideas?

456
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,800
So far Ms. Miranda,

457
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,928
those are the episodes that
beat the competition.

458
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,513
It's also been approved by Sir Julius.

459
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,600
Tommy, piece of advice, hu?

460
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,729
I know your brilliance and capabilities.

461
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,898
Don't be afraid to speak up to Julius,

462
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,234
even if he's in a higher
position than you.

463
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,820
I know you have a lot of idea, share them.

464
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,613
Where is Julius, anyway?

465
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,407
He's at the station, ma'am.

466
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,200
Looks like he got into a fight in Navotas.

467
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,411
What the hell?

468
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,580
What's he doing in Navotas?

469
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,916
Is he still pursuing that story
about the missing child?

470
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,918
But you know what Ms. Miranda?

471
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,129
I think Sir Julius's instincts are right.

472
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,297
Look at this.

473
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,633
The post about the mother searching?

474
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,719
It already has a lot of views- 100,000.

475
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,096
There are also many supportive
comments for the mother.

476
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:39,987
5,000.

477
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,990
5,000? Isn't that too low?

478
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,994
5,000 is really the best I can do, ma'am.

479
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,206
That model already has a new version out,

480
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,918
so the price is low for the older models.

481
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,797
Can't you increase it?

482
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,549
7,000?

483
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,843
If you want, you can sell it
to someone else.

484
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,637
I'm already offering a high price.

485
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,597
Pretty Missy,

486
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,600
aren't you the one selling the cellphone?

487
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,186
Yes.

488
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,689
The guy over there will buy it for 8,000.

489
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,029
-Come on Miss Beautiful!
-Wait!

490
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,489
Sell it to me.

491
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,699
I'll take it for 8,000.

492
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,035
No, let's go with the guy!

493
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,578
I'll take it for 9,000.

494
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,414
10,000.

495
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,218
Thank you.

496
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,397
Sarah I need money.

497
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,481
What?

498
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,817
Why?

499
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,402
I got into a fight.

500
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,196
They were saying things
about what I did to Grace.

501
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,031
The guy I hit seems someone important.

502
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,200
I need 40,000 pesos to post bail

503
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,910
and get out of here right away.

504
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,705
Chito I don't have money.

505
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,833
You know that I'm looking
for Grace, right?

506
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,836
Plus I got fired.
Where would I get the money?

507
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,129
Damn it Sarah!

508
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,505
Do I have to think of everything?

509
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:22,715
Use your brain.

510
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:23,799
Do something.

511
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,384
Hello Chito? Hello?

512
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,886
Who's that?

513
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,893
-Ma'am Miranda!
-Can we take a photo?

514
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,315
You're so beautiful.

515
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,819
-Make way please.
-Let's take a photo.

516
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,406
Come on, just one picture, please.

517
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,784
Are you Sarah Banaag?

518
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,829
Yes. Why?

519
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,914
I'm Miranda Valdez.

520
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,584
Can I interview you?

521
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,137
Well, did it fit?

522
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,182
Approved! It's perfect. Thank you.

523
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:14,933
Come on.

524
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,810
Let's eat first.

525
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,396
The bus will be here soon.

526
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,315
Sit there first.

527
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:32,910
Eat up.

528
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,918
Hey. Why are you not eating?

529
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,005
I don't want to eat.

530
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,966
Grace, you should eat.

531
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,718
This is all we have. Eat it.

532
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,930
Seriously Grace?

533
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,682
Why did you do that?

534
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,434
You shouldn't throw food
just because you don't like it.

535
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,686
That's wrong!

536
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,494
I remembered Pipo.

537
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,790
Uncle Chito ate him.

538
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,089
Grace I'm sorry.

539
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,092
I forgot about Pipo.

540
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,722
I

541
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,306
i'm sorry.

542
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:46,817
Five years ago, you hit a 12-year-old kid.

543
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,028
He was severely hurt that he was
in the hospital for three days.

544
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:53,323
That kid was a thief.

545
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:54,700
How about this?

546
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,912
You kicked a four-year-old kid
playing in front of your house

547
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,707
just because the kid was noisy
and disturbed your sleep.

548
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,333
What was I supposed to do?

549
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,085
The kid was being rude.

550
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,213
Are you also like that towards Grace?

551
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,424
Do you hit her when she does
something you don't like?

552
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,593
I'm not doing anything wrong to Grace.

553
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,804
I treat that child like my own.

554
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,307
You were reported to social services

555
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,809
because Grace had bruises in her body.

556
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,812
Your neighbors also heard a
commotion inside your house

557
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,230
the night before she disappeared.

558
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,816
What exactly did you do to her Chito?

559
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,318
You can't prove anything

560
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,280
because I didn't do
anything wrong to the child.

561
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,419
Pipo was color pink

562
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:50,380
when I won him at the fair.

563
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,883
But…

564
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,386
uncle Chito ate him.

565
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,896
Pipo was...

566
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:11,193
Pipo was my only friend.

567
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,496
Is that why your mother hurt you?

568
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,088
Grace...

569
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,009
I'm not like your mom and Uncle Chito.

570
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,887
I won't hurt you.

571
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,598
What about you?

572
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,519
Did your mom also hurt you

573
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,688
when you were young?

574
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,906
I was the one who hurt them.

575
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,913
Happy birthday to you

576
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,624
happy birthday to you

577
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:11,503
happy birthday, happy birthday

578
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,715
happy birthday to you

579
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,508
yay!

580
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,012
Yay! What's your wish, dear?

581
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,514
That we'll be together forever!

582
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,892
Wow, that's so sweet!

583
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:26,935
Alright.

584
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,605
Oh Pa I heard there are
hornbills in the mangrove area

585
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,315
on the nearby island.

586
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,610
Can we go there, please? Please Pa?

587
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,112
You know I was thinking the same thing.

588
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,697
I also want to go there.

589
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,701
We'll have one more entry
in our scrapbook.

590
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,286
Thank you Pa!

591
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,705
Thank you!

592
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,294
Let's eat.

593
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,797
We'll all go there. It'd be fun.

594
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,799
No, thanks. I'll stay here.

595
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,426
I'll read this book.

596
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,220
Besides, we need to take
a boat going there.

597
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,680
I'll get tired.

598
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,016
-Anna will row the boat.
-Yeah.

599
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,101
You two will just sit on the boat.

600
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,436
You won't get tired at all.

601
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,898
No, thanks. I'll just stay here.

602
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,116
Anna I dropped my doll!

603
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,201
Oh no!

604
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,717
Antonio!

605
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,094
What happened?

606
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,137
Uh...

607
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:49,101
My daughter Anna, fell off the boat.

608
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,937
My husband saw her,

609
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,981
but the waves were too strong.

610
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,024
I tried to stop him,

611
00:37:56,108 --> 00:38:00,487
but my husband insisted in saving Anna.

612
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,698
He has a wound in his head

613
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,325
when he was found by the rescuers.

614
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:08,120
Do you know how he got it?

615
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,705
Hu?

616
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,998
No-

617
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,624
no, sir.

618
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,627
I don't- I don't know.

619
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,212
I don't know.

620
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,214
I guess...

621
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,135
I guess he got it when
he fell off the boat.

622
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,930
My husband will do
anything for our children

623
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,599
even if he's hurt or not feeling well.

624
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:32,811
I don't- I don't know.

625
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:36,398
Alright. We'll be back if we
have more questions.

626
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,283
Ma.

627
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,911
I'm sorry.

628
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,289
I'm so sorry.

629
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,390
I'm sorry!

630
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,593
Helena.

631
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,804
I'm sorry.

632
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,932
There was nothing else I could do.

633
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,017
Someone was going to adopt her.

634
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,897
That's why you convinced me
to adopt her instead!

635
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,234
You're so cruel Antonio!

636
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,028
You knew I had a hard time
getting pregnant,

637
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,696
and you made me feel guilty.

638
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,532
You're so cruel!

639
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,535
I loved that child. I took care of her.

640
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,329
I treated her like she's my own.

641
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,125
But it turns out, she's
your child with someone else!

642
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,417
Helena...

643
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,505
That's why I'm begging you.

644
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,132
That happened a long time ago.

645
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:28,135
Anna is now 17.
She thinks you're her mother.

646
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,177
No!

647
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,181
You will tell her the truth!

648
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,517
No, no.

649
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,520
Please don't do that to the child.

650
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,397
That will surely hurt her.

651
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,483
I see so many fish!

652
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,699
"The child"?

653
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,035
You're worried about
how the child would feel.

654
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,997
What about me?
Do you care about how I feel?

655
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,833
Helena, that's why I'm begging you.

656
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,086
Please don't let the child
suffer for my sins.

657
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,714
I know you love her too.

658
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,924
Can't you just accept it?

659
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,718
Let's not ruin the child's life.

660
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,011
What about me?

661
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,222
What about me?

662
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,223
What about me?

663
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,516
-What about me?
-Helena!

664
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,811
Anna!

665
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,314
Antonio!

666
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,107
It's your fault!

667
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:27,903
If it weren't for you,
papa wouldn't have died.

668
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,112
If it weren't for you,

669
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:31,323
we wouldn't be suffering like this!

670
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,117
This is your fault. You hurt Mama.

671
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,411
You ruined our family!

672
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:50,884
Ma.

673
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,889
I've come up with a way to help us.

674
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,186
Is it okay if we use
our house for business?

675
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,819
Anna. That's enough.

676
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,905
You have an early class tomorrow, right?

677
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,115
No.

678
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,700
I'll finish this first.

679
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,203
So tourists can see our inn.

680
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,207
So Mama can earn something.

681
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,212
Are you okay?

682
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,089
Anna, you're burning up!

683
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,508
You should get some rest.

684
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,094
Come. You should rest.

685
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,684
I'm fine.

686
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,411
Hello?

687
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,998
Hello Mr. Suarez?

688
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,418
-What's going on, ma?
-Please open up!

689
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,421
The other guests are
complaining about this guest.

690
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,298
I think he's drinking inside.

691
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,094
We shouldn't be dealing with this.

692
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,098
I wish Antonio were still alive.

693
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,311
-Hello?
-Let me talk to him.

694
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,522
What? Hang on.

695
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,107
What are you going to do?

696
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,318
You'll talk to him?
What good would that do?

697
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,403
You'll just make things worse.
Give me that.

698
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,281
Mr. Sua-

699
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:41,077
Mr. Suarez! What's going on?

700
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,626
What happened?

701
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,003
Charlie!

702
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,296
Princess!

703
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:56,009
I told you to stay out of it!
Look what you've done!

704
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,428
Ma, whatever you do to me,

705
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,890
even if you push me away
and never forgive me,

706
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:04,726
and I will not change.

707
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,187
I will always be Anna, your daughter.

708
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,190
I will still love you.

709
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:32,504
Do you believe that
Grace will still be found?

710
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,298
Uh...

711
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,301
I'm a mother.

712
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,515
No matter what other people say,

713
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,310
no matter what they believe,

714
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:54,901
and I will never stop hoping
that my child will come back.

715
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,697
I will never lose hope that…

716
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,992
we will meet and be together again.

717
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:06,996
Uh...

718
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,708
We learned some things.

719
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:16,714
Allegations that the child
was being neglected.

720
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:20,510
I am not a perfect mother.

721
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,096
I have many shortcomings.

722
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,806
The thing is,

723
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,184
life is very difficult, ma'am.

724
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,523
There are many things I want
to give to my daughter,

725
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,818
but I simply cannot do so.

726
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:41,114
Maybe that's why people are judging me.

727
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:46,286
But even if you ask our neighbors, ma'am,

728
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,789
they will not say anything bad because…

729
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,001
my daughter loves me very much.

730
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:57,422
And I believe that her love for me

731
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:03,678
is proof that I have been
a good mother to her.

732
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:12,479
So please help me find her, ma'am.

733
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:14,981
Don't worry.

734
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:18,902
I sympathize with you. I will help you.

735
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:31,206
Make sure you behave there, okay?

736
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,709
You said your papa's aunt is already old.

737
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:36,503
I will.

738
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,505
Don't talk back to her.

739
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:40,131
Don't be stubborn, okay?

740
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,382
Yes.

741
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:43,593
Grace.

742
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,806
I hope you become happy.

743
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:52,602
You too. I hope you find
the people you want to be with,

744
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,605
just like the birds we saw.

745
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,899
I hope you become happy.

746
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,911
Hello?

747
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,416
Hello?

748
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,503
Grace I think no one's here.

749
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,880
Maybe it's the wrong address.

750
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:24,968
No. That's the same house number

751
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,512
of the address that you showed me.

752
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,226
-Excuse me, miss.
-What is it?

753
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,937
-Can I ask something?
-Sure.

754
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,398
Does someone named...

755
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,111
Teresa Lorenzo live here?

756
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,821
Um Ms. Tessa?

757
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,406
Yes, that's her house.

758
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:48,825
Do you know where she is?

759
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,287
She passed away about three years ago.

760
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,383
Don't you have any other relatives?

761
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:10,096
If you need to go back now,

762
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,889
it's okay with me.

763
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,518
And where will you go?

764
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:17,437
I'll be okay.

765
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,982
Don't worry about me? Stay positive!

766
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,581
Let's get in here! Hurry!

767
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:54,807
Love!

768
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,101
Where have you been?

769
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,898
I went to the police station,
but you weren't there.

770
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,399
Can I get a hug?

771
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,609
Come on- Oh!

772
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,902
Leave me alone!

773
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,279
What took you so long
to come to the police station?

774
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,406
What are these, hu?

775
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,200
-What are these?
-Hey! Hey!

776
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,702
Get these away from me!
That face pisses me off!

777
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,914
-Why are you so grumpy?
-Do you know…

778
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,791
that daughter of yours

779
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,919
is the reason why they
kept me at the police station.

780
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:28,132
Someone told the reporter
that we hurt Grace.

781
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:31,010
Now the police are suspicious of me.

782
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:34,097
They think I was physically abusing Grace!

783
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,516
Don't worry.

784
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,309
The truth will come out.

785
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:39,519
What truth?

786
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,230
That Grace is alive, hu?

787
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,816
I'm sick of this Sarah.

788
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,527
She should just stay in
wherever the hell she's hiding.

789
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,821
She better not come back here.

790
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,698
Because if she comes back here Sarah,

791
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,492
she'll be in deep trouble with me.

792
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,828
No, listen...

793
00:49:56,911 --> 00:50:00,123
We've got lots of money now!

794
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,416
Where'd it come from?

795
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:05,503
Lots of people donated
cash and other stuff.

796
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:07,505
They felt sorry for me

797
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,590
after my interview with Miss Miranda.

798
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:11,509
-Damn it!
-Oh!

799
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,386
You had an interview?

800
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,305
Well, they were already here,
so I couldn't drive them away.

801
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,307
And you know I don't have a job anymore.

802
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,518
You're stupid Sarah.

803
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,602
Stupid!

804
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,897
You know what'll happen to me
because of what you did?

805
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,607
They'll send me back to jail Sarah!

806
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,318
You're overreacting! That won't happen!

807
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:31,279
You think I'm that stupid?

808
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,406
I've thought about that.

809
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:37,201
I always watch my actions and my words.

810
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,412
I listen to everything you say.

811
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:43,207
I made sure to gain people's sympathy.

812
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,918
You really didn't say anything?

813
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,087
-Yeah.
-You didn't say Grace is alive?

814
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,340
You better be telling the truth.

815
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:00,099
Teacher... Teacher, wake up.

816
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,809
Wake up.

817
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,103
Teacher, wake up.

818
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,987
Come on, we have to go.

819
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:23,581
You're burning up!

820
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,502
Help!

821
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,505
Please help us! Help!

822
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:34,717
Help! Help!

823
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:38,095
Please help us! Help!

824
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,600
Eat this so you'll recover.

825
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:43,935
I can eat by myself.

826
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,520
Let me feed you.

827
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,854
No I can do it myself.

828
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,482
Come on, just let me feed you.

829
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,112
I'll do it myself now.

830
00:51:57,198 --> 00:52:00,993
Are you not used
to someone taking care of you?

831
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,331
I just don't want to be a burden,

832
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,500
so I do everything by myself.

833
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,002
We're the same.

834
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:13,714
I also take care of myself.

835
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,008
Mama...

836
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,596
I will take care of you.

837
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,897
I'm a mother.

838
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,318
No matter what other people say,

839
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,989
no matter what they believe,

840
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:45,079
I will never stop hoping
that my child will come back.

841
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,418
I will never lose hope that…

842
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,504
we'll meet and be together again.

843
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,850
Have you talked to Sarah?

844
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,186
Someone else might beat us to it.
I want this to be our exclusive.

845
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,230
Okay I'll talk to her.

846
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:12,732
You know what happened

847
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,942
between me and her live-in partner, right?

848
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,611
What have you found out?

849
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,614
Do you think it's possible
that the child was abused?

850
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,116
I don't want this to blow up in our faces.

851
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,993
Nothing's been confirmed yet.

852
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,996
But that's what I've been
saying from the start,

853
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,749
we shouldn't have jumped
the gun with that interview.

854
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:33,336
We should be steps ahead from anyone else.

855
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,796
Whatever the truth is,
it must come from us.

856
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,799
Can you imagine
if someone else reports it?

857
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,426
Give me the truth Julius.

858
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,720
Our program is not the only one
that depends on it.

859
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,680
It's our credibility.

860
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:06,786
Grace?

861
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,790
Do you want me to turn on the tv?

862
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,792
Pardon?

863
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,005
I've noticed you've been
waiting for someone

864
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:19,799
to turn on the tv since last night.

865
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,596
Do you miss your mom?

866
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:31,310
Grace, your dad's relative is gone.

867
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:34,105
You have nowhere else to go.

868
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,692
Do you want to go back to her?

869
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:42,321
If you need to come back,

870
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:44,615
it's okay with me.

871
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:47,493
You can just leave me.

872
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:50,997
Just leave me!

873
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,010
-They're here!
-They're here!

874
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,803
What's going on here?

875
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,430
Miss, have you talked to the police?

876
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:08,597
Have they come here?

877
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,599
Has anyone sent you help?

878
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:12,935
What's the update on your daughter's case?

879
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:13,978
There's no update.

880
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,813
There's no news yet.

881
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,023
We'll just let you know-

882
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:18,524
look, there's the police. Ask them.

883
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,234
Out of the way!

884
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,986
Move aside! Excuse me.

885
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:26,240
Come with me.
We're inviting you to the police station.

886
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,326
Why? Are you going to apologize to me?

887
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,329
No. You have some explaining to do.

888
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:35,207
I never harmed the kid!

889
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,417
Never!

890
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,295
There are many inconsistencies
in your statement.

891
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,505
We've found out there were bruises

892
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,132
on the kid's face when she was last seen.

893
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,717
Did you do that to her?

894
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,596
What exactly happened Chito?

895
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,306
Why did you go after her?

896
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,807
Why were you mad at her?

897
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:54,435
Did you push her? Drowned her?

898
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,312
I said I never hurt that kid!

899
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,730
I've told you countless times!

900
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,232
How many times should I have to repeat it?

901
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:03,527
You're the one who reported
to the social service, right?

902
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:04,612
Yes.

903
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,322
Until now I still don't understand

904
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:07,823
how it happened,

905
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:09,283
and why it happened.

906
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,912
If only I had spoken up earlier.

907
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,623
Not that I'm making excuses,

908
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,500
but we have a lot of students.

909
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,086
It's impossible to keep
a close eye on all of them.

910
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,005
But when we had the idea

911
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,507
that the kid was being abused,

912
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,092
we acted immediately.

913
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,135
We?

914
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,512
Yes.

915
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:30,805
Someone went with you?

916
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,808
Grace's substitute teacher Anna.

917
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,979
I didn't kill her!

918
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,607
Why are you targeting me, hu?

919
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,529
I don't doubt you Chito.

920
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,323
If I find out you're the reason
behind Grace's disappearance,

921
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,700
you'll rot in prison. Confess now!

922
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,995
Confess what? I didn't do
anything bad to that kid!

923
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,997
Because Grace isn't dead!

924
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,417
Grace is alive.

925
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,585
She's alive!

926
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,716
Grace...

927
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,098
I just thought maybe…

928
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,100
Maybe your mother has changed.

929
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,395
Maybe she wants to see you,

930
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,896
and she misses you.

931
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:27,695
Before...

932
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:31,407
I used to blow on candles in the church.

933
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:39,206
So I can make a wish
even if it's not my birthday.

934
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,795
I would get scolded

935
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,298
by the people in the church.

936
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,509
Why would you do that?

937
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,303
They say

938
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,597
that it would make your wish come true.

939
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,099
It's not true Teacher.

940
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,394
Why? What did you wish for?

941
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,609
I wished that...

942
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:10,613
Uncle Chito would stop being mean to me.

943
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:14,617
I wished that mama would defend me.

944
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,204
Grace, sorry.

945
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:21,624
Can it just be the two of us together?

946
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,585
I'll behave, I promise.

947
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,298
Grace…

948
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,301
I won't be naughty.

949
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,386
I will take care of you.

950
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,015
As long as you stay with me.

951
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,903
I'm hard to get along with.

952
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,696
I'm hot-headed.

953
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,991
I'm strict. I'll just scold you.

954
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:00,204
Even if you turn into a dragon,
teacher, it's okay.

955
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,680
Get ready Grace.

956
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,015
I'm going to kidnap you.

957
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,033
Does Anna Sarmiento live here?

958
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:39,618
Why are so many people looking for her?

959
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,412
There's someone else looking for her?

960
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,705
Her mother.

961
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,290
I think that's her.

962
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,626
Where are we?

963
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,795
This is the only place
I know we'll be safe.

964
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:53,590
Mama!

965
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,719
Mama!

966
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:59,596
Anna I would like to interview you.

967
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,683
You know, to get your side
of the story, please?

968
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:04,893
Hello?

969
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:07,688
Grace?
