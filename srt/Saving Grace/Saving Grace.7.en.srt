1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,712
What happened to you, Anna?

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:06,215
Didn't you think twice about lying?

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,260
Are you going to put Mama Anna in jail?

4
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,805
I was the one who went with her.

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,515
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,308
We're here to uncover the truth.

7
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,936
Julius, what did you find
out about the child?

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,772
Grace isn't the one with Anna.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,109
Tell me the truth.

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,236
Are you here to get back at me?

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,613
We have new information about Anna.

12
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,115
She's adopted.

13
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,284
She was adopted when she was 4 years old.

14
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,790
Mama, just scream.

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,918
No, thanks.

16
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,130
Ouch!

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,506
See?

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,633
You can do it.

19
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,511
I saw it on TV.

20
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,806
Screaming can make you feel better.

21
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,517
Come on, join me?

22
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,230
Your turn!

23
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:18,412
Mama, are you okay now?

24
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,208
Thank you.

25
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,920
Alright, now you can promise me something.

26
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,087
What is it?

27
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,841
Forget your problems for now.

28
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,470
Alright.

29
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,972
Promise?

30
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,810
I promise.

31
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,739
That jerk hung up on me!

32
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:56,408
You're so full of yourself.

33
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,202
You thought you wouldn't get paid?

34
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,995
Don't worry, you'll get paid.

35
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,208
Oh no, I left my bag!

36
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,462
Stay here. Wait for me.
I'll go back for it, okay?

37
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,089
Okay.

38
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,305
Hello!

39
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,826
Grace?

40
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,120
Mister, I just forgot my bag.

41
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,191
I knew it, it's you.

42
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,238
You're not getting away from me this time!

43
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,908
Come here! You're coming with me, got it?!

44
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,410
You're coming with me!

45
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,494
Hmm?

46
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,789
Run! Quick!

47
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,300
Come on, hurry!

48
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,802
What if…

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,638
What if Uncle Chito follows us here?

50
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,015
Just hurry up. Pack your things. Quick!

51
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,935
You're acting like a kid
and a troublemaker!

52
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,729
Erin, that's how the
whole school sees you now!

53
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,815
Wait a minute, what's going on here?

54
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,401
Your kidnapping is out in the open!

55
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,820
Erin got into a fight because of you!

56
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:41,198
She was bullied
and had to fight because of you!

57
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,617
What if we all get dragged into your mess?

58
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,828
Our whole family could end up in jail!

59
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,329
We'll just leave.

60
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,832
Anna! Don't act rashly--

61
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,626
Maybe it's better if you leave!
Just disappear already!

62
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,004
What about your mess?

63
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,006
We'll clean it up like always?

64
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,300
Honestly, you've always been
like this since the beginning!

65
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,428
What do you want me to do?

66
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,887
Isn't this what you wanted?

67
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,932
We're leaving for good.
You've been asking for it, right?

68
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,018
Don't act like you're the victim here!

69
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,021
Okay, fine! It's all my fault!

70
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,524
It's my fault Papa died!
My fault your child died!

71
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,110
What else? What do you want me to do?

72
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,321
Do you want me
to trade their lives for mine?

73
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,617
If I could, I would.
But I can't, Princess!

74
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,328
What more do you want from me?

75
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,707
I'm so tired of everything
you've put me through!

76
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,209
Maybe it's better if I just leave, Ma!

77
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,503
Don't leave us again, Anna!

78
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,214
-We're family, right?
-Family?

79
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,885
Is that what she sees us as?
A family? No, right?

80
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,637
You're right.

81
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,723
I'm not really part of this family.

82
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,516
No, Ma, it's true.

83
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,602
It's time I speak up.

84
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,022
So you two know
I'm not part of your family.

85
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,608
I'm not your sister. I'm adopted!

86
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,112
Is that true, Ma?

87
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,702
How long have you known?

88
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,208
Before I left.

89
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,920
How dare you!

90
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,713
-Anna!
-That's enough!

91
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,424
-Stop it!
-All our problems

92
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,595
are because of someone who
isn't even related to us!

93
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,931
You witch!

94
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,100
Stop it! Don't hurt my Mama!

95
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:35,104
You, get out of my way!

96
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,398
Mama. Mama.

97
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,901
That's enough.

98
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,321
Don't cry anymore. Don't cry.

99
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
You have a family.

100
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,992
I'm here for you.

101
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,704
You have a family. I'm here for you, Mama.

102
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:57,209
Mama, I'm here. Mama, I'm your family!

103
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,215
Mama…

104
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,732
-Sarah, enough!
-Come out of there!

105
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,317
-Calm down, okay?
-Anna!

106
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,527
Stop shouting, please.

107
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,820
-What?
-Show us Grace!

108
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,238
Come out of there!

109
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,906
You call this place a Paradise?

110
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,616
More like, Paradise of the Deaf!

111
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,326
-Wait, wait.
-Oh, I won't--

112
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,411
Calm down.

113
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,830
At first, you acted clueless!
And now what?

114
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,124
Now you're all pretending to be deaf!

115
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,711
Shut up! Call your boss
so I don't have to shout here!

116
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,212
-Anna!
-Ma'am.

117
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,006
Anna, get out of there!

118
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,008
-Ma'am, you dropped your ring.
-Anna!

119
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,510
Anna! Anna, come out--

120
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,430
What's with all the noise?!
You're disturbing my guests!

121
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,932
And? Do you think
I care about your guests?

122
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,726
I won't stop bothering you.

123
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,728
Bring out my child.

124
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,397
Can we just end this?!

125
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,109
Chito saw you. He saw Grace.

126
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,404
What's with that face?

127
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,907
What, playing dumb again?

128
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,700
I saw Grace by the shore.

129
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,828
And I'm sure you're the one who took her.

130
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,913
Where's Grace?!

131
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,206
Are you sure?

132
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,208
Did you see the people outside?

133
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,085
Do you think I could leave
without being noticed?

134
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,755
So now you're calling me a liar?

135
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,467
If you're not a liar, then what?
No matter what child is in front of you,

136
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,304
Looking at you, I think you're drunk.

137
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,641
No matter what child is in front of you,
you'd think that's Grace.

138
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,604
-You bitch!
-Chito.

139
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,105
Chito!

140
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,899
Go ahead! Do it!

141
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,985
No, don't stop him! Do it.
You're going to hurt me?

142
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,281
You look like you're used
to hurting people.

143
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,617
Can you all just leave us alone!

144
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,328
And you! Do you think
I didn't see your little show?

145
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,538
You're so quick to accuse me
as a criminal,

146
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,915
yet you have no evidence.

147
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,459
If you didn't do anything wrong,
you'd talk to me.

148
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,460
For what?

149
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,879
To be a public spectacle
for the whole country?

150
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,798
To gain you popularity? Is that it?

151
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,217
A child's life is at stake.

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,011
You should've thought of that
before taking their side.

153
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,514
Leave now.

154
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,517
-Matty, call the barangay!
-Yes, ma'am.

155
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,728
Sarah, enough. Please, stop.

156
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,188
Miranda.

157
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:28,402
Remember what you did to my daughter.

158
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,196
You'll regret it.

159
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,407
Leave now!

160
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,589
Okay.

161
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,510
I've thought of a solution.

162
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,181
You can return Grace secretly, can't you?

163
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,518
Bring her back near their house

164
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,230
-and just say she wandered off.
-Ma, no.

165
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,525
Anna, I saw the child
getting close to you.

166
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,028
And you, too, have gotten close to her.

167
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,905
That's why I'm sure she won't turn you in.

168
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,407
Tell her…

169
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,035
Tell her not to mention you to the police.

170
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,703
No!

171
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,080
I won't return Grace to them!

172
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,125
We'll just leave.

173
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,085
She's not your child!

174
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:31,214
She doesn't belong to you, Anna!
She doesn't belong to you!

175
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,300
I know, I know that!

176
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,803
But, Ma…

177
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,598
I'm not related to you either.

178
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,601
That's different!

179
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,105
I didn't kidnap you!

180
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,694
If you insist that I return Grace,

181
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,489
we'll just leave.

182
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,284
So what? You're choosing Grace?

183
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,205
You're choosing her over us, your family?

184
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,209
You're going to let us go?!

185
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,920
After everything…

186
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,715
After everything I've done for you,

187
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,220
after I took you in?

188
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,810
Maybe Princess was right.

189
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,314
You're ungrateful.

190
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,900
Is that how it is, Ma?

191
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,324
I thought you told me that
you consider me your daughter.

192
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,784
Ma…

193
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,120
How long…

194
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,289
How long do I have to repay this kindness?

195
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,919
Is it so hard to be my parent?

196
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:01,513
I wouldn't be upset if I didn't care.

197
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,891
As for me, Ma,

198
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,895
I'll never grow tired
of being Grace's parent.

199
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,816
I'm all she has.

200
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,193
And she's all I have.

201
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,530
If you disown me now, I'll understand.

202
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,908
If you walk out that door,

203
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,202
don't ever come back.

204
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,915
You will never return
here again, not ever!

205
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,792
Remember that!

206
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,589
I just want to say…

207
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,886
thank you so much for everything.

208
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,367
You've reached Helena's Paradise.

209
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,831
What exactly are you doing?

210
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:13,793
They don't want me to go there?
Fine, I won't leave them alone.

211
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,883
You know, this is on you.
Why did you have to get drunk?

212
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,636
You keep seeing things,

213
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,597
but did anyone else see
whatever you're talking about?

214
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,934
So no one?

215
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,728
No one can prove you're telling the truth?

216
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,689
You're so annoying, Sarah,
stop blabbering already!

217
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,108
What? You think I'm delirious?

218
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,319
Of course I know what I saw.

219
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,531
Why would I lie to you?

220
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,324
Don't act like you don't know me.

221
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,701
You know when I'm lying.

222
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,791
That Anna is just playing us for fools.

223
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,503
And we're stupid enough to let her.

224
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,005
No.

225
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,716
I won't let it happen.

226
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,510
Hmm.

227
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,888
And Miss Miranda?
She's getting played too.

228
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,933
Did you see what she did earlier?

229
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,393
She backed down.

230
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,229
She's already having second
thoughts helping you,

231
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,730
I'm telling you.

232
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,191
That's why, Chito,
we need to get my child back.

233
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,277
That's exactly what we're going to do.

234
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,112
But…

235
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,906
We need to use Miss Miranda

236
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,284
before she completely turns her back
on us.

237
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,683
Grace.

238
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,688
Do you remember this?

239
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,982
That's…

240
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,320
the bracelet Mama Lucy gave you.

241
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,198
A gift from your real parents.

242
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,498
I want you to always remember
when you see this…

243
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,294
that I choose you.

244
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,797
I'll take care of you,

245
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,009
watch over you,
and always be on your side.

246
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,303
Do you love me, Mama?

247
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,807
That's what Papa says.

248
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:36,186
When someone gives you jewelry,

249
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,314
it means they love you.

250
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,120
The bosses just called me.

251
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,706
By the tone of your voice,
it sounds like bad news.

252
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,803
They just sent the ratings
for our last episode.

253
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,305
I haven't had time to look at it.

254
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,809
Well, it's not what we expected.

255
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,019
Hold on to your seat.

256
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,313
Carmen, just tell me.

257
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,112
It's our all-time high!

258
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,616
Highest ratings ever, Miranda!

259
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,412
Because of your appeal to the public

260
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,997
and that suspect, Anna Sarmiento.

261
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,835
They think you can solve the case,

262
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,629
and if you catch Anna,

263
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,424
our ratings will skyrocket even more!

264
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,300
But…

265
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,511
And because of our consistent ratings,

266
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,012
it means…

267
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,181
you're not getting booted off the air.

268
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,698
Plus, I mentioned your contract renewal

269
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,324
is coming up soon!

270
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,411
They're willing to negotiate
better terms for you.

271
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,209
You've always wanted
full creative control, right?

272
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,713
They're on board because
they believe in you.

273
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,519
Who are you?! Hey!

274
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,812
Aah!

275
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,619
Hi, this is Helena's Paradise!

276
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,497
Hello?

277
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,333
You're getting into my nerves!

278
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,834
If you don't want paradise,

279
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,420
go to the toilet and flush
yourself down!

280
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,005
So annoying!

281
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,221
You think I'll stop?

282
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,389
I know my daughter is with you.

283
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,021
Mama, are we really leaving?

284
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,732
Aren't we going to say goodbye to Grandma?

285
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,192
No, we don't have time.

286
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,403
Wait, I left my phone.

287
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,616
Here, hide in there.

288
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,285
Don't come out until I say so, okay?

289
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,097
Hello, Grace?

290
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,683
Grace, is that you?

291
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,519
Dear, speak up, don't be afraid.

292
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,605
Grace, I'll come for you!

293
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,190
I won't stop!

294
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,615
Grace?

295
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,702
Grace, let's go.

296
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,291
What's the matter?

297
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,918
What happened?

298
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,421
I'm sorry, Mama. I didn't mean to.

299
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,383
Huh?
What are you talking about?

300
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,406
Grace?

301
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,494
I'll get you out of there!
We'll be together again.

302
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:16,132
Mama, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

303
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,550
Did you tell her anything?

304
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,304
She might take me away from here.

305
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,598
We must hurry, let's go!

306
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,313
No.

307
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,607
I can't sneak you out.

308
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,401
That'll make them more suspicious of me.

309
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,986
What are we going to do?

310
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:41,824
To the warehouse.

311
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,785
Don't come out till I tell you, okay?

312
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,704
Let's go.

313
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,289
And stay quiet, alright?

314
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,005
What happened?

315
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,299
Mom!

316
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,928
If you're feeling any pain

317
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,180
your body is trying to tell you something.

318
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,810
It's best to get a check-up
when you're back in Manila.

319
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,521
For your peace of mind.

320
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,523
Thank you, Doctor.

321
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,608
-Alright, take care.
-Thank you.

322
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,367
Mom!

323
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,037
-What happened?
-Someone broke into my room.

324
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,289
Are you okay?

325
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,166
-Yeah.
-This is unacceptable.

326
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,628
It's okay. The hotel already apologized,

327
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,423
and they've also called the police.

328
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,717
Did you recognize the thief?

329
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,301
No.

330
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,512
He took some of my jewelry.

331
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,890
Good thing you weren't hurt.

332
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,310
A little, but it's okay.

333
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,189
My bracelet!

334
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,108
My bracelet!"

335
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,735
What bracelet, Mom?

336
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,903
The bracelet that matches your sister's.

337
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,280
He took it!

338
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,533
Maybe you just misplaced it somewhere?

339
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,326
No, I couldn't have.

340
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,828
I was just looking at it!

341
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,580
-It was in my jewelry box!
-Mom…

342
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,416
calm down. I'll handle it.

343
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,835
I'll find it, okay?

344
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,920
-Don't touch me, Grace!
-Ma'am! Ma'am!

345
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,922
Stop hiding in there!

346
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,716
-Let me go! Grace!
-Ma'am!

347
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,719
-Ma'am, please!
-Stop hiding in there!

348
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,679
I know my daughter is in there!

349
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,598
I heard her! She answered the phone!

350
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,099
Sarah, that's enough!

351
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,226
Leave now. Go.

352
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,519
-Ma'am!
-I'm not leaving!

353
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,188
Alright, what did you hear?

354
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,814
I'm her mother!

355
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,025
I know every breath my child takes!

356
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,902
I know she's in there!

357
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,905
She's not here! Now please leave!

358
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,114
I'm not leaving!

359
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,201
Why would I leave? My daughter is inside!

360
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,911
She's not here! My child is!

361
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:50,995
Your child?

362
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,914
There you go again with your antics!

363
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,917
If your child is here, show her! Prove it!

364
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,419
-Leave now!
-I'm not leaving!

365
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,005
-I'm not leaving!
-Matty--

366
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,216
-Leave now!
-No!

367
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,134
Show me your child!

368
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,803
I won't! What's wrong with you?

369
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,930
You're just like your partner!

370
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,391
If your partner imagines things,
you hear things!

371
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,812
Oh really? You're testing me?

372
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,230
Let me go!

373
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,898
I'll burn your house down!

374
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,234
-Stop!
-I'll burn it down!

375
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,736
-I'll burn it down!
-Ma'am! Ma'am!

376
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,530
Get out of here!

377
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,031
Go on, try me!

378
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,324
Sarah, stop it!

379
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,784
Bring out my child!

380
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,538
You're not going to bring my daughter out?

381
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,915
Are you testing me, Anna?

382
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,334
Are you testing me?

383
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,336
-Sarah!
-Don't touch me!

384
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,712
Don't touch me!

385
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,507
Grace!

386
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,718
-Dear, come out of there!
-Sarah, stop it!

387
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,929
I'll burn this house down

388
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,099
unless you bring my child out--

389
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,725
Go ahead! Burn it!

390
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,019
But what if Grace really is inside?

391
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,187
Huh?

392
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,107
Your child is inside, think about it!

393
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,317
You'd still do it?

394
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,111
Are you that kind of mother, huh?

395
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,113
Bring my child out!

396
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,990
Bring her out--

397
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,709
Matty, get some water, hurry!

398
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,635
Matty! Call the fire department!

399
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,387
Hurry, give me that!

400
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,394
Grace!

401
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,021
Grace…

402
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,023
Water!

403
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,108
Anna! Anna!

404
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,318
Anna!

405
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,323
Grace…

406
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,699
Anna!

407
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,206
What are you doing here?

408
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,832
I told you to leave!

409
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,125
-Go!
-Let go of me--

410
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,419
-I'm not done yet!
-I told you to leave!

411
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,087
-Let go of me!
-Anna!

412
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,298
-Where's my child?!
-I said she's not here!

413
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,008
-I know she's here!
-Stop!

414
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,635
Grace, come here!

415
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,011
Grace! Come here!

416
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,931
-I said leave!
-Ow, you're hurting me!

417
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,308
Ow! Let go of me!

418
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,190
I'm asking you, where's my child?

419
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,318
-Uncle Julius?
-Come here.

420
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,698
What's this? You're hurting me!

421
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,908
Ouch!

422
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,535
I already told you, it was an accident!

423
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,829
No, I won't! I won't go in there!

424
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,706
Don't come back here again!

425
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,416
Serves you right!

426
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,335
I'm not going in there!

427
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,254
-You bitch!
-Ouch!

428
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,214
-Ma'am, just go inside.
-Lock her up!

429
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,632
Hey, let me out of here!

430
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,425
You're going to rot in hell!

431
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,719
What is this? What's going on?

432
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,137
Let me out of here!

433
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,932
I didn't do anything wrong!

434
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,308
Don't you ever come back!

435
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,311
It was an accident, let me out!

436
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,023
Lock her up!

437
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,984
Don't come back here again!

438
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,496
Let go of me, I said!

439
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,415
Sarah?

440
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,083
-Stay there. Don't move.
-Sarah.

441
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,712
Miss Miranda, what are you doing here?

442
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,881
Someone broke into my hotel room.

443
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:34,510
Do you have a picture
of the bracelet that was stolen?

444
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,387
-Here you go.
-It might help.

445
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,431
Even if the jewelry can't be recovered…

446
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,017
this one, is really important for me.

447
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,686
Do you have anyone in mind
who might have done this?

448
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,233
Come out!

449
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,818
You call this a Paradise?

450
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,321
Call your boss,
so I don't have to yell here!

451
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,405
Anna!

452
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,496
Sarah, I don't want to accuse anyone…

453
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,708
but Chito, could it have been him--

454
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,084
No. Absolutely not.

455
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,838
Miss Miranda, he wouldn't do that to you.

456
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,923
We owe you so much.

457
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,009
We were together the whole night.

458
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,887
And you even called for backup?

459
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,098
Sarah, what's going on here?

460
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,518
I called the inn…

461
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:27,813
and Grace was the one who answered.

462
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,317
Is that true? Really?

463
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,071
-You actually believe her?
-That's what I'm trying to find out.

464
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,405
What did Grace say?

465
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,116
Nothing.

466
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,494
But I'm certain it was Grace.

467
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,913
So you burned down our house for that?

468
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,916
Is it true? Is it really true?

469
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,585
What happened was an accident.

470
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,382
I just got so angry earlier,
all of it came out.

471
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,593
So which is it?
Was it anger, or an accident?

472
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,804
W-why me?!

473
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,305
Why are you singling me out?

474
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,224
Shouldn't we be questioning Anna?

475
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,517
Can you stop?

476
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,935
Just stop bothering us!

477
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,520
Stop dragging us into this!

478
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,107
If you have a problem
with Anna, deal with her!

479
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,401
Leave us out of it!

480
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,404
How can we not involve you,
when you're her family!

481
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,614
You're even covering up for her!

482
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,700
Sorry, but you're wrong!

483
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,703
She's not our family
because she's only adopted.

484
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,492
Julius, thanks for your help.

485
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,497
Yeah, no problem.

486
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,294
Don't worry.

487
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,962
We'll be leaving tomorrow.

488
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,883
Where will you go?

489
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,386
I don't know.

490
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,680
Somewhere far.

491
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,891
Far away from everyone.

492
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,811
Look, Anna,
things are too tense right now.

493
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,982
You can stay here if you want.

494
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,569
I don't want you to get involved.

495
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,072
Besides, this is your mom's house, right?

496
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,743
Yeah, but it's been abandoned
for a long time.

497
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,705
I don't stay here either…

498
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,000
This house brings back too many…

499
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,587
sad memories.

500
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,883
But…

501
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,720
I know no one will look for you here.

502
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,600
Just be careful.

503
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,020
We?

504
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,606
Anna, I have nowhere else to go.

505
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,485
You see, Miranda…

506
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,783
She fired me from her program.

507
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,411
Is it because of Grace's case?

508
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,008
Julius, you shouldn't have covered for me.

509
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,386
Uh… Anna.

510
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,806
I'm doing this for myself, okay?

511
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,226
I admire Miranda,

512
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,104
and I know she has good intentions.

513
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,982
But in this case, I think she's wrong.

514
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,401
She's on the wrong side.

515
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,571
And sometimes, doing the right thing
means standing alone.

516
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,118
That's what you made me realize.

517
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,416
Thank you.

518
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,713
Sir, these are the things that were left--

519
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,716
Sir, sir. Wait. Can I take a look?

520
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,728
Uh… This is my missing bracelet.

521
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,605
It's mine. Where did you get it?

522
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,982
From the fire in the inn.

523
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,536
-Mama.
-Hmm?

524
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,331
Julius is so nice, isn't he?

525
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,791
That's why you need to behave.

526
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,338
Mom, do you want me
to clean this house tomorrow

527
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,131
to make him happy?

528
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,799
That's what I'm thinking too.

529
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,801
Okay, let's do that tomorrow.

530
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,219
But, Mama,

531
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,513
how long will we be here?

532
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:15,309
I don't know but don't worry…

533
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,936
I won't stop until I find a way

534
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,730
for us to get to Hong Kong.

535
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,232
When we arrive in Hong Kong,

536
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:25,194
will they stop looking for us?

537
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,617
Lie down. It's late. Let's go to sleep.

538
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,585
Oh, no, my bracelet…

539
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,515
How did you pay for a lawyer
and post bail?

540
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,017
I found a way.

541
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,394
I'll just take a shower.

542
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,632
It's okay if you don't retrieve
my jewelry, but…

543
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,718
I need to get this back.

544
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:36,932
Chito!

545
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,600
What did you do?!

546
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,018
Why are you yelling?

547
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,395
What's this?!

548
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,606
Did you steal this from Miranda?

549
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,608
I had to.

550
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,902
Or else the people I owe
would've killed me.

551
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,320
You have debt?

552
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,613
From gambling.

553
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,201
Seriously, are you crazy, huh?!

554
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,704
You're not just useless,
you're also a burden!

555
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:02,416
Hey, we're just the same.

556
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:07,337
I'm a burden, you're a burden.
I'm crazy, you're crazy.

557
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,715
Why did you burn their inn, huh?

558
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,301
I used the money
to bail you out.

559
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,927
That was an accident!

560
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,304
Don't yell at me!

561
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,891
Why are you so furious at me?

562
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,018
Don't think about it.

563
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,188
I've paid off all my debts.

564
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,899
And there's more left in there.

565
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,401
Use it however you want.

566
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,530
Don't worry.

567
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,324
I didn't leave any trace.

568
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,701
If you think about it, that's not enough.

569
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,413
It's because you're stupid.

570
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,833
You're too reliant on that Miranda.

571
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,126
What did you get?

572
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,630
Did she bail you out? She didn't, right?

573
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:52,090
You hoped for nothing, didn't you?

574
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,433
Hey.

575
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,310
I brought us breakfast.

576
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,603
Thank you.

577
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,689
-I'll prepare the table.
-No, I'll do it.

578
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,818
No. You're the one who bought it.
Let me prepare it.

579
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,319
Wait! Wait! Wait!

580
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,030
Wash your hands first.

581
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,198
Hmm!

582
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,036
Do you want some cola?

583
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,329
Yes.

584
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,498
Alright. Take a hundred.

585
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,791
Let's buy some.

586
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,934
Were you two in a relationship before?

587
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,811
I didn't know it was there.

588
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,606
I don't usually clean my wallet.

589
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,197
Come on. Let's eat.

590
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,330
Look at this.

591
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,582
Look.

592
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,585
That's your bracelet. What's the matter?

593
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,213
I don't know.
Something seems odd. It's like…

594
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:16,091
It seems like it wasn't
well taken care of. It's like…

595
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,509
like taken out of the box.

596
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,637
You said that the inn
got caught on fire, remember?

597
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,097
That might be the reason.

598
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,183
That's the thing. How did it get there?

599
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,228
Don't you go there often?

600
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,897
Maybe you brought it with you.

601
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,525
I've talked to your private investigator.

602
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:38,113
He said he went to see
the owner of Forever Loved Home.

603
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,823
What do you mean?

604
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,117
He said the owner was rude to him.

605
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,411
The owner seems to have
a memory problem.

606
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,080
They don't remember anything
about the foster home.

607
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,499
Is there no other way?

608
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,335
Surely he can talk to someone else

609
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,628
aside from the owner.

610
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,004
Don't worry.

611
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,506
I'm always pestering him.

612
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,592
They'll find something soon.

613
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,515
I'm done.

614
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,518
I'm going to wash the dishes.
Bring yours when you're done.

615
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,407
Grace. Hey.

616
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,825
What are you looking for?

617
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,204
Mama's bracelet, it's important to her.

618
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,707
Okay. When was the last time you saw it?

619
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,876
She gave it to me
when we were at the inn.

620
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,920
When we got back here, it was gone.

621
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,297
Can you help me?

622
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,216
Sure. Okay.

623
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,510
What does it look like?

624
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,011
Like this.

625
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,024
Uh… Uh…

626
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:59,319
Grace, you know, should I draw it instead?

627
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,904
Then you tell me

628
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,615
the details you remember, is that okay?

629
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,283
-Okay.
-Alright.

630
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,619
Here.

631
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,496
It has little circles.

632
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,914
Small circles.

633
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:13,208
After the small circles,

634
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,710
there's this thing.

635
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:19,381
Aunt, did you see this bracelet?

636
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,304
I don't know anything
about this bracelet.

637
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,181
But it seems like you do.

638
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,810
Where's Anna?

639
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,524
Julius,

640
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,818
If you're planning to lie to me,

641
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,195
think carefully.

642
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,491
You know, Aunt, it's probably better…

643
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,703
if no one knows where they are.

644
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,581
Really?

645
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,917
You're letting Anna do this?

646
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,003
I'm just thinking about their safety.

647
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,421
Julius.

648
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,923
If you're truly concerned
about their safety,

649
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,926
you would convince Anna

650
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,305
to do the right thing.

651
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,689
Excuse me. Hold on.

652
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,526
Jessica.

653
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,195
Can we meet?

654
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,199
I just wanted to…

655
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,786
personally apologize
for my mother's actions.

656
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,998
Jessica, you don't really have to do that.

657
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,919
But maybe…

658
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,713
It was for the better.

659
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,800
But you know I can talk to her.

660
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,219
I can convince her
to get you back to work.

661
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,180
No. For what?
So she'd think I'm using you?

662
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,391
Jess, I'm fine.

663
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,401
So, what's your plan now?

664
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,404
I need space from…

665
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,989
everything…

666
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,118
and everyone.

667
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,623
I know…

668
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,333
I know that…

669
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,002
I'm the reason why you need space.

670
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,089
Jessica, I need to figure out
a lot of things

671
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,507
in my life right now.

672
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,509
Okay?

673
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,303
I need to…

674
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,013
load the power.

675
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,182
Okay.

676
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,311
But please, please don't
shut me out completely.

677
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,108
I'm here for you.

678
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:44,985
Okay?

679
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,404
I have to…

680
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,989
I have to go.

681
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,911
Goodbye.

682
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,496
Hey.

683
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,500
I really hope to see you again soon.

684
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,699
Grace.

685
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,578
Are you okay?

686
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,712
Come on, hurry. I know what you need.

687
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,797
Let's add things that make you happy.

688
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,299
Come here.

689
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,178
Hmm. Come here.

690
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,807
Look, we've written a lot.

691
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:01,394
Mountains, flowers, cakes.

692
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,619
Oh, I know!

693
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,705
Let's add that new thing
that makes you happy.

694
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,791
The bracelet I gave you.

695
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,005
Grace, what's wrong?

696
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:35,512
Mama, don't be mad at me, okay?

697
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,430
Why? What happened?

698
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,809
I lost the bracelet.

699
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,188
Is that why you're upset?

700
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,692
Come on.

701
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,611
Don't think about that.

702
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,697
Okay?

703
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,911
But, Mama, you gave it to me.

704
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:03,999
I did. But I don't want you to feel sad.

705
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,292
Hmm?

706
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,103
You followed me?

707
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,189
What's in this house?

708
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,400
Nothing.

709
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:31,818
You need to leave.

710
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,611
Who's with you?

711
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,113
No one!

712
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,199
-Who's here with you?
-Jess! No one!

713
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,618
-Hey.
-Who?

714
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,078
No one!

715
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,998
-Jess! You need to leave.
-You have company!

716
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,207
I said there's no one.

717
00:43:58,678 --> 00:43:59,888
You?

718
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:10,482
Why are you two together, huh?

719
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,736
You just told me earlier

720
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,113
that you want space from everyone.

721
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,990
You want to rest.

722
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,285
To rethink what you want
to do with your life.

723
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:23,912
What's this?

724
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,915
Is that it? You want to get
back together with her?

725
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,209
Julius is just helping me out.

726
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,795
I'm a lawyer.

727
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,382
I can smell a liar from a mile away.

728
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,426
And I can sense someone

729
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,428
who is scheming something.

730
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,305
Jessica, don't jump to conclusions.

731
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,182
You have no evidence.

732
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,728
Then what's this?

733
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:49,896
What's this, huh?

734
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,023
Are you and your ex playing house?

735
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,400
You're drawing together?

736
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,611
That belongs to my son.

737
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,448
That's not the evidence
you're looking for.

738
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,118
Ah…

739
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,496
I see. You have a child.

740
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,997
You have a child, huh?!

741
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,667
-Hey, Jess! Jessica!
-So, that's what's happening!

742
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,419
-Hey! Stop!
-Bring him out!

743
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,087
Enough!

744
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:16,714
Just leave.

745
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,716
Leave!

746
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:34,691
Um...

747
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,985
I'm sorry for bothering you.

748
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,031
Uh, Ma'am Miranda?

749
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,701
I just want to apologize.

750
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,828
I'm really sorry.

751
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,205
What happened last night--

752
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,791
You know, Sarah…

753
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,587
I understand how you feel.

754
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,592
But I already told you

755
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:06,222
not to act rashly or let your
emotions get the best of you.

756
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:09,100
Look what happened. You got arrested.

757
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,102
Uh…

758
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:14,022
I'm sorry, Miss Miranda,

759
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,816
but you know where I'm coming from, right?

760
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,779
-Oh, Jessica.
-Mom.

761
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,407
Anna is with Julius.

762
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:25,992
What?

763
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,410
Are they with my daughter?

764
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:28,995
Did you see her with them?

765
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:29,913
No.

766
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,916
Only Anna was there when I
confronted Julius at his house.

767
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,293
But I found this there.

768
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,599
Wait…

769
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,644
These are my daughter's
drawings. I'm sure of it.

770
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,312
This is Grace's notebook. Look.

771
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,688
Are you sure?

772
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,900
We have to do something.

773
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,401
I think she's right, Mom.

774
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,112
Think about your show.

775
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,907
Isn't this the breakthrough
you're waiting for?

776
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,619
Dear viewers,

777
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:12,705
this is the update
we've all been waiting for.

778
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,834
A lot of speculations
have been thrown around,

779
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,503
but now…

780
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:22,715
we have new information on Grace's case.

781
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,134
We've just obtained a new lead

782
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,429
to the child's whereabouts.

783
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,431
And the evidence we have here

784
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:34,185
was found in the possession
of Anna Sarmiento.

785
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:35,895
Jimenez!

786
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,231
-What is it, sir?
-You have to ask?

787
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,817
Don't you know what's going on in Palawan?

788
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,236
Aren't you updated
on the case assigned to you?

789
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,196
Look.

790
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,325
Grace's mother, Sarah,

791
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:52,078
had confirmed to us that
this belongs to her daughter.

792
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,708
We don't know
how it ended up in Anna's hands

793
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,795
and we are still in the dark
about her real intentions.

794
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:04,799
However, the truth shall prevail
and we'll soon find answers.

795
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,680
So they're talking about Grace's notebook.

796
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,892
Is that enough to put me in jail?

797
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,478
It's circumstantial evidence.

798
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,899
Just because you have Grace's notebook

799
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:23,693
doesn't mean you kidnapped her.

800
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,696
But why is Miranda Valdez
talking like that?

801
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,448
She's painting me as the bad guy.

802
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,117
I hate to say it, but that's how we work.

803
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,120
We don't just make stories,
we make headlines.

804
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,705
What? What do you mean?

805
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,750
She doesn't care even if
she's in the wrong?

806
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,628
Well, in Miranda's eyes,

807
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:45,131
since Sarah lost her child,
she's the victim.

808
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:48,593
You're the villain in Sarah's story.

809
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,680
I only saved Grace.

810
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,725
Yes, but she doesn't know that.

811
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,186
Neither do the viewers.

812
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,396
Mama?

813
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,192
Are they going to put you in jail?

814
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,406
No. No, Grace.

815
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,118
Do we have to leave again?
Where would we go?

816
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,795
It's time for them to know the truth.

817
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,382
What are you planning?

818
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:31,177
I'll tell them the truth.

819
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,179
How?

820
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,311
What's wrong, Mom?

821
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,399
Aren't you happy
that the case is almost solved?

822
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:49,904
Jess, this isn't just about catching Anna.

823
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,700
Our main goal here is
to return Grace safely to Sarah.

824
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,830
Which will happen
when Grace gets arrested.

825
00:49:58,913 --> 00:49:59,914
Trust me.

826
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,708
I don't know, Jess.

827
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,210
I feel like something is off.

828
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,003
What do you mean?

829
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,588
I don't know either.

830
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,383
Maybe I just need rest.

831
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,218
Okay.

832
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,778
Mom, isn't this your bracelet?

833
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:37,910
Why?

834
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,997
I already found it.

835
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,501
Then what's this?

836
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,629
They look exactly the same.

837
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,715
If this isn't yours,

838
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,883
whose is it?

839
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,068
Carmen, I was just about to call you.

840
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,029
I need updates.

841
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,198
Well, you're in luck.

842
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:18,409
I'm with the investigator.
He has something to tell you.

843
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,077
I'll pass the phone to him.

844
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,205
Here you go.

845
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,416
Hello, ma'am.

846
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,628
Ah, yes.
But I'd like to apologize.

847
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:32,006
I couldn't find anything that
could link your parents

848
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,883
and Forever Love Orphanage.

849
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:35,635
Are you sure?

850
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,011
Yes, ma'am.

851
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,600
But I found something else.

852
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:43,601
What is it?

853
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,480
I investigated further based on
the information you gave me.

854
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,608
Apparently, on the day your mother left

855
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,527
with your baby,

856
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:57,323
two babies were also left
at Forever Love Orphanage.

857
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,200
Excuse me, ma'am.
Table for one?

858
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:00,701
Uh...

859
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,286
-Are you dining alone?
-Ashley?

860
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:05,790
Carmen!

861
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,583
What are you doing here?!

862
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,127
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, no. You have to go.

863
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,797
-What a coincidence!
-You better get out of here.

864
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,508
-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean?

865
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,427
They were just left
at the orphanage's doorstep.

866
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:20,096
They're just foundlings,

867
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:24,517
so I have no way to know
who left them there.

868
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,688
It was a boy and a girl.

869
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,400
My baby is a girl.

870
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,903
Uh, the baby girl…

871
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:40,199
was found wrapped in a blanket.

872
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,910
She was wearing a bracelet…

873
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,413
…with a name engraved on it.

874
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,291
What name?

875
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,084
Grace.

876
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,503
Grace, ma'am.

877
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,922
And I haven't confirmed this yet,

878
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:58,593
but based on the adoption papers,

879
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,095
she was adopted

880
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,513
by a couple.

881
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,392
Helena and Antonio Sarmiento.

882
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,394
What?!

883
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,481
When they adopted her,

884
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:15,693
they named her…

885
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:17,778
Anna.

886
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,907
Anna Grace Sarmiento.

887
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:26,412
I'll send you all the documents I found.

888
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,581
Okay, okay.

889
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,084
Anna?

890
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:51,914
May I talk to you?

891
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,710
I'm ready to give an interview.

892
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,297
Alright.

893
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:08,597
Let's start with the
evidence we have against you.

894
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,394
Are you talking about Grace's notebook?

895
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,024
She gave it to me

896
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,484
after I quit my job
as a teacher at her school.

897
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,281
But…

898
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:27,783
Her drawings…

899
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,202
about Palawan…

900
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,997
Those are recent.

901
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,293
I told her about my life here.

902
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,005
You see, that girl…

903
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:44,800
is such a kind and caring child.

904
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:52,808
But that doesn't mean
you kidnapped her, right?

905
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:07,490
I don't understand why you're
pinning this all on me

906
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,911
just because I was close with Grace.

907
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:16,707
Focus your investigation
on someone else, not me.

908
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,125
Who are you talking about?

909
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,086
Sarah.

910
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,005
Grace's mother.

911
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,007
And her partner, Chito.

912
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:30,012
I tried so many times

913
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:34,100
to seek help from other people.

914
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,396
To report that Grace
was being mistreated at home,

915
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,315
but no one believed me.

916
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:46,195
Just because they act worried
doesn't mean they're innocent.

917
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:47,905
Right, Ma'am Miranda?

918
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:53,119
How could you help a mother

919
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,496
who made her daughter's life miserable?

920
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,085
Is that the kind of mother you are?

921
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:06,215
No, Anna.

922
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,093
I'm not like that.

923
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,682
I only agreed to give
an interview because…

924
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,811
I feel sorry for my family.

925
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:26,402
Especially for my mother.

926
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,281
Anna…

927
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,911
If you haven't found out yet,

928
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:38,414
I'm adopted.

929
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,710
My real parents left me at an orphanage.

930
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:47,006
That's why I feel so ashamed.

931
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:52,219
After all the love and care I
received from my adoptive mom,

932
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:56,599
I ended up bringing her shame.

933
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:04,190
If you were given the chance,

934
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,484
would you like to meet your real mother?

935
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,416
No.

936
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,004
She already left me.

937
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,299
That means she didn't want me.

938
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,303
She's no different from Sarah.

939
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,517
People like them…

940
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,979
don't deserve to be a mother.

941
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,526
People like them
don't deserve a second chance.

942
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,007
My daughter trusted you

943
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:13,717
and you ruined her in return!

944
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,011
Anna isn't your daughter! She's mine!

945
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,013
You're really testing me!

946
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,015
If you want trouble, I'll give it you!

947
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,016
Miranda Valdez,

948
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,851
I have Grace.

949
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,311
Give me five million pesos

950
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,605
if you still want to see her alive.

951
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:28,899
Grace! Grace!

952
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:33,112
I did the most terrible thing, Carmen.

953
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:38,325
I put my own child in danger.

954
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,828
Anna is my daughter!

955
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,788
It was her all along!
