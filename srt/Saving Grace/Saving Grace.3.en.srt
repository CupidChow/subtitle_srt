1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,129
Two tickets to Quezon
one adult, one child.

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,756
Are you sure you'll come with me?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,051
Don't you have a flight to catch?

4
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:12,638
Don't worry I'll accompany you first.

5
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:14,724
I want to make sure you're safe.

6
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,642
Are you Sarah Banaag?

7
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:18,519
I'm Miranda Valdez.

8
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,438
We've got lots of money now!

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,816
People felt sorry for me after
my interview with Miss Miranda.

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,652
Can it just be the two of us together?

11
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,739
I'll behave I promise.

12
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,741
Get ready Grace.

13
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,534
I'm going to kidnap you.

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,415
The truth is, it was Teacher
Anna who noticed

15
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,751
that the child seems
to be a victim of abuse.

16
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,753
Where is this Teacher Anna?

17
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:44,920
Can I talk to her?

18
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,506
I'm sorry, but from what
I know, she went abroad.

19
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,343
What's her full name?

20
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,137
Anna Sarmiento.

21
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,642
Is something wrong, sir?

22
00:00:58,726 --> 00:00:59,727
Um...

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,354
How long did she work here?

24
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:05,941
From what I remember,
she taught here for a year.

25
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,153
It's a shame she left.
She was a good teacher.

26
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,821
Can I get her number?

27
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:15,034
Well I tried calling her number,

28
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,119
but it's out of service.

29
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:21,415
You said she went abroad, right?

30
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:22,833
Where exactly?

31
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,835
I know she's in Hong Kong.

32
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:29,048
She got a research grant for ornithology.

33
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,509
That's what she told me, sir.

34
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,735
Thank you, mister.

35
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,421
Where are we?

36
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:55,217
This is the only place
I know we'll be safe.

37
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,637
Do you know the owner of this place?

38
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,600
Anyone home?

39
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,730
Anybody home?

40
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,408
Anyone home?

41
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,828
Wait here.

42
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,001
Anybody home?

43
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,111
Anyone home?

44
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,334
Aah! A ghost!

45
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,836
Do I look like a ghost? I own this place.

46
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,508
No, you're not a ghost.

47
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,928
-What's your name?
-Lucia.

48
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,514
But people here call me Mama Lucy.

49
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,516
I'm Bright.

50
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,227
There. Now, we know each other.

51
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,730
I'm Anna.

52
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,616
Do you know each other?

53
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,627
What are you two doing here?

54
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,839
We were wondering if we could stay here.

55
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh. I'm sorry, dear.

56
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:05,222
I used to be able to take care
of many kids,

57
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,433
but I'm old now.

58
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,726
I can't do it anymore.

59
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,438
I live here alone
and I can't attend to you both.

60
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,653
Oh. What are you doing?

61
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,114
Is the massage good Mama Lucy?

62
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,619
If you let us stay here,

63
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,330
i will always give you a massage.

64
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,249
It's free and unlimited.

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,043
I'll even sing for you.

66
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:40,132
La la la la

67
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,552
-da da da da
-That feels good.

68
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,432
Shake it Shake it.

69
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,518
Alright then you can stay.

70
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,937
Have you two eaten?

71
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,941
You have to make do with
what we have here, okay?

72
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,026
Excuse me.

73
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,123
She missed her flight.

74
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,043
She called and said

75
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:21,507
she has some emergency
that she needs to attend to.

76
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,425
What emergency?

77
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,135
She did not say.

78
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,515
Well, did she mention
where she is right now?

79
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,474
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,518
Even if she did,

81
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,437
i cannot provide you that information.

82
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,209
Do we still have money?

83
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,006
Come here.

84
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,427
Don't worry about it.

85
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,138
I'll take care of that.

86
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,349
How did you know this place?

87
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,102
What is Mama Lucy's house exactly?

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,526
Why are there so many toys,
beds, and rooms?

89
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,027
It used to be...

90
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,824
It used to be an orphanage.

91
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,579
This is the only place I could think of

92
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,330
where we'll be safe.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,710
I used to live here…

94
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,628
before I was adopted.

95
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,214
You were adopted?

96
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,802
My biological parents left me here.

97
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,432
But, why doesn't Miss Lucy remember you?

98
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,230
It was a long time ago.
I was too young then.

99
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,776
I bet you had lots of playmates
and toys when you were a kid.

100
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,329
Stay positive Teacher Anna.

101
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,719
What did you say to the police?

102
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,930
Nothing.

103
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,724
Of course, he still thinks
you were abusing the child.

104
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,144
He doesn't even believe
that Grace is alive.

105
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,104
He claims he has proof.

106
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,024
Proof that you hurt her.

107
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,651
He thinks you killed her.

108
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,028
But of course I told him
that it's not true.

109
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,821
-It's all your fault.
-Hm?

110
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,114
They were getting quiet,

111
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,283
but you just had to do that tv interview.

112
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,453
I did that because I want
to find my daughter.

113
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,372
No one else helped us before, right?

114
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,958
And look what you've done.

115
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,210
You just made things worse.

116
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,713
I told you to just let them handle it.

117
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,425
Why are you acting like that?
Isn't Grace alive?

118
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,095
I already told you she is!
You're so annoying!

119
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,722
That daughter of yours
really pisses me off.

120
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,558
She brings me trouble
even when she's not here.

121
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,938
We need to find Grace first
before the police does.

122
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,525
We'll be in deep trouble if she speaks up.

123
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,403
Where did you last see Grace, anyway?

124
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,422
Excuse me.

125
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:03,312
Hang on. How would she
know how to ride the bus?

126
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,525
Chito.

127
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,319
What?

128
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,197
Try to think where she could go.

129
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,241
And why she came here.

130
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,328
Laguna.

131
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,123
Sorsogon Camarine Sur
Camarines Norte Albay

132
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,042
Quezon and Batangas.

133
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,337
Those are the only places
she could've gone to.

134
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,631
Quezon.

135
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,510
Her father has a relative in Quezon.

136
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,019
Oh.

137
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,439
I'm glad you're awake.

138
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,024
I just have a question.

139
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,818
Do you have a cell phone?

140
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,737
I just need to do something.

141
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,322
Ah…

142
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,533
Yeah I do. Uh...

143
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,037
It's lying somewhere on the vanity table.

144
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,414
I don't use it. You can use it.

145
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,416
-Thank you.
-Sure.

146
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,431
Here.

147
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,518
This was her unit.

148
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,311
She was here for about a year.

149
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,523
Did she live here with someone?

150
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,024
No, she lived alone.

151
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,568
That's why she chose a small room

152
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,028
and didn't have many stuff.

153
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,864
Maybe because she wasn't
planning to stay here for long.

154
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,951
Where did she say she was moving to?

155
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,954
She said she's moving abroad.

156
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,123
-Abroad?
-Yes.

157
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,125
But she didn't say where.

158
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,753
All I know is she'll work there.

159
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,004
When did she...

160
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,132
When did she leave?

161
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,426
Just a week ago.

162
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,599
Hello?

163
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,644
This is Anna Sarmiento.

164
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm calling regarding the research grant.

165
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,233
I'm just asking for
a little bit more time.

166
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,651
I'm just fixing something.

167
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,946
You have one month Ms. Sarmiento.

168
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,531
Uh, after that,

169
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,034
we will be giving the grant
to somebody else.

170
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,828
Okay. Thank you.

171
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,122
Oh, one more thing.

172
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,041
C-Can I bring somebody?

173
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,127
Is this family?

174
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,713
I-It's a child.

175
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,800
My child.

176
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,428
I will see what I can do.

177
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,931
But in this situation,

178
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,143
you need to provide us
with the requirements

179
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,436
of the child.

180
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,815
I can send you an email
with the requirements.

181
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,527
But you need to submit it
as soon as possible.

182
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,447
Let me remind you Ms. Sarmiento,

183
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,948
you have only

184
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,200
one month.

185
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,410
Okay.

186
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,636
Uh, excuse me.

187
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,763
I'm sorry. I'm just looking for someone.

188
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,057
I've talked to other people
around this area,

189
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,019
and they told me that
Anna Sarmiento stays here.

190
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,939
Oh, yes, the teacher?

191
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:34,940
Yes.

192
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,900
But she's no longer here.

193
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,113
What's going on?

194
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,865
Did she do something wrong?

195
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,825
Why are they looking for her?

196
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,827
Hold on, who else is looking for her?

197
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,830
Her mother.

198
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,123
Uh…

199
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,542
Where is she?

200
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,918
Is she still here?

201
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,215
I think that's her.

202
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,933
It looks like you're doing well.

203
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,226
Uh...

204
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,145
You haven't come to our house
in a long time.

205
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,398
You were like a son to me for many years.

206
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,944
When was the last time we saw each other?

207
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,947
I think it was when
you two were preparing for…

208
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,615
The wedding.

209
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:34,416
Anna's landlady said
you're also looking for her.

210
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,627
You see I was persuading her to come home.

211
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,213
But she suddenly stopped
communicating with us.

212
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,799
Are you looking for her, too?

213
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,720
Yes.

214
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,435
-Are you still mad at Anna?
-That's all in the past.

215
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,520
I've moved on.

216
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,022
I'm doing this for work.

217
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,609
Did Anna do something wrong?

218
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,446
I just have some questions to ask her

219
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,406
about a case we're covering.

220
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,039
How can someone adopt a child?

221
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:18,043
Oh, dear. It's a very long process.

222
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:22,005
As I carefully assess those
who want to adopt a child,

223
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,216
they must also undergo court proceedings

224
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,219
to legalize the adoption process.

225
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,431
And it requires a huge sum of money.

226
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,100
Wait, why do you ask?

227
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,229
Oh...

228
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,523
It's nothing.

229
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,402
Have we met before?

230
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,198
You look familiar.

231
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,709
Hello?

232
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,797
-Anybody home?
-Are you sure this is the place?

233
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,757
-Yes I'm sure.
-The house looks empty.

234
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,133
This is the right house.

235
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,302
Anybody home?

236
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,306
What's going on here?

237
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,100
What the-

238
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,227
what are you doing here?

239
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,938
What's the matter?

240
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,190
You're not hiding anything are you?

241
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,025
Are you following us?

242
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,112
You know I'm confused with you two.

243
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,448
First, you were seen chasing
Grace at the fish port.

244
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,952
Then, you said you saw her
at the bus terminal.

245
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,121
What really happened? Where is she?

246
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,914
We don't know.

247
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,333
That's why we're here.

248
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,211
So we can find out if what I saw was true.

249
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,338
But this is so far away.

250
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,298
Why would she come here?

251
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,135
Why would I tell you?

252
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,973
You are the prime suspect
in Grace's death.

253
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,434
And if you fail to prove
that she's still alive,

254
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,521
you'll end up in jail.

255
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,318
Are you also looking for Miss Tessa?

256
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,739
Why? Who else was looking for her?

257
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,031
A child.

258
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,617
-A child?
-Yes.

259
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,829
Was it this child?

260
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,416
No. It was a boy who asked me.

261
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,418
A boy?

262
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,754
Yes, the boy was with his mother.

263
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,422
Did they tell you their names?

264
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,548
No.

265
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,342
They immediately left when they learned

266
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,344
that Miss Tessa has passed away.

267
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,139
Oh maybe it's a different relative Sarah.

268
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,099
-Let's go.
-Wait, hold on.

269
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,352
I just want to know.

270
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,897
What made you think Grace would come here?

271
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,900
We just took a chance.

272
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,236
Since this is the only relative
Grace knows.

273
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,238
But this is so far away.

274
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,531
Why would she come here?

275
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,034
Did you do anything to her?

276
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,913
Why won't you say it straight to my face?

277
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,706
Stop beating around the bush.

278
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,710
Is she missing because
she ran away from you?

279
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,922
Chito, come on. Let's go home.

280
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,861
It's quite busy in the terminal, isn't it?

281
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,240
There are lots of passengers.

282
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,617
Uh, sir, excuse me.

283
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,536
-Yes, sir?
-Is there a trip

284
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,246
Quezon and Batangas.

285
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,915
-Yes, sir.
-We're looking for someone.

286
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,629
Have you seen the news about
the kid who fell into the water?

287
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,008
Her mother said she was seen in Quezon.

288
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,928
And this is the nearest
bus station to them.

289
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,513
Did you see her?

290
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,432
I don't remember, sir.

291
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,017
Maybe the relief guard did.

292
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,228
But he won't be here until tonight.

293
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,314
Try asking the storekeepers.
Maybe they saw her.

294
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,817
Alright. Thank you.

295
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,798
Ma'am? Excuse me.

296
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,509
You're looking for a helper?

297
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,304
What experience do you have?

298
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,223
I used to be a teacher.

299
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,144
But don't worry,
we used to run a small inn.

300
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,438
I'm pretty used to this business.

301
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,399
Alright. I'll try you out.

302
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,905
If you're good at the job,
we can talk about the pay.

303
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,699
Alright.

304
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,118
Where do I start?

305
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,414
You're a fast learner.

306
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,335
You haven't been here long,
but you've learned a lot.

307
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,631
Don't be sad.

308
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,133
She'll be back.

309
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,553
How do you know?

310
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,806
I've run an orphanage for decades.

311
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,477
I've witnessed many parents
abandon their children.

312
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,729
They would promise that they'd come back.

313
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,232
That they wouldn't take long,
they just had to find something.

314
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,819
But a person's eyes do not lie.

315
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,322
I knew right away

316
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,200
that they weren't coming back
for their children.

317
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,453
What about my mom's mother?

318
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,914
Did you also see her eyes?

319
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,416
Your mom's mother?

320
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:56,881
My mom told me that
she came from this orphanage.

321
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,928
Do you remember how she got here?

322
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,933
What's your mom's full name?

323
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,103
Anna Sarmiento.

324
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,731
Sarmiento...

325
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,946
We've got a missing person case.

326
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,031
An eight-year-old girl.

327
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,617
Reports say she might be in this area.

328
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,453
Maybe you've seen a young girl who's lost

329
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,039
or alone or asking for help.

330
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,250
What's the girl's name, sir?

331
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,918
Uh Grace Banaag.

332
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,420
Here.

333
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,424
I don't remember, sir.

334
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,926
Lots of people come and go here.

335
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,098
Doesn't she look like that kid?

336
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,435
The one who came here
with his mother on a tricycle.

337
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,021
But wasn't that a boy?

338
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,024
Do you have a record of the patients?

339
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,233
We do.

340
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,234
Um...

341
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,113
I remember the mother's name was…

342
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,198
mila.

343
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,330
That's the footage we got
from the terminal.

344
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,416
The problem is, we can't see the face.

345
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,626
So, nothing concrete.

346
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,004
We're not sure if it's Grace.

347
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,924
But we have statements
from those who saw them, right?

348
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,719
Yes, but they said the kid was a boy.

349
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,597
But they also said
the kid looked like Grace.

350
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,808
The truth is,

351
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,604
more questions come up instead of answers.

352
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,523
If she did abduct the kid,

353
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,444
why would they go to Grace's relatives?

354
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,322
And you saw how she held the kid.

355
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:45,990
It looked normal.

356
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,076
Didn't seem like
she was forcing the kid.

357
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,619
They were in a public place.

358
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,621
She wouldn't behave like a kidnapper.

359
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,624
And it's possible that the child
was scared or traumatized

360
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,501
or was being manipulated.

361
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,753
Whatever we say Julius,

362
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,924
it was wrong of her to take
the child from her parents.

363
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,009
We have to find them right away.

364
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,429
We can't second-guess ourselves
every time Julius.

365
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,224
I'm looking into something.

366
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:13,935
What?

367
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,230
Two teachers made a report.

368
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,608
To social services
about what happened to Grace.

369
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,027
One of them is now missing.

370
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,826
On the same day that Grace disappeared,

371
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,121
she was supposed to leave for abroad,

372
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,622
but she never arrived.

373
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,916
Who's this?

374
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,417
What's the name?

375
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,502
Anna.

376
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,754
Sarmiento.

377
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,714
Her movements and posture

378
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,634
are the same as those
of the woman with the kid.

379
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,720
How do you know?

380
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,223
We were in a relationship.

381
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:57,937
Keep your personal feelings
out of work Julius.

382
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,398
Miranda, you've known me
for a long time, right?

383
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,152
I'm a professional in everything I do.

384
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,737
And it's my job to uncover the truth,

385
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,823
regardless of who gets affected.

386
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,623
"Julius"?

387
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,917
Julius Auntie as in-

388
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,335
-Julius.
-Don't tell me-

389
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,837
it was Anna's ex.

390
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,214
Why was he looking for Anna?

391
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,718
He said he wanted to talk to her for work.

392
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,722
Are you sure
that's the real reason Auntie?

393
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,099
That's what he told me.

394
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,604
It's not that easy to get over
what happened to them.

395
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,398
Quezon and Batangas.

396
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,859
It already feels like
my world is falling apart.

397
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,528
Think about it.
They were about to get married.

398
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,822
But then Anna suddenly disappeared.

399
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:55,119
I can't really blame Julius
if he still resents Anna.

400
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,706
What Anna did was humiliating.

401
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,918
Do you think
they can still make up Auntie?

402
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,629
I'm worried.

403
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,632
I don't know if they should have closure.

404
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,801
I'm sure Julius is still mad at Anna.

405
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,221
I would, too, if I were ghosted.

406
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,103
Damn it. What are you doing here?

407
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,231
Mrs. Banaag.

408
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,107
Excuse me?

409
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:26,734
Can I help you?

410
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,402
I have news for you.

411
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,613
Have you found Grace?

412
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,115
Do you know someone named Mila?

413
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,327
Mila? No.

414
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,246
Do you know a Mila?

415
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,330
No.

416
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,414
Why?

417
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,125
Did you fight with anyone recently?

418
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,295
-What's with all the questions?
-Just answer my question.

419
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,256
You had a fight recently.

420
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,632
With that guy at the bar.

421
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,133
Because he was rude to you.

422
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,010
I'm looking for a woman.

423
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,097
Do you know anyone
who could've taken Grace?

424
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,810
Could've taken Grace? Like kidnap her?

425
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,107
Why would they do that? We're poor!

426
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,317
There are many possible reasons.

427
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,279
I'm looking into every angle.

428
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,281
That woman you were asking me about...

429
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,240
Mila, right?

430
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,825
Was it her?

431
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,618
Did she take my kid?

432
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,328
So my daughter was kidnapped?

433
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,621
Grace was kidnapped!

434
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,206
Chito. Grace was kidnapped!

435
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,925
So, you think Grace
visited her aunt in Quezon

436
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,136
with that Mila?

437
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,931
Sir, is there a chance
her name isn't really Mila?

438
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,142
It's possible.

439
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,770
Some witnesses said that
Grace looked like a boy.

440
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,398
Maybe this Mila put her in a disguise.

441
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,819
Wait, how did you notice that?

442
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,904
Do you know something we don't?

443
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,825
I'm looking for someone
who also knows Grace.

444
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,120
She disappeared the same day Grace did.

445
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,204
Who?

446
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,831
Grace's teacher.

447
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,334
Anna Sarmiento.

448
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,132
Here's your food Mama Lucy.

449
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,718
You also don't have to
worry about your food later,

450
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,345
i cooked already.

451
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,429
Oh.

452
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,930
Oh…

453
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,516
uh-

454
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,603
what happened?

455
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,731
Where'd you get all these burns?

456
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,608
This is nothing, don't worry.

457
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,903
I'm not blind.

458
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,696
Where did you get those?

459
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,199
At your new job?

460
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,327
What did you get into?

461
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,038
I got a job at an eatery.

462
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,124
I cook and do the dishes.

463
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,628
Oh my goodness.

464
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:55,132
Not only will you get callus and wounds,

465
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,510
your hands will be sore.

466
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,389
What did you get into?

467
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:02,306
Hm?

468
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,726
Was your previous job like this?

469
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,145
You seem to be an educated person.

470
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:11,232
I just need money immediately.

471
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,610
I'm not kicking you out, okay?

472
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,530
You can stay.

473
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:22,034
You and Bright can stay here
as long as you want.

474
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,745
You don't need to do this to yourself.

475
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,123
Here, take this.

476
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,332
Use this.

477
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,501
Find yourself a new job.

478
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,002
Thank you.

479
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:34,713
You need to eat.

480
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,925
That's all yours to use.

481
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,219
I don't need it.

482
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,934
Everyone has forgotten about me anyway.

483
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,105
Okay.

484
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,610
"The National Law Enforcement Agency."

485
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,332
Sarah?

486
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,418
-Miss Miranda.
-What are you doing here?

487
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,421
Uh, can I talk to you?

488
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,215
Something is bothering me.

489
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,010
It's about Mila.

490
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,303
Mila?

491
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,015
She was the person
my daughter was last with.

492
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,519
I just found out that
before Grace disappeared,

493
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,313
they were always together.

494
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,315
She's her teacher.

495
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,734
But she's nowhere to be found now.

496
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,819
What is the name of the teacher?

497
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,112
Anna.

498
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,743
Let's just wait here.

499
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,827
Okay.

500
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,249
-There he is.
-Miss Miranda.

501
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,542
What are you doing here?

502
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:54,752
I'm here with Sarah.

503
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,921
She might know who Mila is.

504
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,424
That's her!

505
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,928
Miss Miranda, that's Mila!

506
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,554
You're her, right?

507
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,349
You're our daughter's teacher.
You visited us before.

508
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,309
Yes I was her teacher.

509
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,811
But my name is Anna, not Mila.

510
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,106
I also reported what
happened to the kid before.

511
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,025
See?

512
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,944
You were lying from the start.

513
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,820
Your accusations are false.

514
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,114
Sarah, calm down.

515
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,116
Hold on.

516
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,828
I have nothing to do with
what happened to Grace.

517
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,581
I don't know why
I'm getting dragged into this.

518
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,750
If I had anything to do with it,

519
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,127
why would I bother show up here?

520
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,337
Wait a minute.

521
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,632
I assume she's here
to be questioned, right?

522
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,925
You're right.

523
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,427
I was asking Miss Sarmiento
about her whereabouts

524
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,012
on the day Grace disappeared.

525
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,514
She was bound for Hong Kong.

526
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,432
But we learned that she didn't go.

527
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,517
Hm.

528
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,018
And what did she say?

529
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,019
Look.

530
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,104
Here.

531
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,399
"Princess and Wilson"

532
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,735
My sister is getting married.
My mom invited me.

533
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,320
She insisted I come.

534
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,698
That's why I didn't leave.

535
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,618
Is that so?

536
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,500
Then explain this.

537
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,503
This is footage from the bus terminal.

538
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,714
Is this not you?

539
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,603
She has short hair mine is long.

540
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,314
Miss, here's what we'll do.

541
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,734
Do you have any idea
where the kid could've gone?

542
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,404
Or anyone who could've taken her?

543
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,200
I think what you should be asking is…

544
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,828
What kind of life did the kid have?

545
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:56,498
Why was she malnourished and always dirty?

546
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,001
Why was she always distracted at school?

547
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:02,004
Why was her body covered in bruises?

548
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,341
You should be asking
those questions instead.

549
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,717
Are you blaming me?

550
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,718
No.

551
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,720
I don't blame anyone.

552
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,598
We're all at fault here.

553
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,018
Because none of us ever checked on her.

554
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,479
None of us asked her
what she was going through.

555
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:22,566
All because, what?
She looked okay and happy?

556
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,445
So who's the bad guy?

557
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,529
It's all of us.

558
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,823
Because we neglected her.

559
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,338
Mama Lucy?

560
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,422
Hm?

561
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:49,134
How do I find a job?

562
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,135
Oh.

563
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,596
Why do you want to know?

564
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,517
I want to help Mama work.

565
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,230
It's the parent's responsibility
to provide for their child.

566
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,024
But I want to help her.

567
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,151
By working too?

568
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,946
-I'm good at cleaning.
-Mm-hmm.

569
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,948
I can do the laundry.

570
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,826
I know how to do dishes.

571
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,830
What if I worked for you?

572
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,831
Oh, dear.

573
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,918
I'm afraid I can't afford to pay you.

574
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,129
Please Mama Lucy.

575
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:30,217
What you need to do is be a child.

576
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,638
I know what else you can do.

577
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,725
Help me find my treasure.

578
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,643
Treasure?

579
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,937
You want to help your mom, don't you?

580
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,647
Where is it?

581
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:48,110
First we need to find the key.

582
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,364
Anna?

583
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,032
Can I talk to you for a second?

584
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,617
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

585
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:56,910
Uh...

586
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,913
I want to interview you.

587
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,124
You know, to get your side of the story.

588
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,918
I'm sorry I'm not comfortable with that.

589
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,462
I have nothing to say either.

590
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,213
I understand.

591
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,841
But I know that as a teacher,

592
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,219
of course you're also concerned
about Grace, right?

593
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:18,599
That's why you're here to
help the authorities find her.

594
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,059
Well, the interview
will be just like that.

595
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,644
It's like talking to a police,

596
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,898
or your neighbor, or your mother.

597
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,737
You shouldn't be asking me.

598
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,823
I was just a sub for Grace's class.

599
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,826
The other teachers know her more.

600
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,536
You should be asking them.

601
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,829
Anna.

602
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:42,998
Please?

603
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,919
I want to know the truth.

604
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,511
I know you.

605
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:00,516
I know you help mothers in need

606
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,435
but I'm telling you...

607
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,396
Not all mothers are the same.

608
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,299
You're so good at lying.

609
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,010
You are such a manipulator.

610
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,139
I didn't expect to see you here.

611
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,808
Don't change the subject.

612
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,726
Where's Grace?

613
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,437
I already told you.

614
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:48,522
I don't know.

615
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,607
I don't believe you.

616
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,234
I know you.

617
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,157
Are you still mad about what I did before?

618
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,702
Is that why you're accusing me?

619
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,705
Don't flatter yourself.

620
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,500
It's my job to find out
what happened to Grace.

621
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,796
And you're my suspect because
the evidence points to you.

622
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,008
Why would you believe the evidence?

623
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,219
Julius, you know me.

624
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,723
Do you really think
I'm capable of caring for a kid?

625
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,727
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

626
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,811
You're right.

627
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,397
But I haven't changed.

628
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,651
Why the hell would I
look after a stranger's kid?

629
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,320
She's your student.

630
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,196
For only less than a month.

631
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,950
Whatever happened to Grace,

632
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,410
i hope you find her.

633
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,914
But I have nothing to do
with it, so leave me alone.

634
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,844
Where is it Mama Lucy?

635
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:01,929
Come, look.

636
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,348
It's on the wall. Right there.

637
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,933
-Where?
-Over there.

638
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,977
It's hanging on the wall. Right there.

639
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,437
You see, hu?

640
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,523
How can I get it? The door is locked.

641
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,150
Wait. Well, here.

642
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,444
Am I going to steal it?

643
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,948
You're not stealing
because this is my house.

644
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,450
Then why don't you use the door?

645
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,119
Oh, enough with the questions.

646
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,705
Do you want to find the treasure or not?

647
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,833
Alright.

648
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,335
Come on then.

649
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,421
Okay. Get up here.

650
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,422
Hurry.

651
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,925
Hurry up.

652
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,426
Go on, go on.

653
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,053
-I'm in.
-Good.

654
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,305
Very good. Now, go get it.

655
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,516
Hurry up! Bright!

656
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,518
Jump. You can do it.

657
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,853
There. Keep jumping.

658
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,314
Faster! Bright! Oh!

659
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,441
Alright, come on now Bright.

660
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,443
Hurry up. Hurry up Bright.

661
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,445
Hurry up Bright!

662
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,031
I'm coming. Calm down.

663
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,825
-Quick.
-Here I come Mama Lucy.

664
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,327
-I might get hurt.
-No you won't.

665
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,830
Hurry, the owner's here.

666
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,629
What are you doing?

667
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,506
-Run.
-Hm?

668
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,424
Run Bright.

669
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,842
What are you doing here?

670
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,051
Bright, run!

671
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,428
Answer me!

672
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,345
Run Bright!

673
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,308
Do you live here?

674
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,812
Were you the one who broke into my house?

675
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,314
No.

676
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,443
I'm sorry, but you need to go.

677
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,987
I'm taking my mom to a nursing home
to live there.

678
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:42,946
What?

679
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,239
Nursing home?

680
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,324
How many times do I have to repeat this?

681
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,118
I won't live there.

682
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,327
I have a house.

683
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,328
Where?

684
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,621
This orphanage?

685
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,832
It's falling apart.

686
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,417
It's not safe to live here.

687
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,420
I hope you're ready
to leave by tomorrow Anna.

688
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,337
No.

689
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,214
Anna is not going anywhere.

690
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,508
She has nowhere to go.

691
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,595
Enough Ma!

692
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,808
Why do you always
have to help other people?

693
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,936
What about you?

694
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,814
What do you mean? What's wrong?

695
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:18,815
Why?

696
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,609
You don't notice?

697
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,029
Your memory is faltering.

698
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,323
Recently,

699
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,117
you stole someone's dog.

700
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:34,039
Then you stole from Miss Siony's garden.

701
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,916
Now you broke into my house!

702
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,421
Hey, that's my house too.

703
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,924
I'll just stay with you.

704
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,301
Someone needs to take care of you.

705
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,804
Someone who's always around.

706
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,139
I have a job I can't do that.

707
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,432
I can do it.

708
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,727
I can take care of Mama Lucy.

709
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,439
Please, sir.

710
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,316
Please let us stay here.

711
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,901
Don't kick us out.

712
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,947
Sorry, but once Mama leaves,

713
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,032
i'm tearing down the orphanage.

714
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,326
Find somewhere else to live.

715
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,342
Are we leaving?

716
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,927
Why didn't you listen to me?

717
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,221
Didn't I tell you not to leave the house?

718
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,848
But you've done it

719
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,599
and now we're getting kicked out!

720
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,310
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,233
I don't know what to do anymore.

722
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,235
Nothing's going our way.

723
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,738
I don't have enough money
to get us out of this country.

724
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,699
I can't shake the cops off our trail.

725
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,075
Don't know where to hide.

726
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,911
Now you've made it worse
by disobeying my instructions!

727
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,706
Do you think this is easy for me?

728
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,129
I know it's hard for you.

729
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,425
If that is so, why didn't you
follow my instructions?

730
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,927
Just so you know, you're not
my responsibility.

731
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,430
But I'm enduring everything
just for your sake!

732
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,849
You should've thought of that
before acting up!

733
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,934
I know.

734
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,106
I know. I just wanted to help you.

735
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,152
Because…

736
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,197
You've ran out of money.

737
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,495
Gra...

738
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:46,630
The kid's just worried about you.

739
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,425
He knows you're having a hard time.

740
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,720
He just wants to help

741
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,223
and cheer you up.

742
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,607
Let me show you my treasures.

743
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,654
I kept in these boxes all the documents

744
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:14,824
related to kids who lived
in this orphanage.

745
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,204
These are my memories of them.

746
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,625
You're one of them, right?

747
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,213
Bright told me…

748
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,424
that you came from here.

749
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,931
If I'm not mistaken,

750
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,016
you're Grace.

751
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,396
You were just a baby
when you were left here.

752
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:49,025
No one knows who brought you here.

753
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,904
It wasn't until you turned four
when you were adopted.

754
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:00,829
It was your adoptive parents
who named you "Anna Grace."

755
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,334
They got the name
from the bracelet you had

756
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:10,422
when you were left at our doorstep.

757
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,519
Why are you giving me this?

758
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:29,107
Well, isn't that the reason you're here?

759
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:34,821
You're searching for answers
to all your questions.

760
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,909
Even if you don't say it,
your child knows what you need.

761
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,997
So don't be mad at him.

762
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,709
I just feel like I don't deserve his love.

763
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,594
I'm short-tempered.

764
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,305
I'm selfish.

765
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,436
I'm not even sure
if I'm doing the right thing

766
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,898
or if I can pull this off.

767
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:15,320
Raising a kid is never a walk in the park.

768
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,617
No parent has had it easy.

769
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,828
All of us doubted ourselves at least once.

770
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:28,500
Motherhood is a choice.

771
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,314
Grace?

772
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,653
Grace? Grace!

773
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,696
What are you doing?

774
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,450
Do I look handsome?

775
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,744
Why did you cut your hair?

776
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:08,415
I know you don't want us to get caught.

777
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,543
That's why you got angry.

778
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,295
I'm sorry for being stubborn.

779
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,216
No I should be the one apologizing.

780
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,843
I'm sorry.

781
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,554
I understand why you got angry.

782
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,223
You're just worried about me.

783
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:29,018
There's a time and place for play.

784
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,148
Come here.

785
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,024
Let me fix your hair.

786
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,904
Whose is that?

787
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,327
Mama Lucy gave it to me.

788
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,039
She said it was from
my biological parents.

789
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,208
I had it when I was left here as a baby.

790
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,211
Was it their gift to you?

791
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,922
Yeah, but they still left me.

792
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:04,929
Papa told me that if someone
gives you jewelry,

793
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,598
it means they love you.

794
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,935
He gave me something similar.

795
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,731
Where is it now?

796
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,609
Mama pawned it.

797
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,820
To pay for our rent.

798
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:27,035
Your parents love you too.

799
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,829
That's why they gave you that bracelet.

800
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,796
You think I wouldn't find out?

801
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,008
You're planning to sell the orphanage.

802
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,760
That's why you want me to leave.

803
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,261
What's so wrong about that?

804
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:47,347
You old fart. I'll inherit this soon.

805
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,098
I'm still alive Bobby.

806
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:52,936
Are you that excited for me to die

807
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,521
so you can fill your pocket?

808
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,232
What kind of son are you?

809
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,316
What about you?

810
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,819
What kind of mother are you?

811
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,822
You expecting me to be patient with you?

812
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,700
To take care of you until you wither?

813
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,829
You didn't even take care of me
when I was a kid!

814
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,916
You let my father take me away!

815
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,629
All you cared about was this orphanage!

816
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:23,132
Don't be mean to Mama Lucy!

817
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:28,596
Even if she did you wrong,
you don't have to yell at her!

818
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,141
She's still your mother!

819
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:36,229
-Mind your own business, kid.
-Why are you so angry?

820
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,148
She just wants to be with you!

821
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,608
To be with me?

822
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,820
She doesn't even want to leave this place

823
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,948
because this rotting orphanage
is more important to her!

824
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,909
Do you know why
she let me and Mama stay here?

825
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,496
Because she's lonely!

826
00:47:55,123 --> 00:48:00,920
Every day, she sits by the window waiting.

827
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,214
Waiting for you!

828
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,301
Just take her with you!

829
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,137
Forgive me, son.

830
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,307
I know I wasn't a good mother to you.

831
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:15,518
But I want to make it up to you.

832
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,815
I want to stay with you,
not to be a burden,

833
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,235
but to take care of you.

834
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,532
I want to make you feel my love
at least before I die.

835
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:38,041
You're very lucky Mister Bobby.

836
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:42,211
You have a mother who wants
to make things right with you.

837
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:47,216
Like you said Mama Lucy is old now.

838
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,137
Don't you want

839
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:56,434
to make the most of your time
left with Mama Lucy?

840
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,700
You're leaving?

841
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,827
Yes.

842
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,705
I'm going with my son.

843
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,500
I'll stay with him from now on.

844
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:22,835
Really?

845
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,420
Yes.

846
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:29,509
It looks like Grace managed
to knock some sense into him.

847
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:34,639
H-How did you know her real name?

848
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:38,309
I heard you fighting last night.

849
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:42,105
I heard how you called her Grace

850
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,525
and that you're hiding from the cops.

851
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,029
I'm really sorry.

852
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,950
I didn't want to lie to you.

853
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,952
I'm just protecting Grace.

854
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,995
She was being mistreated by her mother.

855
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,333
In the short time I spent with you,

856
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,504
i saw how you care for Grace.

857
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,717
I saw how you protect
and love her in your own way.

858
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,847
In my eyes, you are her mother.

859
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,724
What if I'm not strong enough?

860
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,436
You may not realize it...

861
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:24,731
but you're slowly
becoming stronger for her.

862
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,817
And that's what a mother is.

863
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,196
Wait here.

864
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,615
I'll go get something.

865
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:37,535
You can see on your screens

866
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,037
the numbers you may call
to get in touch with us.

867
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,331
You may also post on social media

868
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,626
with the hashtag Where is Grace.

869
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:49,714
Let's help the poor mother
find her daughter.

870
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,425
On a personal note...

871
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:58,097
We've been following Sarah
and Grace's story for weeks.

872
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:02,018
But with each passing second

873
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:05,229
that Grace is separated from her mother,

874
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:08,232
my patience is wearing thinner.

875
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,527
To the person who took Grace,

876
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,114
please rethink your choices.

877
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,452
Whether Grace wants to go with you or not,

878
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,914
she's in no capacity
to make decisions for herself.

879
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,333
You're the adult.

880
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,419
You should know
what's the right thing to do.

881
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:31,422
So I'm giving you a chance

882
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,925
to fix things before it gets worse.

883
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,637
Within 24 hours,

884
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,931
bring back Grace.

885
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,434
Your 24 hours

886
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,311
starts now.

887
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:58,115
The birds that fly

888
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,117
are dear to God

889
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,245
his love doesn't fade

890
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,914
so don't be sad

891
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,210
stay positive

892
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,629
we're here.

893
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,427
Are we going to stay here?

894
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,518
Mama, there are many kids
I can play with here!

895
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,812
Positive!

896
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:35,403
-Hello! Can I play with you?
-Sure! Let's play! Come on!

897
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,951
-Your turn!
-Okay!

898
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,202
Be careful!

899
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,544
Mama!

900
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:34,712
Little kid!

901
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,214
Where are your parents? Are you alone?

902
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:40,635
No! I'm with my mama!

903
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,346
Why don't we wait for her inside?

904
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:47,350
-No! I'm not coming with you!
-Calm down. Come on.

905
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,152
Take me with you!

906
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:25,596
Mama!

907
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,850
Has anyone called regarding Grace?

908
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,435
None yet Miss Miranda.

909
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,358
There's only one hour left.

910
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,222
"Heart"

911
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:11,434
"Be happy"

912
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,106
"Pipo's feather"

913
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,324
"Teacher Anna I'm happy
that you'll be happy."

914
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:29,804
Hello?

915
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,517
Grace?

916
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,313
Grace. Talk to me, dear.

917
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,942
Sarah, who are you

918
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,610
talking to?

919
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,403
You're too loud.

920
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:49,615
G-Grace.

921
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,120
Hello?

922
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,716
Let's go, let's go.

923
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:14,306
Excuse me, miss.
Are you getting on or not?

924
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,530
Alright, let's go.

925
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,418
Hey, kid! Hey!

926
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,422
Kid!

927
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,718
Where are you going?

928
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,429
Come on, let's go back to the orphanage.

929
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,514
-You should go inside.
-I don't want to!

930
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,141
I need to look for my mother!

931
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:44,146
-Let go of me!
-Come back inside.

932
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,149
No. I don't want to!

933
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:48,943
Let go of her!

934
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,612
-Let go of my daughter!
-Come with us.

935
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,122
Mama!

936
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,253
Dear I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

937
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:09,630
I won't leave you again. I'm sorry.

938
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:17,304
Mama! Mama!

939
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,726
Mama!

940
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,106
Mama...

941
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,567
The police found an address
where Grace could be.

942
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:31,944
What are they doing here?

943
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:34,780
Since she's the mother
she has every right to be here.

944
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,073
What's going on here?

945
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,783
Are you the owner of this house?

946
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,326
It belongs to my mother. Why?

947
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,912
Have you seen a woman
and a child around here?

948
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:45,040
Anna.

949
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:46,834
Ma I need your help.

950
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,502
How much did you ask from Mama?

951
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:50,629
What was that?

952
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:53,507
Excuse me.

953
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,097
Mama?

954
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,598
Grace?
