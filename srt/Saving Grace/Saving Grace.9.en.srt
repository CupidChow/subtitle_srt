1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,337
I want to know who exactly it was

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:05,381
that decided to mess with my episode.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,008
My daughter trusts you,

4
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:09,677
yet you're going to betray her?

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,012
Anna is not your daughter.
She's my daughter!

6
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,015
Miranda Valdez, I have Grace.

7
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,434
Give me five million pesos

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,686
if you want to see
this kid alive.

9
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,232
Chito!

10
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,191
Dad.

11
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,236
-Why are you aiding a criminal?
-Dad, Anna's not a criminal.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,238
Don't treat me like a fool, Julius.

13
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,199
Governor Hernandez has ordered a manhunt

14
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,034
for Anna Sarmiento.

15
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,704
Get in. I'll help you escape.

16
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,009
No one can touch me now.

17
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,721
I'll show all of you.

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:59,018
You can't walk all over me
because I'm rich now.

19
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:05,816
What is this?

20
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,612
What is this? What the hell is this?

21
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,113
What the hell?

22
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,699
The police have arrested Sarah Banaag,

23
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,702
the mother of the missing
child Grace Banaag.

24
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:18,621
She was arrested by the police

25
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,332
during a foiled
kidnap-for-ransom operation.

26
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,919
Sarah was seen with
her partner, Chito Sumulong,

27
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,338
who took a fake five-million ransom

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,923
in exchange for Grace.

29
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,300
Based on Mrs. Banaag's initial statement,

30
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,928
she claims she wasn't aware
of her partner's plans

31
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,721
and that she is a victim too.

32
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,098
The police are currently investigating

33
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,435
if they are the masterminds
behind Grace's disappearance.

34
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,438
Meanwhile, Chito Sumulong has escaped

35
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:47,107
and is now wanted by the police.

36
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,494
There's a checkpoint at the plaza.

37
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,120
We can't get pass there.

38
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,498
We need to get out of here.

39
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,500
Where are you taking us?

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,918
Just trust me.

41
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,127
I know it's hard,

42
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,046
but right now, I'm your best chance.

43
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,133
Julius, take that corner.

44
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,511
Turn left.
There's a way there to the pier.

45
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,595
Alright.

46
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,392
There's a checkpoint.

47
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,310
What are we going to do?

48
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,521
Wait, hold on. Stop.

49
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,898
It will be more suspicious
if we turn around.

50
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,985
Take the blanket at the back
and hide yourselves. Hurry.

51
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:35,114
-Come here, Grace.
-Hurry, hurry.

52
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,038
Good evening, ma'am.
This is a checkpoint.

53
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,624
W-We're off to somewhere.
We're in a hurry.

54
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,835
-It's important.
-Oh, Miss Miranda.

55
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,919
Good evening.

56
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:53,883
We're looking for Anna Sarmiento.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,010
You reported on her, right?

58
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,804
I did. This is my producer.

59
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,223
We're on our way to an important meeting.

60
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,017
Could you please let us through?

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,435
Alright, ma'am. Thank you.

62
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,686
Thank you.

63
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,326
Hello, Jess?

64
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,911
Sorry I missed your calls.

65
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:04,912
It's okay.

66
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,498
I just want to know
if you know where Mommy is.

67
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,000
She hasn't been answering my calls.

68
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,419
Your mom is on the way back to Manila.

69
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,005
She left without telling me?

70
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,007
Uh, yes. I'm sorry, dear.

71
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,802
You see, I'm going through something.

72
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,513
I-I really need her with me.

73
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,891
If that's the case,
why isn't she picking up?

74
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,811
And her suitcases are still here.

75
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,481
Well, I asked her to come right away.

76
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,110
Maybe she just turned off her phone.

77
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,612
Um, don't worry.

78
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,198
I'll tell her to call you right away.

79
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,825
Do you still need anything?

80
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,702
I really need to go.

81
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,412
No, Auntie.

82
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,872
Thank you. I'll just wait for her call.

83
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,001
Don't worry, dear.
Don't worry too much, okay?

84
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,085
Bye.

85
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,885
Where are you, Mom?

86
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,713
Where are we?

87
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,299
We're in San Rafael, Rizal.

88
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,134
This is my rest house.

89
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,011
You can stay here for now.

90
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,515
It's quiet here.

91
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,310
Far from all the activities.

92
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,104
But the thing is, there's no signal here,

93
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,523
and we often have power outages.

94
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,901
But like I said,

95
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,529
the people here are far
from what's going on out there.

96
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,907
No one will recognize you here.

97
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,993
You can now move
and live freely all you want.

98
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,287
Why are you doing this?

99
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,707
Why are you helping us?

100
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,794
Even though you know
that I kidnapped Grace.

101
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:20,798
I'm hoping…

102
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,301
that you could forgive me.

103
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,011
I want to say that…

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
I wasn't the one who did it,

105
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,183
but it was still my fault.

106
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,812
I didn't do my job right.

107
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,526
Still nothing?

108
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,946
I told you, Julius's phone
cannot be reached.

109
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,532
Do you think they're together?
I hope they're safe.

110
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,908
I wonder where they are.

111
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,785
Will you still be opening, Helena?

112
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,829
Why wouldn't we?

113
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,206
Does the chairman know about it?

114
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,417
Why do I have to inform the chairman?

115
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,002
We have a permit.

116
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,420
Don't you know?

117
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,006
People here have been
complaining against you.

118
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,802
They say you're ruining
the image of our place

119
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,220
because of your daughter.

120
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,429
What did you say?

121
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,432
Doesn't she have a warrant?

122
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,018
That's why there were checkpoints
recently.

123
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,604
There were a lot of reporters here.

124
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,232
Instead of highlighting
the beauty of our place,

125
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,609
they said we've got a criminal here!

126
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,611
My daughter didn't do anything wrong.

127
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:29,408
And for a bunch of gossips,
you sure are late to the party.

128
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,536
The police are now questioning
the child's mother.

129
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,454
-You're a bad mother.
-Where is Anna?

130
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,831
Where are you hiding her?

131
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,418
What are you doing here?
Stop ruining our lives!

132
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,420
Weren't you and your partner the ones

133
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,213
who extorted money for Grace?

134
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,007
I didn't know anything about that.

135
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,426
But I do know that you have my daughter,

136
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,635
so bring her out.

137
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,222
What are you talking about?
Anna is not here!

138
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,434
Of course she's not,
because you're hiding her!

139
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,687
Don't play me for a fool.
Bring out your daughter!

140
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,398
-Where are you going?
-Don't touch me!

141
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,992
Come in, come in.

142
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,331
Hold on.

143
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,790
Come in.

144
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,429
Please excuse the house.

145
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,808
I don't often come here,
so the fridge is nearly empty.

146
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,812
Don't worry. I'll ask someone to get food.

147
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,898
Uh, I'll do it.

148
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,485
I also have to make a phone call
to get updates from Palawan.

149
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,488
Could you call Mama too?

150
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,115
Let her know that we're safe.

151
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,285
Just don't tell her where we are.

152
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,412
Alright.

153
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,498
I'm going.

154
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,712
Water?

155
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,307
I'll go set up your room.

156
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,200
Mama, I have to pee.

157
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,996
Come.

158
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,500
Yes, they're here.

159
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,127
Keep an eye on them.

160
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,130
I'll just go out for a bit.
I need to talk to someone.

161
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,214
Okay.

162
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,899
Mama! Mama, where are we going?

163
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,902
I don't know, but we have to leave.

164
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:11,987
Come.

165
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,534
Is it still far?

166
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,702
I don't know.

167
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,911
Why? Are you tired?

168
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,497
No, I can do it.
What about you?

169
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,333
-Hurry!
-There's a car!

170
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,417
Hurry up!

171
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,295
Let's hide here. Hurry!

172
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,505
Hurry up!

173
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,301
Mama.

174
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,219
Mama!

175
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,514
Aah!

176
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,695
I-I'm okay.

177
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,722
Julius.

178
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,017
Julius, I've been texting and calling you.

179
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,936
I'm glad you called.

180
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,146
I'm sorry, Auntie. There's no signal here.

181
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,524
Where are you? Are you with Anna?

182
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,403
Auntie, it's probably better
that you don't know anything.

183
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,406
So you don't get implicated.

184
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,830
Let me help you with that.

185
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,415
I can do it.

186
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,293
You helped us, so I'm helping you too.

187
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,090
There. It's all clean.

188
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,592
You're good.

189
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,011
I'm used to this.

190
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,391
I clean my own wounds
whenever I get bruised.

191
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,523
Why? Do you often get bruised?

192
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,609
Whenever I got hit by Uncle Chito.

193
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,905
And… Mama.

194
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,124
Did they often hurt you?

195
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:33,420
Uncle Chito did, and so did my old mom.

196
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:42,721
But I don't get hurt anymore
because I'm with Mama.

197
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,602
You call Anna "Mama"?

198
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,813
Yes. She's my new mama.

199
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,816
Did she tell you to say that?

200
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,110
Back when we were hiding.

201
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,613
So that nobody would find us.

202
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,824
But now, I like it.

203
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,701
She's my mama now.

204
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,708
Weren't you scared when she kidnapped you?

205
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,423
Is there something funny
about my question?

206
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,883
No.

207
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:25,180
She didn't kidnap me.
It was me who kidnapped her.

208
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,186
She was about to leave then.

209
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,021
But…

210
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:39,027
I asked her to come with me
to my papa's aunt in Quezon.

211
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,488
But it turned out she's dead.

212
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,491
So she just stayed with me.

213
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,203
Is that kidnapping, Miss Miranda?

214
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,211
But, you know,

215
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,797
according to the law,

216
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,883
she should've brought you back.

217
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,220
She should've brought you home.

218
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,306
I don't want to. I don't want to go back.

219
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,237
-Chito!
-Shh! Not so loud!

220
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,697
Someone might see us here.

221
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,741
You jerk. I got arrested because of you.

222
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,034
You didn't even help me.

223
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,202
Do you have a brain?

224
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,205
How could I do that?
The police would've arrested me.

225
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,498
I'm wanted, remember?

226
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,710
We both would've ended up
in jail if I had done that.

227
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,588
And don't you dare blame me.
You threw me under the bus.

228
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,089
You know nothing?

229
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,299
I saw it on TV.

230
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,969
Besides, how could I help you?

231
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,012
With money.

232
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,805
The money, Chito.

233
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,974
Didn't you get the ransom money from her?

234
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,392
I got nothing!

235
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,936
I didn't get anything, not even a cent!

236
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,396
That woman tricked me!

237
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,231
It was just scraps of paper.

238
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,108
Why didn't you check it?

239
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,736
How was I supposed to check it, huh?

240
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,614
You expect me to open it
while running? Are you stupid?

241
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,824
Just admit it, this is your fault.

242
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,493
Your insanity keeps dragging me
into trouble!

243
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,079
The police think
we're the ones who took the child,

244
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,080
not Anna anymore.

245
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,166
Louder please, so everyone can hear you!

246
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,417
You stupid!

247
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,586
Where's Anna?

248
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,714
I don't know. I think she escaped.

249
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,008
Love.

250
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,219
Listen to me carefully.

251
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:34,225
We cannot get caught by the police.

252
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,810
Got it?

253
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,021
Find your daughter.

254
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,982
She needs to be the one
to pin this on Anna.

255
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,985
We have to clear our names, okay?

256
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,112
Understand, love?

257
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,909
Anna, you shouldn't have left.

258
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,497
You know, your stubbornness
keeps putting you in danger.

259
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,793
You didn't have to leave, Anna.

260
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,796
It's more dangerous for you outside.

261
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,716
Wait, I'll look for something
to use as a crutch.

262
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,426
No, no need. I can manage.

263
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,804
-Anna--
-I said, I'm fine. Oh!

264
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,019
Anna, you're not fine. Sit down.

265
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,604
Just relax, okay?

266
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,314
Mm-hmm.

267
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,693
Good thing it's not too serious.

268
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,903
-I'll go with you!
-Rest until it heals.

269
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,118
We might end up in
more trouble if we stay here.

270
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,208
Sorry, I overheard your phone call.

271
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,086
You mentioned having
someone watch over us.

272
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,089
That was Mang Berting,
my caretaker here.

273
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,717
I asked him to check on you

274
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,594
in case you needed anything.

275
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,306
I had to make a call to Manila, but…

276
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,309
but if it worries you, don't worry.

277
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,311
I won't ask him to come here again.

278
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,607
I'm just being careful.

279
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,111
I understand.

280
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,989
It's hard to trust anyone.

281
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,616
You don't know me.

282
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,414
You can't blame me.

283
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,668
Sometimes the ones you love the most
are the ones who betray you.

284
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,883
Did someone do that to you?

285
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,598
Your mom, did she do that to you?

286
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,190
It was me. I betrayed her trust.

287
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,610
And I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

288
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,200
That's how much you love them?

289
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,507
Oh! Anna!

290
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,928
Finally, we meet!

291
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,013
This is my best friend, Carmen.

292
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,099
Sorry about her. She's a little crazy.

293
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,521
That's why you're my best friend.

294
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,483
Birds of the same feather, flock together.

295
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,902
-Miss! Miss!
-Yes?

296
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,531
You're like Mama. She loves birds too.

297
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:39,035
Is that so? Then let's all flock together!

298
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,204
Wouldn't that be fun?

299
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,581
Anna…

300
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,210
just give me a chance.

301
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,798
I'll prove to you that you can trust me.

302
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,386
I'll clear your name.

303
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,180
I'll make sure Sarah and Chito are jailed.

304
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:07,105
Honestly, I'm starting to worry
about our safety here.

305
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,692
Sarah won't leave us alone.

306
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,903
What if next time it'd be worse than fire?

307
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,490
And, Auntie, our business
is already affected.

308
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,701
Nobody wants to book anymore.

309
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,787
You know, this is all Anna's fault.

310
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,125
Why are you blaming her?
Is she even still here?

311
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,128
Do you see her around?
She's gone, isn't she?

312
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,380
But Auntie, what do we do now?

313
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,716
What's our next step?

314
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm thinking…

315
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,890
Maybe…

316
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,019
Maybe we should leave for now.

317
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,315
Let's close the inn temporarily.

318
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,987
Let things cool down.

319
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,700
But where would we go, Ma?

320
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,703
I…

321
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:09,500
I have a friend who owns
some apartments in Manila.

322
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,587
Let's stay there for now.

323
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,234
Hmm?

324
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,236
Why are you staring at me like that?

325
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,780
It's just…

326
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:43,618
It's the first time
I've seen you this domesticated!

327
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:48,206
And smiling like that again, Miranda! Wow!

328
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,001
I'm just happy to be with her again.

329
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,381
But she still doesn't know the truth.

330
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,218
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

331
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,888
And how long are you planning to wait?

332
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,226
-Huh?
-I'm scared, Carmen.

333
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,019
Scared of what?

334
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,896
Ever since we've been together,

335
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,399
even though she doesn't say it,

336
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,818
I know she's been through so much.

337
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,488
-Mm.
-And I know I'm part of that.

338
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,532
I made a huge mistake.

339
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,493
Well, Helena's mistakes are far worse.

340
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:31,290
Anna loves Helena and her whole family.

341
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,794
Despite everything Helena's done,

342
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,882
how can I go up against
the person who raised her?

343
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,636
You're winning her back, aren't you?

344
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,100
You have all the time in the
world to prepare her, Miranda.

345
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,685
Don't worry.

346
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,104
-I hope so.
-Okay?

347
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:56,524
You know, what I want most
in the world right now

348
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,192
is just one thing,

349
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,280
to take away all the pain she feels.

350
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,991
Well…

351
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,618
What about Jessica?

352
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,706
Do you think she'll easily accept Anna?

353
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,919
Didn't Julius and Anna have a past?

354
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,184
Let's eat.

355
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,312
Okay.

356
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:39,317
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

357
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,779
-About what?
-About Anna.

358
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,991
Do you plan on getting back
together with her?

359
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,920
But Miranda, I don't think we should…

360
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,422
meddle in our personal lives anymore.

361
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,007
You're right.

362
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,803
Then let's talk business.

363
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,098
Come back to Karamay.

364
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,813
Why?

365
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,524
Because I was…

366
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,610
I was too emotional when I fired you.

367
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,488
But I need you, Julius.

368
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,534
Help me change
the public's opinion of Anna.

369
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:32,203
Help me reveal the truth.

370
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,705
We both want the same thing, don't we?

371
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,669
Let's prove that Sarah and Chito
are responsible

372
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,004
for everything that happened to Grace.

373
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,731
What? Erin and her family left?

374
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,483
Where did they go?

375
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,612
Oh, they're not here anymore.
They've gone to Manila.

376
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,614
Wait, who are you?

377
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,617
I'm a friend of hers.
I just wanted to say goodbye

378
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,786
because I need to head back home.

379
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,914
Uh... Can I get her number?

380
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,833
I thought you were her friend.

381
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,418
Why don't you have her number?

382
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,836
Never mind. Thanks anyway.

383
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,504
Geez.

384
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,132
They left? Are they running away?

385
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,925
-You again?
-Where did they go?

386
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,886
Miss, can you just go home for now?

387
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,805
This is the latest incident in Palawan.

388
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,100
Sarah Banaag caused a major scandal

389
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,436
and harmed Anna Sarmiento's family.

390
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,398
She acted like a wild tiger
just to get her child back.

391
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,734
But before this incident,

392
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,528
questions arose about
Sarah Banaag's connection

393
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:51,032
to Chito Sumulong, who was
confirmed to have orchestrated

394
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,117
Grace's kidnap-for-ransom.

395
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:57,413
This has led many to doubt
Sarah Banaag's true nature.

396
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,998
Is she a victim,

397
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:02,293
or is she the one behind what
happened to her own child?

398
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,512
Hand her over! Hand her over!

399
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,223
Mom, you're back!

400
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,225
-Jessica.
-I've been looking for you.

401
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,103
Sorry, dear, I got so busy here
after I returned.

402
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,022
Where did you go, anyway?

403
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,899
Why did you suddenly leave?

404
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,485
I just had something important
to take care of.

405
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,614
I've missed you, Mom.

406
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,407
I missed you too, dear.

407
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,994
Jess…

408
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,998
Um…

409
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,626
There's something I need to tell you.

410
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:48,005
If this is about Julius,
why did you hire him back?

411
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,800
You know he's helping Anna.

412
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,804
Is this your way
of finding out where she is?

413
00:25:56,013 --> 00:26:00,017
Ah, so… Sarah's the suspect
in Grace's case, right?

414
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,437
I thought you and Sarah already
talked. You're helping her.

415
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,232
That's why I became her lawyer, right?

416
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,317
We didn't discuss anything like that.

417
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,696
Well, either way, I believe in her.

418
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,531
I know what I saw, Mom.

419
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,324
It wasn't just about the notebook.

420
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,076
The way they acted was different.

421
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,287
I know they're hiding the child.

422
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,707
I hope they catch Anna soon.

423
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,084
She ruined things between me and Julius.

424
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,920
Mom.

425
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,006
-Mom, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

426
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,633
Nothing. My stomach just hurt, dear.

427
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,302
-Are you okay?
-Probably stress.

428
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,138
-Yeah, don't worry.
-You want to go to the doctor's?

429
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,016
-We need to get a check--
-No, no, I'll handle it, dear.

430
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,060
I'm sorry. I have so much to do.
There's so much to be done.

431
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,812
-Mom.
-I'm sorry.

432
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,314
I'll talk later.

433
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:49,400
-Okay. Are you sure?
-Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:14,133
That's us, right
That's when they barged in.

435
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,010
That's me, right?

436
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,429
That's what they're showing me
in the video.

437
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:22,391
I'm sure it's our nosy neighbors
spreading it.

438
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,310
What's going on?

439
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,229
Why is Miranda Valdez
making Sarah look bad?

440
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,231
Aren't they supposed to be buddies?

441
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,108
Well, Sarah is bad.

442
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:35,029
Anna said Grace was being hurt there,

443
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,614
so she took her.

444
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,908
Maybe she finally realized the truth.

445
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,910
Charlie, can you turn that off?

446
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,704
It's distracting me.
We still have a lot to do.

447
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,834
Ma, tomorrow I might need to go out.

448
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,920
I'll probably get home late.

449
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,880
Why? Where are you going?

450
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,425
I'm planning to apply for a job.

451
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,679
We need the money while the inn is closed.

452
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,391
Me too.

453
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,810
I'm thinking of starting a business too.

454
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,728
What kind of business?

455
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,480
I don't know yet.

456
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,902
Why don't we try online selling?
It's trendy now.

457
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,406
We can sell desserts Auntie makes.

458
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,116
That's a trend these days.

459
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,784
Hey, count me in!

460
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,123
You know, you're giving me hope.

461
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:32,002
I can feel that if we do this well,

462
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:36,006
we might even open
a branch of Helena's Paradise.

463
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,717
Wow, that's a winner!

464
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

465
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,307
Tell me.

466
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,601
Well,

467
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:53,315
Based on the colonoscopy
and other tests we conducted,

468
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,946
you have colon cancer.

469
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,414
Miranda.

470
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,083
Miranda, are you okay?

471
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,420
H-How…

472
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,798
How serious is it?

473
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,717
Stage four.

474
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,636
It has spread to your liver.

475
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,099
But we can discuss the options available.

476
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,020
This can't be.

477
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,483
There's still so much I need to do.

478
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,279
I haven't… I haven't made it
up to my daughter yet.

479
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,492
I can't die.

480
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,832
Miranda, I've been waiting for you!

481
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,503
I got a call from
the Asian Essence Awards.

482
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,213
It's official!

483
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,132
You are getting the
Lifetime Achievement Award!

484
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,302
Congratulations, my friend.
I'm so happy for you.

485
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,013
Finally, everything is falling into place.

486
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:08,516
No, it's not.

487
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,602
What do you mean?
You are at the peak of your career.

488
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,312
You've also found your daughter.

489
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,813
What more could you want?

490
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,732
Time.

491
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,733
Huh?

492
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,818
I need time.

493
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,200
Anna and I haven't patched things up yet.

494
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,204
S-She still doesn't know the truth.

495
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:35,334
Don't worry, you'll be able
to tell her eventually.

496
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,003
Miranda, we need to celebrate!

497
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,298
I…

498
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,592
I need to be alone.

499
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,936
You were in Palawan for a long time

500
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,022
and that's all you have to say to me?

501
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,399
That the mother is your suspect?

502
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,151
Sir, my doubts never disappeared.

503
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,570
I still suspect it's Chito.

504
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,114
Anna suddenly showed up
while I was investigating.

505
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,115
Fool!

506
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,408
Did it ever occur to you

507
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,619
that the reason
why she's always showing up

508
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,997
is because she really has
something to do with it, huh?

509
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,291
We already got some evidence from her!

510
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,210
Sir, it's just circumstantial.
It can't be used in court.

511
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,629
We'll only be humiliated.

512
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,715
People already think
we're a disgrace, Jimenez!

513
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,134
Even the governor got involved!

514
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,303
He kicked us out of his jurisdiction!

515
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,514
I'm sorry, sir.

516
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,099
You're always sorry!

517
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,809
Recheck everything you need

518
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,811
so we can close this case already!

519
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:21,023
We need to send someone
to jail as soon as possible!

520
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,608
Use your head, Jimenez!

521
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,611
Get out of my sight!

522
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,488
You're pissing me off.

523
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,704
Son, what are you doing here?

524
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,082
I was thinking…

525
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,918
let's have lunch together.

526
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,046
School is starting soon,
so I'll get busier.

527
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,631
You need something, don't you?

528
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,799
No, Pa.

529
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,426
Where do you want to eat?

530
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,011
At your favorite place?

531
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:59,228
Miss Miranda, congratulations.

532
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,313
I heard you already signed the contract.

533
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,982
Head of the news department.

534
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,111
So, I guess you better behave, Ashley.

535
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,612
I'm your boss now.

536
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,199
Miss Miranda!

537
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,909
Sarah, you're back already?

538
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,411
Well…

539
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,330
I don't have anything to do there anymore.

540
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,374
Anna already left with her family.

541
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,835
When I found that out,
I scrammed to get here.

542
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,087
So that I could continue my search.

543
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,298
Haven't I told you, Sarah?

544
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,634
Bothering them won't help.

545
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:31,802
Bother?

546
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,762
Do you think that's what I did?

547
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,725
Is that why you reported that
on your program the other day?

548
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,018
You made me look like the villain.

549
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,897
I just showed them how brave you are.

550
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:47,609
How far a mother can go for her kid.

551
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:52,030
Miss Miranda, you showed them
that I was violent

552
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,116
and I was being aggressive towards them.

553
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,535
It made it seem like I beat my daughter.

554
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,998
Hmm, no, what I want is for the kidnapper

555
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,083
to be very afraid of you.

556
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,710
I want them to see

557
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,920
that they're messing with the wrong woman.

558
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,006
That will make them return Grace to you.

559
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,508
Miss Miranda, that wasn't
how it was portrayed.

560
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,636
From what I read, people on social media

561
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,804
are criticizing me.

562
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,097
Oh.

563
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,266
Maybe that's their perception…

564
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,935
because they're associating you
with what Chito did.

565
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,187
You know, the ransom.

566
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,316
If you want to clear your name,

567
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:32,237
you need to reveal everything
you know about Chito.

568
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,907
Because you can't deny what he has done.

569
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,909
So…

570
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,412
Miss Miranda, are you saying

571
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,206
I should betray Chito?

572
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,001
Before he drags you down
with him, you know?

573
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,212
You want to find your daughter.

574
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,506
You need to get the sympathy
of the people.

575
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,550
How can you do that if…

576
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,385
I'm the only one who believes you?

577
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,388
Think about it, Sarah, hmm?

578
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,605
Hi.

579
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,607
I'm Ashley Santillan.

580
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,317
I'm Miss Miranda's co-host.

581
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,886
Wow. It's beautiful here.

582
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,488
Wow.

583
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,033
So, this is why Ms. Miranda
is so beautiful.

584
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,412
She puts a lot of stuff on her face.

585
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,017
Oh!

586
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,814
This is my bracelet.

587
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,317
Why is it here?

588
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,986
And why are there two?

589
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,084
Grace!

590
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,795
Grace, what's that on your hand?

591
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:58,634
Sorry, I touched your things.

592
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,427
I'm sorry, Grace.

593
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,180
This is important to me.

594
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,017
I just wanted to show it to Mama.

595
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,686
Because you have the same bracelet.

596
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,689
She gave hers to me.

597
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,692
But I lost it.

598
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:17,903
Ah.

599
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,821
Grace…

600
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,615
I'm sorry, but…

601
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,117
Is it okay if you don't tell your mom

602
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,702
about the bracelet?

603
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,789
Why? Do you think she'll be jealous?

604
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,000
Mama isn't like that.

605
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,211
That's not what I mean.

606
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,799
It's just that I'd like
to give her that bracelet too.

607
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,926
I want to surprise her.

608
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,303
Can you keep this secret between us?

609
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,891
Okay. Positive.

610
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,520
Thank you. I'll just put it back.

611
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,079
Chito.

612
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,999
How did you get here?

613
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,419
Luckily, a friend let me crash.

614
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,213
You mean, you were lucky to leave Palawan

615
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,715
without anyone seeing you.

616
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,717
Of course.

617
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,511
What were you expecting?

618
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,013
I'm like a secret agent.

619
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,682
What's new? I'm getting bored here.

620
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,393
I don't know anymore.

621
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,312
Nothing is going right.

622
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,524
I don't know where Anna's family is

623
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,984
or Anna herself.

624
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,696
And that Oscar is snooping
around our area again.

625
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,616
What's Miranda doing?

626
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,410
Why don't you ask for her help?

627
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,412
Ask her?

628
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,081
So, you haven't watched her show?

629
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,209
She's taking Anna's side.

630
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,379
She dropped me after the stunt you pulled.

631
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,010
Watch your tone.

632
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,595
So?

633
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,680
Are you blaming me?

634
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,434
If you're using your brain,

635
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,019
you won't react like that.

636
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,981
Why? Is Miranda the only person
who can help you?

637
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,193
Think, don't just blabber.

638
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,595
Hello, Miss Ashley?

639
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,389
This is Sarah Banaag.

640
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,019
I've already thought about
what you told me.

641
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,106
Do you still want to help me?

642
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,318
Before Chito went to Palawan,

643
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,320
he left his truck here.

644
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,280
He never came back.

645
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,325
But is it true that Chito is wanted?

646
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,494
Is he the one who kidnapped Grace?

647
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,412
Why? Do you know anything?

648
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,915
Honestly, I don't.

649
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,416
But I won't be surprised

650
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,711
because Chito has always
had a short temper.

651
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,296
I thought he had changed.

652
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,215
He's hot-headed?

653
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,716
-He can hurt someone?
-Yes.

654
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,885
He's been into fights since he was a kid.

655
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:31,096
It's like he gets blinded by rage.

656
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,015
His father was the same.

657
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,810
-His father beat him up?
-Yes.

658
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,108
Did someone else use this aside from him?

659
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,694
No. He just left it like that.

660
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,905
-Okay. Thank you.
-I'll get going now, sir.

661
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:16,474
There's something I need you
to run a blood test on.

662
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,519
This is possible evidence
for Grace Banaag's case.

663
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,690
Hey, look!

664
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,401
-There's a cake.
-Let's go there.

665
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,404
What's that, kid?

666
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,614
Cake.

667
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,032
Is it yummy?

668
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,617
Do you want some?

669
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,118
Can we try it?

670
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,290
Me too. Let me try.

671
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,586
Mm! It's good!

672
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,632
It's delicious!

673
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,008
Why do you have a cake?

674
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,301
Ah.

675
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,011
It was my birthday yesterday.

676
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,305
Wait. What's your name?

677
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,431
Bright.

678
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,516
Happy birthday, Bright!

679
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,935
Thank you.

680
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,812
Ah, if you want more, I can get more.

681
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,731
We have a lot of food.

682
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,691
Uh, maybe later.

683
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,237
We need to go to school.

684
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,821
But thank you.

685
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,323
You're so nice.

686
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,201
When we get home later, let's play here.

687
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,536
Is your school nearby?

688
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,413
It's near, but also far.

689
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:24,626
When it's rainy or too sunny, it's far.

690
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,835
Want to come?

691
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,213
Okay. Go to school. See you later.

692
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,799
Okay. Bye. We'll get going.

693
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,884
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

694
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,720
The cake is so good.

695
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:37,681
I'm glad I got to try it.

696
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,516
Hey, wait up!

697
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,814
Let's go to school, guys!

698
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,194
Hey, kid!

699
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,280
Grace?

700
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,493
Grace!

701
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,496
Grace, it's time for a bath!

702
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,379
Grace!

703
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:14,718
What do you call a vast body of water

704
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,594
that is smaller than an ocean?

705
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,681
Sea. Ma'am!

706
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,391
Prince!

707
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,518
A sea, ma'am!

708
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,103
Correct!

709
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,606
You get five points for that.

710
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,735
And a candy. Ask it from me later, okay?

711
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,320
Next question.

712
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,905
Five times three?

713
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,283
Fifteen. Ma'am!

714
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:40,910
Jewel.

715
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,412
Fifteen, ma'am!

716
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,830
Very good!

717
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:44,998
Yes.

718
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,207
You get five points!

719
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,585
Five points for Jeffrey.

720
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,921
Okay, next question.

721
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:55,717
What do you call a baby frog?

722
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,636
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

723
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,804
Beth.

724
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:01,306
Mini frog, ma'am.

725
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,811
Wrong. Who else wants to answer?

726
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:09,606
-Ribbit, ma'am.
-Tadpole!

727
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,984
Tadpole!

728
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,404
Wait. Who was that?

729
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,823
That's the correct answer.

730
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,326
The correct answer is tadpole.

731
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,078
Who answered tadpole?

732
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,288
Who was it?

733
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:27,707
Grace.

734
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,001
Let's go.

735
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:33,880
Grace.

736
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,799
You know about our situation, right?

737
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,509
You disobeyed me again.

738
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,512
You know why we're hiding, don't you?

739
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,931
I just peeked.

740
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,600
No one saw me.

741
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:47,936
Grace, what if--

742
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,731
Besides, the kids look nice.

743
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:53,024
Nice?

744
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:54,609
What if they tell the police?

745
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:58,113
What if they do something bad to you?
What if someone recognizes you?

746
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,324
Are all people bad, Mama?

747
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:04,828
Mama Lucy, Julius, and Miss Miranda…

748
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,414
…they understand us.

749
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:11,000
They helped us
when they found out the truth.

750
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,711
Grace, not everyone is like them.

751
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,798
But not everyone
is dangerous either, right?

752
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,426
Not everyone is trustworthy.

753
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:24,806
How will we know who's kind
if we don't trust anyone?

754
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,517
How long do we have to keep running

755
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,019
and hiding?

756
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:40,321
I know it'll take a while
before we can get to Hong Kong.

757
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,616
I just miss doing the things I used to do.

758
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,288
Like going to school…

759
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,507
There are so many
houses here, so far from us.

760
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,885
There must be a lot of kids too.

761
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:06,306
That's why we need
to hurry, or we'll be late.

762
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,517
Late for what? Where are we going?

763
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,686
You'll see. We're almost there.

764
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:15,899
We're here!

765
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,233
Huh?

766
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:20,278
Why are we here?

767
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:23,448
You told me you wanted
to go to school, right?

768
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,533
I'm letting you now.

769
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,911
Isn't it dangerous?

770
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,788
What if someone sees me?

771
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:35,418
Don't worry, Miss Miranda
already spoke to the school.

772
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:38,338
They're letting you join,
even if it's just as a visitor.

773
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,716
She also said you're her relative.

774
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,510
Be careful, okay?

775
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,721
If anyone asks, just like before,

776
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,806
tell them… Bright.

777
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,517
Bright Sarmiento.

778
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,935
Sarmiento?

779
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,187
We have the same last name now?

780
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,316
Here. Sorry, it's all I could bring.

781
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,611
So that's why you brought my bag!

782
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,279
You're something else, Mama.

783
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,825
Thank you, Mama.

784
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:10,495
Oh, go on now, or you'll be late.

785
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,415
Here's your snacks.

786
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:18,002
When I find a job,
I'll buy you a uniform, okay?

787
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,129
Okay. Thank you, Mama.

788
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,881
Come here.

789
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,177
What's up, guys! Ashley Santillan here!

790
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,513
Wow, I missed you all.

791
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,307
Well, this is where I started,

792
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:33,935
Anyway, today is an important day

793
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,897
because I have someone
with me who trusts me

794
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:41,109
and is here to give us
nothing but the truth.

795
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:44,279
Ms. Sarah Banaag.

796
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,991
Good day.

797
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,411
Good day, Sarah. Uhm…

798
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,705
Let me get straight to the point.

799
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:57,917
Many people are saying you're involved

800
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,919
in your child's disappearance.

801
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,504
What can you say about that?

802
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,756
That's not true.

803
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:08,094
Would I be like this if I hurt my child?

804
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,388
I can't even eat…

805
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,683
or sleep anymore.

806
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,896
I've even accepted that I'm being

807
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,898
painted as the bad person because…

808
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,111
there was a video that many people saw,

809
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,406
showing me hurting Anna's mother.

810
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,202
But I wish they'd shown the full video.

811
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,123
It's unfair.

812
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,126
They don't know that
the only reason I acted that way

813
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,378
was that they were covering for Anna.

814
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,090
I'm certain my daughter is with Anna!

815
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,885
That's why I reacted that way.

816
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:54,891
Did you tell Miss Miranda about this?

817
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,812
Of course, I told her.

818
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,316
But she wouldn't listen to me.

819
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:06,486
She told me not to speak up--

820
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:14,410
she said the police might go after Anna.

821
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:15,536
Oh my god.

822
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,580
I see your struggles.

823
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,709
I see how hard you're
working to find your child.

824
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,002
I saw it, guys.

825
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,629
And you don't deserve this.

826
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,799
You don't deserve this injustice.

827
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,302
I think you deserve to know the truth.

828
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:36,391
What truth?

829
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:40,478
Miranda is covering for Anna

830
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:45,400
because Anna's ex
is the producer of Karamay,

831
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,986
Julius Hernandez.

832
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,992
I discovered this myself
when I went to Palawan.

833
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,496
I think it's very unethical,
right?

834
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,291
Because the person they're
protecting is a criminal.

835
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,502
That person? My gosh.

836
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:09,924
Everyone in their town knows
she killed her father.

837
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,010
Anna is the cause of her father's death.

838
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,100
What is she talking about?

839
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,811
Anna is the cause of Antonio's death?

840
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,193
You can't blame me.

841
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:32,822
Sometimes, it's the people you love
the most who break your trust.

842
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,907
Has anyone ever done that to you?

843
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:35,992
I have.

844
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,286
I broke his trust.

845
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,914
And I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

846
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,003
I'm more concerned about you.

847
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,131
Not only have they accused you
of being biased,

848
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,216
but your show's credibility was damaged

849
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,721
because of Julius's
past relationship with Anna.

850
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,099
This is a big problem, Miranda.

851
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,608
Hello, is this the head of HR?

852
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,109
This is Miranda Valdez.

853
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:12,612
Did you see what Ashley Santillan did?

854
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,114
Isn't that against her contract?

855
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,075
Good! Because I want you to revoke

856
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,621
all her security access to the building.
She's no longer welcome here.

857
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,915
And I want her fired!

858
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,210
I don't have an appointment!

859
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,628
This is urgent!

860
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,297
If you won't let me in, bring her out!

861
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,717
Tell her Helena is looking for her!

862
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,346
Are you looking for me?

863
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,598
Did you watch Sarah's interview?

864
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,434
She said all those things about Anna!

865
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,394
Why did you let that air?

866
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,563
That was a live interview
on social media.

867
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:48,898
I had no control over it.

868
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,399
I already fired Ashley.

869
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,026
For what?

870
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,029
It's too late, she's already ruined Anna!

871
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,907
Tell me, what really happened to Antonio?

872
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,992
Why is Anna being blamed?

873
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:02,995
It was an accident.

874
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,501
Then why does Anna feel like
it's her fault?

875
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:12,797
What do you know about what Anna feels?

876
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,301
You know where she is.

877
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,601
Where is she?

878
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,186
I won't tell you anything.

879
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,107
What is this, Miranda?

880
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,485
Are you punishing me?

881
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:39,407
Are you keeping my own daughter from me?

882
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,410
You kept her entire life
with you from me, Helena,

883
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,995
so don't lecture me!

884
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:45,830
A mother?

885
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,915
Were you even a good mother to her?

886
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:59,093
What non-disparagement?

887
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,013
Honey, is there really nothing you can do?

888
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,598
I wouldn't even be doing this

889
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,518
if you'd given me
the show you promised me.

890
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:10,021
Fine!

891
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,981
I'll move to another network!

892
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,233
What non-compete?

893
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:15,401
Go ahead and sue me!

894
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,613
I'll expose everything
I know to my followers.

895
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,699
What non-disclosure?

896
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,284
I trusted you!

897
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,913
I don't even remember
signing those papers!

898
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,081
Non-non your face!

899
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,501
I'm sorry.

900
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:35,212
Looks like I've caused you more trouble.

901
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,424
They're really trying to silence us.

902
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,385
And this only proves you're right, Sarah.

903
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,305
They want to ruin lives?

904
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,474
Fine, that's exactly what I'll give them.

905
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,395
Look, Anna, don't dwell
too much on what you saw.

906
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,397
We'll find a way to fix it.

907
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,859
You know, if it were just me, it's easy.

908
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:01,113
I'm used to people trying to ruin me.

909
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,324
But Miss Miranda… even you…

910
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,909
you've been dragged into this.

911
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,410
We're used to this.

912
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,122
It's part of our job.

913
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,917
But you and Miss Miranda
still got dragged in.

914
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,503
I can't live like this--

915
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,796
Grace and I can't.

916
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,299
I promised Grace a better life.

917
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:21,717
A normal life.

918
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:26,097
Sure, here she's experiencing
a normal life,

919
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,434
but as long as we're in the Philippines,

920
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,436
we'll always live in fear.

921
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,688
What's your plan?

922
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,860
I'm going to push my plan
of going to Hong Kong.

923
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,613
I'll apply for a research grant.

924
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,118
There, I can give Grace a peaceful life.

925
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,412
There, her life will be better.

926
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:50,705
Are you sure about this?

927
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,586
No matter what I do,
I know I'll end up in jail.

928
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,089
I've committed a crime.

929
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,510
I know it'll be hard
for Grace to accept, but…

930
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,304
I have to do it.

931
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,598
Julius…

932
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,228
I need your help.

933
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,312
What kind of help?

934
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,315
I need to get papers for Grace

935
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,485
so she can leave the country.

936
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:24,363
Julius, I know I've already
asked so much from you, but…

937
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,702
for the last time,
I'm asking for your help.

938
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:30,786
Well, Anna…

939
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,708
this can't be the last time.

940
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,334
What do you mean?

941
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,587
I'll help you with the papers you need…

942
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,590
but I'm coming with you.

943
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,680
I saw your livestream earlier.

944
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,310
That's why I love you,
you're so good at crying.

945
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,686
Like an actress.

946
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,605
Hand over your talent fee.

947
00:55:58,314 --> 00:55:59,523
Oh, come on.

948
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,817
Are you still thinking
about money even now?

949
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,487
Why not? Huh?

950
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,989
I'm starving here.

951
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:10,159
I can't work, in case you're forgetting,
I'm a wanted man.

952
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:13,204
Fine, fine. I'll find a job.

953
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,706
There you go.

954
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,709
But did all that crying on the
livestream get you anywhere?

955
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:23,506
Any news about Grace?

956
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,299
I've been thinking…

957
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,219
about when Miranda started
acting differently towards me.

958
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,888
Wasn't it after your last interview
with her?

959
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,598
When Anna disappeared…

960
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,018
Miss Miranda also went missing
for a few days.

961
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,479
Her daughter was looking for her.

962
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,899
Do you think Miss Miranda is hiding Anna?

963
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,277
Ms. Miranda?

964
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,197
Miss Miranda, just a moment!

965
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,698
Please wait!

966
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,785
Miss Miranda, can I talk to you?

967
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,621
I'm on my way to something
important, Sarah.

968
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,415
Next time, I'd appreciate it
if you'd call first

969
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,209
or book an appointment.

970
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,294
Please, Miss Miranda…

971
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,922
I understand that you're angry.

972
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:08,217
I can't blame you because
what I did was wrong.

973
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,219
I'm sorry.

974
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,014
Ashley said all sorts of things
that made me believe her.

975
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:16,100
I can accept your apology.

976
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:19,103
But I need to trust you again.

977
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,523
Yes, of course!

978
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,900
If you want…

979
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:27,444
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

980
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,904
We'll set up an interview.

981
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:32,032
We'll discuss everything
that's happened recently.

982
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,200
An interview?

983
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,411
Sure!

984
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,413
If you want, we can do it right now.

985
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:40,291
I'll have someone call you.
For now, I need to leave.

986
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:10,696
Miss Miranda, I'm sorry
about the news that came out.

987
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,698
I didn't mean for you to get dragged.

988
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:18,204
You shouldn't have had
to go through all this, Anna.

989
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,108
Are we leaving now?

990
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,610
Yes, you're going to Hong Kong.

991
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:33,529
What did you do to Anna?

992
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,030
It's too late, Mom!

993
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,700
They've already made fake papers
for Grace!

994
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,661
The police know their location,
she's about to get caught!

995
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,620
There are police!

996
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,622
Why do you care so much about Anna?

997
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,708
I don't understand you anymore!

998
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,918
Because Anna is my daughter!

999
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,295
She's your sister!

1000
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,506
Mama?

1001
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,383
Grace, dear!
