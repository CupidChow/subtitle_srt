1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,712
-Where is Grace?!
-Sarah!

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,506
-Ow! That hurts!
-I told you she's not here!

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,802
If you have a problem with Anna,
leave us out of it!

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,513
How? You're her family.

5
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,307
She's not our family
because she's only adopted.

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,810
A couple adopted her.

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,730
Helena and Antonio Sarmiento.

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,816
They named her Anna Grace Sarmiento.

9
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,861
How could you help a mother

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,904
who made her daughter's life miserable?

11
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,407
If you were given the chance,

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,617
would you like to meet your real mother?

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,494
No.

14
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,582
Anna, wait.

15
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,003
Why? Do you need anything else?

16
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,716
I just want to say thank you.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,719
For sharing your side.

18
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:58,100
Did something happen? You sound different.

19
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:02,521
Weren't you just hell-bent
on proving I'm the kidnapper?

20
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:08,110
I need to look into every
possible angle of Grace's story,

21
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,489
so it is important
that I hear your side too.

22
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,617
I've done what you wanted.

23
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,411
I hope I've set things straight.

24
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,205
When will I see you again?

25
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,416
I-I mean…

26
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,294
For follow-up interviews.

27
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,715
I already said everything I needed to say.

28
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,510
So, I hope this will be
the last time we meet.

29
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,181
Oh, you're still here?

30
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,683
That was a good interview.

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,894
Goodbye.

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,286
She'll be here any minute.
We can finally catch her.

33
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:02,915
Oh.

34
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,000
There she is.

35
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,002
Anna Sarmiento?

36
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,839
That's me.

37
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,091
Can you come with us to the precinct?

38
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,099
Um…

39
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,519
Gentlemen, you don't have
to do this for me.

40
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:06,729
It's too much.

41
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,023
Miranda, you've earned it!

42
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,734
That interview is a game changer.

43
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,404
Despite calling her out,
she still agreed to it.

44
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,324
Nobody can question your credibility.

45
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,910
You've only dropped the teaser,

46
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,120
yet social media is already abuzz.

47
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,332
You've taken us to
a whole new level Miranda!

48
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,918
You deserve all our congratulations!

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,129
Thank you.

50
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
-Good job.
-Good night, gentlemen.

51
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,600
"The police has taken Anna."

52
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,313
Mom.

53
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,107
Are you okay?

54
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,196
I think I'm just tired, dear.

55
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,823
I just need to rest.

56
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,991
Okay.

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,119
Have a good rest.

58
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,704
Okay. Thank you.

59
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,081
Good night.

60
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,821
What are you watching?

61
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,698
The rough edit of Anna's interview.

62
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,700
It's like Miranda felt sorry for her.

63
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,828
She should've grilled Anna
until she confessed.

64
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,497
But no, Miranda let her explain.

65
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,917
I can't air it like this.

66
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,920
It's too soft. It's too sympathetic.

67
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,923
Then let the management
chew her out for it.

68
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,800
Maybe she'll finally get booted.

69
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,512
You're forgetting I'm the management.

70
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,224
We have a lot of sponsors
for this episode.

71
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
I can't let it fail.

72
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,811
If it fails, that's on you.

73
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,106
Because you keep investing in her.

74
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,399
But you know what?

75
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,317
I'm on to something recently.

76
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:23,323
I found out that Miranda had
an orphanage investigated.

77
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,700
How strange.

78
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,829
I told you, she's hiding something nasty.

79
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,998
Don't antagonize her now.

80
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,791
Oh, I'm not!

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,918
But you...

82
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,130
Didn't you say you're the management?

83
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:43,385
So, you can have that episode
edited however you want.

84
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,683
Mom.

85
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,518
-Look.
-Hi.

86
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,229
Your interview with Anna
is already airing.

87
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,231
…you kidnapped her, right?

88
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,900
You can't blame me.

89
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,028
She's such a caring child.

90
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,529
That kid is the kindest.

91
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,406
If you haven't found out yet,

92
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,824
I'm just adopted.

93
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,701
Grace saw how lonely I was.

94
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,453
She wanted to make me happy.

95
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,871
You don't have to do this.

96
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,207
Grace's mother, Sarah…

97
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,793
People like her…

98
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,712
are unfit to be a mother.

99
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,006
That wasn't in the interview!

100
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,221
Tommy, what happened?

101
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,098
I don't know, Miss Miranda.

102
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,100
That edit didn't go through our staff.

103
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,936
We heard someone from
the management had it edited

104
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,189
to make Anna look guilty so that
more people will talk about it.

105
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,733
They can't… They can't do this!

106
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,529
No! That's not true!
Those manipulative jerks!

107
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,115
-They can't do this to Anna!
-Mom!

108
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,410
They just twisted my words
in the interview.

109
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,204
That's not what I said.

110
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,331
That's hard to believe.

111
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,292
You think Ms. Miranda Valdez
would lie to the people?

112
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,420
If I wanted to confess
about kidnapping Grace,

113
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,464
why would I bother getting interviewed?

114
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,424
I could've gone straight here.

115
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,135
There are many possible reasons.

116
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,137
Perhaps you wanted attention or fame?

117
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,931
-Many criminals are like that.
-I'm not a criminal.

118
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,933
Whatever I said in that interview,

119
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,519
I said it for my family's sake.

120
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,229
She just twisted my words.

121
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,814
You think I'd believe you?

122
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,732
Call her over so we can talk.

123
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,901
Not before you answer my questions.

124
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,319
Forever Loved Orphanage.

125
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,822
That's where we found
some of Grace's belongings.

126
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,700
We suspect the kidnapper hid her there.

127
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,619
Weren't you from that same orphanage?

128
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:38,000
That's where Helena and Antonio
Sarmiento adopted you.

129
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,711
You had history with that orphanage.

130
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,296
Now, explain that.

131
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,884
What? Cat got your tongue?

132
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,595
Can't come up with an excuse?

133
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,724
Give it up, Anna.
We've talked to Grandma Lucia.

134
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,017
She already confessed.

135
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,311
I suggest you do the same

136
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,730
if you don't want the old lady
to get sued.

137
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,814
Fess up!

138
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,525
Anna, you don't have
to answer his questions.

139
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,110
What are you doing here?

140
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,029
I brought her lawyer.

141
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,697
We'll get you out of here.

142
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,282
She can't leave.

143
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,994
We're detaining her for 12 hours
to answer our questions.

144
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,415
If I were you, I'd fess up now
because I won't stop.

145
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,502
This is the day
everyone learns the whole truth.

146
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,799
Sarah.

147
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,927
What happened?
Where's that Anna?

148
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,136
She's already inside.

149
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,513
Oscar is interrogating her as we speak.

150
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,808
Did I watch that right?

151
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,603
She admitted to kidnapping Grace?

152
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,898
She didn't say it outright.

153
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,610
But the show made her seem guilty.

154
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,820
Miss Miranda's amazing, isn't she?

155
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,908
I'm so excited to see Anna locked up.

156
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,118
I can finally get my daughter back.

157
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,203
Come here.

158
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,287
Why?

159
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,414
Listen carefully.

160
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,917
We need to further destroy Anna's image.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,918
Do you understand?

162
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,086
What for?

163
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,129
-Sarah…
-Yeah?

164
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,715
We just paid off our debts, remember?

165
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,926
Tsk! Come on now, Chito.

166
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,429
Those are your debts.
I had nothing to do with them.

167
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,307
Hey, what are you saying?
We're in this together, right?

168
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,310
And we're running out of cash.
We barely have any left.

169
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,603
We need more.

170
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,730
What? How did that happen?

171
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,525
You still have the jewelry.
Just sell those.

172
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,111
I already did and that money's gone too.

173
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,029
So, here's what we should do.

174
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,700
Let's make more money out
of Grace before we get her back.

175
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,536
To do that, let's use Anna.

176
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,788
I don't get what you're saying at all.

177
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,707
Just leave it to me.

178
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,004
There's nothing you can do, Miranda.

179
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,007
The episode has already aired.
Many people have watched it.

180
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,717
You can't take that back.

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,927
Th-Then issue a statement!

182
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,804
Let's say we made a mistake.

183
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,433
Say we'll… Say we'll post
the unedited version online!

184
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,518
I'm just your manager.

185
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,937
It's Julius you should talk to about this.

186
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,315
I already fired Julius.

187
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,399
What?

188
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,610
Maybe I should go straight
to the management.

189
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:11,820
Relax, Miranda.

190
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,406
Tell me what exactly is the problem.

191
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,118
Why don't you want
that Anna to look guilty?

192
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,704
I'm just standing up for the truth.

193
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,207
You're saying you want the truth?

194
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,711
Miranda, think about the management too.

195
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,297
Because your version could stir things up.

196
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,091
Maybe they're just playing safe.

197
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,927
Carmen, I became a journalist

198
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,013
to challenge people, not to coddle them.

199
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,849
I want viewers to see my work
as a reflection of society

200
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,851
even if they don't like what they see.

201
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,312
Karamay is a public service program.

202
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,022
We don't just help people.

203
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,107
We open their eyes.

204
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,735
And now you want to open their eyes

205
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,030
to the possibility that
Anna was wrongly accused.

206
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,114
Is that right?

207
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,034
Yes, and I want names, Carmen.

208
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,119
I want to know who exactly was it

209
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,080
that decided to mess with my episode!

210
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,374
And if there's anyone
tampering with my work,

211
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,000
I need to know!

212
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,418
I'll do what I can.

213
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,129
But I also have to tell you

214
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,006
that the management just called me.

215
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,468
They were so impressed by the episode.

216
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,179
You know what? They're even
thinking of promoting you

217
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,598
to be the head of the news department.

218
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,684
Isn't that your goal all along?

219
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,897
But if you're going to make
an issue out of this episode,

220
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,024
forget everything I just said.

221
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,486
They'll surely take back their offer.

222
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,495
Mom, someone's looking for you.

223
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,932
Good thing you came here.

224
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,309
I was planning to go to you.

225
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,437
My daughter trusted you!

226
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,230
How could you betray her?

227
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,983
Anna is not your daughter! She's mine!

228
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,489
What are you talking about?

229
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,617
How did Anna become your daughter?

230
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,246
You and Antonio stole her from me.

231
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,125
"Stole?"

232
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,210
I stole her?

233
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,629
What are you talking about?

234
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,715
Anna came from the orphanage.

235
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,719
Besides, you're Miranda Valdez
for goodness' sake!

236
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,513
There's no way you would
abandon your daughter

237
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,724
and put her up for adoption.

238
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,892
That's impossible!

239
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,144
I had an investigator
do a background check.

240
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,314
Well, that investigator is wrong!

241
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,735
I'll have us take a DNA test.

242
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,237
Don't you dare come near my daughter!

243
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,198
You said that Anna isn't my daughter.

244
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,783
Why do you seem threatened?

245
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,831
Tell me the truth.

246
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:13,210
How could you do this to me?

247
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,921
What did I do wrong to you?

248
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,299
Isn't it enough that you took
Antonio from me

249
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,510
that you had to take my daughter too?

250
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,804
I didn't take Antonio from you!

251
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,017
He chose me.

252
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,727
You and your delusions!

253
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,729
I saw your marriage certificate!

254
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,898
You only got married after I gave birth.

255
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,317
You lied when I called Antonio.

256
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,402
You said you were married!

257
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,405
I don't know recall that.
I don't remember.

258
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,824
Maybe you'll remember if I slap you again.

259
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,786
Go ahead! Do it!

260
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,829
I dare you!

261
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,206
Go make a scene here!

262
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,917
That way, everyone will know your secret!

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,921
Go tell everyone that you have
an illegitimate child!

264
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,798
Is that what you want? Go ahead!

265
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,093
So, you admit that Anna is my daughter.

266
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,601
She's not your daughter!

267
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:16,106
You gave birth to her,
but she's my daughter!

268
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,609
I took care of her and raised her!

269
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:24,406
You have no right to Anna
because you gave her away!

270
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,616
I didn't give her away.

271
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:31,496
You don't know what I went through.

272
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,000
I've always known Antonio
can't be trusted!

273
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,336
I told you that he's useless
and a deadbeat!

274
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,005
He won't do you any good!

275
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,881
But you didn't listen to me!

276
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,801
He made you a mistress
and knocked you up!

277
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,136
Stop it, Pa!

278
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,096
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,893
I won't let that ruin your life!

280
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,898
Get rid of that child!

281
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,913
Are you sure about this?

282
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,584
Okay, I'll get the tools ready.

283
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,919
Please wear this.

284
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,595
I can't do this.

285
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,890
Hey! Miss!

286
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:43,026
Are you sure you don't want to
know where we're taking her?

287
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,904
It's best that I don't know.

288
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,787
She won't live a peaceful life…

289
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,916
if she's with me.

290
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,129
She won't be happy.

291
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,216
I'd rather have her be with another family

292
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,303
who can give her a good life.

293
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,516
We need to leave.
It's going to be a long trip.

294
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,436
We'll go now, dear.

295
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,397
Wait.

296
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,207
You know what I realized?

297
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,584
This is all your fault!

298
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,129
If you hadn't lied to me,

299
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,716
I would've had the chance to
tell Antonio I was pregnant.

300
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,928
He could've helped me raise Anna.

301
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,722
But that's not what happened.

302
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,682
You're a snake!

303
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,228
I gave up my daughter because of you,

304
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,313
and now you stole her from me?

305
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,816
I didn't steal her!

306
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,527
Antonio forced me to adopt

307
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,113
because I couldn't bear a child.

308
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,906
I was against it.

309
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,118
We found her in the orphanage.

310
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:20,999
Antonio made me take your
illegitimate child as my own!

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,501
-All that hate…
-Tell me.

312
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,589
Did you honestly think
I wanted that, Miranda?

313
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,009
All that hate…

314
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:35,430
I cannot imagine the hardships
you gave to my daughter.

315
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,098
Despite everything,

316
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:45,315
I never made Anna feel my hatred

317
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,735
toward you and Antonio.

318
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:54,908
Why would I believe
a liar and thief like you?

319
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,118
I need to talk to Anna.

320
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,204
I'll tell my daughter the truth!

321
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,580
What for?

322
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,334
So she'll recognize you as her mother

323
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,127
and get her back?

324
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,214
You can't just suddenly act as her mother.

325
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,508
It's too late, Miranda.

326
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,718
It's no use.

327
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:17,680
Especially now that you're
accusing her a criminal!

328
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,184
You've lost your rights to her!

329
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,395
She will hate you, Miranda.

330
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:31,319
You're a useless person
and a useless mother!

331
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,238
And we'll fight to the death

332
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,323
if you come near my daughter

333
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,825
and take her from me!

334
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,619
Auntie, Julius called.

335
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,912
It's Anna.

336
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,205
What happened?

337
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,708
We went to the address
that Atty. Valdez gave us,

338
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,502
but Grace wasn't there.

339
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,712
They must have taken her somewhere else.

340
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,422
Oh, here they are.

341
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,884
Well? Are you going to give me
back my daughter or not?

342
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,306
-You bitch!
-Ma'am.

343
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,101
You're really testing my patience!

344
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,103
If you want trouble, I'll fight back!

345
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,438
So you're tough now, huh?

346
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,400
Mrs. Banaag, you can't just accuse her.

347
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,110
You have no evidence.

348
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,319
You want evidence?

349
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,031
There they are.

350
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,408
There's Attorney.

351
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,411
She has the evidence you want.

352
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,704
Anna.

353
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,998
It's good you're here.

354
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,001
Sir Jimenez told me to get the evidence

355
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,420
that you have against Anna.

356
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,506
You found something
that belongs to Grace, right?

357
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,303
Um…

358
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,638
I lost it.

359
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:41,598
Mom.

360
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,099
I don't know what happened.

361
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,436
People came in and out of the room.

362
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,398
I'm not sure if it got misplaced
or if someone took it.

363
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,901
But Anna already explained everything.

364
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,111
Grace had it before she went missing.

365
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,781
What's with you?

366
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,618
Don't you believe me anymore?

367
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,621
I will call my staff to give you

368
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,414
a copy of my interview with Anna.

369
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,333
You'll find the details there.

370
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,919
Don't believe what you saw on TV.

371
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,187
Auntie.

372
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,106
They said they'll release Anna.

373
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,734
Thank goodness! I was really worried.

374
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,111
I thought they had evidence against Anna.

375
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,613
Good thing they don't.

376
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,115
Well, Anna is her daughter

377
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,284
so Miss Miranda changed her mind.

378
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:49,290
Charlie, how did you know that?

379
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,002
I heard your conversation earlier, Auntie.

380
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,881
Charlie, please…

381
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,217
I'm begging you.

382
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,010
Don't worry, Auntie.

383
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,388
I won't tell anyone.

384
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,602
But are you really not going to tell Anna?

385
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,314
Miss Miranda can help Anna with her case.

386
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,400
She doesn't need Miranda.

387
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,320
I know Anna can get through this

388
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,698
without asking for Miranda's help.

389
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,410
You can't hide the truth forever, Auntie.

390
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:29,414
Miss Miranda already knows
that Anna is her daughter.

391
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,500
She'll find ways to gain her trust.

392
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,169
Maybe they'll patch things up.

393
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,713
No.

394
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,007
They can't be together.

395
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,801
Why, Auntie?

396
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,638
Why don't you want them
to talk to each other

397
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,390
and sort things out?

398
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,311
Are you hiding something else, Auntie?

399
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,026
Why did you say that, Mom?

400
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,902
Why did you lie?

401
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,822
She can't go to jail, Jess.

402
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,906
Why?

403
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,036
My conscience wouldn't be able to take it.

404
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,788
Does that mean you believe she's innocent?

405
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,499
What happened to you?

406
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,795
Of all people, you should be
the last person to believe her.

407
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,214
She's lying, Mom!

408
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:25,803
Jess…

409
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,514
Just trust me on this.

410
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:29,807
Please.

411
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,186
Just do this for me.

412
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:35,980
Okay?

413
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,692
I don't know what Anna has

414
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,988
for Julius to take her side.

415
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,410
And now you too?

416
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,083
Jess…

417
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,245
Hello?

418
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,455
You need to go back to Manila now.

419
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,124
I've found out

420
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,917
who tampered with your episode.

421
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,585
Okay.

422
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,382
Anna.

423
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,219
I only have one request.

424
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,891
I hope you've learned your lesson.

425
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,814
Don't ever go near Miranda again.

426
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,408
Have you seen a fair-skinned girl?

427
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,409
-Hey!
-Be quiet!

428
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:12,535
Where? Over here?

429
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,786
Hurry up.

430
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,874
Have you seen a girl running around here?

431
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,001
She went that way.

432
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,336
-Huh? She's not there.
-Over there.

433
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,880
Let's go! Hurry!

434
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,889
Hey, Erin.

435
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,266
Why are they looking for you?

436
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,935
Because I threw rocks at them.

437
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,520
Why'd you do that?

438
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,522
They're gossips.

439
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,317
They believe Miranda's interview.

440
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,111
They were saying bad things about Anna.

441
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,030
She's not that kind of person.

442
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,489
Idiots.

443
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,367
You sound like you're ready to fight.

444
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,911
Do you know her?

445
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,122
I don't think anyone here
hasn't heard about her.

446
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:04,795
So, you know that she's my sister?

447
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,381
Why are you even talking to me?

448
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,218
Why wouldn't I talk to you?

449
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,805
Because Anna is my sister.

450
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,016
We're a family of kidnappers.

451
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,976
That's what my classmates say.

452
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,605
Why would you let them get to you?
It's not true, right?

453
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,315
That your sister's a kidnapper?

454
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,109
Kidnapper or not,

455
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,403
I know that my sister's a good person.

456
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,447
Let's go.

457
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,827
I feel like I was blindsided
by the episode.

458
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,205
And I learned that it was management

459
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,999
who had that episode edited.

460
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,210
I'm the one who ordered it, Miranda.

461
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,211
So you're welcome.

462
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,006
This is your highest-rated episode yet.

463
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,679
I'm sure you're thinking
about the show's success.

464
00:25:56,097 --> 00:26:00,309
But is it really my success
if you manipulated the episode?

465
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,897
You know very well that it's
part of the management's job

466
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,607
to make decisions like that.

467
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:10,611
So I don't understand why you're
making it seem like a bad thing.

468
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,531
Are you unhappy, Miranda? Is that it?

469
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:18,202
Let me remind you that your
non-compete is ironclad.

470
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,290
You want creative control?

471
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,710
We've discussed that with your manager.

472
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,086
We will give you that.

473
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,633
That's a draft
for the renewal of your contract.

474
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,926
Go through it.

475
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,637
I'm sure you'll find it satisfactory.

476
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,681
I think Carmen will.

477
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,685
Stock options

478
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,814
and a promotion
to head our News Department.

479
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,403
You've really proven yourself, Miranda.

480
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,822
We all thought you've stagnated.

481
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,326
But with this whole Grace Banaag saga,

482
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:02,079
you have proven why you are
a legend in this industry.

483
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,834
And the Asian Essense Awards
also called me.

484
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,212
You will be given a
lifetime achievement award.

485
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:14,300
You're the youngest person
to receive such an award.

486
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,219
Wow, Miranda, congratulations!

487
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:21,724
You know, we're all curious
about what will happen next.

488
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:26,312
When do you think will
Sarah and her daughter reunite?

489
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,511
You know, my fortune-teller was right!

490
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:03,307
Didn't he say this will be
your best year ever?

491
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,436
Hey.

492
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,313
What's wrong?

493
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,690
Well…

494
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,694
I did the most…

495
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,408
terrible thing, Carmen.

496
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,119
I don't understand, Miranda.

497
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:27,832
I ruined my own daughter's life.

498
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:28,916
Huh?

499
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,421
It's…

500
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,507
It's Anna.

501
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,887
Anna is the person we've been looking for.

502
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,808
My daughter.

503
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,981
But I can't tell her the truth.

504
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,903
Because she'll hate me.

505
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,198
Anna…

506
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,617
Anna...

507
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,579
It's Anna.

508
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,207
Anna is my daughter.

509
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,419
Anna's the one I've been looking for.

510
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,004
My daughter…

511
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,507
Carmen! It's Anna…

512
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,301
She's my daughter.

513
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:24,138
She's the one I've been
looking for, Carmen!

514
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,516
She's the one I've been looking for!

515
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,726
Oh my god.

516
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,813
It's Anna! It's her!

517
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,900
She's the one I've been
looking for, Carmen!

518
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,861
How can I tell her?

519
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,697
It's Anna…

520
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:46,494
Oh my God! Turns out Anna is my daughter!

521
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,914
Miss Miranda did that?

522
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,415
She withdrew evidence?

523
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,502
I don't understand my mom anymore.

524
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,382
It's like she believes
a stranger more than me.

525
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,219
Even when I'm helping her…

526
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,097
it's never enough.

527
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,807
You're enough, Jess.

528
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,310
You're just thinking that
because you keep trying

529
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,853
to fill someone else's place.

530
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,146
Ever since you're young,

531
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,649
you've been telling me
about your missing sister.

532
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,983
Am I not enough?

533
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,987
Why does she have
to look for someone else?

534
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,991
I'm doing everything I can
to make up for her absence.

535
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,036
I know your mom appreciates that.

536
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,704
But the sad truth is…

537
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,624
that space in your mom's heart
will always belong to her.

538
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,795
And you're making yourself small
to fill that space?

539
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,214
You can't fill it.

540
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,010
Your worth isn't defined
by people's expectations

541
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:48,389
but by yourself, by who you really are.

542
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:03,821
Hello?

543
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,197
Miranda Valdez.

544
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,908
I have Grace now.

545
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,201
Who's this?

546
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,120
How did you know my number?

547
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,332
Give me 5 million if you
want to see this kid alive.

548
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,001
Hello? Hello?

549
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,276
Mr. Jimenez, what are you doing there?

550
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:43,986
Uh…

551
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,281
I'm just looking for something.

552
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,908
I have answered all of your questions.

553
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,827
How long will you keep following me?

554
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,413
Until we find Grace.

555
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,206
Or have you found her already?

556
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,214
Hello?

557
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,591
When did this happen?

558
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:07,885
Just now?

559
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,180
Impossible.

560
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,515
Alright. I'll call you back.

561
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,519
What is it?

562
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,229
Who's demanding ransom?

563
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,731
I don't know.

564
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,609
Mr. Jimenez didn't tell me much detail.

565
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,736
Where's Grace?

566
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,071
She's in the room.

567
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,116
It seems that someone took
advantage of the situation.

568
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,327
But wouldn't this be better for you?

569
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,121
This could get rid of
all their suspicions about you.

570
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,414
No. I don't know.

571
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

572
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,880
"Miranda Valdez"

573
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:49,802
Hello?

574
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,637
Listen.

575
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,014
There is an old bridge
in Fabellon, Mangubat.

576
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,933
Mangubat? In Palawan?

577
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,602
Bring the money to the bridge at five.

578
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,397
Don't you dare take the police with you

579
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,607
if you want to see Grace alive.

580
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,488
Chito, what are you doing?

581
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,116
I'm securing us a wealthy life.

582
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,618
We can also get revenge, Sarah.

583
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,995
No one's on our side now.

584
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,999
Didn't you say Miranda lied
about the evidence?

585
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,922
She's no longer on your side, Sarah.

586
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,716
She's on Anna's side now.

587
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,926
But if my plan succeeds,

588
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,513
they'll suspect Anna again.

589
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,724
Why do you think

590
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,894
I told her to bring the money here?

591
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,315
I'm your only ally now, Sarah.

592
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,693
Until the end.

593
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,906
I hope you trust my plans.

594
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,283
Trust me.

595
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,413
Of course!

596
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,082
Of course.

597
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:06,128
We really need to pressure Anna,

598
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,505
she needs tell us where my daughter is.

599
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,382
Alright.

600
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,121
Hello?

601
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,290
I'll give you what you want.

602
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,418
Who's this?

603
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:50,130
Let's meet at five o'clock
at Malbado Beach.

604
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,508
It's a closed beach in Mangubat.

605
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,137
They're demanding ransom?

606
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,097
Sir Jimenez and I have a plan.

607
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,516
It will be an entrapment.

608
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,435
We need to find out who's behind this.

609
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,020
Please charter me a flight.

610
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,314
The operation will be executed in Palawan.

611
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,107
In Palawan?

612
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,110
So, does that mean Anna's behind it?

613
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,403
No.

614
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,489
It cannot be her.

615
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,201
You're going back to Palawan?

616
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:20,994
I'll go with you.

617
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,687
Why are you alone?

618
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:50,399
Grandma had to do something.

619
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,987
Aren't you bored being alone all the time?

620
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,531
Not really.

621
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,907
I'm used to it.

622
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,288
Where did you and my sister
go when you went out?

623
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,791
We went to the beach.

624
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,211
Would you like us to go there now?

625
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:12,504
We can?

626
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,798
Do you know what sea turtles are?

627
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,426
They're like tortoises.

628
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,511
I think it's their nesting season now.

629
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,221
Want to check it out?

630
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:22,514
Really?

631
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,392
Yeah, I'll text Anna
to ask for her permission.

632
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,613
Oh! She said yes!

633
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,615
So, let's go? Come on!

634
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,703
-Wait.
-Hm?

635
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,289
Is it okay for us to go out?

636
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,709
It's okay since I'm with you.

637
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,088
Let's go?

638
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,884
Let's go. Let's take your stuff.

639
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,180
Come on.

640
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:09,811
Grace.

641
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,816
Grace?

642
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,110
Grace!

643
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,405
Grace is missing.

644
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:21,907
What's going on?

645
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,408
Mama, Grace is missing.

646
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,409
Anna?

647
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,786
Anna! Anna, it's Grace.

648
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,204
Why? What happened to her?

649
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,122
She left with Princess.

650
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,791
What? Where did they go?

651
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,460
I tried to chase them,
but they're already on board.

652
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,712
I heard them talking about sea turtles.

653
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,215
Come on, let's follow them.

654
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,925
Where could they have gone?

655
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,302
I think I know a place.

656
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,599
Princess is still not picking up.

657
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,893
Let's look for them separately.

658
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,398
Princess.

659
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,483
Princess!

660
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:04,116
Auntie. Auntie. Auntie.

661
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,409
Grandma is calling.

662
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,119
Aren't you going answer her?

663
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,287
Uh… I'll call her back later.

664
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,291
Auntie…

665
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,919
Where are the sea turtles?

666
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,507
Uh… let's just wait
for them here, okay?

667
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,802
Play over there for now,
but don't go too far.

668
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,889
Auntie…

669
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,227
Can you tell Mama to come here too

670
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,396
so that we can have fun together?

671
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,314
Okay, okay. I'll tell them.

672
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,817
Now play over there and stop bothering me.

673
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,002
Mom.

674
00:38:58,795 --> 00:38:59,755
Mom?

675
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:18,815
Jessica.

676
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,193
Uncle.

677
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,320
What are you doing here?

678
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,530
I'm looking for Julius.

679
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:28,617
I've been calling him,
but he's not answering my calls.

680
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,619
I was hoping you were together.

681
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,205
No, we're not.

682
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,709
But I'm sure…

683
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,712
he's with Anna, the kidnapper.

684
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,590
Last time I heard, she's still a suspect.

685
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,133
But she's guilty.

686
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,803
I just fear that Julius is helping her.

687
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,181
And I have evidence to prove it.

688
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,404
I kept my end of the deal.

689
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,198
The police aren't with me.

690
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,784
I won't put the child's life in danger.

691
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,078
You're obedient.

692
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:14,746
Alright.

693
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,290
Throw the bag near the bridge and leave.

694
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,417
What about Grace?

695
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,920
There is a small house
on the side of the bridge.

696
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,380
Grace is there.

697
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,715
But my friend is there too.

698
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,843
So if you don't throw that money,

699
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,594
the girl will be dead.

700
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:52,993
Negative.

701
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:12,888
Chito!

702
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,102
Princess.

703
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,359
Princess!

704
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,908
Princess.

705
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,498
Princess!

706
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,293
Auntie.

707
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,795
Let's go home now.

708
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,798
I've talked to your mom.

709
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,800
They're on their way here.

710
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,219
Which…

711
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,096
Which mom are you talking about?

712
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,689
Grace.

713
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,316
Grace?

714
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,818
Grace!

715
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,528
-Grace!
-Hey!

716
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:13,031
Who are you?
What are you doing to my child?

717
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,282
Hey, who are you?

718
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,201
What are you doing to my child, huh?

719
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,702
Who are you?

720
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,496
Why are you touching my child?

721
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,206
My dear! Are you okay?

722
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,666
Sorry, Grace.

723
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,335
You and Anna brought a lot of trouble
to our family.

724
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,795
You need to go home now.

725
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,213
Come here!

726
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,006
-I'm taking you back!
-Auntie, no!

727
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,133
Please don't do this!

728
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,010
-No!
-Stop resisting!

729
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:36,012
-Let go of her!
-Please!

730
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,389
-Grandma!
-Ma!

731
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,518
Princess, what are you doing?

732
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,020
We already talked about this, didn't we?

733
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:46,898
We're not going to tell on Anna!

734
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,734
I wasn't planning to tell on her!

735
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,820
I was only talking to Sarah!

736
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:55,782
Did you really think
she wouldn't tell the cops?

737
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,035
I'll talk to her!

738
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,830
I'll tell her to leave us out of this!

739
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,332
What will your sister say?

740
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,710
You'll only push Anna
further away from us!

741
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,212
Ma, since when has that been an issue?

742
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,423
She's been distant from us
for a long time!

743
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,301
Things have changed!
Miranda has entered the picture!

744
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:17,304
Anna can't get close to Miranda!

745
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,395
Ma, I don't understand you!

746
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,397
Just listen to me!

747
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,274
Grace, come--

748
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:30,984
-Grace!
-Grace!

749
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,007
-Grace.
-Mama?

750
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:07,604
Grace.

751
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,314
Let's hurry.

752
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,108
Come on. Run faster.

753
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,110
-Anna!
-Julius.

754
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,613
Grace? Oh, Grace.

755
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:17,989
-Let's hurry.
-Come on.

756
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:19,991
Grace.

757
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,410
Grace?

758
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,288
Show me that kid!

759
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:27,999
Grace!

760
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,793
Grace.

761
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:39,844
-Chito!
-Sarah!

762
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,763
Chito, help me. I finally saw Grace.

763
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,348
-Huh?
-She really is with Anna.

764
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,016
-Come on, let's find them.
-No.

765
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,435
-We're leaving. Let's go.
-We're not leaving!

766
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,896
Things went south!
I'll explain later. Let's go!

767
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,065
I'm not going anywhere until you explain!

768
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,608
The plan failed!

769
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,859
Jimenez saw me! Okay?

770
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,194
-Let's go!
-Please, Chito.

771
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,113
-I'm begging you.
-Quit whining!

772
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,406
But Grace is here-- Ah!

773
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,283
-Chito…
-Just follow me.

774
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,881
Men, after him!

775
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,634
Where did Chito go?

776
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,386
I-I don't know.

777
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,223
Come with us, Mrs. Banaag.

778
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,435
Yes. I'll come with you.

779
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:31,896
But can you explain to me
what's going on first?

780
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,109
I was so shocked when Chito hurt me.

781
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,487
He hit my head against this tree.

782
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:45,785
Sir Jimenez, we saw Chito
with Mrs. Banaag.

783
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:49,122
Our men are chasing after Chito.

784
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,916
But Mrs. Banaag is with me.

785
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:56,713
Come with me.

786
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:06,222
Look, I've talked to Wilson.

787
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,683
I was asking for help
so we could leave Palawan.

788
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,311
We can't stay here for long.

789
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,399
Is it painful?

790
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,819
No, it's not.

791
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,113
I'm used to getting hurt.

792
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,532
This is nothing compared
to what I experienced.

793
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,496
Mama, I'm sorry.

794
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:33,500
I didn't know
Aunt Princess would do that.

795
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,506
Oh, come on. It wasn't your fault.

796
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,176
I'm the one who should apologize

797
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,094
because I didn't watch you properly.

798
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,890
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

799
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:54,812
Stay positive. I promise
I'll be careful, too.

800
00:46:56,105 --> 00:47:00,401
I know that if I return to Mama Sarah,

801
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,695
you'll get in trouble.

802
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,822
Not just with her

803
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,699
but also with the police.

804
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,202
She'll send you to jail.

805
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:16,000
I won't let them send you to jail, Mama.

806
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:19,796
Don't worry.

807
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,090
That won't happen.

808
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,385
Because, you know, I won't give up.

809
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,929
I will never give up.

810
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,847
As long as you want me by your side.

811
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,891
I'll always stay by your side.

812
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:33,601
That's really what I want, Mama.

813
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:36,020
You're the only one I want to be with

814
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,815
until I grow old.

815
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:48,700
Kidnapping?

816
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,952
Did you really not know
about Chito's plans?

817
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:54,205
How was that possible
when you were together?

818
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:57,125
No, we weren't together.

819
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,918
We just bumped into each other.

820
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,421
Then he told me to follow him.

821
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,298
But when I refused to do so…

822
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,424
he got angry.

823
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:08,511
Then he suddenly hurt me.

824
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,518
How could he do that to me?

825
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,396
I thought Chito loved me.

826
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,399
I really had nothing to do with it.

827
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,401
There's no way you wouldn't know

828
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,403
because you're his partner!

829
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,907
Are you insisting that
Anna took your daughter

830
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,118
so you could cover up your mess?

831
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,079
Chito was the last person
she was seen with.

832
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:38,124
Someone reported that
you two were hurting Grace!

833
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:41,210
That's not true. They're lying.

834
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:44,797
You're blaming other people
so you can cover up your mess!

835
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,134
Where's Grace? What did you do to her?

836
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,095
No, I didn't do anything to her!

837
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:55,099
Sir, Miranda Valdez is here.

838
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,311
Okay, I'll be right there.

839
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,313
I need to report to Sir Roman first.

840
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,987
Thank you. Miss Miranda!

841
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:13,117
Oh, Miss Miranda. Please help me.

842
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,621
I have nothing to do with what Chito did.

843
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,623
-Sarah.
-Yes?

844
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,709
Tell me the truth
before it's too late.

845
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:25,546
I tried calling you because
someone was asking for ransom,

846
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,006
but you weren't picking up.

847
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,300
It turns out you and Chito planned it all.

848
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,718
No.

849
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:33,805
I would never do that to you,
Miss Miranda.

850
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,515
I'm innocent. I swear.

851
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,434
I don't know anything about Chito's plans.

852
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,603
I wasn't able to answer your call

853
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,898
because Anna's sister called me.

854
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,734
She said that she has my daughter,

855
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,319
and she'll bring her to me.

856
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,405
That's why I got preoccupied.

857
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:54,033
But Miss Miranda, I would
never do that to you.

858
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:56,202
I'm telling the truth.

859
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:59,414
In fact, I saw my daughter.

860
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,417
She's with Anna, Miss Miranda.

861
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,836
It's the truth.

862
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,713
Please believe me, Miss Miranda.

863
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,881
I'm telling the truth.

864
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,801
I'm begging you.

865
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,725
Have you heard from Wilson?

866
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,394
I've been trying to call him
but couldn't reach him.

867
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,688
Are you the kidnapper?

868
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,108
-Dad.
-Are you out of your mind?

869
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,527
Why are you helping a criminal?

870
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,029
Dad, Anna is not a criminal.

871
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:34,532
Don't treat me like a fool, Julius.

872
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:38,619
I have eyes and ears everywhere.

873
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,830
I know exactly what's going on.

874
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,624
You even dragged your cousin
into this mess.

875
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,918
No! It's not what it looks like, okay?

876
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,297
Anna is not a bad person.

877
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,883
She's just…

878
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,303
She's just caught up
with something out of control.

879
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,804
"Beyond her control?"

880
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,890
She kidnapped a child!

881
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,896
Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to drag you into this.

882
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,105
You're sorry?

883
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,901
What do you want me to do?

884
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,402
Turn a blind eye?

885
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,406
All because you suddenly
want to become a hero?!

886
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,202
Yes.

887
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,123
Yes, Dad.

888
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,295
I've never asked you for
anything in my entire life.

889
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:34,300
When Mommy died, I provided for myself.

890
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:41,182
I never asked you to be a father to me.

891
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,311
Just this once, Dad.

892
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:49,106
Just this once.

893
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,698
Dad, please just…

894
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,788
You will never hear
from me again, I promise.

895
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,212
And if you still consider me your son…

896
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,006
you'll help me out.

897
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:30,898
So, you're saying that you
saw Grace with Anna?

898
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:33,109
Drop the act.

899
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,528
I don't know what you're talking about.

900
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,196
What do you mean?

901
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,324
Hey! Tell your mother to stop lying.

902
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,118
Tell us the truth!

903
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,413
Didn't you call me and said

904
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,915
that you'll meet me by the beach

905
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,209
and give my daughter back to me?

906
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,130
Well?

907
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:57,300
Are you all deaf and mute, huh?

908
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,636
Tell them the truth! You called me, right?

909
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,307
You said you'll get Grace
from Anna and give her to me.

910
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,600
Where is she now?

911
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,810
Yes, I called you.

912
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,312
See? I told you.

913
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,523
I called to tell you to leave us alone.

914
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:15,610
I didn't say anything about
giving Grace to you.

915
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:16,903
Why would I do that?

916
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:18,905
I don't know where your daughter is.

917
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:21,490
You and your mother are both liars!

918
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:27,079
-Liar!
-You're the liar!

919
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,208
I need a team right now.

920
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:35,087
Gov. Hernandez issued a manhunt
order against Anna Sarmiento.

921
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:37,006
Now!

922
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,607
10-20. 10-20.

923
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,901
Report from Mangubat
Police Station.

924
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:00,029
Be advised that
Gov. Hernandez has issued

925
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,615
a manhunt order
against Anna Sarmiento.

926
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,618
A unit has been deployed
to arrest her.

927
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,203
ETA, five minutes.

928
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:10,831
Other units, standby
for possible escape route.

929
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,208
Did I hear that right?

930
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,307
They're coming.

931
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:58,713
No.

932
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,010
The tire is busted.

933
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,015
Who is this?

934
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:11,976
Julius!

935
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,895
Your father called the police

936
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,398
and told them your location.

937
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,317
If you stop us,
Grace will be in more trouble.

938
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,028
Sarah is not a good mother.

939
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,904
Believe me.

940
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,698
Come on.

941
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,616
I will help you escape.

942
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,326
Get in the car.

943
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,411
Hurry!

944
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,087
I'll drive.

945
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,314
No one will recognize you here.

946
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,815
Why are you helping us

947
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,776
though you're aware
I kidnapped Grace?

948
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,152
Keep an eye on them.

949
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,321
I'm going out to meet with someone.

950
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,906
We need to leave.

951
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,532
Give my daughter back to me!

952
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,034
I can't because she's not--

953
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,911
-You witch!
-Stop!

954
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,913
Do you have any
update about Grace?

955
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,247
I was just thinking.

956
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:16,874
When Anna went missing,

957
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,168
Miss Miranda also disappeared
for a few days.

958
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,295
What if Miss Miranda
is hiding Anna?

959
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,214
I'm sorry about what happened.

960
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,508
I didn't mean to drag you into this mess.
