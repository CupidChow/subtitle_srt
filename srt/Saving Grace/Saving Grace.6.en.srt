1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,336
You have a child?

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,714
Anna, you didn't have to hide it.

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,132
Why didn't you tell us?

4
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:09,093
Why did you bring that
child here just now?

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,721
Grace, we need to leave.

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,806
My family already knows about you.

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,518
This belongs to my daughter.

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,603
I'm sure of it, Miss Miranda.

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,731
Is she Grace?!

10
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,733
Did you kidnap her?

11
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,317
Yes.

12
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,903
Grace, let's go. Come with me.

13
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:31,532
No. Please, I don't want to go home.

14
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,201
Anna, don't make this difficult.

15
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,494
Surrender her now.

16
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:40,040
I don't want to go home!

17
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,004
-Julius, can we talk-
-About what?

18
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,797
You want me to take you back

19
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,716
and pretend I didn't see you?

20
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,051
No. I will not be your accomplice.

21
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,012
I'm not asking you to help us escape.

22
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,930
Just tell the child what's going on.

23
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:57,183
Is that what you did
when you kidnapped her?

24
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,727
I was the one who decided to go with her.

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,812
Grace, Anna is not your mom.

26
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,106
Your real mother is waiting for you.

27
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,901
-Stop the car!
-Grace, no!

28
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,111
We might get into trouble!

29
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,988
-Let go of us!
-Stop! Grace!

30
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,428
Grace? Grace.

31
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,222
Are you okay?

32
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,516
-Are you hurt?
-No.

33
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,603
Julius…

34
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,737
Come on. Get your bag.

35
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:34,989
Hey.

36
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,616
Where are you going?

37
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,727
Auntie, I've looked
everywhere for Anna,

38
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,812
but I couldn't find her.

39
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:10,399
Erin said she was in a hurry
and looking for Bright.

40
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,610
Do you know what happened
to them?

41
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,323
I've been trying to call Anna,
but couldn't reach her.

42
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,408
What if…

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,493
What?

44
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,997
What if Anna had left again?

45
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,292
But her stuff is still here.

46
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,003
What could've happened to her?

47
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,014
We've got no signal.

48
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,601
I doubt anyone will pass here.

49
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,936
I'll look for help.

50
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,897
No, no. You can't leave my sight.

51
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,485
What happened to you, Anna?

52
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,490
Didn't you think twice about lying?

53
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,700
You even lied to the cops.

54
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,619
I just did what I had to do.

55
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,621
You did what you wanted.

56
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,417
You had plenty of opportunities
to correct your mistakes.

57
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,127
But what did you do?

58
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,421
You ran away!

59
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,799
You avoided the problem!

60
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,593
Wait a minute.

61
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,806
Is this still about Grace
or your grudge against me?

62
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,617
How could you say that to me?

63
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,413
You think what I did was wrong?

64
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,333
You should've asked me why I did it

65
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,793
before you judged me.

66
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,883
Hey, where are you going?

67
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,263
I'll find help and search for a signal.

68
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,934
-Meneses?
-Yes, sir?

69
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,936
Where are the orphanage's files?

70
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,604
Uh…

71
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,524
Here, sir.

72
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,692
Thank you.

73
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,591
Hello?

74
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,181
It seems no one's here.

75
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,812
Alright.

76
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,898
Let's spend the night here.

77
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,698
Grace, are you okay?

78
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,909
I'm okay.

79
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,411
You seem a little hot.

80
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,122
Don't worry about me.

81
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,291
I just got nervous earlier.

82
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,088
Get some rest so you'll feel better.

83
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:20,798
Okay?

84
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,800
-Thank you, Mama.
-Alright.

85
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,888
Relax.

86
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,606
"Julius"

87
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,391
What is it?

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,602
You'd make a good mother.

89
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,481
Back then, you said…

90
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,818
you weren't ready to be a mother.

91
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,486
But you took in Grace.

92
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,199
You took responsibility for her.

93
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,536
I didn't mean for this to happen.

94
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,037
She chose to be with me.

95
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,707
Maybe it's because no one else
wants to help her.

96
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,126
So she held on to me.

97
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,420
And I think she'd have latched on…

98
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,755
to anyone who would help her.

99
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,301
Maybe she saw something in you,

100
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,721
which made her feel…

101
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,390
that she's safe

102
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,810
when she's with you.

103
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,897
Fate has a way of teaching us things.

104
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,988
Julius, I know…

105
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,201
to this day, you're still angry with me.

106
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,038
Because you didn't give me a chance

107
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,497
to fight for you.

108
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,626
I just didn't want to waste your time.

109
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,212
Because I know,
you wouldn't be happy, Julius.

110
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,923
Believe it or not,

111
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,799
all the things I've done before…

112
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,511
I did it for you.

113
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,514
Asherman's syndrome.

114
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,099
After your miscarriage,

115
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,727
your uterus formed a scarring.

116
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,021
That will interfere with implantation.

117
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,609
Will I be able to have a baby?

118
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,736
We can still do some treatments.

119
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,529
Hysteroscopy.

120
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,114
Hormone therapy

121
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,536
to help heal the lining of your uterus.

122
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,413
IVF is also an option.

123
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,207
But it will be challenging.

124
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,709
Nothing is impossible.

125
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:07,089
But I'm preparing you
for the possibilities.

126
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,719
You know, even if we fought back then…

127
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,600
I still wouldn't have given you
your dream life.

128
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,729
I know it's your dream to have a child

129
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,606
and a family.

130
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,609
Something your father couldn't give you.

131
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:28,902
Yes.

132
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,781
I want a child so bad.

133
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,496
But, Anna, I hope you realized…

134
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,418
you were what I needed.

135
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,880
At the time.

136
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,883
Julius, I was just being realistic.

137
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
I accepted that…

138
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,310
I'm not going to be a mother anymore.

139
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,024
I didn't know how to give you my love

140
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,484
when I couldn't even love myself.

141
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,282
When…

142
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,493
When I lost our child,

143
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,081
that's when I found out I was adopted.

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,002
After I thought about it,

145
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,505
that explains why
I've felt like that ever since.

146
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,801
My own parents threw me away.

147
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,721
They gave me away.

148
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,890
They couldn't love me.

149
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,024
That's why even if
I was with my adoptive family,

150
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,609
I felt like…

151
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,819
I felt like I was always alone

152
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,405
and that something was wrong.

153
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,993
I just didn't want to be a burden.

154
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,580
Anna, if only we had talked before

155
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,500
and you told me all of this…

156
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,797
I could've changed your mind.

157
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,384
You know, I just chose
to deal with all of that.

158
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,389
I chose to face it alone.

159
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,517
I didn't want to hurt anyone else

160
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
so that I wouldn't get hurt in return.

161
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,617
Grace was the one
who changed everything.

162
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,209
Miranda?

163
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,004
I'm not the only one saying it.

164
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,717
Even your career is being affected…

165
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,011
by that Sarah.

166
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,433
It's not just about Sarah,

167
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,934
It's about the child.

168
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:10,021
Well, you can find the kid

169
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,108
without getting close to the mother.

170
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,403
I don't get it. I really don't understand

171
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,991
what connection you have with that woman.

172
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,201
What is it?

173
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,911
What's your connection with her?

174
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,331
I think I see myself in her.

175
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,583
Huh?

176
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,295
In what way?

177
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,886
Finally, you're here.

178
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,555
-I missed you.
-Don't have gifts for me?

179
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,308
Are you more excited about the gifts?

180
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,606
You're so cute.

181
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,996
If I made a single mistake,

182
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,084
we could have had the same outcome.

183
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:18,215
Maybe that woman and I
would've ended up the same.

184
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,135
But you're not the same, right?

185
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,639
You decided to fix your life.

186
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,517
To make the best
of something out of your life.

187
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:33,104
You didn't let your mistakes define you.

188
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,984
But did I make the right decision, Carmen,

189
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,905
to give my daughter away?

190
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,702
You didn't give her away.

191
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,122
You gave her a chance

192
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,918
to have a family
that would take care of her.

193
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,505
Miranda, all the things in our lives

194
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,215
happen for a reason.

195
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,218
All the people you helped,

196
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,012
everything you have accomplished…

197
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,433
It was all because of your decision.

198
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,525
-Vincent, son.
-Hello, Pa.

199
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,901
Why'd you call?

200
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,113
Son, you're in Mangubat,
Palawan, right?

201
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,197
Yes, Pa.

202
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,116
I have a request for you.

203
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,702
Sure, Pa. Anything.

204
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,121
I need you to look into Anna Sarmiento.

205
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,708
I'll text you the address
of their family home, okay?

206
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,209
Then see if she's there

207
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,628
and if she has a kid with her.
You get it, son?

208
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,798
Alright.

209
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,384
Thank you.

210
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,513
Wait.

211
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,057
What does Anna Sarmiento
have to do with my child?

212
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,809
Isn't she…

213
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,394
Isn't she Grace's teacher?

214
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,606
I'm just looking into a new lead.

215
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,898
What is it?

216
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,400
Mrs. Banaag-

217
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,902
Oh, no! Don't try to hide it from me.

218
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,112
I'm tired, okay?

219
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,697
You're making me wait.

220
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,282
I'm not getting any news.

221
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,618
What does Anna Sarmiento
have to do with this?

222
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,998
I won't leave until I get an answer.

223
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,917
There's a tip about seeing Grace.

224
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,129
We are investigating whether it is related

225
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,714
to Lucia Calinao.

226
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,299
The owner of the orphanage,

227
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,925
where you saw her.

228
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,802
What does Anna
have to do with that?

229
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,596
She came from that orphanage.

230
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,224
Mrs. Banaag, nothing is confirmed

231
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,101
from what I told you.

232
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,312
So don't make a move impulsively.

233
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,211
How are you feeling?

234
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,214
Are you hungry?

235
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,884
Um... Do you have food?

236
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,387
Um...

237
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,396
This is all I have.

238
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,900
I'm okay with this.

239
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,405
My stomach is used to this.

240
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,118
Always feeling hungry?

241
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,833
Mama said kids
shouldn't eat a lot.

242
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,918
You mean your Mama Sarah?

243
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,301
What do you do
when you're starving?

244
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,220
I sleep.

245
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,098
I listen to the sounds my stomach make

246
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,100
until I fall asleep.

247
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,310
You don't tell Sarah?

248
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,521
She doesn't like
having a burden.

249
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,902
That's what she always tells me.

250
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,530
What would you do?

251
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,615
I help her.

252
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,288
I sell stuff until I can save money.

253
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,332
Sometimes…

254
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,587
I buy food for her and Uncle Chito.

255
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,802
And what they do when…

256
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,597
when they think…

257
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,016
that you're being a burden?

258
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,994
When Uncle Chito…

259
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,206
gets mad at me,

260
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,293
he would burn me.

261
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,089
I love Mama

262
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,511
that's why I put up with them
even though they hit me.

263
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:19,182
But Mama loves Uncle Chito
more than she loves me.

264
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,187
Are you going to give me
back to them?

265
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,694
Are you going to put Mama Anna in jail?

266
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,698
They say,

267
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:41,412
people who go to jail
have done something wrong.

268
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,707
Did Mama Anna
do anything wrong to me?

269
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,419
I was the one who went with her.

270
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,296
Grace…

271
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,424
Grace, you're still young.

272
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,302
You don't understand
what is right and wrong.

273
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,138
Who decides what is right and wrong?

274
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,890
I'll talk to them.

275
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,437
Grace…

276
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:07,730
I don't understand

277
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,692
why you think Mama Anna
is a bad person.

278
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,404
Is it wrong that she took me?

279
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:19,200
Is it right if she left me
with the people who hurt me?

280
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,040
Grace, yesterday,
you tried to run away.

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,209
Why?

282
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,420
You were about to get in a boat?

283
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,214
So that Mama won't go to jail.

284
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,509
I'll leave.

285
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,012
I'll go back home.

286
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,180
As long as she'll be fine.

287
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,100
Mama is nice.

288
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,396
She's not like Mama Sarah
and Uncle Chito.

289
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,105
Where'd your toughness go?

290
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,524
You know how to borrow money,

291
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,193
but you don't know how to pay?

292
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,450
I'm giving you a week, Chito.

293
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,494
If you don't pay the boss
within a week,

294
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,537
you'll suffer worse than this!

295
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,081
Enough.

296
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,215
Sarah!

297
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,219
What are you doing?

298
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,012
Why are you packing?

299
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,305
I'm going to Palawan.

300
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,016
Be serious, Sarah.

301
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,018
Our life is a mess

302
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,020
and you still want to go
on a vacation?

303
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,481
Grace's teacher is there.

304
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,401
They all suspect,

305
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,028
she has something to do
with Grace's disappearance.

306
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,698
Why? Are they sure that Grace is there?

307
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,408
I don't know.

308
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,827
But since they have a suspicion,

309
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,537
I'm going there myself.

310
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,206
Miss Miranda also said
that Julius is in Palawan.

311
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,083
Maybe my daughter is really there.

312
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,879
What happened to you?

313
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,718
I just had been drinking. I slipped.

314
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,138
Look after the house.

315
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,305
You're leaving alone?

316
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,724
Are you coming?

317
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,100
Of course.

318
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,437
Don't we plan to find her
before the police does?

319
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,106
Go. Pack my things too.

320
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,693
I'll do it.

321
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,537
Julius will get mad at me
if he finds out.

322
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,956
He gave me this spare key
for emergencies only.

323
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,624
This is an emergency.

324
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,293
Julius is missing.

325
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,587
Everything seems normal.

326
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,006
All his stuff is still here.

327
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,926
Isn't that more concerning?

328
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,804
That means he hasn't been home
since last night.

329
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,223
He doesn't answer my calls.

330
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,433
Wait.

331
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,101
You two have broken up, right?

332
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,230
Do you know his father's number?

333
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,815
No, Jessica.

334
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,609
Don't even think about it.

335
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,694
You'll only anger Julius more.

336
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,781
But what if
he's in danger?

337
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,701
We need to call the cops
so they can help us.

338
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:52,997
First, we have to figure out
where he went.

339
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,917
So where did he go?
Aren't you two together?

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,502
The last time we talked,

341
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,004
He was investigating Anna.

342
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,509
Then let's start with her.

343
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,802
Do something about it!

344
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,512
Yes. I'm sorry.

345
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:09,597
Hey, Erin!

346
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,726
What was that about?

347
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,728
One of our guests
lost his watch.

348
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,188
Again?

349
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,525
That's the third time this month.

350
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,318
Have you checked the CCTV footage?

351
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,278
Not yet. I'll take a look.

352
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:25,905
Okay.

353
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,634
Hey! You're the thief, aren't you?

354
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,427
Come here! I said, come here!

355
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,012
-You-
-Hey, stop it!

356
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,514
I'm not a thief!

357
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,100
Then why were you breaking
into our guests' rooms?!

358
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,601
I caught you in the act!

359
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,437
Hang on.

360
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,022
I know you.

361
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,817
You were the girl who tried
to pocket me at the beach.

362
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,235
You're the thief!

363
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,113
I'm not a thief!
Don't turn this around on me!

364
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,907
You'll see. I'll report you to the police!

365
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,127
Oh, Wilson!

366
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,004
I'm here for Julius.

367
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,005
Is he here?

368
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,382
Julius? No.

369
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,384
How about Anna?

370
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,012
Who's this?

371
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,430
I'm Jessica.

372
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,182
Julius's fiancée.

373
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,936
Julius has been missing since yesterday.

374
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,523
We were thinking he might be with Anna.

375
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,108
Do you know where she is?

376
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,236
Anna is missing too.

377
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,572
We don't know where she went.

378
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,325
We've been trying to call her,
but she won't pick up.

379
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,826
They are together.

380
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,579
So, where could they
have gone to?

381
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,794
What the heck? You called the cops?

382
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,631
I wasn't the one
who called them.

383
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,007
Then why are they here?

384
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,634
Come on!

385
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,302
I called them here.

386
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,638
I've caught the thief.

387
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,722
Come here!

388
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,099
Erin, he's our customer!

389
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,810
But I saw him break into one of our rooms.

390
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,103
Where is she?

391
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,606
Where is Anna?

392
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,529
Sarah, what are you doing here?

393
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,281
Bring Anna out.

394
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,116
What?

395
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,911
Are you all deaf? Didn't you hear her?

396
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,205
Wait a minute. Who are you?

397
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,623
Anna isn't here.

398
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,125
Hey, twink. Stop pretending.

399
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,210
Bring Anna out!

400
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,837
Do you have a problem
with twinks, huh?!

401
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,297
Wait. Excuse me.

402
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,715
What is going on here?

403
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,425
Sir, I was the one who called.

404
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,302
I caught this thief.

405
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:54,929
My daughter is missing.

406
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,639
Yes. You might've seen it on TV.

407
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,100
Our case is quite famous.
You know Grace Banaag?

408
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,311
I found out that Anna Sarmiento
is involved

409
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,230
in my daughter's disappearance.

410
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,482
So, I thought
maybe she took Grace.

411
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,484
That's why we're here.

412
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,611
That's right.

413
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:11,988
Look at them.

414
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,990
They're obviously covering up for her.

415
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,825
Officer, Anna isn't here.

416
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,911
And she's a teacher,
not a kidnapper. Right, Auntie?

417
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,497
Besides, why would Anna
take someone else's child

418
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,582
-when she has-
-Charlie.

419
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,212
I'm sorry, but we didn't
see Anna with any girl.

420
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,381
She didn't kidnap your daughter.

421
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,092
We don't know where she is either.

422
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,635
We're also looking for her.

423
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,804
They can't find her either!

424
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,432
Obviously, she ran away!

425
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,101
Officers, can you just
search for her?

426
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,020
Because my boyfriend
is also missing.

427
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:47,231
And there is a possibility
that they are together.

428
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,734
You see, Julius is investigating Anna,

429
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,987
but they suddenly disappeared.
And it's been more than 24 hours.

430
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,406
And you…

431
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,616
If you have any info on their whereabouts,

432
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,201
you better say it now.

433
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,412
Because kidnapping is a crime.

434
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,206
And if it is proven that
you are accomplices,

435
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,584
you'll be punished accordingly.

436
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,628
That's right, Attorney.

437
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,297
Tell them.

438
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,133
They can't even look at us
in the eye.

439
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,384
Might as well sue them.

440
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,304
Maybe you should call Miranda here too

441
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,389
so she can put their guilty faces on TV.

442
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,808
Miranda who?

443
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,103
Miranda Valdez. My mother.

444
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,980
Why?

445
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,818
The nerve of those people

446
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:36,906
to barge in here
and accuse Anna of kidnapping!

447
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,407
Are they out of their minds?

448
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,618
Call Anna.

449
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,620
Huh?

450
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,997
We can't reach her, remember?
Her phone's off.

451
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,916
Just keep trying!

452
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,919
Tell her not to come home for now.

453
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,588
Wherever she and Bright are,
tell her to stay there.

454
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,632
Why, Auntie?

455
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,802
Shouldn't they come home
to deal with those people?

456
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,305
She can't show up here now.

457
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,099
People might talk.

458
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,683
It'll only make things worse.

459
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,186
You have a point.

460
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,481
You're right.

461
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,026
We can't have Miranda Valdez come here.

462
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,237
Everyone in the country knows her.

463
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,032
Any word from her about us
could spell trouble.

464
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,911
It might drive away guests
and affect our business.

465
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,958
But she probably wouldn't do that.

466
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,918
Miss Miranda's nice!

467
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,629
That's why she's called
the Nation's Mother.

468
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,967
She only shows her fierce side
when dealing with nasty people.

469
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,391
I'm glad Daddy allowed me to visit you.

470
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,601
That looks good!

471
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,020
-I missed your cooking.
-Hmm?

472
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,897
You're the best, best friend!

473
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,607
Oh! Wait.

474
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,819
I almost forgot.

475
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,286
You've been eyeing that
for a while, right?

476
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,914
Isn't this expensive?

477
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,207
Anything for you.

478
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,626
Look, I got one for me too.

479
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,711
See?

480
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,007
Thank you.

481
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,218
You know what?
You just beat me to it.

482
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,511
Hm?

483
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,806
I've also been planning
to buy matching watches.

484
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,517
One for me
and one for my girlfriend.

485
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,104
You have a girlfriend?

486
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,106
Sorry, I didn't tell you sooner.

487
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,319
She didn't want anyone else to know yet.

488
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,279
And her father doesn't approve of me.

489
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,616
Hmm.

490
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,284
Her name's Miranda.

491
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,703
She's not just beautiful.

492
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,914
She's also kind and smart.

493
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,500
She's a rising newscaster.

494
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,003
She's the newest reporter on NTV.

495
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,505
What a lucky girl!

496
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,383
Anyway, let's get wasted!

497
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,181
But finish your food first.

498
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,902
Hello?

499
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,403
Antonio.

500
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,114
We need to talk.

501
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:30,996
Miranda?

502
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,207
Antonio...

503
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,417
Forget about her.

504
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:40,297
I'm right here. I love you so much.

505
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,315
Auntie?

506
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,484
Auntie, are you okay?

507
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,486
Are you alright?

508
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,708
-Miss Miranda, welcome.
-Thank you.

509
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,090
-This way, madam.
-Thanks.

510
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,302
Sarah.

511
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,304
Miss Miranda.

512
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,388
Chito.

513
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,599
-Oh, Miss Miranda.
-Hey.

514
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,309
Ma'am.

515
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,312
I'm glad you could come right away.

516
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,897
We need to find Anna right away.

517
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,318
Her family said
they don't know where she is.

518
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,528
What if they're just covering up for her?

519
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,905
Wait, we can't act rashly.

520
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,325
We have to know
what's really going on first.

521
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,410
You said you knew
where she lives, right?

522
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,330
Yes, ma'am. Sorry I didn't
to tell you sooner.

523
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,498
She already took Grace once.

524
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,084
I won't let her do it again.

525
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,086
Ma'am.

526
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,921
I was thinking…

527
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,008
What if we offer a reward?

528
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,720
The greater the reward,
the greater the interest.

529
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,891
More people will help us search
for Anna Sarmiento.

530
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,735
-Mama?
-Mm?

531
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,986
Let's play.

532
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,906
Just go play by yourself.

533
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,118
How can I play tag if there's no "it"?

534
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,703
Tag, you're it!

535
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,413
Chase me if you can!

536
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,707
Oh, I see. Don't you feel tired?

537
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,501
Come and get me!

538
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,127
Alright!

539
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,587
Come get me!

540
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,632
-Got you!
-Mama…

541
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,300
I got you!

542
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,303
Let's stop. I'm tired now.

543
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,308
Mama…

544
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,894
Please don't ever get tired of me, okay?

545
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,398
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

546
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,779
I might get tired, but I won't give up.

547
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,784
Mwah!

548
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,495
Because of that…

549
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,580
You're it now!

550
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,418
That's cheating!

551
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,002
-You're it!
-Hm?

552
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,713
-Is that so?
-No.

553
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,513
Join us. You're it!

554
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm not playing though.

555
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,895
Oh, getting old now, huh?
Is that it?

556
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,234
Here, tag her!

557
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,111
What?

558
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,905
Ah! Run!

559
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,617
You're it.

560
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,202
You're it now!

561
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,795
Who's it? Her?

562
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,381
You're it.

563
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,302
You're it!

564
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,515
You're it again.

565
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,309
Your son told me the truth.

566
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,519
Are you really so desperate

567
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,397
that you'd risk your
son's safety just for a case?

568
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:28,233
I'm sorry. I took care
of everything.

569
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,902
If this happens again,

570
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,113
I'm sure you'll never
see your son again!

571
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,699
Let's go, Vincent!

572
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,117
I'm staying with Papa.

573
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,327
Vincent!

574
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,537
I already told you, Ma.

575
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,122
I called Papa.

576
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,916
You didn't have to
come here.

577
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,542
Just go be with your husband.

578
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,920
Do what you want!

579
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,301
I'm sorry, Pa.

580
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,303
Don't worry about it, son.

581
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,722
I'm the one who should
apologize to you.

582
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,808
Pa, you should head to the inn.

583
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,602
It's a big mess.
Everyone's looking for Anna.

584
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,312
They might beat you to it.

585
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,985
Mama? Mama, the cops are here!

586
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:15,906
Grace.

587
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,501
Julius!

588
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,794
Jessica?

589
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,506
-Anna!
-Ma.

590
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,805
Thank God you're safe.

591
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,808
Anna, are you okay?

592
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,190
So, you're Anna.

593
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:56,488
I'm Jessica,
Julius's fiancée.

594
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,999
Babe, what happened?

595
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,209
We've been looking for you
since yesterday.

596
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,837
I was so worried,
so I flew all the way here.

597
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,006
We found your car crashed into a tree.

598
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,595
Yeah. Um, I suddenly lost control.

599
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,390
You were alone with her?

600
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,903
Yes. It was just us two.

601
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,323
I was supposed to interview her.

602
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,533
We were looking for a good location.

603
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:42,993
That's what happened.

604
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,003
Come on, babe. Let's go.

605
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,589
Hang on.

606
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,508
Whose car is this?

607
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:01,386
It's your father's. He's waiting for you.

608
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,396
Anna.

609
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,983
Come on. We'll give you a ride.

610
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,529
No, thanks.

611
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,615
We'll just get a ride from the cops.

612
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,788
Let's go.

613
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,513
Where's Grace? Where is she?

614
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,516
Anna!

615
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,191
Hey!

616
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,318
What's wrong?

617
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:00,278
You've been quiet the whole ride.

618
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:06,118
You shouldn't have come here.
We broke up, remember?

619
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,620
Babe, forget about it.

620
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,497
I didn't mean anything I said.

621
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,000
I love you.

622
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,212
I love you, okay-

623
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,799
So, you're really breaking up
with me now?

624
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,302
I'm here now. I came here for you.

625
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,596
But I didn't ask you to, Jessica.

626
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:28,515
No.

627
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,019
No!

628
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,729
We didn't break up.

629
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,313
We're still together, okay?

630
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,733
The wedding is still on.

631
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,817
Hm?

632
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,112
We're still getting married, okay?

633
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,615
You know,
I think it's better…

634
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,202
…that we take a break
from each other.

635
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,788
So we can both think things over.

636
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,292
It's because of that
Anna girl, isn't it?

637
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,627
-I knew it!
-It's not because of her!

638
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:58,879
Jessica!

639
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,717
It's because I'm so tired
of this relationship!

640
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,304
You always threaten
to break up with me

641
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,805
every time we fight!

642
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,392
And your constant insecurity?!

643
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,895
I'm done.

644
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,607
Babe!

645
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,908
I'll just give Grace a bath.

646
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,839
-Ma'am, sir!
-Move out of the way!

647
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:43,799
Anna!

648
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,425
-Say again?
-You can't come in.

649
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,135
-You'll get me in trouble.
-Move!

650
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,721
-Come out!
-Chito, he's touching me!

651
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,431
-Chito!
-Don't touch my wife!

652
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,809
-Get your hands off her!
-Hey! Come out!

653
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,602
-Ma'am!
-Anna! Where are you?

654
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,229
-Ma'am! Ma'am!
-Show yourself!

655
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,231
Don't touch me!

656
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,607
Come out!

657
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,817
-Ma'am.
-Anna!

658
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,902
-Ma'am!
-I'm warning you!

659
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,614
Hey!

660
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,200
Stop making a scene
at this hour!

661
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,326
Where's Anna?

662
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,411
Get her out! I know
your daughter's back.

663
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,704
Leave.

664
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:15,997
I said leave!

665
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:16,998
Don't touch me!

666
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,542
Get out of our house!

667
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,211
I'm not going anywhere.
I know your daughter's here.

668
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,004
Tell her to bring out
my daughter!

669
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,006
Get out of here!
Please escort her out!

670
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,425
I said I'm not going anywhere!

671
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,928
-Ma'am!
-No one can make me leave!

672
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,429
-No!
-Hey!

673
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:32,597
Leave!

674
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,516
What? Are you looking for me?

675
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,103
Where is my daughter?

676
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,313
Why are you asking me?

677
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,400
You're still playing dumb?

678
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,403
I heard the cops say you're
a suspect in kidnapping her,

679
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,737
so bring her out!

680
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,699
Why would I assume
someone else's responsibility?

681
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,451
For what? To tie me down?

682
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,912
I don't want the burden
of taking care of a kid.

683
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,998
So, please.
Your daughter isn't here.

684
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,417
Oh, really?
Come here!

685
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,211
Come here, you!
Get down over here!

686
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,714
-Get down here!
-Stop it!

687
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,924
-Come here!
-Stop it!

688
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,718
-Let go of me!
-Enough!

689
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,721
Give me back my daughter!

690
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,598
-Stop it!
-Give her back!

691
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,433
-Enough!
-No! Give her back!

692
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,810
-Ma'am.
-That's enough. Let her go!

693
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,312
Stop it!

694
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,689
Enough already!

695
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,410
What are you doing here?

696
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,705
We're here to
uncover the truth.

697
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,499
I've watched your show.

698
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,418
We all know what you do.

699
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,629
You make up stories.

700
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:49,299
Can you please
leave my family alone?

701
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,717
We don't want trouble.

702
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:55,180
I'm here to give
Anna a chance.

703
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,310
I suppose she's old enough
to answer my questions alone.

704
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,354
Especially if she did nothing wrong.

705
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,313
Right, Anna?

706
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,898
What else do you want?

707
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,316
I answered your questions.

708
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,610
I already told everything at the police.

709
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,112
Julius said you have a kid.

710
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,615
What does that
have to do with anything?

711
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:18,328
Well, it seems like no one
knew you had a child.

712
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,123
Not your employer
or anyone in your life.

713
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,416
See?

714
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,418
This woman is a liar.

715
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,421
So what if my daughter has a kid?

716
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,716
Whether she gave birth
or not is none of your business!

717
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,552
It's the child I gave birth to
that I'm concerned about!

718
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,513
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

719
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,931
Here's what we'll do.

720
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,099
Show us the kid.

721
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,601
This will confirm everything
if we see the kid.

722
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:42,727
Come on.

723
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,397
Then, what?
We'll end up on TV?

724
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,524
I refuse to let
my child go through that.

725
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,734
All you need to see
is Anna's kid?

726
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,027
Hold on.

727
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,487
Don't, Princess!

728
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,823
What? I can't just stand here.

729
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,199
They're accusing us!

730
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,993
I'm putting an end to this!

731
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:06,918
Hey!

732
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,295
What's going on here?

733
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,423
Oh, Julius. You were here before us.

734
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,384
Tell them what you found out
about the kid.

735
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,314
The kid Anna has isn't Grace.

736
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:40,702
Who's that?

737
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:42,912
Chief!

738
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:46,291
Over here! Arrest them!

739
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,835
-What's happening?
-You're just in time.

740
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:49,836
Arrest them.

741
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,880
Who do we arrest?

742
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:57,010
Them! I heard you!

743
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,803
I know Anna is a suspect.

744
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,514
That's why we're here. Now, arrest them.

745
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:05,393
I'm afraid we can't do that, Mrs. Banaag.

746
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,521
We have to follow due process.

747
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,398
-What?
-Chief, please.

748
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:11,900
Please make them leave.

749
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,818
Please leave us alone.

750
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,821
Alright. Let's go.

751
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,032
-Miss Miranda…
-Before they press charges.

752
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,533
Come on.

753
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,993
Miss Miranda.

754
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,795
Miranda.

755
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,008
We need to talk.

756
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,209
Tell me the truth.

757
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,296
Are you here to get back at me?

758
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,300
That's not why I'm here.

759
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:25,098
So you didn't drop by
to check on me?

760
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:30,687
You and I both know
your connection to Antonio.

761
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:39,696
Antonio didn't tell me he was married.

762
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,907
I left when I found out the truth.

763
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,284
You know that.

764
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:52,083
Then who owes who
an explanation?

765
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:58,214
We know who the homewrecker is.

766
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:04,804
My daughter has nothing to explain.

767
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,599
Especially to you.

768
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,982
You've wronged me in many ways.

769
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,985
Enough, Miranda.

770
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:24,908
Leave our daughter alone!

771
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,496
You can't blame me
for life, Helena.

772
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:32,123
We both know that we're victims

773
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:35,084
of Antonio's deceit.

774
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,005
And if there's one thing I learned

775
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,007
from what he did to me

776
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,801
is how to take a stand.

777
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,803
And that's what I'm doing here.

778
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,806
I'm standing up for the truth.

779
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,483
Get out!

780
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,708
Are you done?

781
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,504
Aren't you scared?

782
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,217
Why would I be afraid?

783
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,928
I'm not doing anything wrong.

784
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,889
The truth will come out.

785
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,725
We don't have evidence yet,

786
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,018
but not for long.

787
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,607
Are you ready to lose
everything you have?

788
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,736
We just want peace,

789
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,946
but you won't give it.

790
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,617
Spare my child from
your baseless accusations.

791
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:53,788
Because if you don't,
I will fight you.

792
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:58,293
I will put her first
before anything else.

793
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,587
Even myself.

794
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,900
She said she was concerned
about my daughter.

795
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:26,195
So she told the police all these nonsense.

796
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:29,115
But that teacher is so suspicious.

797
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:32,702
The way I see it,
if you're really innocent,

798
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,704
why won't you face me?

799
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,831
Talk to me.

800
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,084
Instead, she's avoiding us.

801
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,213
There are so many questions

802
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,007
about Anna Sarmiento's identity.

803
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,301
Questions she's avoiding to answer.

804
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:53,014
If she was truly innocent,
she would face us

805
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,891
to clear her name.

806
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:01,189
Anna Sarmiento, I'm giving you
one more chance.

807
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,900
Our program is open to hear your side.

808
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,780
To the public, we implore you,

809
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,533
let's not prolong Sarah's suffering.

810
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,911
Help us find Grace.

811
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:20,833
I am willing to give one million pesos

812
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:24,796
to whoever can tell us
where Grace Banaag is.

813
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:29,509
You just can't spare us
from your problems, huh?

814
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:30,510
I didn't mean to--

815
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,512
You always say you didn't mean to!

816
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,932
You didn't mean for Papa
to die because of you!

817
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,434
You didn't mean for us
to suffer like this!

818
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,104
And you didn't mean
for me to lose my baby!

819
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,690
Princess, calm down.

820
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,484
None of those
were Anna's fault.

821
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,697
Grace's mother is insane!

822
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,323
First of all,

823
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,409
Anna's kid
can't be Sarah's kid

824
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,202
because Bright is a boy.

825
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:57,537
Exactly.

826
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,498
Why don't you just
tell them that?

827
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,796
You didn't take
their daughter, right?

828
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,007
Bright is your child, right?

829
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,302
Erin is asking you
a simple question.

830
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:16,097
-Answer her!
-Enough, Princess.

831
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,599
Aren't you tired of
getting angry at Anna?

832
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,317
Anna, what did you do?

833
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:31,779
Let me see!

834
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,200
"MISSING
NAME: GRACE BANAAG"

835
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,620
Princess, no!

836
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,623
-How dare you!
-Princess, stop!

837
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,834
-I knew it! Damn it!
-Princess!

838
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,878
Enough!

839
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,797
That's enough!

840
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:51,507
Mama!

841
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:03,186
Why are you all mad
at my mama?!

842
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:08,316
All of you are against her!

843
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,611
She's not a bad person.

844
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:16,699
You shouldn't be
treating her like this!

845
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,996
You know, If you were planning
to commit a crime,

846
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,207
you shouldn't have
shown up here at all!

847
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,833
You shouldn't have come here!

848
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,210
That's enough!

849
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,796
I'm the one who
begged my mama to bring me!

850
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,423
Do you want her
to leave too?

851
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:37,011
I left home because
I was being hurt there!

852
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:44,685
Anna, we should take her
to the police.

853
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,104
No! I don't want to!

854
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,233
-Please, don't--
-I'm calling the police!

855
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,318
Nobody is reporting this!

856
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:58,616
None of us will say
anything about this!

857
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,910
You're really
taking her side, Ma?!

858
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,412
It's too late to call
the police now!

859
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,002
Grace's mother pointed out Anna.

860
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,380
Miranda's already here.

861
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:19,387
If Anna gets arrested,
this will be a huge scandal.

862
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,639
We'll be the talk of the country.

863
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,600
That's why your plan is to
cover up her crime, huh?!

864
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:27,228
Pretending Grace isn't here?!

865
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,815
That's the only way
to protect my family!

866
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,910
Why did you pinch me?

867
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:25,703
Uh--

868
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,413
Does it hurt?

869
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:30,207
Does it make you cry?

870
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:35,212
Mama Sarah
doesn't like me crying

871
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,715
when she hits me.

872
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,177
She gets mad...

873
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:47,600
especially if I cry too loud.

874
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,313
If I don't cry,

875
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:57,401
how will she know I'm hurting?

876
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:04,909
Mama.

877
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,204
Don't hold it in.

878
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,418
Just keep crying...

879
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:19,298
so they'll understand
you're hurting.

880
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:11,225
Sir Jimenez, why are you here?

881
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,309
Uh, ma'am.

882
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,813
I just wanted to inform you

883
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,607
that we got new information
about Anna.

884
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:19,608
What is it?

885
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:21,027
It's about her background.

886
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,029
She's connected
to the same orphanage

887
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,530
where Grace came from.

888
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,490
Anna Sarmiento
came from there too.

889
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,285
Anna came from the orphanage?

890
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,203
Yes, she's adopted.

891
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,249
She was adopted
when she was 4 years old.

892
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,294
How old is she now?

893
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,380
Uh, 28 years old. Why?

894
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:46,802
Uh, thank you, Sir Jimenez.

895
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:49,889
Thank you, ma'am.

896
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:04,612
Carmen, I need an investigator.

897
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,698
I want to know if my mother
has any connection

898
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,492
to the Forever Loved Orphanage.

899
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:11,911
Thanks.

900
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,795
You know, auntie...

901
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,799
I still can't believe Anna
could do that.

902
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:27,218
She's so quiet...

903
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,595
so gentle...

904
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:33,015
then all of a sudden,
she kidnaps a kid?

905
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:37,770
What do you think, auntie?

906
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,814
Maybe I should hold off

907
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,023
here at the inn.

908
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:44,985
Some people just come here
to gossip.

909
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,280
Okay.

910
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,909
Our peace of mind
is more important.

911
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,707
I'm sorry.

912
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,381
Ma, I'm sorry. I didn't want
to drag you into this mess...

913
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,592
but I really need the money.

914
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,179
Charlie, just leave us for now.

915
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,406
So, the money you need...

916
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:34,493
...is for your escape?

917
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,918
Where are you going?

918
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,088
We're going to Hong Kong.

919
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,304
What about the kid?

920
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,517
Are you going
to fake her documents?

921
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:12,406
I just need to do that
so we can leave right away.

922
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,700
After that,
I won't bother you anymore.

923
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,493
That's not going to happen.

924
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,207
You'll return the child.

925
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,084
Ma--

926
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,212
Anna.

927
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:30,132
We both know
what you did was wrong,

928
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,593
and your plans are wrong too.

929
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,390
I won't interfere…

930
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,101
…and I won't report you.

931
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:49,318
But I'm giving you a week
to say goodbye to the kid,

932
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,991
to help her prepare
for the separation.

933
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:00,579
After that…

934
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:05,084
…you'll return her
to her real mother.

935
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,430
Every time you look at this,

936
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:22,017
remember that
I'm always choosing you.

937
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,520
I'll look after you
and keep you safe.

938
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,188
Chito, we need to get her back.

939
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:27,940
That's exactly what we'll to do.

940
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:31,235
But we need to make use
of Miss Miranda

941
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,903
before she turns on us.

942
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,571
I'll burn down your house!

943
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,115
Matty, get some water! Hurry!

944
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,533
Okay, ma'am!

945
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,702
She was found wrapped in cloth,

946
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,621
wearing a bracelet
with a name on it.

947
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:47,918
She was adopted by
Helena and Antonio Sarmiento,

948
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:51,213
They named her
Anna Grace Sarmiento.
