Don't thank me.

that kind man go?

65
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,660
Over there?

66

Qiuqiu,

67
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,620
your tip didn't help at all.

68
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,140
There was nobody there.

69
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,060
Don't tip me next time.

70
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,260
Dummy cat.

71
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,700
Also, don't run away again.

72
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,900
Hear me?

73
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,980
I didn't even know

74
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,940
how you managed to run out.

75
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,060
Are you actually a cat fairy?

76
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,940
And you helped yourself out?

77
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,260
(It's a decent cat.)

he's making fun of you.

85
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Positioning collar.

86
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,340
Right.

87
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,660
You are Ji Chen, aren't you?

88
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,780
Qiao Yi? Right on time.

89
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,900
I was going to you.

90
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Take a seat.

91
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,380
Changed my agent
just after you came to power.

92
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,300
What are you planning?

93
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,820
It's a business decision.

94
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,060
Cut the cheese.

95
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,300
I know you did it as a new broom.

96
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,700
Don't try to fool me.

97
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,980
So what do you want?

98
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,780
Get my agent back.

99
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,500
She didn't follow the strategy

100
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,620
formulated by the company,

101
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,100
regardless of long-term influence

102
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,380
and brand value,

103
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,180
and tempted you
to write eye-catching works

104
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,740
that might
affect your long-term development.

105
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,180
The head office talked to her twice,

106
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,580
but she refused to change.

107
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,660
Is there a problem with Luxi

108
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,700
attracting more readers for me?

109
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,780
We made a lot of money

110
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,300
for the company.

111
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,260
Your recent two last two short stories

112
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,180
have pretty good CTR

113
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,220
and attract some fans for you.

114
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,660
But many old readers

115
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,460
are very dissatisfied with these two.

116
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,580
They think

117
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
you are no longer

118
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,300
the detached writer

119
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,340
who can bring them

120
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,100
peace and serenity.

121
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,420
You're too fixed on hot issues.

122
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,020
Moreover,

123
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,140
you speculated at will

124
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,980
and made subjective comments

125
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,420
without investigating,

126
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,220
which caused adverse effects

127
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,460
on the parties involved.

128
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,100
I don't believe it.

129
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,780
Facts don't change

130
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,260
just because of your opinion.

131
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,140
I'll be your agent.

132
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,580
To help you
work positively as a public figure.

133
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,300
I won't allow you
to chase after any trend

134
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,140
to increase short-term CTR.

135
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,340
My team has disbanded.

136
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Can't I panic?

137
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm building a new team for you.

138
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,020
They'll be ready in three days.

139
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,500
It won't affect your work.

140
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,660
But I only want my old team.

141
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,420
No way.

142
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,220
Then I will terminate our contract.

143
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,500
OK.

144
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,460
Pay the liquidated damages

145
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,700
which are 20 times your salary,

146
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
and we can terminate the contract.

147
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,940
What? Why 20 times my salary?

148
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,940
Half a year ago,

149
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,540
when Lucy renewed your contract,

150
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,380
she raised it to 20 times your salary.

151
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,100
Didn't she tell you about it?

152
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,740
(Hello, Tian.)

What?

156
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,820
Lucy took Qiao Yi's core team away.

157
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,620
Now they need

158
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,900
to build a new team

159
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,300
(and an assistant for the agent.)

160
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,580
Assistant for the agent?

161
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,380
Do you think I, a green hand,

162
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,780
can do this?

163
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,140
Logically, you can't.

164
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,140
But you know Qiao Yi.

165
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,980
He's been working the hardest
at Xing Yi.

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,460
you can be on his team.

174
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,340
But I have to meet him at least.

175
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,220
This is the problem we have to solve.

176
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,620
We have to make Qiao Yi notice you

177
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,460
and recognize you.

178
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,420
Xia,

179
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,820
I have an idea.

180
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,260
(I've done my homework.)

181
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,380
(Qiao Yi will be here
to shoot for his new book.)

182
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,540
(Electric Curtain Through Here)

183
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,100
Tian, you clever girl.

184
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Even your job interview
is so unstoppable.

185
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,380
Never try to stop an athlete.

186
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,540
And I'm on your boss' hit list
right now.

187
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,300
I have to do it this way.

188
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,380
Or I won't enter Xing Yi my whole life.

189
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,860
You downy bird.

190
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,420
But remember.

191
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,580
You snuck in on your own.

192
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,780
I didn't help any bit.

193
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,260
Yi, let's take a break.

194
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,860
Relax.

195
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,860
Chin up. You're the best.

196
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,380
Go, girl.

197
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,940
You can do this alone, right?

198
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,460
I gotta go back to my position.

199
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,700
Hi, Qiao Yi.

200
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,220
My name is Zhou Tian.

201
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,340
I know you're looking

202
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
for an assistant for the agent.

203
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,220
So I want to ask for a chance.

204
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,300
Here's my resume.

205
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,660
To me? Why?

206
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,340
Interesting.

207
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,460
Do I look like an interviewer?

208
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,300
I've submitted a resume online
to Xing Yi.

209
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,300
But I don't have much job experience.

210
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,220
I don't have any advantage.

211
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,300
And you're really popular,

212
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,540
after all.

213
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,860
I heard that
you would look after rookies.

214
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,580
So I thought

215
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,100
I had to come to see you

216
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,540
and show you my sincerity
and determination

217
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,740
before I actually failed.

218
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,820
At least I have to try once.

219
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,380
Quite proactive.

220
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,660
Yesterday, they told me

221
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,300
a lot of people
applied for this position.

222
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,940
No wonder you panic.

223
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,660
Give it to me.

224
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,460
Excuse me.

225
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,780
Sorry.

226
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
I didn't mean it.

227
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,380
Ji Chen, you came just in time.

228
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,020
This girl came to me
for a job interview.

229
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,020
I don't have time for her.

230
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,220
You're my agent. You handle this.

231
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,260
I told you

232
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,860
Xing Yi wouldn't accept you.

233
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,460
"Xing Yi wouldn't accept you."

234
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,980
You think you're cool

235
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,700
when you're saying this, right?

236
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,460
But it only proves

237
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,900
you're dictatorial and cheap.

238
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,980
(Picking a quarrel with Ji Chen?)

239
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,620
(She's got some nerve.)

240

As a first-class
cultural brokerage company,

241
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,420
Xing Yi has its all employees selected.

242
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,060
And you

243
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,860
are not qualified at all.

244
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,060
You're recruiting an assistant
for the agent.

245
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,140
The person will mainly serve Qiao Yi.

246
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,220
But you don't respect

247
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,580
Qiao Yi's opinion at all.

248
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,540
He's been working for years.

249
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,900
He knows how to select an assistant.

250
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,540
He's not someone you can control.

251
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,580
Don't think too highly of yourself.

252
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,380
Most of the people

253
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,980
are not qualified.

254
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,900
You're just one of them.

255
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,900
Well, the worst one of them.

256
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,540
I don't want to explain to you.

257
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,420
Please, leave.

258

Or I'll call security.

No.

260
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,740
I think she has a point.

261
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,460
The assistant is for me.

262
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,500
I do believe you need my opinion.

263

The company

264

will screen two rounds of interviewees

265

and give you the final list.

266

No bother. I'll take her.

267

No.

268

Are you saying

269
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,900
I can't even choose

270

who works for me?

271
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Anyone but her.

272
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,860
She's a jinx.

273
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,780
Anyone around her will be cursed.

274
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm doing this for you.

275
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,860
Only you're cursed, right?

276
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,180
The more you stop me,

277
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,460
the more I look forward to her entry.

Yi, we're ready now.

279

We can start.

Don't kick her out.

281

Indeed cursed.

288

No one can't lower our bar for her.

289
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,020
Is it because of the bar

290
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,300
or your prejudice?

291
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,020
Not prejudice.

292
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
It's me being professional.

293

What if I insist?

294
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,460
She can't join Xing Yi no matter what.

295
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,700
I can hire her personally.

296

Every employee around you

297
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,340
has to be approved

Mr. Ji,

she's super agile

and has a golden heart.

302
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,700
Isn't she acceptable to the company?

303
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,820
Fine.

304
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,420
You tell him

305
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,220
about your educational background

306
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,500
and occupational history.

307
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,220
What is wrong with my education?

308
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,460
Communiversity.

309
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,900
Better than 70% of people
in our country.

310
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,180
And that's not my specialty.

311
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,900
I was an athlete.

312
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,780
Why don't you ask me

313
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,540
about my performance in the running?

314
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,780
The way you speak

315
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,860
is really annoying.

316
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,180
Good point.

317
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,500
He can always

318
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,180
make people annoyed.

319
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,460
You said it yourself.

320
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,860
This is not your specializing.

321
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,780
You know nothing of working

322
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
as the agent of a writer.

323
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,540
Why should I give you this job?

324
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,860
Do you start to work

325
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,540
as a baby?

326
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,180
I need time,

327
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,620
and I'll grow to be an assistant.

328
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,340
Good point.

329
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,500
Very good.

330
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,660
I think Zhou Tian is very reasonable

331
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,060
when expressing opinions.

332
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,540
Mr. Ji,

333
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,740
how about this?

334
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,540
You think she's inexperienced.

335
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,580
Then why don't you

336
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,140
get the old assistant back to me?

337
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,500
No one knows me better

338
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,220
or is more experienced than him.

339
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,740
How's that? Make your choice.

340
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,140

Happy now?

357

This trifle
