20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,980
Ji Chen, I've decided.

21
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,020
You don't have to go with me.

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,300
I will be a little more comfortable.

23
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,540
Hello, Hao?

24
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,540
(Hello, Tian.)

25
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,620
I've got the training center
you asked for.

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,820
It's the one we used to visit
every year.

27
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,580
You mean the one on the coast?

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,180
(Yeah.)

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,140
That one is really nice.

30
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,940
But about the date,

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,900
their schedule is tight.

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,580
Only five days of vacancy this month.

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,060
If we miss it,

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,700
you'll have to wait until next month.

35
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,300
Hang on.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,380
I'll ask about it.

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,700
Mr. Ji,

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,300
the training center

39
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,580
has only five days of the vacancy.

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,220
About our work schedule...

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,500
It fits.

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,980
Hao,

43
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,340
please book the center for me.

44
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,100
Yeah.

45
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,780
You wanna go with us?

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,660
Of course, yes.

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,060
You can be our coach.

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,060
Remember to give us a discount.

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,140
OK.

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,180
Bye.

51
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,380
(He was asking)

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,780
(about the confession things.)

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,940
(And now he is booking
the training center for Tian?)

54
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,700
(What on earth is going on?)

55
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:18,980
Mr. Ji,

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,660
Yi,

57
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,860
I'll go contact

58
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
and prepare for the training center.

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,900
I'll excuse myself then.

60
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,500
Hold on.

61
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,820
On second thought,

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,420
I should go with you

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,580
to experience the athlete's life.

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,940
But you said you wouldn't go.

65
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,060
I'm your agent.

66
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,140
Of course, I should go with you.

67
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,340
You're the president of Xing Yi.

68
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,340
And you're the pillar of Xing Yi.

69
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,780
Xing Yi has more than one pillar.

70
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
They have their agents.

71
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,660
They don't need me.

72
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,020
But they don't make such requests

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,900
to their agents.

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,180
Someone has to try tomato first.

75
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,300
That someone doesn't have to.

76
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,100
You're not used to being turned down.

77
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm starting to get used to it.

78
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,180
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

79
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,220
It's settled.

80
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,380
I'll go with you.

81
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,820
If you have any requests, shoot.

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,220
(How can I make him less annoying?)

83
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,100
(Oh!)

84
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,820
(I heard he hates sports)

85
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,700
(and never chooses to exercise himself.)

86
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,500
(Got it.)

87
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,660
I have only one request.

88
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,860
You have to experience

89
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,700
whatever I experience.

90
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,380
If you can't make it,

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,180
then I don't have to do it.

92
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,980
Hao,

93
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,260
thank you for specially coming

94
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,140
and setting out with us.

95
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,060
You can wait

96
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,020
at the training center, actually.

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,020
It's OK.

98
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,220
You don't have to thank me.

99
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,060
You haven't gone there for a while.

100
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm afraid you have forgotten the route.

101
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,380
How is it possible?

102
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,820
We've been going there
every year since we were kids.

103
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,620
I can get there with my eyes closed.

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,540
Zhou Tian,

105
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,180
check the schedule with me.

106
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,020
Mr. Ji,

107
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,700
I've sent the schedule

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,140
to your phone.

109
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,660
Double check, double insurance.

110
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,140
You two look cute

111
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,180
in lovers' clothes.

112
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,260
Not lovers' clothes.

113
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,460
It's the sportswear

114
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,780
from my old sports team.

115
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
It's about time. Get in the car.

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,980
Then Yi and Mr. Ji share a ride.

117
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,020
I'll share a ride with Hao.

118
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:13,940
Qiao Yi,

119
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,380
you stay with Zhang Hao.

120
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,140
You can talk about his experience

121
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,460
on the way there.

122
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,340
Let's go.

123
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,540
Sir, we can set out now.

(I'll look after her)

133
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
(just as I look after you.)

134
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,140
These two, please.

135
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,260
Here we are.

136
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,740
When Zhou Tian and I

137
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
trained here when we were young,

138
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,780
the conditions here were much worse.

139
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,260
The whole resort was built

140
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,940
in recent years.

141
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,820
For example, this villa.

142
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,340
One single room on the first floor.

143
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,620
Two rooms on the second floor.

144
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,860
The third floor has a wide view.

145
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,180
And you can see the sea there.

146
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,780
How will you allocate rooms?

147
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,940
I'll take the third floor.

148
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,540
That room

149
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,740
is meant for you.

150
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,460
I-I surely know.

151
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,940
I was just trying

152
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,580
to emphasize our tacit understanding.

153
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,140
Tian, which room do you want?

154
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,060
I'll take a room on the second floor.

155
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,860
It's close
to both the first and third floors.

156
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,740
I'll also stay on the second floor.

157
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,180
(Is there anything special
about the second floor?)

158
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
(They both want it.)

159
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,780
You both want a second-floor room?

160
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,420
Then you two stay on the second floor.

161
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,460
I'll stay on the first floor.

162
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,820
You choose first.

163
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,700
It's OK. After you.

164
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,780
This one, then.

165
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,300
By the way,

166
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,900
all who enter the center

167
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,340
must have a physical examination.

168
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,820
A nurse will come later.

169
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,940
Now the training center that

170
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,620
everyone must have
a physical examination.

171
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,740
Why do I need a blood test?

172
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
It's to check your body's indicators.

173
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,780
Very simple.

174
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,340
Look how poised Mr. Ji is.

175
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,220
Mr. Ji!

176
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,460
(I didn't expect)

(such a strong person)

178
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,660
(to have such a weakness.)

181
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,340
He should be fine.

182
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,620
I'll go prepare lunch.

183
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,420
I thought

184
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,700
he was acting,

185
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,380
but it turned out
to be his needle sickness.

186
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,300
So fragile.

187
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,780
That is not correct.

188
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,980
Needle sickness

189
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,380
is a common physiological phenomenon,

190
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
just like car sickness and seasickness.

191
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,860
It's not because of being fragile.

192
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,380
Mr. Ji,

193
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,220
you're awake.

194
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,500
You are being too loud.

195
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,140
Even a dead will wake up.

196
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,940
Mr. Ji,

197
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,980
do you know about your needle sickness?

198
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,660
I do. So what?

199
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,500
You do?

200
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,700
Why didn't you tell us?

201
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,540
You don't have to be embarrassed.

202
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,460
Today,

203
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,180
if it weren't for Hao,

204
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,660
you would have hit your head

205
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,500
on the ground.

206
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,260
Who can take the blame?

207
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,100
My needle sickness

208
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,660
doesn't attack every time.

209
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,540
It depends on my mood.

210
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,260
Sounds creepy.

211
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,140
I'm too full.

212
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,220
Let's go for a walk.

213
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,420
What about you, Mr. Ji and Yi?

214
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,020
The blood's concentration in the stomach

215
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,860
after eating aids digestion.

216
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,460
Why do you have to make it spread

217
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,460
to your limbs?

218
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,260
Ji Chen stays, so I stay.

You haven't come for a long time.

Yeah.

231

Stand straight.

232
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,620
Seems you're shorter.

Hand away.

236
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,500
You clearly faked this mark just now.

She said you caught me.

265

Just a lift of the finger.

266
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,660
So, you two have known each other
since childhood?

267

Yeah.

268
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,020
We were neighbors.

269
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,220
Our fathers worked together.

270
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,940
I entered the Youth Sports School

271
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,860
two years earlier than her.

272
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,660
And we came here together.

273
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,900
During these years,

274
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,740
she spent more time with me

275
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,140
than with her parents.

276
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,740
You've been training there

277
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,580
since you were kids?

278
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,900
Yep.

279
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,460
We came to train here every year.

280
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,700
Closed training.

281
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,900
So rough.

282
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,540
I remember it

283
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,060
when we came here the first time.

284
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,380
Tian ran out at night

285

because of being homesick.

286
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,580
We looked everywhere for her.

287
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,980
I found her on a nearby beach,

288
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,100
crying there alone.

Oh, right.

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,020
One more thing.

294
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,700
She refused to get up every winter.

295
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,500
I had to drag her out of bed every time.

296
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,140
I would dress her,

297
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,740
and she would nod

298
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
for another while.

299

You were always this close?

300

I said it.

301
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,580
She spent more time with me

302
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,060
than with her parents.

303
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,660
No one knows each other better
than we do.

304
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,660
Yeah.

305
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,180
You are like siblings.

Completely real siblings.

Sort of.

308

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,140

Do you have to do it this seriously?

323

You have to experience it

to know the character.

OK.

343
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:48,900
Qiao Yi,

344
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,900
take one with you.

345
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,620
Zhou Tian is never tired from running.

346
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,900
How does she make it?

347
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,660
She was an athlete after all.

348
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,420
Look.

349
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,660
How beautiful.

350
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,140
A perfect couple.

351
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,020
Right, Mr. Ji?

352
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,900
No.

353
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,780
They grew up together

354
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,460
and fit each other

355
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,140
perfectly in sports.

356
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,940
I heard eighty percent
of childhood sweethearts

357
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,340
turn into couples in the end.

358
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,140
That's nonsense.

359
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,740
Perhaps,

360
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,580
they don't see each other now,

361
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,540
but they will approach
each other eventually.

362
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,740
This is the magic of love.

363
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,100
Intimacy, see?

364
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,820
I don't understand Zhou Tian.

365
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,780
She doesn't have to work

366
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,540
as an assistant in Xing Yi.

367
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,260
Zhang Hao's assistant is a better job.

368
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,460
She can look after him

369
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,060
and run with him during training.

370
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,580
What a happy family.

371
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,620
So beautiful.

372
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,300
Xing Yi is a subsidiary
of Ansheng Group,

373
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,460
one of the top ten in the world,

374
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,420
and has the strongest

375
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,100
cultural brokerage business in China.

376
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,580
We...

377
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,540
I didn't say Xing Yi was not good.

378
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,500
Zhou Tian
is the most promising employee.

379
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,740
How can she be Zhang Hao's assistant?

380
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
I was just saying.

381
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,220
You don't have to be triggered.

382
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,820
Hurry up.

383
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,380
Or we won't finish it before dark.

384
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,540
Ji Chen!

385
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,180
Zhou Tian, watch out.

386
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,780
Thanks for your helping hand.

387
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,620
It's OK.

388
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,100
Zhou Tian,

389
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,500
the rest stop is just ahead.

390
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,580
Let's sprint for it.

391
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,740
All right.

392
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,580
(Mountain Trail Running Rest Stop)

393
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm drained.

394
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,380
I can't run anymore.

395
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,300
Let's take a break.

396
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:24,740
OK.

397
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,260
OK.

398
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,820
Thank you, Hao.

399
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,260
Mr. Ji, keep it to yourself.

400
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,300
You are still fast

401
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
though you haven't run in a long time.

402
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,300
Come on. You slowed down for me.

403
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,860
I promise I didn't.

404
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,180
You're all hungry, right?

405
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,420
I'll get us some supplies

406
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,620
to regain strength.

407
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,780
Where's Qiao Yi?

408
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,100
I didn't see him.

409
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,740
I thought he was with you

410
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
running behind?

411
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
I'm not his attendant.

412
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:24,860
He...

413
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,100
It could't be that he ran alone

414
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,140
and got lost, right?

415
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,780
Hao, phone.

416
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,860
The terrain in the mountains is complex.

417
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,820
Not easy to navigate here.

418
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,180
No answer.

419
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,900
Calm down.

420
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,460
Let's go find him.

421
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,140
OK.

422
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,660
Qiao Yi.

423
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,140
Qiao Yi.

424
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,500
- Qiao Yi.
- Yi.

425
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,220
- Qiao Yi.
- Qiao Yi.

426
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,740
Qiao Yi.

427
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,660
Qiao Yi.

428
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,220
Qiao Yi.

429
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,220
Qiao Yi.

430
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,500
Qiao Yi.

431
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,220
Yi.

432
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,340
Qiao Yi.

433
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,260
Hi.

434
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,260
Excuse me.

435
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,580
Have you

436
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
seen a guy

437
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,140
who doesn't look like an athlete

438
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,100
in a rose jacket

439
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,700
instead of a straitjacket?

440
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,820
No.

441
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,820
Thanks, anyway.

442
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,380
We're in the mountains.

443
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,780
The passing players all said

444
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,780
they hadn't seen Qiao Yi.

445
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,100
I think we need to split up.

446
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,700
Then let's split up.

447
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,580
We two will go east.

448
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,300
And you go west.

449
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,180
I mean, I'm a stranger here.

450
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,820
If

451
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,300
you are not worried I may get lost,

452
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,460
I can go alone.

453
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,220
OK.

454
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,620
Let's split up.

455
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,900
No matter whether we find him or not,

456
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,900
we have to get out of here before dark.

457
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,140
After that, we can call the police.

458
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,540
OK.

459
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,020
Yi.

460
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,820
Qiao Yi.

461
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,460
Mr. Ji,

462
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,980
can you please speed up?

463
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,060
Easy.

464
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,980
There's a GPS on Qiao Yi's GoPro.

465
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,140
I can just check it.

466
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,700
Why didn't you say this earlier?

467
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,460
I forgot it.

468
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,180
My boss has short memories.

469
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,300
Let me see.

470
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,300
(Device, Qiao Yi's GoPro)

471
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,700
Not far away from us.

472
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,180
He should be...

473
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,740
He should be over there.

474
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,220
Left or right?

475
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,060
Right or left?

476
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,460
Whatever.

477
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,180
I'll take the left.

478
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,580
The ancients respected the left.

479
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,420
Yeah. To the left.

480
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,620
Qiao Yi.

481
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,700
Qiao Yi.

482
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,980
But he should be here.

483
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,820
Where?

484
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,820
Qiao Yi's hat!

485
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,700
Are you all right?

486
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,540
Yeah.

487
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,500
So weird.

488
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,180
He should be here.

490
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,580
He lost it halfway.

491
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,940
It's a large forest.

492
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,860
And so many forks here.

493
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,420
He can be lost in the forest.

494
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,820
Let's go find him.

495
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,180
Easy.

510
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
did you plan this?

What did I plan?

512
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,100
I got it.

513
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,540
You are making use of this incident

514
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,660
to teach Qiao Yi a lesson.

515
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,380
Am I right?

516
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,980
Why would I make use of danger

517
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,580
which threatens his life?

518
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,220
I believe you.

519
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,220
But we really need to find him

520
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,300
as soon as possible.

521
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,220
He'll be in danger

522
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,260
when it gets dark.

523
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,340
Let's find shelter first.

524
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,940
Over there.

525
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,900
What should I do?

526
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,140
It's a cliff.

527
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,100
Rain in the mountains comes heavily,

528
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,620
but it won't last long.

529
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,580
I'm fine with it.

530
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,300
I'm not fine with it.

531
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
If you get sick,

532
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,100
I'll have to...

533
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,180
We'll have to take care of you.

534
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,340
I haven't listened for rain
in the mountains for a long time.

535
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,140
Did you often leave

536
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,980
for the mountain when raining

537
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,660
instead of staying at home?

538
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,700
When I was young,

539
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,700
my parents ran a farm

540
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,580
in the mountains.

541
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,980
When I was back home on vacation,

542
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,660
I would stay a few days
in the mountains.

543
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,420
I would run up the mountain

544
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,940
even though it rained.

545
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,060
When it rains in summer,

546
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,700
the stream will rise.

547
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,180
The dragonflies are not afraid
of getting their wings soaked.

548
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,140
They linger on the water's surface.

549
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,700
Like everything slows down.

550
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,140
Sounds quite interesting.

551
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,500
I never needed an air conditioner
before I joined

552
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,860
the Youth Sports School.

553
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,620
It was pleasantly cool in the summer

554
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,020
when living in the mountains.

555
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,500
Open my window,

556
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,820
and the wind would blow in.

557
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,420
The longan tree from the next yard

558
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,140
reached into our yard.

559
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,860
I could pick some to eat

560
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,380
if I opened the second-floor window.

561
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,100
That kind of life is something

562
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,820
that people like you who live in cities

563
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,420
will never experience.

564
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,980
Not everyone can survive hardships

565
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,580
as you do.

566
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,140
Exquisite life is also needed.

567
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,340
In case that accident may happen.

568
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,020
Mr. Ji,

569
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,940
you cherish your body so much.

570
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,540
And you take so many pills.

571
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,740
Are you born

572
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,860
with some terminal illness?

573
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,460
Your phone is ringing.

574
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,620
Hello, Hao?

575
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,020
OK.

576
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,380
I see.

577
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,180
Got it.

578
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,580
We'll be right back.

579
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,220
He found Qiao Yi.

580
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,260
Great.

581
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,540
It stops.

582
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,060
Keep it.

583
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,980
It's cold after the rain.

584
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,180
I don't need it.

585
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,140
You have a terminal illness.

586
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,140
You keep it.

587
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,460
You have it.

588
00:33:59,380 --> 00:33:59,900
What's wrong?

589
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,780
Nothing.

590
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,060
I just sprained my ankle.

591
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
Sit down. Let me check it.

592
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
You don't have to. I'm OK.

593
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,700
Just a sprain. Not serious.

594
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,220
Yeah, I said it.

595
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,740
Just a minor injury.

596
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,620
I got a lot of that

597
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,900
when I was under training.

598
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,260
What's the story of this scar?

599
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,340
I was injured

600
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,540
and had surgery.

601
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,540
So I couldn't do
long-distance running again.

602
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,700
Let's go.

603
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:04,940
Stay still.

604
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,020
Mr. Ji,

605
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,260
are you Doraemon?

606
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,940
There are so many things in your bag.

607
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,220
Just my habit.

608
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,780
To prevent from incident coming.

609
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,060
And to get myself braced.

610
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,820
Will you get tired?

611
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,100
My parents died young.

612
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,700
And I had to take care of my sister.

613
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,140
So I have to take more

614
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,100
into my consideration.

615
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,540
When I'm needed,

616
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,260
I can offer more help to people I love.

617
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,260
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

618
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,300
I'll carry you back.

619
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,740
No, no.

620
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,580
No need.

621
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,940
I can walk by myself.

622
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,740
Let's hurry back.

623
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,340
Maybe

624
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,140
it will rain again.

625
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,420
You sprained your ankle.

626
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,300
You shouldn't walk.

627
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:15,900
I'll carry you on my back.

628
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,660
Come.

629
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,780
On my back.

630
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,380
Be careful.

631
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,340
I will.

Zhou Tian,

635
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,300
where have you been?

636
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,180
It's so late now.

637
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,580
We...

638
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,460
Went to find you.

639
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,740
Where did you go?

640
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,060
I was lost.

641
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
I stopped

642
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,620
to catch the beautiful scenery.

643
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,580
You were gone when I resumed.

644
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,460
Thank goodness Zhang Hao found me.

645
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,860
What about you two?

646
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,700
We were looking for you.

647
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,700
Can you please

648
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,660
be less self-centered?

649
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
Do you know she got hurt

650
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,540
when looking for you?

651
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,300
Who got hurt?

652
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,220
It's OK.

653
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,540
I just accidentally sprained my ankle.

654
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,140
It can be serious.

655
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,460
How is it now? Let me see.

656
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,900
I-I can do...

657
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,340
Don't move.

658
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,660
Zhou Tian,

659
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:41,980
sorry.

660
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,780
I didn't mean to get lost.

Sorry.

662
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,300
It's OK. I'm fine.

663
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,700
It's a work injury.

664

I'll be paid for that.

665

You're fine?

666
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:52,900
Look at your ankle.

667
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,300
How swollen it is.

668
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,620
Not that swollen.

you're being overstrained.

Leave me alone.

I can make it myself.
