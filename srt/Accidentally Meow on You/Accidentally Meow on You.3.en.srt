So I'll just get to the point.

I heard that EX

I hope you can consider Qiao Yi.

Qiao Yi?

212
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,380
His readers

213
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,500
seem to be mostly young,

214
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,380
which is inconsistent
with our positioning.

A young writer like him

especially teenagers.

223
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,740
But, what makes Qiao Yi special

224
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,620
is that his novels

225
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,580
also have great influence

226
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,820

used other novels'.

251

This means that Qiao Yi's novels

are quite popular among readers.

There is a lounge for him upstairs.

any minute.

to have this cat coffee shop.

we could have this Kitties' Fairyland.

and time-consuming

506
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,460
to produce a bow tie like that.

507
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,860
So, you have to go without the bow tie.

508
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,420
Without it?

509
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,020
If he doesn't wear it,

510
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,900
we may get reproached by our client

511
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,700
and be ridiculed by the public.

512
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,100
Just say something useful, all right?

513
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,180
I have an idea.

514
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,740
The theme of the series

515
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,260
is the environment.

516
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,100
The designer also stressed

517
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,740
the application of natural materials.

518
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,780
As for the dyeing,

519
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,740
she used the ancient dyeing technique.

520
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,340
This got me thinking

521
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,340
that perhaps we should focus

522
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,020
on the theme, which is the environment.

523
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,140
Environment?

524
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
You are just saying that.

525
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,780
Do you have a specific plan?

526
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,380
Perhaps we could

527
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,220
make a bow tie out of this?

528
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,380
OK, Qiao Yi.

529
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,420
Please stay for a moment.

530
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,620
Qiao Yi,

531
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,860
I saw your bow tie from afar,

532
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,100
and I think it's pretty special.

533
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,060
But it doesn't seem

534
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,460
to be the original bow tie

535
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,780
of this outfit.

536
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,220
It's made of leaves, right?

537
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,740
Yes.

538
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,420
Are they real leaves

539
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,420
or preserved flowers that kind of thing?

540
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,300
It's made of real leaves.

541
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,780
You can touch it
if you don't believe me.

542
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,780
These are real leaves!

543
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,380
How creative.

544
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,100
But as far as I know,

545
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,260
EX had prepared outfits

546
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,740
for all guests today.

547
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,740
And it's widely known

548
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,020
that EX respects its designers a lot.

549
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,380
Don't you think

550
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,100
EX may take it as an offense

551
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,980
if you change their original design?

552
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,340
I don't think you have read the brochure

553
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,860
for the conference carefully.

554
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,380
You must bear in mind

555
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,100
what I'm about to say.

556
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:13,833
The...

557
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,660
EX and Ms. Amanda,

558
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,500
the trendy designer,

559
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
have jointly proposed the concept

560
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,580
of changing the aesthetics of clothes.

561
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,500
EX and Ms. Amanda,

562
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,580
the trendy designer,

563
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,620
have jointly proposed the concept

564
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,020
of changing the aesthetics of clothes.

565
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,900
Her design of the entire series

566
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,060
has shown her respect
for tradition and nature.

567
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,020
Her design of the entire series

568
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,020
has shown her respect
for tradition and nature.

569
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,020
All the cloths

570
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,020
are dyed with dyestuff made of plants,

571
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,340
which is the oldest dyeing technique.

572
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
All the cloths

573
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,260
are dyed with dyestuff made of plants,

574
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,820
which is the oldest dyeing technique.

575
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,500
She demonstrated her idea
of environmental protection.

576
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,300
Not just saying those words.

577
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,780
By actually doing something.

578
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,900
She started small

579
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,020
and integrated eco-friendly materials

580
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,460
with traditional clothes.

581
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,820
To gradually influence people

582
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,220
and promote the pro-environmental idea.

583
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,140
I think...

584
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,220
This is the true spirit

585
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,580
behind this conference.

586
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,940
I wanted to echo her design concept.

587
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,180
That's why

588
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,180
I changed a little.

589
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,220
I'm not a professional designer.

590
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,700
So my bow tie may not be fine.

591
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,140
But I want to make an effort

592
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,900
to show my support

593
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,580
for environmental protection.

594
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,900
I also urge you all

595
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,260
to cut down on expensive furs

596
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,540
and use more natural materials.

597
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,100
Well said!

598
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,500
Let's give him a round of applause.

599
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,060
Thank you.

600
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,100
Thank you for the speech, Qiao Yi.

601
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,660
This way, please.

602
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,220
Mr. Ji,

603
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,500
the president of the EX

604
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
came to Qiao Yi and told him

605
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,140
that he was a great embodiment

606
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,100
of the brand concept.

607
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,940
Does it mean

608
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,140
Qiao Yi is more likely

609
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,060
to get the job and be EX's endorser?

610
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,780
I must make sure he is.

611
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,140
I'll slow down today.

612
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,660
Mr. Ji,

613
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,060
if you no longer need me here,

614
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,780
I'll go home now.

615
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,500
It's time for me to get off work.

616
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,940
I told you before

617
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,580
that we agents must be on standby 24/7.

618
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,340
But the news conference is over,

619
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,860
and Qiao Yi also left.

620
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,340
Why do we have to work overtime?

621
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,460
Get in the car.

622
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Come on. Eat some.

623
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,740
Time to eat.

624
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,500
(Enough is enough!)

625
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,140
(Don't try to call me again!)

626
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,420
(So what?)

627
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,740
(Just leave me alone!)

628
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,980
(Or you'll be sorry!)

629
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,420
(Bathroom)

630
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,380
Well, looks like I'm done here.

631
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,740
So, bye, Zhang Hao.

632
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,820
OK.

633
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,220
(Is she in trouble?)

634
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,700
It's me,

635
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,100
Zhang Hao.

636
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,580
Zhang Hao?

637
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,460
Are you all right?

638
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,340
What are you doing here?

639
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,180
I heard what you said over the phone

640
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,260
at the shop.

641
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,340
I was worried you might get hurt

642
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,420
on your way home.

643
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,780
But I couldn't bring myself

644
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,140
to ask you directly.

645
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,500
That's why you are here in secret

646
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,780
to protect me?

647
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,180
But it seemed I was being a sad sack.

648
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,740
I frightened you.

649
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,380
No, you didn't.

650
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,420
I'm deeply touched

651
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,620
and also surprised.

652
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,860
Perhaps you can tell me

653
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,780
what kind of trouble you are in.

654
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,700
It's OK. No pressure.

655
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,060
You don't have to.

656
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,500
But if you do need me,

657
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,700
I'll always be there for you.

658
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,060
Come on. Let me walk you home.

659
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,140
OK.

660
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,860
Let's go.

661
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,860
What's new?

662
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,780
Mr. Ji. All the feedback

663
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,500
we got are favorable.

664
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,460
Qiao Yi's leaf bow tie

665
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,140
was also praised by Ms. Amanda.

666
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,580
She personally sent an email

667
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,020
to express her appreciation

668
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,380
for Qiao Yi's change of bow tie

669
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,420
and his support
for environmental protection.

670
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,700
(Publicity Programme
of Qiao Yi's Leaf Bow Tie)

671
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,420
That bow tie idea was brilliant!

672
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,740
Follow up on this.

673
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,180
- Use this data.
- OK.

674
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,700
Hey, Xia.

675
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,540
Now that the conference is over,

676
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,620
can we contact the client?

677
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,740
Did our client give any feedback?

678
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,860
Don't you know it's a tough business?

679
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,740
We must be productive
and efficient at Xing Yi.

680
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,420
But now,

681
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,420
we lost the original bow tie,

682
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,500
which could be

683
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,460
a huge hazard for us.

684
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,580
Seriously?

685
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:25,940
Yes.

686
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,180
- Mr. Ji will win this client for sure.
- Oh, OK.

687
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,300
Let's hurry up
and prepare the documents.

688
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,020
(Xing Yi Media)

689
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,220
(This could be a problem.
You should check it again.)

690
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,380
(Xing Yi Media)

691
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,460
Kevin, come in.

692
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,940
Mr. Ji, here is your ginseng tea.

693
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,460
The temperature is just right. 46.5℃.

694
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,860
Mr. Ji,

695
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
it was brilliant of you

696
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,580
to think of eco bow tie

697
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,580
and promote the theme

698
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,980
based on that.

699
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,780
It was Zhou Tian.

700
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,460
What?

701
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,940
I mean the eco bow tie.

702
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,020
It's her idea.
