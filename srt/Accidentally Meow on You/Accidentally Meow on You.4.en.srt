00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,860
Kevin, come in.

21
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,340
Mr. Ji, here is your ginseng tea.

22
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,860
The temperature is just right. 46.5℃.

23
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,260
Mr. Ji,

24
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,060
it was brilliant of you

25
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,980
to think of eco bow tie

26
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,980
and promote the theme

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
based on that.

28
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,180
It was Zhou Tian.

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,140
I mean the eco bow tie.

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
It's her idea.

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,060
The collar is not the point.

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,780
Qiao Yi's speech is very powerful.

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,500
Mr. Ji, you must be a genius.

34
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,900
Last night, some independent designers

35
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,580
spoke for Qiao Yi online.

36
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,900
They supported him.

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,060
They also expected

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,300
to cooperate with Qiao Yi

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,900
since he respects design and nature.

40
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,180
Genius.

41
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,260
Hello, Tina.

42
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,020
OK. No problem.

43
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,860
Is it settled?

44
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,220
Yes, basically.

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,460
Great.

46
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,620
If he gets this endorsement,

47
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,420
he won't
consider terminating the contract

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,220
or causing any other trouble.

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,020
He actually recruited Zhou Tian,

50
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,180
a rookie,

51
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,060
trying to trouble you.

52
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,220
How dare he?

53
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,900
However,

54
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,060
everything is under your control.

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
His scheme will never work.

56
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,620
Don't you have any work at hand?

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,300
I do.

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,580
I'll go meet the attorney
and the accountant

59
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,780
to follow up on the future contract.

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,260
Can't believe she left alone.

61
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,060
Hi, Mr. Ji.

62
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,820
Morning.

63
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,580
Do you want some breakfast?

64
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,380
It's 7 o'clock now.

65
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,580
Two hours later, we'll start working.

66
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
Instead of taking some rest,

67
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,020
you chose to order food?

68
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,820
I didn't order. It's too early now.

69
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
I went out and bought these.

70
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,700
I know nothing about this.

71
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,060
And I didn't help much.

72
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,100
So I thought

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,060
I could prepare some food.

74
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,900
When they wake up,

75
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,140
they have to start working.

76
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,860
Now they don't have to work hungry.

77
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,580
I thought you

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,740
were organizing Qiao Yi's work plan?

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,260
That's an easy chore.

80
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,580
I watched them

81
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,140
contact various parties and brands

82
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,420
to discuss the promotion plan

83
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,500
and feed data back all night.

84
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,660
I realized that

85
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,980
this is not an easy job.

86
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,060
A whole process system

87
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,820
is supporting it behind.

88
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,140
Behind every celebrity, it's a team.

89
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,260
Only by cooperating efficiently

90
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,580
and working harder than others

91
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,780
can this celebrity go further.

92
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,500
OK. I see.

93
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,060
I will study really hard.

94
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,660
I'll go ask them to have some food.

95
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,460
If Qiao Yi can successfully

96
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,220
win the endorsement of EX,

97
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,140
it'll be the first cooperation

98
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,860
between Xing Yi and EX.

99
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,180
Mr. Ji is so amazing.

100
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,460
Why?

101
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,540
Qiao Yi presented
in the fashion world before,

102
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,300
but he never officially
endorsed anything.

103
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,220
Lucy didn't pay much attention to it.

104
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,740
She would simply accept which paid more.

105
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,500
So,

106
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,140
Qiao Yi's commercial resource

107
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,020
has always been poor.

108
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,660
And it has a negative impact on him.

109
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,340
It must be hard for him.

110
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,980
I collected some of his profiles

111
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,500
for the job interview.

112
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,900
He is a good writer

113
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,220
and is known to the public
for he does charity

114
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,940
with his royalty income.

115
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,660
Yeah.

116
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,500
That's why I said

117
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,820
Mr. Ji is amazing.

118
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,340
I heard a lot of companies

119
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,620
are contacting EX.

120
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,260
Mr. Ji ingeniously settled the dispute

121
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,100
and made Qiao Yi stand out.

122
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,340
He's indeed a pro.

123
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,500
And it is said that

124
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,500
once this endorsement is settled,

125
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,820
we will be half achieved

126
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,780
on this year's performance.

127
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,060
- Morning, Mr. Ji.
- Morning, Mr. Ji.

128
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,700
Mr. Ji, morning.

129
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,580
Zhou Tian,

130
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,780
come.

131
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,380
Qiao Yi's schedule has changed.

132
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,460
Cancel his vacation next month.

133
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,860
Is the EX thing settled?

134
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,980
Only need a stamp now.

135
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,380
It'll be announced next week.

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,380
Qiao Yi is the first Asian endorser

137
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,940
of EX.

138
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,260
Mr. Ji,

139
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,380
you'll be the man

140
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,500
who makes history.

141
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,900
I'll deliver the good news to him.

142
00:06:48,820 --> 00:07:00,140
(Qiao Yi, Dialing)

143
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,700
No answer. He may be busy.

144
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
I'll text him on WeChat.

145
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,340
Red alert, Mr. Ji.

146
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,660
Someone charges Qiao Yi with plagiarism

147
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,260
before his book is published.

148
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,980
Indeed the ace of Xing Yi.

149
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,020
So many paparazzi here.

150
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,180
Don't move.

151
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,180
They know me.

152
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,900
We'll be under siege if we get out now.

153
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,540
Seriously?

154
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,940
You're a boss, not a celebrity.

155
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm a celebrity's agent.

156
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,780
We'll use underground parking.

157
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,460
Mr. Ji, why do you have

158
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,620
Qiao Yi's key card?

159
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,740
If you can't enter
your celebrity's house,

160
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,060
maybe you need

161
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,900
to reflect
on how terrible an agent you are.

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,660
I don't think

166
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,740
we should enter his house

167
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,740
when he's not home.

168
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,060
For his safety during critical periods,

169
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,860
we have to.

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,460
not spot the difference.

343
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,660
So what kind of star?

344
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,780
Light in every window.

345
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,620
I noticed that

346
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,780
the city lights look like the starry sky

347
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,340
when I stand upside down.

348
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,380
So dreamy and so healing.

349
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,700
My troubles,

350
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,100
no matter how big it is,

351
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,660
all vanish at that moment.

352
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,460
Seems you got great pressure

353
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,220
from work.

354
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,100
Exactly.

355
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
You really sound like

356
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,220
a fortuneteller.

357
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,220
Is it the peacock

358
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,660
or the crocodile

359
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
giving you a hard time?

360
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,740
Long story.

361
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,020
In a word,

362
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,140
the peacock meets the crocodile,

363
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,540
and everything just got tougher.

364
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,980
Got it.

365
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,300
All right. Take a rest.

366
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,380
Store up some energy.

367
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,020
And fight them tomorrow.

368
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,780
Nothing can't be fixed

369
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,780
in this world.

370
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,140
You just need

371
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,180
to find the right way to do it.

372
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,140
I'll take your word for it.

becoming more and more serious?

00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,380
I know, right?

441
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,540

on the plagiarism trend recently.

445

Who knows if this would happen?

446
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,900
It's like a slap in the face.

447
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,540
This is getting worse and worse.

448
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,020
Even other of our writers

449
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,180
are suspected groundlessly.

450
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,420
The impact is dramatic.

451
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,180
The board couldn't sit still

452

Zhou Tian!

454

to save the company.

456
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,380
Terminate his contract.

457
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,100
Sever his ties to the company.

458

You have to get off the dime.

459

Don't affect the whole company

you know this well, right?

I do.

464
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,980
The interests of the company

465
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,260
are the priority no matter when.

466
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,660
I'm glad you think so.

467
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,900
Hurry up, then.

468
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,100
Mr. Chen, please.

Mr. Chen.

Oh, girl.

471
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Did Mr. Ji scold you?

472
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,780
I just heard Mr. Ji say

473
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,020
the interests of the company
are the priority.

474
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,700
And Mr. Chen was urging him.

475
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,140
Sounds like

476
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,460
they're abandoning Qiao Yi.

477
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,700
It can't be.

478
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,820
Qiao Yi is the ace of Xing Yi
Literature Division Department.

479
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,260
He's an uncrowned writer.

480
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,620
Qiao Yi is not just a writer.

481
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,380
He is also of high brand value.

482
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,540
If the plagiarism is confirmed,

483
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,500
the corresponding penalty is high.

484
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,740
But Qiao Yi is wronged.

485
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,620
Is he?

486
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,340
Don't say anything

487
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,220
unless you know the specifics.

488
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,780
You know it.

489
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,100
Qiao Yi told you, right?

490
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,700
But are you sure he didn't lie?

491
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,020
Mr. Chen.

492
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,420
Congrats.

493
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,540
Qiao Yi is yours again.

494
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
Do you really think

495
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,140
he'll terminate Qiao Yi's contract?

496
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,260
If he lets Qiao Yi go,

497
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,140
what he said

498
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,580
about doubling the performance

499
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,140
will be really impossible.

500
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,820
He absolutely knows it.

501
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,700
Yet, in the current situation,

502
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,540
if he refuses to abandon Qiao Yi,

503
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,460
Qiao Yi will become a negative asset.

504
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,180
By then,

505
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,340
the penalty for the endorsements

506
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,100
will drain him.

507
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,660
I've found a friend in the press

508
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,980
to investigate for me.

509
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,260
Since Qiao Yi didn't plagiarize,

510

we can prove his innocence

511
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,660
as long as we find that poster.

512
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,460
I told you

513
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,700
to stay out of this.

514
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,460
Mr. Ji.

515
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,580
M-Mr. Ji.

516
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,820
We're just glancing over.

517
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,340
I think

518
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,060
I've finished my job.

519
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,780
Maybe

520
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,060
I should leave now.

521
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,180
See you, Mr. Ji.

522
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,380
Me too.

523
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Gotta go now.

524
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,460
Bye, Mr. Ji.

525
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,060
They just abandoned me.

526
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,540
Mr. Ji, I did stay out of it.

527
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,900
As an employee,

528
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,180
I'm just concerned about it.

529
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,340
Maybe I can offer you

530
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,100
some trifling clues.

531
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:31,980
No need.

532
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,500
Mr. Ji,

533
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,060
you must have a plan B now, right?

534
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Seems you really want me

535
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,020
to spare some time

536
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,580

It's my pleasure to serve you.

Excuse me. Are you Li Xiang's husband?

Sorry.

I work for Qiao Yi's agency.

Why me? I have nothing to do with it.

577
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,140
I know.

578
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,700
I want to contact her through you.

579
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,820
I want to confirm

580
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,980
if there's any misunderstanding.

581
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,980
Li Xiang is my wife.

But I have nothing to do with it.

583

I've done the investigation.

584

The prototype of the character

Am I right?

587
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,580
So, back then,

588
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,460
Li Luxi also contacted you, right?

589
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Yeah, I did meet with Li Luxi.

590
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,500
And we sighed... Sorry.

591

I know you want to help Qiao Yi.

592
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,460
But Xiang is my wife.

593
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,620
I love her. I can't betray her.

594
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,940
But what if you two are used?

595
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,580
From the beginning to the end.

596
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,420
Since you love her,

597
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
why don't you try to help her

598
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,220
get back on track?

599
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
Is it complicated?

600
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,860
Tricky.

601
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,540
Where's Qiao Yi?

602
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,340
Being dumb.

603
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,860
Welcome.

604
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,580
Here to terminate our contract?

605
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,140
Who says so?

606
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,780
Isn't this an open secret?

607
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,100
We'll hold an incident briefing

608
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,220
to explain the whole story tomorrow.

609
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,700
I'll prepare your speech.

610
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,900
OK.

611
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,940
Have a good rest.

612
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,300
I'll return to the company.

613
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,220
Did Mr. Ji force you

614
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,740
to stay up all night?

615
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,060
Look at your dark circles.

616
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,540
I found a new witness

617
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,020
who could testify for Qiao Yi

618
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,340
that he plagiarized under duress.

619
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,380
Great!

620
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,220
Mr. Ji is already here.

621
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,380
Go tell him.

622
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,380
OK.

623
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,220
What about the influencers I told you

624
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,100
to pay close attention to?

625
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,620
Two have no room for us tomorrow.

626
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,380
Still negotiating.

627
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,300
About the briefing,

628
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,180
it is all settled.

629
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,540
We've notified the media.

630
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,980
What briefing?

631
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,740
Is it about Qiao Yi?

632
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,660
What are you announcing?

633
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,900
Who allowed you in?

634
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,180
Who are you to ask?

635
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,900
I...

636
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,780
Don't ask me anything

637
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,700
before the briefing tomorrow afternoon.

638
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,300
I don't want to

639
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,100
answer any of your questions.

640
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,820
Out.

641
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,500

Shouldn't it be your triumphant return?

Why do you look gloomy?

651

I'm quitting.

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,540
Mr. Ji fired you?

No.

654
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,420
I want to quit.

655
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,340
Come on. Why are you so mad?

656
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,980
You went through a lot to join Xing Yi.

657
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,900
Did you forget it?

658
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,860
I didn't.

659
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,740
I just didn't expect this to be
such a cold-blooded

660
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,740
and heartless company.

661
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,380
But even though I'm quitting,

662
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,020
I have to handle Qiao Yi's matter

663
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,260
before I quit.

664
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,940
After all,

665
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm partly to blame

666
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,540
for what happened till now.

667
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,500
What on earth happened?

668
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,460
They're terminating Qiao Yi's contract.

669
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,660
The contract is finished.

670
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,580
Seriously? Abandoning Qiao Yi?

671
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,660
Also,

672
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,540
Mr. Ji is holding a briefing

673
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,020
to terminate Qiao Yi's contract openly.

674
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,300
They're trying

675
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,900
to sever the ties to Qiao Yi in public.

676
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,020
Sacrificing Qiao Yi to protect Xing Yi.

677
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,460
So ruthless.

678
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,340
Then, did you tell Mr. Ji

679
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,220
about what you've found?
