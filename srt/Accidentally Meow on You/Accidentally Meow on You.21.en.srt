I think it's great.

I know that

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,660
you were pretty upset

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,940
because I hid my identity

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,860
1003 from you before.

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,220
And now,

64
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,220
That's fine. You can stop explaining.

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,860
The truth is,

66
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,060
I'm not a petty girl.

67
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,060
So,

68
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,740
you are not mad at me anymore?

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,580
No.

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,700
I wasn't mad in the first place.

71
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,580
I just wanted to see how you reacted.

About this concert,

73
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,100
I have made my promise online.

74
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,580
We will take

75
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,620
part of the ticket sales

76
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,340
to establish a charitable fund.

77
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,500
It will be dedicated

78
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,140
to help sick children.

79
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,860
It was an ill fan of mine

80
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,860
who gave me

81
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,860
such an idea.

82
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,620
Her name is Song.

realize my value.

(Hey, guys. I'm Song.)

88
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,060
She made me realize

89
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,860
that I can't just

90
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,780
enjoy your attention and admiration.

91
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,780
I should give back to society as well.

00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,380
And I thought

174
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,500
he was being pretentious.

175
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,020
We have been busy preparing the concert
and book launch lately.

176
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,020
He didn't sleep well.

177
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,780

178
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,940
you must survive this.

179

Hello.

184
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm Yan Liang,

185
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,460
the director of the Administrative
Committee

186
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,340
of Ronghai Will Bank.

187
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,180
Hi.

188
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,740
Why is he here?

189
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
The will bank

190
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,540
is not just about keeping wills.

191
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,180
It also keeps blessing messages,

192
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,340
family videos,

193
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,140
and help announce wills.

194
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,460
With full respect

195
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,820
to our clients' will,

196
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,540
we help our clients' families

197
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,540
to complete their legal procedures
of property inheritance.

198
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,900
Mr. Ji Chen gave us

199
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,900
an instruction.

200
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,500
He asked me

201
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,340
to announce his will

202
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,780
if he became unconscious

203
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,140
due to his poor health.

204
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,780
His will?

205
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

206
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,580
Chen is not dead.

207
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,380
Why are you talking about his will now?

208
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,500
First,

209
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,300

But you then shook your head again...

I shook my head again

because you asked me
if he's hopeless now.

His body couldn't take it anymore.

And his brain suffered from
insufficient blood supply.

330
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,260
He must do some change
so that such thing can be prevented,

and his current condition
won't become worse.

344
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,340
Tian told us you are discharged.

345
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,860
So I asked Zhang Hao

346
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,580
to drive you home.

347
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,660
Why are you alone?

348
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,740
Where is Tian?

349
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,780
Gigi.

350
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,580
Hao.

351
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,140
Tian,

352
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,380
what's this about?

353
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,300
He wants a wheelchair.

354
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,540
What?

355
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,100
He can't walk himself?

356
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,660
He wants to rest.

357
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,420
The doctor said he was fine.

358
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,460
He just needs some rest.

359
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,420
Therefore,

360
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,780
he decided
to follow doctor's instruction

361
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,140
by resting and remaining still.

362
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,020
If you sit for too long,

363
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:31,900
your blood won't circulate well,

364
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,300
which may cause myophagism

365
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,540
on your legs.

366
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,900
Be careful.
You might not stand up again.

367
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
It's OK.

368
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,060
I have asked Kevin

369
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,020
to find me a private masseur.

370
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,020
I'll get a regular massage every day
at home.

371
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,540
Chen.

372
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,780
You are exaggerating.

373
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,620
The doctor said you are fine.

374
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,180
You don't have to be over-cautious.

375
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,020
There are some genetic diseases

376
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,180
that medical equipment can't detect.

377
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,660
Did you forget

378
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,100
how our grandpa and our dad

379
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,140
passed away?

380
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,820
They both

381
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,380
died of

382
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,300
congenital heart disease.

383
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,660
Gigi!

384
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,780
You...

385
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,460
We women don't get
to have such a disease.

386
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,020
And I like sports.

387
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,500
Ji Nian.

388
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,500
You should go home with me.

389
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,740
Why?

390
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,420
I'm your brother,

391
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,580
and I need someone to take care of me.

392
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,380
You must go with me.

393
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,660
No.

394
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,060
The shop is in need of help.

395
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,180
I have to stay there.

396
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,060
I can get you a nurse.

397
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,620
That won't work.

398
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,260
It only works well when you come
and take care of me yourself.

399
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,020
Pretentious.

400
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,940
I don't care.

401
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,220
You must go take care of me.

402
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,980
No.

403
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,500
You're being unreasonable.

404
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,380
I can take care of Ji Chen.

405
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,460
No, Tian.

406
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,140
After all, he's my brother.

407
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,340
It's my duty

408
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,300
to take care of him.

409
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,260
I can't let a bad-tempered girl like you

410
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,940
to take care of me.

411
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,820
Go leave us alone.

412
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,940
I don't want to see you.

413
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,340
We can take care of him together.

414
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,100
We can help each other.

415
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,180
I...

416
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,180
I...

417
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,860
Pass.

418
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,940
Ji Chen

419
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,420
is being a control freak again.

420
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,380
I won't let him have his way.

421
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,300
This time,

422
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,180
I won't compromise.

423
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,780
You can leave now.

424
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,940
I don't need you.

425
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,100
You may

426
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,820
give me

427
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
a heart attack.

428
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,700
Fine.

429
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,700
Since you don't want me,

430
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,420
I'll leave, as you wish.

431
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,980
Bye.

432
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,460
Zhang Hao,

433
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,340
go check on Ji Nian.

434
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,140
You shouldn't have been

435
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,620
mean to Nian.

436
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,660
My blood pressure is high again.

437
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,980
You wanna lie down?

438
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,540
I like this better.

439
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,660
Gigi.

440
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,980
Hao.

441
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,100
Are you alright?

442
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,100
Yeah.

443
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,940
Chen was pretending to be weak.

444
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,420
He wants Tian

445
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,180
to care for and hug him.

446
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,380
I see.

447
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,300
Well,

448
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,900
will you go back to the shop?

449
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,340
I'll go there later.

450
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,260
I have to meet a producer

451
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,100
and discuss some business.

452
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,100
Do you need me to drive you?

453
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,020
No.

454
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,100
The subway station is right there.

455
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,820
I can take the subway.

456
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,380
Fine.

457
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,860
Be careful.

458
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,420
OK.

459
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,820
We are home.

460
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,060
I'll ask the nurse

461
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,780
to come over and keep you company
tonight.

462
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,820
I don't like strangers at my home.

463
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,580
I need to go home.

464
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,140
I have everything here.

465
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,380
But I don't have any clothes here.

466
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,300
Eh...

467
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,060
What are these?

468
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,780
Mr. Ji.

469
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,260
I have prepared everything for her.

470
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,620
I bought pajamas, sportswear,

471
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,340
business wear, and underwear.

472
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,220
As you requested,

473
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,820
I bought all sizes.

474
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,900
Good.

475
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,300
I won't go in here.

476
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,340
Good night.

477
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,420
It's not dark yet.

478
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,020
Why did he say good night?

479
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,580
That's a lot of stuff.

480
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,540
It's quite cold now.

481
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,220
I can't wear this.

482
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,220
Eh...

483
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,820
Kevin is so bad at this.

484
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,060
It's perhaps because

485
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,780
he only shops for himself usually.

486
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,380
He doesn't have much experience
in buying lady stuff.

487
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,820
I should go back to my place.

488
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,220
I'm a patient

489
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,100
that no one wants to take care of.

490
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,900
My sister

491
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,500
doesn't want to come home with me.

492
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,700
And now, my girlfriend

493
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,220
doesn't want to accompany me either.

494
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,580
She is leaving me as well.

495
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,300
Where is this going?

496
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,300
It's OK.

497
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,700
I can be alone.

498
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,940
You can go home.

499
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,700
How do I make this work?

500
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,540
I...

501
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,580
I didn't mean that, Ji Chen.

502
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,180
Well, Tian.

503
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,340
Please stay

504
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,060
and accompany me

505
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,820
since I'm so pitiful.

506
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,180
All right.

507
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,820
(Mr. Ji!)

508
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,380
What are you looking at, Hao?

509
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,580
Nothing.

510
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,260
Gigi told me

511
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,620
that she was going to meet a producer

512
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,660
to discuss business.

513
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,660
But she's not back yet.

514
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,900
Can you tell me

515
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,100
if that is a male producer?

516
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,380
Hao.

517
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,340
You are so changed.

518
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,540
You are acting

519
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,580
exactly like

520
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,340
a miserable second female leading
in a romantic play.

521
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Stop that.

522
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm just caring for my employee.

523
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,140
If we are in the romantic play,

524
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
I should be the second male leading,

525
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,500
OK?

526
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,220
OK.

527
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,700
Then,
Gigi will be the second female leading.

528
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,500
You two can make a couple.

529
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,820
You're back.

530
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,060
Hao.

531
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,340
How was the business discussion?

532
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,900
It went well.

533
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,740
That producer

534
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,140
liked those songs I put online.

535
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,300
Not only did he want to sign up me
with big money,

536
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,420
but also had he made a plan
for my singing career.

537
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,740
He liked you?

538
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,820
That means

539
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,980
you will develop in showbiz.

540
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,380
You will leave me...

541
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,740
leave my coffee shop.

542
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,820
Well,

543
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,180
I'll stay

544
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,460
as long as you ask me to.

545
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
This is your chance.

546
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,260
I...

547
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,980
think it's a great opportunity.

548
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,820
It's good to be in showbiz.

549
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,380
This shop welcomes you back any time.

550
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,340
It will be a pity

551
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,780
if you give up your career.

552
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,740
Don't be so serious.

553
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,380
Rest assured.

554
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,620
I have declined

555

his offer.

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,340
Why?

557
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm still young.

558
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,420
I need to study more.

559
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,980
If I do want an agent,

560
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,940
I will go find Tian.

561

562

Don't you think

566
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,180
Gigi is a bit off?

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,340
She is?

568
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,900
How?

569
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,980
Come on.

570
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,140

to stoop down and explain this to you?

573
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,140
That wasn't about the business.

574
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,700
The business was only a cover.

575
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,940
Gigi basically

576
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,860
told you herself.

577
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,180
She wished you could

578
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
ask her to stay.

579
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,340
Why didn't you take the initiative?

580
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,380
But I didn't know.

581
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,660
Plus,

582
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,180
I can't just talk her into this.

583
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,580
How could she know your feelings

584
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,700
if you don't tell her?

585
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,700
Think about it.

586
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,380
You liked Tian for so long.

587
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,060
But you only told her your feelings

588
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,860
after Mr. Ji showed up.

589
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,140
That was too late.

590
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,060
Mr. Ji was brave

591
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,140
and resolute.

592
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,260
That's why he got Tian.

593
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,020
You have to be resolute,

594
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,820
in terms of the relationship.

595
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,780
Tell me.

596
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,340
I liked Zhou Tian
a couple of months ago,

597
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,260
but now, I like Gigi.

598

Does it make me a bad man?

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,500
Your heart wants what it wants.

600

It only takes you one second to decide

601
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,020
whether to love someone or not.

602
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,020
You lost your chance with Zhou Tian.

603
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,500
Do you want to lose Gigi as well?

604
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,420
We're not the same kind.

605
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,700
We shouldn't be together.

00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,340
Don't.

686
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,180
That water is getting cold.
You can have this one.

687
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,180
Come on. Open your mouth.

688
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,940
Careful. It's hot.

689
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:40,980
Well,

690
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
how do you like resting?

691
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,660
This is what my life is supposed to be.

692
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,860
I got the rest I deserve,

693
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,580
and I can enjoy your meticulous care.

694
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,020
I will take good care of you.

695
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,380
We will follow the doctor's instructions

696
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,860
and keep healthy.

697
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,940
Time for the meal.

698
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,140
Sit there.

699
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,180
What's for breakfast?

700
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,700
Seafood feast.

701
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,380
Go ahead.

702
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,620
This is seafood?

703
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,260
Yep.

704
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,100
I made more

705
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,380
for your sake.

706
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,060
You are the patient.

707
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,700
You must keep a light diet.

708
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,940
What now?

709
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,020
You can eat multiple times a day
but less food each time.

710
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,540
Let me have some more.

711
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,660
No.

712
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,180
We must attach great importance
to your health.

713
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,900
Zhou Tian.

714
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,300
That's all for my dinner?

715
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,380
You can't eat too much in the evening.

716
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,620
These fruits will help

717
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,620
reduce your intestinal burden.

718
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,620
I think

719
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,780
my food can be more diverse.

720
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,060
These red fruits

721
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,420
look bland.

722
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,260
They are food,

723
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,860
not art work.

724
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,780
Red food is conducive
to promoting blood circulation

725
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,660
and removing blood stasis.

726
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,420
They are good for your heart.

727
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,820
They can clear your blood vessels

728
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,340
and prevent arteriosclerosis.

729
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,540
They are perfect

730
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
for patients with a genetic disease

731
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,020
like you.

732
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,740
Come on.

733
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,740
Have one.

734
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,380
Zhou Tian,

735
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
are you gonna eat them all?

736
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,140
No.

737
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,620
Can I...

738
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,420
No.

739
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,140
You can't have unhealthy food.

740
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,180
But life is about trying

741
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,100
something new.

742
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,180
Nope.

743
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,180
Zhou Tian.

744
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,140
Can I go to work

745
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,700
tomorrow?

746
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,940
Nope.

747
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,060
You have to rest.

748
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,580
I...

749
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,340
So good.
