Ji Nian called me just now

21
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,580
and asked me

22
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,940
why I suspended you.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,220
Zhou Tian must have told her.

24
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,020
That's exactly what I expected.

00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,740
You are the wise one.

You used me to suspend you,

29
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,340
so the mastermind behind it

30
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,180
will be off guard.

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,300
Then, you can clear them all.

you are also adorable.

I'm so flattered.

But my dear Tian

48

173
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,260
You don't have to be involved in this.

174
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,180
Ms. Jiang,

175
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,420
Mr. Ji is Qiao Yi's agent,

176
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,420
and I'm Qiao Yi's executive agent.

177
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Qiao Yi was involved in this incident.

178
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,900
If we don't deal with it
at the earliest speed,

179
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,460
the thing will go viral
like it did last time.

180
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,020
Even if Mr. Ji

181
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,180
is no longer

182
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,060
the CEO of the company now,

183
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,180
he's still

184
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,300
Qiao Yi's agent.

185
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,900
If he is replaced,

186
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,020
Qiao Yi's approval

187
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,980
is at least necessary.

188
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,300
I have confirmed the thing

189
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
with Qiao Yi

190
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,780
on my way this morning.

(Zhou Tian,)

192
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,020
(Ji Chen is still my agent now.)

193
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,660
(He is the mere handler of my affairs.)

194

(Whoever wants to expel him)

195

(Without my approval,
no one could make it happen.)

197
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
So we are extending to you
our earnest desires

198
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,020
in the disposal of the incident

199
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,660
as soon as possible

200
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,580
on behalf of Qiao Yi,

201
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,420
lest the larger negative effects

202
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,900
would be made.

203
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,540
How lovely you are.

204
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,700
Wanna have some candies?

205
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,180
No?

206
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,860
I understand what you meant.

207
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,740
You just want me

208
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,660
to know that

209
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,300
I cannot drive

210
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,780
Ji Chen away as my pleasure.

211
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,940
Do you have a thing for him?

212
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,580
What you have done for him

213
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,420
has gone far beyond

214
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,060
what an employee might feel for a boss.

215
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
He's my boss,

216
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,460
and I have learned a lot from him.

217
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,980
It has nothing to do
with my affection for him.

218
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,260
I don't think

219
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,500
he should be

220
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,780
treated with injustice.

221
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
I hope you are not

222
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,420
taking deliberate aim at him.

223
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,460
The reason I asked him

224
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,340
to take over Xing Yi

225
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,780
was to have him

226
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,140
accumulate some performances,

227
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,940
so that I can take him back
to the headquarters.

228
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,540
My father thinks highly of him.

229
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,900
He will be one of our family

230
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,420
in the near future.

231
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,300
But it was surprising to me that

232
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,260
he totally forgot why he started.

233
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,060
So I must remind him
of his initial intention.

234
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,340
Without my support,

235
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,700
he would lose everything.

236
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,620
Don't you think you're selfish?

237
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,700
What does it matter to you

238
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,140
what I do to him?

239
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,060
Who are you to him?

240
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm nobody to him.

241
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,820
But I think

242
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,820
he really cares about the job,

243
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,380
and wants to do everything
to make Xing Yi a brighter future.

244
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,180
If you understand him,

245
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,900
or care about him,

246
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,060
you would never treat him like this.

247
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,460
I believe that

248
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,940
he won't yield to you.

249
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,100
In your mind,

250
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,300
the confidence can

251
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,660
solve every problem in the world?

252
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,020
I'm confident about Ji Chen.

253
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,180
How lovely she is!

254
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,420
Your sweetheart came to me just now.

255
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,100
She does have her attitude.

256
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
She attracts me.

257
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,380
Zhou Tian,

258
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,980
I got the information

259
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,140
of the producer named Liu Siliang

260
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,380
who you asked me to inquire about.

261
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,740
He works in Starry Films now.

262
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,820
I'll send his phone number to you

263

later.

Ji Nian, where is your brother?

270
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,140
He left in a flurry

271
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,460
after answering a phone call.

Is it Qiao Yi's?

Don't be that modest.

went into the meeting room just now.

with all my forces.

343
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,460
But I have to add some items

344
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
to the announcement

345
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,660
to make it

346
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,060
more practical.

347
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
We should publicize

348
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,020
the latest investigation result.

349
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,500
What result?

350
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,380
The only connection between Xing Yi
and Extreme Impala

351
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,820
was that Extreme Impala recommended

352
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,380
a film called Phantom City

353
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,700
to the investors as a financial product

354
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,180
in the name of Qiao Yi
being the producer.

355
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,340
This is the program description
of the film.

356
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,660
The confirmation letter
signed by Qiao Yi is included.

357
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,380
Xing Yi is also

358
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,460
on the list of their producers.

359
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,220
However,

360
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,660
I have confirmed that

361
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,540
Xing Yi has never signed the contract

362
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,980
with Qiao Yi,

363
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,700
nor any investment contract.

364
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,460
You should ask Ji Chen to explain.

365
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,700
He is Qiao Yi's agent.

366
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,420
He must have been
in charge of the matter.

367
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,900
The paper appeared in the group chat

368
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,220
of Extreme Impala at the soonest,

369
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,300
which was the end of last year,

370
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,300
earlier than the time
I took over Xing Yi.

371
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,780
So you mean

372
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,020
the paper is fake?

373
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,660
No.

374
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,340
I have checked that

375
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,540
the official seal
on the contract was true.

376
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,060
It suggests that

377
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:06,940
it was made

378
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,420
by someone inside Xing Yi.

379
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,460
Qiao Yi's agent back then

380
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,420
was Lucy.

381
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,740
And he said that

382
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,460
Lucy asked him to attend

383
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,860
Extreme Impala's party.

384
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,620
You passed the buck

385
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,460
to a former employee.

386
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,900
Have you confirmed it with Lucy?

387
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,780
Did she admit it?

388
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,700
She turned off her phone,

389
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,660
and her whereabouts remain unknown.

390
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,380
So?

391
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,140
What's the point of your proof?

392
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,500
It didn't make any difference.

393
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,380
Though her whereabouts
still remain unknown,

394
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,100
I have found the producer

395
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,740
on the paper.

396
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,420
I got his recordings.

397
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,620
Producer?

398
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,820
Please,

399
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,580
we are hectic.

400
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,900
We don't have much time

401
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,900
to watch your show.

402
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,900
If you do have the proof,

403
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,060
show it to us.

404
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,300
Mr. Chen is right.

405
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,460
(Can you explain)

406
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,900
(the whole thing to us?)

407
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,540
(The project doesn't exist at all.)

408
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,580
(Extreme Impala asked me)

409
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,020
(to make a film for them.)

410
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,540
(They said Qiao Yi
would be the scriptwriter,)

411
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,380
(and wished that I could do the budget.)

412
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,860
(I was afraid it was a trap,)

413
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,940
(so I asked)

414
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
(to have a face-to-face negotiation)

415
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
(with Qiao Yi's agent.)

416
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
(They showed me)

417
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,820
(a confirmation letter
with Qiao Yi's signature.)

418
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,860
(Voice Memo)

419
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
(I wasn't completely convinced,)

420
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,180
(with the fear that
it could be a fake one.)

421
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,260
(So I asked my friend)

422
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,660
(to contact Lucy.)

423
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,100
(Lucy confirmed it with me in person.)

424
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,060
(We had the meeting a few times,)

425
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,820
(and started to talk
with actors and actresses.)

426
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,300
(They then said it wasn't urgent.)

427
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,700
(They needed a program description
from me.)

428
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,420
(I wasn't secure then,)

429
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
(so I told them)

430
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,940
(we should first put it on record
in the National Film Board.)

431
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,100
(I need them to offer the letter of)

432
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,300
(investment confirmation.)

433
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,300
(I heard them)

434
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,780
(make a phone call to a man,)

435
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,540
(who was Mr. Chen from Xing Yi.)

436
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,340
(That Mr. Chen said)

437
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,220
(he would deliver the letter
with the seal to us.)

438
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,180
(Did you see Mr. Chen?)

439
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,060
(After the meeting that night,)

440
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,220
(they had dinner together.)

441
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,300
(I wasn't invited.)

442
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,780
(But I saw Mr. Chen come.)

443
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,580
(I gave them the stamped document.)

444
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,420
(And they copied one and sent it to me.)

445
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,700
(Then, they went for food.)

446
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,860
(Later, I realized that this project)

447
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,020
(was entirely infeasible.)

448
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,660
(They promised to sign the contract)

449
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,580
(but didn't.)

450
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,780
(So, I dropped the project.)

451
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,620
Mr. Chen.

452
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,260
Please explain yourself.

453
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,140
What do you mean?

454
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,140
Just because of this sound recording?

455
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,700
Are you implying

456
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,620
that I'm the guy he mentioned?

457
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,260
First, I'm not even sure

458
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,300
whether this sound recording
is authentic.

459
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,860
Besides,

460
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,420
how did he know

461
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,380
that Mr. Chen

462
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,060
was the actual president

463
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,820
of Xing Yi?

464
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,900
As far as I can see it,

465
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,260
you arranged this person.

466
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,900
Well,

467
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,020
we can get him up here

468
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,860
and let him speak.

469
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,780
He's waiting in the car downstairs.

470
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,460
You have two options now.

471
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,540
We can let the police have him,

472
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,860
and they will take over the matter.

473
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,740
Or you tell everyone here

474
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,460
what happened.

475
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,380
Mr. Chen.

476
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,420
Don't be nervous.

477
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,540
My father and you

478
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,660
have been good friends for so long.

479
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,500
Last night,

480
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,300
I told him about you.

481
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,820
He thought

482
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,820
that as long as you admit

483
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,380
and turn in the money,

484
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,180
we will handle this ourselves.

485
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,220
Otherwise, we will call the police.

486
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,100
[*Alarm Call]

487
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,540
You have 10 seconds.

488
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
One, two...

489
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,060
Seven...

490
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,660
What? That's way too fast.

491
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,140
Nine...

492
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,460
Fine.

493
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,180
I'll confess.

494
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,420
Back then,

495
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,540
Extreme Impala reached me.

496
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,900
They said they could turn film
and television projects

497
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,580
into financial products.

498
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,340
And I could get the money back

499
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,220
before shooting.

500
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,300
I had no idea

501
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,940
the company could collapse.

502
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,940
Later, they asked me

503
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,060
to get Screenwriter Confirmation Letter
from Qiao Yi.

504
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,540
I asked Lucy to get it.

505
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,900
How about this?

506
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,540
I'll turn in every penny

507
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,780
I received.

508
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,700
You guys can act like
you don't know about this.

509
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,340
We can,

510
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,860
but the police won't allow it.

511
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,420
We should

512
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,860
let the police handle this.

513
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,580
Hold on.

Jiang.

515
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,780
You just said

516
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,780
you wouldn't call the police.

517
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
What did I just say?

518
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,340
You said we would handle it ourselves,
instead of calling the police.

519
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,860
My dad suggested we keep it
from the police.

520
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,100
But that doesn't mean

521
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,820
he won't call the police.

522
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,460
You...

523
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,820
Mr. Chen.

524
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,620
What a hero you are.

525
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,620
I'm not a hero.

526
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,780
I just don't want you, a taekwondo pro,

to break his ribs

528
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,940
if he actually goes near you.

529
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,740
In that case, we can't explain ourselves
to the police.

530
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,580
You are right.

531
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,660

559

you came to me that day?

560

that the producer of the project

You being upset

Ji Chen is not a commodity

you're letting Ji Chen dangle.

Playing hard to get

If you keep pestering him,

645
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,820
I'll make him unable

to take the CEO position back forever.

647

Is this how you get the person you like?

648
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,220
You are threatening him with his career,

649

one thing that he cares about the most.

650
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,260
No wonder he didn't go to watch

the rehearsal of Qiao Yi and Li Ang.

652

I just want him
to see the bigger picture here.

Tell me.

What do I want?

658

in this world

660

that you can't buy with money.

661
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,380
At least,
you can't buy my affection to Ji Chen.

Ms. Jiang.

663
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,180
You don't have to threaten me
with his career.

No matter what happens,

I'll face it with him.

666

I like him, and he likes me.

667

Nothing and nobody

668
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,780
can break us apart.

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,380
What a confession of love.

Please don't be mad.

679
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,220
The reason why I'm back this time

680
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,180
(was to)

681
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,740
(help Ji Chen to pursue you.)

682
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,020
(He may seem)

683
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,860
(to be vigorous and resolute.)

684
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,300
He has never been in a relationship
before.

685
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
He doesn't know about girls.

686
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,220
That's why I wanted to help him.

687
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,860
Take a bite yourself.

688
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,780
You want me to help you with dressing?

689
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,300
So, you were targeting me all along?

690
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,580
And you pretended to sacrifice Ji Chen?

691
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,780
All was but a scam?

692
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,140
It wasn't all a scam.

693
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,620
We had to stabilize Mr. Chen,

694
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,660
you know?

695
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,580
Nevertheless,

696
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,580
what do you think of our acting skills?

697
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,780
Good.

698
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,500
Great.

699
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,700
So,

700
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,580
Ji Chen knew everything?

701
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,700
You two planned all these

702
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,420
from the very beginning, didn't you?

703
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,620
Yeah, he knew.

704
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,020
He liked the plan.

705
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,820
I...

706
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,260
Zhou Tian, please listen to me.

707
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,420
Jiang Hanyi,

708
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,580
stop talking!

709
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,660
(Well...)

710
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,420
She's gone.

711
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,180
And she seemed mad.

712
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,660
(But now, you have the chance)

713
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,620
(to make her feel better.)

714
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,580
Make yourself disappear now!

715
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,860
What's with the attitude?

716
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,500
I did make her

717
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,580
confess her love to you.

718
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,140
(I should at least get some credit
for that.)

719
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,900
(Don't you think so?)

720
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,260
(But)

721
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,740
(I'm done playing here.)

722
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,420
You have to take over from here.

723
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,660
You can be the CEO again.

724
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,500
Bye.

725
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,740
Cute.

726
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,980
Hello?

727
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,420
The car is here?

728
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,580
Thanks.

729
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,180
(Calling Zhou Tian)

730
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,660
Thanks.

731
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,940
Sweetie,

732
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,500
I have successfully messed up

733
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,740
Ji Chen's relationship.

734
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,180
Now, I can get out of here.

735
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,820
See you in 12 hours.

736
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
(I'll pick you up.)

737
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,700
Thanks.

738
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,020
And we also arranged first-aid personnel

739
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,860
and security guards.

740
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,460
Good.

741
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,340
Security guards are already in place.

742
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,300
OK.

743
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,220
Zhou Tian,

744
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,180
can I have a word with you?

745
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,100
Is it about work?

746
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,140
I didn't lie to you.

747
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,260
It was all Jiang Hanyi's doing...

748
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:00,780
Mr. Ji.

749
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,980
Li Ang's concert is about to begin.

750
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,180
And we have a lot

751
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,940
to do here.

752
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,860
Are you really gonna

753
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,740
make me stand here

754
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,140
and listen to your personal matters?

755
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,220
This is very important.

756
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,900
If we can't

757
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,620
sort this out,

758
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,740
we might as well stop the concert.

759
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,780
What?

760
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,180
This concert may mean nothing to you,

761
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,100
but it means everything
to Li Ang and me.

762
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:17,900
Zhou Tian,

763
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,900
he deceived you.

764
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,700
You can't forgive him.

765
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,740
Otherwise, I'll fire you.

766
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,340
You need me now?

767
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:27,860
Hello?

768
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,580
Yeah, I heard you.

769
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,780
Hey, Zhou Tian.

770
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,500
Please listen to me.

771
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,500
- No, this matter...
- Attention, everyone.

772
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,620
There are five minutes left
before the concert.

773
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,140
The concert will be on in five minutes.

774
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,660
I can think of nothing but work
right now.

775
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,260
Sorry.

776
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,460
I really can't talk
about your personal matters.

777
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,580
Wait, Zhou Tian.

778
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,580
How can I explain myself to her?

779
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,340
By the way, Hao.

780
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,580
I think

781
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,420
you do have feelings for Gigi.

782
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,780
Why don't you tell her?

783
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,740
It's not that I don't want to tell her.

784
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,700
I just fear that it may be
a misunderstanding.

785
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,500
What do you mean?

786
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,980
I'm not sure

787
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,940
if she likes me for being me

788
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,180
or being the champion.

789
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,820
I once met a girl

790
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,620
at the training base.

791
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,780
She brought me lunch every day

792
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,300
until I came as the second place

793
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,700
in one competition.

794
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,820
She never showed up again.

795
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,340
She believed that I, as her idol,

796
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,620
must win first place every time.

797
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,740
Otherwise,
I wouldn't be attractive to her.

798
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,260
The truth is, we can't take the feelings

799
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,660
a fan has for her idol seriously.

800
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,660
But Gigi

801
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,100
is different.

802
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,780
She's a good girl

803
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,620
but not mature enough.

804
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,660
That's why I have to remain rational.

805
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,300
Zhou Tian,

806
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,300
I wasn't finished earlier.

807
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,180
Mr. Ji.

808
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,860
It's a critical moment

809
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,220
for the concert.

810
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,620
Don't you think it's unprofessional

811
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,820
to talk about personal matters now?

812
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,180
I don't care.

813
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,860
Welcome our special guest

814
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
of the concert,

815
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,060
Qiao Yi!

816
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,660
Now,

817
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,180
I want to

818
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,380
share a few things with you.

819
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,900
If you can't forgive me for now,

820
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
I'll follow you around until you can.

821
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,660
If you can never forgive me,

822
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,820
I'll follow you for the rest of my life.

823
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,540
I'll never let you go.

824
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,740
In the last couple of months,

825
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,620
my life

826
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,540
has been like riding a roller coaster.

827
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,700
There were a lot of ups and downs.

828
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,140
So many things happened.

829
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,940
I almost gave up on myself.

830
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,700
Let me go.

831
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,660
But

832
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,620
my friends and colleagues

833
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,420
were always there for me.

834
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,020
I'd like to thank them

835
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,580
for their trust and support.

836
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,020
I'm grateful

837
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,380
that they didn't give up on me.

838
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,100
For starters,

839
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,460
I want to thank

840
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,780
my best friend,

841
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,780
tonight's star,

842
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,660
a man who accompanied me

843
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,700
when times were tough

844
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,340
and created that beautiful song,

845
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,460
Li Ang!

846
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,020
Li Ang!

847
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,220
Li Ang!

848
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,740
