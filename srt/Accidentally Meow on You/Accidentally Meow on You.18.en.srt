Bravo!

How could I expect that

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,890
you ruin this place?

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,540
Did you explode the place?

I can't be the only one to blame.

25

You played a part too.

incapable and slow.

No,

31
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,980
that's inaccurate.

OK, fine.

I know what you wanna say.

36
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,450
Just keep that sarcastic remarks
to yourself,

37
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,860

that we can only talk about work
in working hours,

40
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,650
perhaps I can make use
of non-working hours.

Thanks, but no.

Just consider it a benefit

to be almost an example
in this industry.

look far from where I stand,

we should work on,

please tell me.

Our company is in the downtown area.

There are plenty of buses
and subways nearby.

101
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,720
It's quite convenient.

102
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,520
I don't think
a shuttle bus is necessary.

103
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,860
I'll get to it.

Not yet.

Mr. Ji lives
at least dozens of kilometers

from your station.

167
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,910
Why would he make such a detour?

168
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,360
Because of Zhou Tian.

169

Mr. Ji.

170
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,390
Next station is
the Third Xinxiu Village.

171

This is from Mr. Ji.

He doesn't want you guys

to get bored on the way to work.

No need to put one here.

not take the bus today?

Why is he in sportswear?

He looks good even in that sportswear!

Look how energetic he is.

Yes, he is.

He's literally chasing her.

Slowly.

I can't believe
Zhou Tian could be so cruel.

It's a shame

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,530
Good morning, Mr. Kevin.

342
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,530
Who is she?

343
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,980
She is Jiang Hanyi,

344
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,810
her father is president
of the An Sheng Group.

345
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,570
She's here to inspect our work.

346
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,900
Well, I should go.

347
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,530
Well, is this Ms. Jiang

348
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,740
the fiancee of Mr. Ji

349
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,180

(Meeting Room)

351
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,090
Let me introduce her to you.

352
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,330
She is from An Sheng Group...

353
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,420
I'm one of you.

354
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,290
No need to be so formal.

355
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,530
Hello, I'm Jiang Hanyi.

356
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,660
I only came back recently

357
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,290
to help our president

358
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,370
with some business.

359
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,700
I heard that according to KPI,

360
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,220
Xing Yi had beaten the target
in this quarter.

361
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,980
I was hoping

362
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,570
to learn something from you guys.

363
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,330
You must be Zhou Tian.

364
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,330
Mr. Ji told me

365
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,220
that most achievements of the company

366
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,700
were from Qiao Yi and his commercials.

367
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,530
And you played a vital role.

368
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,770
Not really.

369
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,740
We all worked hard.

370
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,770
I'm the least experienced member
in our team.

371
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,980
It's good to be humble.

372
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,050
But this is business,

373
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,660
and results matter here.

374
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,770
I hope
you can all show the real you here.

375
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,090
You can show what you got,

376
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,260
may it be about work
or personal feelings.

377
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,980
You don't have to hide.

378
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,050
Right, Zhou Tian?

379
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,290
Mr. Ji.

380
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:15,900
Ms. Jiang.

381
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,260
Do you want coffee?

382
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,850
Give me my usual.

383
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,020
And bring Ms. Jiang a cup of hot latte.

384
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,530
Make sure it's dark roasted Mandheling,

385
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,530
semi-sweet and with almond milk.

386
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,770
Does anyone else need coffee?

387
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,090
Zhou Tian,

388
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,500
do you want one?

389
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,370
What kind of coffee do you want?

390
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,180
(What do I want?)

without asking.)

393
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,980
No, thank you.

394
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,610
Well,

395
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,260
I won't have coffee either.

396
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,700
Just bring one for Ms. Jiang.

397
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,570
OK.

398
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,770
OK.

399
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,940
Without further ado,

400
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,570
let's begin our weekly meeting.

401
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,660
I'll start with the agency business.

402
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,330
Speaking of the agency business
of Xing Yi this week,

403
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,290
we must go through
the performing section first.

404
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,020
(Financial Statement)
This

405
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,260
is Xing Yi's last quarter...

406
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,370
What? Why is there a blank space?

407
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,460
(You are the boss.
How could you not know?)

408

(This blank space is so obvious.)

409
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,980
(And there is no document
for our meeting.)

410
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,420
That was a mistake.

411
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,460
I'll make sure everything is OK

412
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,610
upon meeting.

413
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,980
It's OK. I'll do it myself.

414
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,130
(Mr. Ji)
It seems that "Silent Cry"

415
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,700
will be released soon.

416

(We have been communicating
with the producer...)

417
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,330

We have been communicating

418
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,700
with the producer
about the publicity program.

419
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,810
What I'm saying is that

420
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,850
you can take your parents

421
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,460
to watch it.

422
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,180
You will see your name
at the end of the film.

423
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,330
Why would there be my name?

424
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,460
The producer will put on all names
of major creators there.

425
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,810
Please pass my coat on to me.

I have plans for tonight.

428

So, I can't have dinner with you.

429
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,130
Is this about work?

430
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,850
I'll ask Kevin to drive you.

431
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,180
No, thanks. I'll be with several ladies.

432
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,460
Is he worried that something may happen

433
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,500
to a delicate girl like me?

434

I'm not worried about you.

435

I just don't trust

436
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,260
those girls who you hang out with.

437
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,980
What!

438
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,610
I'm out of here.

There is a new restaurant downstairs.
Let's go...

I'm not feeling well. So, no.

You can't possibly buy those rumors.

455

But you'll know her
if you give her a chance.

458
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,530
She likes girls.

459
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,770
She'll never like me.

Don't worry.

462

Neither was I mad at you,

463

nor did I misunderstand you.

464
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,180
Excuse me. If you are not here

465

to talk about work,

466

It just turned 6:00 p.m.

I can't believe Mr. Ji has left already.

I don't want to work overtime today,

We didn't get to have lunch together.

Perhaps we can have dinner now.

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,770
I begin to think
you have caused a misunderstanding

508
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
between Zhou Tian and me.

509
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,420
Misunderstanding?

510
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,090
That's a good thing.

511
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,980
You are a stubborn man,

512
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,090
and you finally find someone you like.

513
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,220
You are so close

514
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,330
in winning her over.

515
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,140
I must stay

516
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,220
and help you.

517
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,610
Otherwise, I would have gone long ago.

518
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,460
You know
I'm about to get married next month.

519
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,530
I didn't ask for your help.

520
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,940
You may make things worse.

521
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,260
That's impossible.

522
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,770
You should give me some credit.

523
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,420
As a woman,

524
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,530
I know what a woman thinks and likes.

525
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,660
The moment

526
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,130
when I saw your Tian,

527
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,900
I knew how to win her over.

528
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,980
Don't you think

529
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,090
she looks lovely

530
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,530
and cute

531
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,700
when she gets upset.

532
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,460
Come to think of it,

533
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,610
she is kind of cute.

534
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,420
I'm warning you.

535
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,740
Don't try to hit on her.

536
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
No worries.

537
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,090
I'm on your side.

538
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,420
Unless,

539
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,180
you want to make a move to me.

540
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,180
I'd rather hit on a guy

541
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,420
than you.

542
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,290
Anyway,

543
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,660
you don't have to worry about me.

544
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,420
If you have nothing to do,

545
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,770
you can go check on Nian.

546
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,900
You can ask

547
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,460
what her plans are.

548
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,660
When will she finish her degree?

549
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,740
She can't work

550
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,610
in that coffee shop forever.

551
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
OK. Got it.

552
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,700
Well,

553
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,020
I'll go sleep now. Good night.

554
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,810
How could I

555
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,130
not think for you?

556
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,180
Let me adjust that tie for you.

557
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,610
Who is she?

558
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,370
She's Jiang Hanyi.

559
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,180
Her father is president
of the An Sheng Group.

560
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,220
(Is this Ms. Jiang)

561
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,610
(the fiancee of Mr. Ji)

562
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,050
(that people talk about?)

563
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,090
Give my money back.

564
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,980
You fraud.

565
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,180
Give my money back.

566
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,020
You fraud.

567
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,090
Give my money back.

568
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,980
You fraud.

569
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,090
Give my money back.

570
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,180
You fraud.

571
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,020
Give my money back.

572
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,900
What's going on here?

573
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,580
No idea.

574
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,050
They are already here when we arrive.

575
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,380
With so many people blocking the door,

576
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,290
we can't even get in.

577
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,530
We should call the police.

578
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,180
Yeah, good idea.

579
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,020
Let me call the police.

580
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,850
You want to call the police?

581
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,370
We are the victims here.

582
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,810
Where is Qiao Yi? Get him out.

583
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,290
I paid the full price
six months in advance

584
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,420
to buy the Extreme Impala.

585
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,050
Because it was endorsed by Qiao Yi.

586
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,340
But now, I didn't get my car.

587
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,540
And that auto company vanished.

588
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,220
Extreme Impala?

589
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,850
Qiao Yi has never endorsed it.

590
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,090
How about this?

591
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,660
I'm Qiao Yi's executive agent.

592
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,980
You can tell me what happened exactly.

593
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,530
Do I look like a fool?

594
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,370
You are an executive agent.

595
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,130
So what?

596
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,090
You can't decide anything.

597
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,090
We wanna see Qiao Yi.

598
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,770
- We want Qiao Yi!
- We want Qiao Yi!

599
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,460
- We want Qiao Yi!
- We want Qiao Yi!

600
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,220
- We want Qiao Yi!
- We want Qiao Yi!

601
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,050
- We want Qiao Yi!
- We want Qiao Yi!

602
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,370
- We want Qiao Yi!
- We want Qiao Yi!

603
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,660
I'm Qiao Yi's agent,

604
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,220
and I'm the boss here.

605
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,610
You can talk to me.

606
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,020
(Xing Yi Media)
Here is the fact.

607
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,050
Qiao Yi recommended

608
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,460
a new car named Extreme Impala.

609
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,420
As his fans,

610
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,370
we trusted him,

611
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,180
and we believed the product

612
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,330
he recommended must be good.

613
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,290
That's why we paid the full price
six months in advance.

614
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,570
Now, it's time to pick up our cars,

615
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,530
but we can't find the dealer.

616
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,420
You said that

617
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,220
Qiao Yi endorsed Extreme Impala.

618
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,610
But we just reviewed

619
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,940
all the business contracts here,

620
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,130
and there is no contract
relating to this auto company.

621
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,820
What do you mean?

622
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,730
Are you saying

623
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,420
that we are here

624
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,610
to find trouble with you?

625
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,690
We saw Qiao Yi's pictures on the website
of Extreme Impala,

626
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,940
and there were posters of him

627
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,420
in the auto shop.

628
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,060
If he's not paid to endorse that car,

629
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,530
how could his pictures be used there?

630
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,620
Plus,

631
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,620
there were pictures

632
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,420
of him and the CEO of that company.

633
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,460
That can't be fake.

634
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,900
He even wrote a post on Weibo about it.

635
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,020
But we didn't find
any endorsement contract.

636
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,250
I think there must be
some misunderstanding here.

637
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,210
Guys,

638
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,250
I hope you can go back and wait.

639
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,860
We will get to the bottom of it

640
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,900
and get back to you.

641
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,170
No, we won't.

642
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,340
The manufacturing company
is gone already.

643
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,780
I can't believe you are still trying

644
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,690
to fool us around.

645
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,700
Get Qiao Yi out here.

646
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,900
We wanna see him.

647
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,020
- Get him out.
- Get Qiao Yi out.

648
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,860
Get Qiao Yi out here.

649
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,530
You leave us no choice
but to call the police.

650
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,380
Hanyi.

651
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Please calm down.

652
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,690
This is nothing personal.

653
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,780
We just want the police

654
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,060
to help and investigate this issue.

655
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,130
There is so much

656
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,170
we need to figure it out.

657
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,820
It's best if we let the police help.

658
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,780
We will get to the bottom of this.

659
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,210
What do you think?

660
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,250
OK.

661
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,340
OK.

662
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,460
Kevin, go with them.

663
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,610
Rest assured.

664
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,730
We will give you an explanation.

665
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,730
Please come with me.

666
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,250
Hanyi, you...

667
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,210
I know.

668
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,250
I have already contacted

669
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,420
the legal department of our group.

670
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,090
They will send a lawyer.

671
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,780
And someone is already
doing the background check

672
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,060
of the company behind
the Extreme Impala.

673
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,780
Zhou Tian, where are you going?

674
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,300
I'll go find Qiao Yi.

675
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,780
I'm worried that he might do something

676
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,690
when he saw the negative news.

677
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,730
I'll take a legal counsel and a lawyer

678
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,610
and go with you.

679
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,980
It's pretty clear now.

680
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,780
That company used the publicity photos

681
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,090
of Qiao Yi at a cocktail party,

682
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,570
and distorted them

683
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,940
into endorsement photos.

684
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,380
I'll ask our firm

685
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,820
to prepare an official statement.

686
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,900
But before that,

687
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,250
Qiao Yi can't answer

688
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,610
any questions from the press.

689
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,780
He's right.

690
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,380
Qiao Yi has an exclusive interview

691
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,540
this afternoon.

692
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,820
Zhou Tian.

693
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,050
You stay here and help Qiao Yi

694
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,940
prepare for it.

695
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,420
Make sure he can handle it.

696
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,530
We will go back

697
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,650
and prepare the statement.

698
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,210
Ok, Mr. Ji.

699
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,940
Now, now.

700
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,300
Don't be upset.

701
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,820
About the interview,

702
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,130
I'll talk to the press in advance.

703
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,340
However,

704
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,090
some reporters with bad intentions

705
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,050
may ask you about the Extreme Impala.

706
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,900
You can just say

707
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,940
that you have never
endorsed Extreme Impala,

708
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,090
and you are a victim as well.

709
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,900
Our company

710
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,610
will issue a statement about it.

711
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:24,690
Come on.

712
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Can you repeat what I just told you?

713
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,900
I...

714
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,300
I have never endorsed Extreme Impala,

715
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,300
I...

716
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,020
I...

717
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,380
Why is this happening to me!

718
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,820
First, there was that copyright dispute,

719
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,300
and now the Extreme Impala incident.

720
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,420
I have read what people say online.

721
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,730
Many people believed that I
endorsed that car.

722
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,380
They paid full price because of me.

723
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,860
It was my fault.

724
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,050
They trusted me so much.

725
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,170
But I can't do anything for them.

726
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,090
Instead, I got them ripped off.

727
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,380
Well,

728
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,780
you did something, actually.

729
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,340
Do you remember

730
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,570
that I have been interacting
with your fans

731
