What is it?

23
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,420
I have finished reading the documents.

24
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,740
Stay with me for a while.

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,900
No, I can't.

26
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,540
You finished your work,

27
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,900
but I didn't.

28
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,060
Wasn't my heart shape

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,180
sincere enough?

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,380
I can also blow a kiss.

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,700
Mr. Ji,

32
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,220
please hold back

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,580
your flirty gaze.

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,340
Don't disturb me.

35
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,140
I just want you

36
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,460
to stay with me.

37
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,860
You are the CEO.

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,540
You can't be so clingy.

39
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,780
Haven't you seen those dramas?

40
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,460
The CEOs

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,380
are always clingy.

42
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,420
Mr. Ji,

43
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,740
we're at the company.

44
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,260
It's inappropriate

45
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,100
to drink from a female
subordinate's cup.

46
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,940
This cup

47
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,580
belongs to my girlfriend.

48
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,900
Did you forget our deal?

49
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,660
It's not working time now.

50
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm not off duty yet.

51
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,660
You're not working either.

52
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,500
You're unreasonable.

53
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,500
When will you get off work?

54
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,340
I wonder if you can

55
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,940
have dinner with me.

56
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
I can't.

57
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,140
Then I'll work overtime with you.

58
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,620
Okay.

59
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,380
Zhou Tian and Mr. Ji

60
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,620
will work overtime tonight.

61
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,020
All of you should get off work at 6 pm.

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,540
I have many works unfinished.

63
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,820
I have to stay.

64
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,740
Me too.

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,980
So do I.

66
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,300
Yes, me too.

67
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,100
Me too.

68
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,740
Then go home to finish your work!

69
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,860
You can't bother Mr. Ji!

70
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,340
Right?

71
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,140
I can't.

72
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,500
I have to use the Intranet.

73
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,940
You can't work overtime

74
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,500
at the company tonight.

75
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,060
You'll regret it if you do.

Where are they?

78
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,300
Why did they leave so early?

79
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,500
It's only 6 pm.

80
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,820
Have you finished your work?

81
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,900
Not yet.

82
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,700
It's so weird.

83
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,900
Why did everyone get off work

84
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,380
on time?

85
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,300
A good employee

86
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,900
should finish her work

87
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,220
during her working hours.

88
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,020
Mr. Ji,

89
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,300
are you telling me

90
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,220
that I'm not efficient enough?

91
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,740
Yes.

92
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,220
You have bothered

93
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,860
my date

94
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,620
with my girlfriend.

95
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,500
I can call it a date

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,620
if you work overtime with me.

97
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,740
I booked

98
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,660
a decent restaurant.

99
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,540
We can go there

100
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,340
after you finish your work.

101
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,700
Don't bother.

102
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,900
We can order a takeaway.

103
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,020
What do you want to eat?

104
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,300
You.

105
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,620
Oh, right.

106
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,580
I suddenly remembered

107
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,060
that I had left my mug
in the meeting room.

108
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,820
I'll get it.

109
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,180
No rush.

110
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,820
It won't get lost.

111
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,020
I'm thirsty.

112
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,300
I hope I can get off work earlier.

113
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
If you get thirsty,

114
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,740
you can use my mug.

115
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,740
What are you doing?

116
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,340
Working. We need the Intranet.

117
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,220
So...

118
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,140
I didn't see anything.

119
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,140
What happened just now?

120
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,300
I don't remember a thing.

121
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,420
Maybe a comet hit the earth.

122
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,900
Why am I here?

123
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Who am I? Where am I?

124
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,260
What was I doing?

125
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,900
Why don't I remember a thing?

126
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,940
I have works to do.

127
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,700
Maybe we should

128
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,060
have dinner or something.

129
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,780
I should have

130
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,500
got off work earlier

131
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,060
so that the other colleagues

132
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,020
wouldn't be so embarrassed.

133
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,540
Indeed.

134
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,620
You should have taken my advice.

135
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,340
It's alright.

136
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,700
We can go ahead

137
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,740
and have a midnight snack together.

138
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,860
No.

139
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,500
How can you still be happy?

140
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,140
I should have kicked you out

141
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,220
with a red card.

142
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,580
Please don't.

143
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,340
I was worried about you.

144
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,660
You need to take a rest

145
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,020
while working.

146
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,820
You can't rush everything.

147
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,540
But

148
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,740
I also have a dream.

149
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,580
It's said on the Internet

150
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,180
that you have to work hard

151
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,140
before you get old.

152
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,180
You want to join the Sports Department?

153
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,620
I have seen your performance.

154
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,700
You did a good job.

155
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,500
After this quarter ends
at the end of this month,

156
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,500
you can join the Sports Department.

157
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,140
This quarter?

158
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,900
So soon.

159
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,380
I...

160
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,700
What's wrong?

161
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Do you have any worries?

162
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,380
I can help.

163
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,060
Actually,

164
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,060
I don't have any.

165
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,700
It's just...

166
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,460
I came here for the Sports Department,

167
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,180
but I have learned a lot

168
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,620
at the Performance Department.

169
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,260
I also made many friends.

170
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
So,

171
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm a bit unwilling to leave.

172
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
Actually,

173
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,180
it's hard to integrate the resources

174
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,540
if the agents are divided

175
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,620
So,
I'm thinking about whether to combine

176
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,860
all the brokerage departments.

177
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,060
Combine?

178
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,540
So

179
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,940
I can sign an athlete

180
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,260
at the Performance Department?

181
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:30,900
No.

182
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,340
The Sports Department will combine

183
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,620
with the Performance Department.

184
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
Every agent

185
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,420
is free to sign anyone.

186
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,940
You can achieve your goal

187
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,540
of joining the Sports Department,

188
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,380
and you don't need

189
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,540
to say goodbye to your friends.

190
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,780
What do you think?

191
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,820
You're so considerate.

192
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,900
I thought I could

193
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,540
give you a bunch of red cards.

194
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,260
Since you're so grateful,

195
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,500
how about staying the night with me?

196
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,700
Sure!

197
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,180
Well,

198
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,020
let's go home then.

199

Hi, Tian.

354
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm having dinner with Nian.

355

Bye.

360
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,780
You had never been so gentle

361
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,260

362

So...

370
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,380
I want to cherish

371
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,540

372

375
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,940
Okay.

376

Hao, there you are.

379
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,620
Why are you here alone?

380
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,660
Gigi has left,

381
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,020
but you didn't do anything.

382
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,180
If you continue like this,

383
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,540
she'll leave for real.

384
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,420
I saw the video.

385
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,740
You saw it?

386
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,780
How can you be so calm

387
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,020
after you saw it?

388
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,060
She has to finish her study,

389
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,620
so she has to leave.

390
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,620
I'm telling you,

391
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,780
if she actually leaves,

392
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,740
she'll never come back again.

393
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,740
She doesn't belong here.

394
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
She should return to her world.

395
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,540
I'm so mad at you.

396
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,180
Gigi likes you.

397
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,620
She came back because of you.

398
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,220
She worked here

399
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,180
because she wanted

400
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,460
to get closer to you.

401
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,540
You obviously like her.

402
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
Why didn't you tell her?

403
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,860
She's young,

404
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,500
and she has to continue her study.

405
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,660
I can't bother her life.

406
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,020
If she knows that I like her,

407
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,580
she probably won't leave.

408
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,540
These are all excuses.

409
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,020
You'll only harm her

410
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,940
by doing this.

411
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,660
Now, communication and transportation

412
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,380
are developed.

413
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,820
A long-distance relationship
is not difficult at all.

414
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,260
She's still young,

415
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,340
and she will meet many other people.

416
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,660
I can't let her give up

417
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,700
all those opportunities.

418
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,580
Maybe, she likes me

419
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,340
because she's impulsive.

420
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,340
Nevermind.

421
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,900
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,540
Why are you here now?

513
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,100
I have something to tell you.

514
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,820
I don't want to listen.

515
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:16,940
Gigi,

516
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,620
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,300
It's all my fault.

518
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,060
I have never been in a relationship.

519
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,900
I thought I liked Zhou Tian,

520
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,260
so when I faced your feelings,

521
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,780
I thought

522
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,780
I might misunderstand.

523
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,180
I was afraid that I might waste them.

524
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,100
Last night,

525
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,180
I sat in the cat cafe all night.

526
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
I realized I might never see you again

527
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,620
in the future.

528
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
I was suddenly panicked.

529
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,620
So, I have been waiting for you

530
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,660
since this morning.

531
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,860
Gigi,

532
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,660
I care for you.

533
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,620
I hope you can forgive me.

534
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,740
Zhang Hao.

535
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,620
I once believed

536
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,940
that I have to say it out loud

537
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,180
when I like someone.

538
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,340
But now,

539
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,740
I don't think the same.

540
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,500
I think,

541
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,380
love doesn't only exist in words.

542
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,380
It's everywhere.

543
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,020
It breaks the limit of time and space,

544
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,060
and it roots in your heart

545
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,940
until it blooms.

546
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,980
The relationship I want

547
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,980
is not an urge of passion.

548
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,860
As time goes by,

549
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,100
it'll give everything an explanation.

It's still a baby.

gentle and careful.

A baby?

It's three years old now!

598

If it were a human being,

599
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,340
it should be married now.

600

I'm telling you,

601
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
you have been flirty recently.

Listen,

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,300
I'll find you...

604
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,220
You're going to find a male cat,

605

aren't you?

606
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,660
No way.

607
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,340
Absolutely no.

608
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,180
All male cats are evil.

609
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,580
Qiuqiu is our princess.

610
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,660
I won't allow any cat to bully it.

No biggie.

614
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,820
I have just known

615
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,940
that all your aunties

616
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,420
have cats

617
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,900
in their homes.

618
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,460
And all the cats are male.

619
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,460
I'm thinking,

620
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,820
Qiuqiu

621
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,140
is not a kitten anymore.

622
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,540
Should we find a male cat for it

623
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,060
as its date?

624
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,380

625
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,140

626
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm afraid

627
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,220
Ji Chen can't agree with this idea.

628
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,700
Yes. We just talked about it.

629
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,500
Her mom

630
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,820
wants her to date someone else?

631
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,260
It's really late.

632
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,140
I'm leaving.

633
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,100
I'll also take away

634
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
the garbage made by Qiuqiu.

635
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,020
It's only 10 pm.

636
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,740
We rarely

637
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,260
got off work on time today.

638
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,820
You don't want me to leave?

639
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,620
Then I'll stay.

640
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,940
Be careful. I'll see you tomorrow.

641
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,420
Okay.

642
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,860
I'm going back.

643

By the way,

644
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I saw you were rather worried

645
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,820
while talking with your mother.

646
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,260
Was there something wrong?

647
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:25,940
You can tell me about it.

648
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,020
Well, it was not a big deal.

649
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,700
My mother

650
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,620
came over to see a show

651
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,900
without telling me in advance.

652
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,860
But

653
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,380
I already talked with her solemnly.

654
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,020
That was it?

655
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,620
Then I'll drive to pick her up tomorrow.

656
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,660
I haven't seen her for a long time.

657
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,740
No.

658
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,860
Don't meet her.

659
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,860
I'll ask my Mom

660
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,860
to go back on her own.

661
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,540
But...

662
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,340
There's no "but!"

663
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,300
You can't spoil

664

my parents.

665
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,340

00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,580
When they saw me last time,

683
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,420
they wanted

684
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,260
to let Zhou Tian marry me

685
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,460
as soon as possible.

686
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,460
But now,

687
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,100
why did she ask her
to date someone else?

688
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,660
Well,

689
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,940
let's analyze the situation back then

690
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,540
with the words that we heard.

691
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,060
It should be like this.

692
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,660
(Tian,)

693
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,860
(your Dad and I have heard about)

(Ji Chen won't accept this.)

I don't care!

705
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,340
(I'm telling you,)

706
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,460

(find you a boyfriend.)

It'll be my fault

710
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,580
if I dump him.

711
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,940
Your fault?

712
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,660
Even if you want to marry him,

713
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,180
you have to consider

714
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,300
about your future kid!

715
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,100
Fine.

716
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,660
(Where's the place?)

717
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,780
(I'll go.)

718
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,900
So, that's what happened.

719
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,300
And then,
Zhou Tian went to date someone else.

720
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,340
Impossible!

721
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,540
It was obvious that Zhou Tian said,
"I won't go".

722
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,140
She didn't want to go.

723
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,140
"I won't go?"

724
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,380
Do you think it was a mime?

725
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,020
She definitely said,

726
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,740
"I'll go".

727
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,100
Forget about it.

728
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,780
I made a deal with Zhou Tian

729
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,940
that we would always be
honest with each other.

730
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,780
I'll ask her directly.

731
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,940
(Aegean Sea)

732
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,340
(Tian, it's time to work. Come
downstairs! I made breakfast for you.)

She won't actually go on a date, right?
