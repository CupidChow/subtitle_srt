(Qiuqiu Just Now, Still)

25
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,100
It can't be real that
she goes on a blind date, right?

26
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,460
In.

27
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,540
Every time we come here,

28
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,340
you'll fight with other cats.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,060
No snack for you today.

30
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,900
I'm warning you.

31
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,620
Dear mom.

32
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,460
Can you let me know in advance

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,380
when you come next time?

34
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,260
It's always like a surprise attack.

35
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,140
I'm a human being.

36
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,860
I have my liberty.

37
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,700
I came yesterday for a show.

38
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,900
I was so nice that I didn't tell you.

39
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,380
I slept at your Aunt's place.

40
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
Not a cozy night at all.

41
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
When some people

42
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,260
say they are nice,

43
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,260
they are not nice at all.

44
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,660
Anyway,

45
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,100
you asked me to take Qiuqiu here.

46
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,100
I took her here.

47
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,420
You saw it yourself.

48
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,100
She can't mingle with other cats.

49
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,620
And Ji Chen doesn't agree.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,140
So about the blind date,

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,140
thanks, but no, thanks.

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,940
I have to work later.

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,060
I have ordered you a luxury breakfast.

54
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,660
Finish it and go home.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,140
My dad is lonely at home.

56
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,100
Xin Xin,

57
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,100
I'll go to work.

58
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,260
And I'll pick Qiuqiu up after work.

59
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,100
Please look after her for me.

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,100
OK.

61
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,460
Hey, wait.

62
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,060
You...

63
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,780
Tian...

64
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,220
Mrs. Zhou,

65
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,540
here's your breakfast.

66
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,660
Mrs. Zhou,

67
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,340
I heard it all.

68
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,220
If you have to make her date,

69
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,540
I know many boys.

70
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,940
Handsome.

71
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,820
Well-shaped.

72
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,340
Foreign boys.

73
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,020
You can rest assured and go home.

74
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,660
I'll introduce them to Zhou Tian.

75
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,780
She can choose whatever she wants.

76
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,100
We don't have to let Ji Chen know.

77
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,980
Right?

78
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,620
Don't you have to let me know?

79
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,100
Don't you know

80
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,900
that Zhou Tian is taken?

81
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,660
But, Chen,

82
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,620
it's OK

83
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,700
even though she's taken.

84
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,260
She can still have it if she wants.

85
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,060
When they have babies,

86
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,940
I can find a foster family

87
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,980
if you don't want to keep them.

88
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,380
And you want her to have babies!

89
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,140
Fine. Never mind what I said.

90
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,900
I gotta go. Enjoy your time.

91
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,380
Chen,

92
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,940
take a seat.

93
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,860
Tian

94
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,060
just left.

95
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,100
What are you two...

96
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,300
Mrs. Zhou,

97
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,820
I actually followed her here.

98
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,620
About the blind date,

99
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,140
I need to talk with you.

100
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,780
Tian already talked to me.

101
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,460
Let's forget it if you don't agree.

102
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,660
You don't have to overthink it.

103
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,100
I have to.

104
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,580
I understand it.

105
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,860
You are worried

106
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,500
about me being hospitalized.

107
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,020
But

108
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,260
I'm healthy now.

109
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,660
Also,

110
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,940
I promise

111
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,220
to make her happy

112
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,180
with everything I have.

113
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,420
I knew it.

114
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,300
My future son-in-law

115
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,820
is so caring.

116
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,820
It's a blessing for her

117
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,140
to be with you.

118
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,500
But

119
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,220
she's old enough.

120
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,060
She needs to have a baby

121
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,260
even if she doesn't need a blind date.

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,540
Or it will be a waste

123
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,340
of her great genes.

124
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,980
Are you really this anxious?

125
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,260
Yeah, of course, I am.

126
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,580
This is a serious matter.

127
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,580
It can't be done casually.

128
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,460
No.

129
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,100
So you are saying

130
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,380
we should hold a ceremony?

131
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,140
Great!

132
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,860
It'll be great to have a ceremony.

133
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,100
I understand now.

134
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,900
Rest assured.

135
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,980
I'll give her

136
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,700
an unforgettable wedding.

137
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,140
Unforgettable.

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,540
A president's idea

139
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,180
is certainly unique.

140
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,300
OK.

141
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,380
It's settled then.

142
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,660
When you get everything ready,

143
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,420
invite us to join you,

144
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,780
OK?

145
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,020
OK. Great.

146
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,580
Then, Mrs. Zhou,

147
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,860
I'll go get it done now.

148
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,620
So...

149
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,300
Well...

150
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,580
Qiuqiu,

151
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,340

Bobosnap will hold a fashion party

the six girls, will attend it.

The Business Cooperation Department

160
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,900
got them a jewelry sponsor.

161
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,220
See if this one will do.

162
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,940
I think they didn't

163
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,420
have shops in our country.

164
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,940
Mr. Ji,

165
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,300
you don't like their design?

166
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,380
They just entered

the domestic market.

Business Cooperation Department

169
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,940
spent a lot of effort in winning them.

170
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,540
No.

171
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:29,980
I think their design

172
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,620
is very stunning.

173
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,260

to order me a ring.

175
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,220
Ring.

176

Also,

don't come back again

178
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,780
if you insist on answering my question

179
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,740
with your question.

180
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,100
Sorry, Mr. Ji.

181
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,980
I won't do that again.

182
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,380
I'll go order the ring now.

183
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,220
Mr. Ji!

184

The ring style and size,

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,140
which one would you prefer?

186

About this...

187
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,260
Go to the shop first.

188
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,380
I'll text you

189
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
about it later.

190
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,100
Take a seat.

191
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,340
You need me?

192
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,740
Have you had breakfast?

193
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,140
Not yet.

194
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,620
I had an urgent this morning,

195
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,900
so I didn't wait for you.

196
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,580
I'll do better next time.

197
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,180
I won't ask you about what you did.

198
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,620
You breakfast

199

is in the refrigerator in the pantry.

200
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,060
Remember to heat it before you eat it.

201
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,780
Thank you for your care

202
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,060
and consideration.

203
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,180
I'll go get it now.

204
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,020
Hold on.

205
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,020
I have something to talk to you about.

Bobosnap's fashion party.

212
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,260
Select some with me.

213
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,380
Isn't this

214
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,660
their stylist's work?

215
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,300
Stylist...

216
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,220
Yeah,

217
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,540
their stylist

218
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,260
will select the dress

219
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,020
and accessories.

220
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,700
Yet the theme this time is

221
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,300
"Shine Finger".

222
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,220
So we have to choose them each

223
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,500
a ring.

224
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,460
Me?

225
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,300
But what I like

226
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,500
may not suit them.

227
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,340
Just make your choice.

228
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,220
Choose what you like.

229
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,180
Let me have a look.

230
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,380
This one is so beautiful.

231
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,340
Are you sure?

232
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,420
This one is simple,

233
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,220
not complicated,

234
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,980
which is in line
with the current aesthetics.

235
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,340
OK, settled then.

I want this one.

239
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,860
Please wrap this for me.

240
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,100
No problem.

But

242
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,740
(Xue)
Xue has bigger finger joints.

243
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,380
This one suits her.

244
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,460
But it may not suit others.

245
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,980
(Ke)
If it is on Ke's or my finger,

246
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,380
it will look

247
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,460
too big.

248
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,780
So...

249
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,780
Any problem?

Nope.

should Ke or you wear?

Ke...

255

Are you sure?

257
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,860
The square diamond

258

looks more solid and stable. Also sassy.

259

OK.

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,380
It was about business.

349
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,380
About Six Up.

350
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,780
Mr. Ji wanted me

351
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,340
to select diamond rings for them.

352
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,300
What?

353
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,780
Diamond ring?

354
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,420
You selected it?

355
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,540
My God, my Tian.

356
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,580
I see this more clearly than you.

357
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,660
He's doing all this

358
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,140
for you.

359
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,340
Selecting rings

360
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,660
for the girl group?

361
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,780
Isn't it an excuse

362
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,580
to find out what you like?

363
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,860
You mean he wants

364
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,020
to select a wedding ring?

365
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,700
And

366
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,340
I think your wedding

367
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,580
will be coming really soon.

368
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,260
What a wild guess.

369
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,500
We just handled Lucy's matter.

370

Xing Yi is

371

372
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,980
And I just entered a new field.

373
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,500
We both are too busy

374
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
to get married.

375
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,380
What if your Chen

376
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,660
proposes to you?

377
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,380
Will you say yes,

378
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,420
yes,

379
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,540
or yes?

380
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,180
We'll see.

381
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,300
OK.

382
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,860
I'll talk it over with Qiao Yi.

about some specific work.

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,940
Did I do it the right way?

522
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,860
But this is a big deal.

523
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,620
Why didn't you talk to me

524
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,180
before you actually did it?

525
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,540
Everyone in the neighborhood

526
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,260
knows it now.

527
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,940
Should I marry you or not?

528
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,340
Don't you want to marry me?

529
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,700
It's not like that.

530
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:20,900
Mr. Ji.

531
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,980
Ji Chen.

532
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,700
Actually,

533
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,860
we have not been

534
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,140
officially together

535
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,380
for a long time.

536
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,540
Officially together?

537
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,620
We work together.

538
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,740
We are together

539
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,100
day and night.

540
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,460
But we're busy now.

541
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,660
We just handled Lucy

542
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,700
and Mr. Chen's matter.

543
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
You said it yourself.

544
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,180
You will get Xing Yi back on track.

545
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,340
So you worry about me.

546
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,140
It's OK.

547
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,980
I can balance my life and career.

548
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,380
But we have three

549
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,740
to four projects on our plate.

550
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,060
Do we have time for a wedding?

551
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
Those are projects for the company.

552
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,460
The wedding is a project for our life.

553
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,220
They two can go hand in hand.

554
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:06,740
I...

555
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,220
Why can't you understand

556
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,500
what I'm trying to say?

557
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,580
Zhou...

558
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,900
Qiao Yi is rushing me.

559
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,580
Mine's faster.

560
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,740
I'll drive you there.

561
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:23,860
Sit tight.

562
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,180
(OK!)

563
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,020
(Recording Room)

564
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,220
I didn't expect this matter

565
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,500
would be solved smoothly.

566
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,180
I feel like we didn't help

567
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,540
any little at all.

568
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,140
Qiao Yi didn't want

569
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,420
to replace anyone in his heart.

570
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
They just needed

571
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,740
to give each other an out.

572
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,020
Qiao Yi is right, actually.

573
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,820
We are two completely different people.

574
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,540
One is slow, and the other is fast.

575
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,820
One is quiet, and the other is loud.

576
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,540
One is a crocodile,

577
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,420
and the other is...

578
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,340
A husky.

579
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,140
I am the smartest

580
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,100
even if I

581
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,220
really am a husky.

582
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,140
So much

583
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,180
difference between us,

584
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,580
yet we make a great couple.

585
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,580
It's kinda dreamy.

586
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,900
There are no two people

587
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,700
who are exactly alike

588
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,780
in this world.

589
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,820
We all need a run-in period.

590
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,020
Zhou Tian,

591
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,860
I was being unthoughtful

592
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,260
to plan the wedding alone in secret.

593
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,980
But I don't know why

594
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,020
my feelings for you

595
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,900
are this overwhelming.

596
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:40,980
I would say

597
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,900
the same thing to you

598
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,420
even if your mom didn't call.

599
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,700
Will you marry me, Tian?

600
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,580
I'm not gonna say no,

601
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,620
but

602
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,740
it has only been a few months

603
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,700
since we got to know each other.

604
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,100
So...

605
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,620
You think this

606
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,740
is coming on too strong, right?

607
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,420
But we work together

608
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,100
and stay together day and night.

609
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,660
One month to us

610
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,700
is like a year to others.

611
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,660
So,

612
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,340
according to this,

613
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,620
we have been together for years.

614
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,900
Does this equation make sense?

615
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,460
Then, Xing Yi?

616
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,340
Too many projects.

617
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,620
Too much pressure. Right?

618
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,060
Don't worry.

619
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
I'll help.

620
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,820
And I can recruit a new

621
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,060
executive agent for Qiao Yi

622
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,060
to set you free.

623
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,940
Then,

624
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,140
my parents?

625
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,220
They may disagree

626
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,700
or question my health, right?

627
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,180
It's OK.

628
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,380
Don't worry.

629
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,540
I have got their receipt form

630
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,580
for those betrothal gifts.

631
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,140
They won't return the gift

632
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,460
and take you back from me.

633
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,460
And our colleagues.

634
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,140
They may discuss

635
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,100
with each other

636
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,380
and gossip, right?

637
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,860
Don't worry.

638
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,780
I can set up

639
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,380
an internal studio for you.

640
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,140
We'll distinguish between the interests

641
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,980
of superiors and subordinates.

642
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,860
If anyone gossips about us,

643
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,180
I will make him

644
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,860
unable to gossip again.

645
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,660
But...

646
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,140
No more but.

647
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,860
If we were

648
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,100
in a 24-episode of TV play,

649
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,140
I would have wooed you for 23 episodes.

650
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,980
We can solve any problem

651
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,180
in front of us.

652
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,260
Zhou Tian,

653
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,220
can you

654
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,540
give me your answer now?

655
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,860
Then,

656
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,340
OK.

657
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,940
What?

658
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
It's to the question

659
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,220
you asked me.

660
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,940
I said OK.

661
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,700
Really?

662
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,060
You won't but again, right?

663
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,860
I won't.

664
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,980
I will marry you.

665
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,660
What did you say?

666
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,300
It's a bit noisy here.

667
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,220
I didn't really catch you.

668
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,820
I said I would marry you.

669
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,060
I will marry you.

Why are there two cats at the wedding?

695
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,420
Didn't you read the invitation?

696
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,420
It's Qiuqiu's wedding.

on having a wedding for the cats.

And what a wedding.

710
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,820
Our son-in-law is a CEO.

711
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,620
Of course, it would be a grand wedding.

712
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,580
But does he really have

713

It's a pet business project

Mr. Ji told me to.

He said that the star wall rank

a new executive agent,

Why are you moving my portrait?

766
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,180
Qiuqiu has been a star

767
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,220
since the cat wedding

768

half a year ago.

She has over ten endorsements.

00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,620
She is Qiuqiu's agent

entertainment, and pet industry.

have been resting for several months.

Qiuqiu is naturally

00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,940

779
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,020
I'll be back to work right now.

780

I'll be back in first place next week.

But

783

Mr. Ji worries that you may get drained

784
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,980
after constant working.

785

He has extended the deadline

789
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,060
for your next book indefinitely.

How long do you plan to stay abroad?

796
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,500
It depends on...

797
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,460
Nian, right?

798
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,700
The place where you train overseas

799
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,980
is the same city

800
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,700
where Ji Nian attends school.

801
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,300
Are you sure you didn't arrange this?

802
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,740
I'm sure.

803
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,300
It's impossible

804
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,420
for me to arrange it.

Don't worry, my little sister's husband.

I won't disturb Nian

Yet I won't respond

812
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,140
because

813
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,980
you and Nian

814
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,020

And you bring these stinky rice noodles.

It has to be you.

We don't have to dig everything out.

I chose one.

Why are you asking again?

850
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,980
Yeah, but it was

851
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,660
three months ago.

852
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,740
You were busy all the time.

853
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,220
Those flowers are way out of season.

Then dried flower.

What are we doing here?

861
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,820
I have told the client

862
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,700
to delay for half an hour.

863

Come.

with my parents.

880

Gotta have a baby after registration.

The wedding and other things

898
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,740
can be delayed. Right?

899
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,620
It can be combined
