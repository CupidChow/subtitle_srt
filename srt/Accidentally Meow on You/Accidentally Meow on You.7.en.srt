You are not supposed to leave.

As a gentleman,

you can't break the appointment.

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,180
And,

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
she's a lady.

unhandsome,

Aren't you expecting the meeting
with her?

51
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,420
Imagination is beautiful,

52
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,780
but the reality is horrible.

53
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,100
I see.

54
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,980
You're afraid that you will fall in love
with her,

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,620
if you stay with her for too long.

58

who almost knocked me down

and unconditionally

60
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,220
challenged my tolerance.

61
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,500
You are temperamental and domineering.

62
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,060
As an employee,

63
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,900
she just tries hard

64
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,900
to survive.

65
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,700
She didn't mean to knock you down.

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,860
You think she is disobedient

67
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,380
because you are always self-centered

68
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,780
and have no sense of team spirit.

69
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,180
She's just trying hard

70
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
to do her job well.

71
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,100
She's doing her own job.

72
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,220
Sunday is Zhou Tian.

73
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,580
And I am the crocodile in her zoo.

74
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,900
But I even teased myself with her.

75
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,820
That's your problem,

76
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,380
not Zhou Tian's.

77
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,220
Do you like her?

78
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,660
Yes.

79
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,180
I do like her.

80
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,780
She's warm, generous,

81
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
kind, and considerate.

82
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,140
She often inspires me suddenly.

83
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,180
She let me think carefully

84
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,620
about my relationship with Ji Nian.

85
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,300
I think she is a reliable friend.

86
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,020
So, you like her as a friend.

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,140
That's good.

88
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,700
But I'm not sure

89
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,100
if we will have a new relationship
in the future.

90
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,780
The person who has a good relationship

91
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,420
with her is you, 1003, not me, Ji Chen.

92
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,780
Aren't you just 1003?

93
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,260
She just gets used to your look

94
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,580
when you are working.

95
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,420
She has never seen your look
in daily life.

96
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,900
Just have a try.

97
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,380
She will accept you.

98
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,100
Don't flatter yourself.

99
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,580
She will never like you,

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
because she hates me.

101
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,180
She may hate me, but it's not up to you.

102
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,900
It's up to her.

103
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,780
Fine.

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I will make you hopeless.

105
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,500
It's already 12:30.

106
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,380
Did anything happen to him?

107
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,220
M-Mr. Ji.

108
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,540
Why are you here?

109
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,580
I have a business appointment.

110
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,940
Business appointment?

111
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Here?

112
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,740
Hello, sir.

113
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,980
What can I do for you?

114
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,020
My friend and I

115
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,100
want to help you

116
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,260
with the dogs and cats charity.

117
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,340
I'd like to offer 10,000 yuan first.

118
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,140
Thank you, sir. Thank you, miss.

119
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,620
We are not...

120
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,980
Mr. Ji.

121
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,500
My friend is coming.

122
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,580
And you are sitting in his seat.

123
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,100
He hasn't come yet.

124
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,100
But he will be here soon.

125
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
He can take the seat when he comes.

126
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,100
Hey, why are you so shameless?

127
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,700
I have refused you so obviously.

128
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,260
It's not working time now.

129
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,100
Please don't let me

130
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,740
see your ugly face as a capitalist.

131
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,380
Get out of here.

132
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,540
What are you doing?

133
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,900

Please drink some water.

Eat some food.

No, thanks, Mr. Ji.

145
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,420
I'm waiting for my friend.

146
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,740
What time is your appointment?

147
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,540
Twelve.

148
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,740
He's almost an hour late.

149
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,180
You should ask him

150
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,460
if he will still come.

151
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,060
What friend is it?

152
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,100
Boyfriend?

153
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,780
Nope.

154
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,660
Is it a net friend?

155
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,740
Mr. Ji.

156
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,580
This should not

157
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,380
be a part of your business.

158
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,860
So, I'm right.

159
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,420
I still need to care

160
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,860
about my employee's personal life.

161
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,100
After all, in this big world,

162
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,060
there are all kinds of people.

163
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,940
And even liars.

164
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,820
I don't want you to be deceived,

165
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,740
which may affect your work.

166
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,820
Don't worry, Mr. Ji.

167
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,420
I know my friend very well.

168
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,100
He is not a liar.

169
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,180
If you really have so much time,

170
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
you should care more about others.

171
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,860
You have never seen him.

172
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,340
You can't judge him so carelessly.

173
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,060
The more you expect,
the more disappointed you will be.

174
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,140
He's my friend.

175
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,700
I know him well.

176
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,420
He's not capable like you,

177
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,460
who has a good career.

178
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,460
But that guy is

179
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,540
sensible,

180
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,780
warm,

181
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,300
and loves life.

182
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Mr. Ji.

183
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,940
If you don't have any other requests,

184
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,140
please go back to have a rest.

185
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,100
It's the weekend today.

186
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,820
You don't have to supervise my work,

187
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,060
do you?

188
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,940
It's so late.

189
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,020
He may not be here today.

190
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,820
We made an appointment.

191
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,740
I believe he will come.

192
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,540
But he doesn't come.

193
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,220
I will wait.

194
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,740
(Sorry. I'm full occupied,
so I can't keep the appointment.)

195
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,660
(Sorry. I'm full occupied,
so I can't keep the appointment.)

196
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,700
What's wrong?

197
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,820
Did he break the appointment?

198
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,700
(It doesn't matter. I won't mind it.)

199
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,620
Mr. Ji.

200
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,660
Enjoy yourself.

201
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,780
I have to go.

202
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,300
(Why is there)

203
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,100
(such an annoying species in the world?)

204
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,700
(I submitted the resignation letter.)

205
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,060
(I can finally get rid
of that annoying guy.)

206
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,180
(If there is no dream,)

207
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,060
(there will be no life.)

208
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,780
(I love life.)

209
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,420
(So I have to keep enduring you.)

210
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,540
I...

211
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,460
Is the crocodile really so annoying?

212
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,540
What's wrong with 1003?

213
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,980
Why doesn't he reply to my message?

214
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,620
Qiuqiu.

215
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,860
Are you worried about him?

216
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,380
Yes.

217
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,460
You are worried.

218
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,540
I will help you ask him.

219
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,140
(Weird.)

220
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,260
Well.

221
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,380
No.

222
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,340
Calm down.

223
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,500
Sorry.

224
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,820
There was an emergency to Huskie.

225
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,180
And I left my phone at home.

226
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,940
So, I couldn't

227
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,140
reply to your message.

228
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,260
So, it was your dog who stalled you.

229
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,020
It doesn't matter.

230
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,300
I thought you had met an accident.

231
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,660
It's good that you are fine.

232
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,500
Did you get angry?

233
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,460
In fact, the crocodile

234
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,900
made trouble again.

235
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,380
Fortunately, you didn't come.

236
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,740
Or the meeting

237
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,820
would be unpeaceful.

238
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,940
Anyway,

239
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm glad that you are fine.

240
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,940
Tomorrow,

241
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,300
I will go with the peacock
for an exhibition.

242
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,300
I have to go.

243
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,220
Bye.

244
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,860
Qiuqiu.

245
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,220
He's fine.

246
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,660
(Glad to hear that.)

247
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,780
Look.

248
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,220
She thinks you like that.

249
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,780
You should stop chatting with her.

250
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,700
In her eyes, you are just

251
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,940
a cold-blooded crocodile.

252
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,980
Do you know what crocodile is?

253
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,580
A kind of animal

254
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,180
being watched by visitors in the zoo.

255
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,500
You are not

256
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,500
better than me.

257
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,780
You called her Huskie.

258
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,580
She calls me like that,

259
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,140
because she doesn't know me well.

260
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,380
I will give her time to know me,

261
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,100
because I like her.

262
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,020
(I like her?)

263
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:52,980
Qiao Yi.

264
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,100
Let's talk about the working plan
in the next half year.

265
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,140
You published a new book every year
these years.

266
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,980
All of them are popular.

267
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,580
I heard that some of them

268
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,180
have been revised as scripts of dramas.

269
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,380
- (God bless me.)
- Could you tell us something?

270
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,260
(Great. Everything goes well today.)

271
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,100
(And there is no accident.)

272
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,100
"Silent Cry" is going to be made.

273
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,140
I will participate in the production.

274
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,820
(Why didn't I know this?)

275
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,180
Could you tell us some details?

276
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,180
I will be the scriptwriter of the play.

277
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,860
Excuse me.

278
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,900
We have more work to do next.

279
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,900
Sorry.

280
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
- Yi.
- Yi.

281
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,340
I know he's always dissatisfied
with the revised script.

282
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,860
But I didn't expect...

283
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,100
Zhou Tian.

284
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,020
You were too careless.

285
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,300
Don't you know
once he has the revision right,

286
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,140
he will be able to decide everything?

287
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,020
If they deny it in public,

288
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,980
we will be embarrassed.

289
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,300
What should we do?

290
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,020
What should we do?

291
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,740
You were on the spot,

292
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,620
but you didn't stop him.

293
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,460
What do you think we should do?

294
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,700
Make the best of a mistake.

295
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,740
I get it.

296
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,060
Mr. Ji, do you mean

297
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,220
we should invest in a net play

298
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,740
named "Silent Cry"?

299
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,380
Then we invite Qiao Yi
to be the scriptwriter.

300
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,300
But,

301
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
will Qiao Yi agree to that?

302
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,900
He said this just because

303
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,220
he dislikes the revision.

304
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,180
Zhou Tian, take Qiao Yi

305
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,940
to see the director on Monday,

306
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,980
and talk about the script.

307
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,780
Then there will be no problem.

308
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,620
Mr. Ji, you are always wise.

309
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,100
You always have a good idea

310
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
when we need it.

311
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,340
You solved such a complicated matter

312
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,620
in an instant.

313
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,900
It's cool.

314
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
They still needed thirty percent

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,140
of the investment.

316
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,900
I asked my friend to invest in it.

317
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,380
Besides, other investors
are also not satisfied with the script.

318
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,260
Now, the writer, Qiao Yi,
wants to have a try,

319
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,300
so the investors are expecting his work.

320
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,180
The director can't have any objections.

321
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,980
Got it.

322
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,780
I can't understand

323
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,940
why everyone of you is so nervous.

324
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,340
Is my work really so bad?

325
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,660
It's not bad, is it?

326
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,700
You are not a rookie in this circle.

327
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,900
Do you really think

328
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,780
it's easy to change a scriptwriter

329
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
when everything is read?

330
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,780
Of course, I know it's not easy.

331
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,020
But,

332
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,700
I have Ji Chen.

333
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,380
He's my agent.

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,140
He has to solve all my problems.

335
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,620
Otherwise, why should I

336
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,220
hire an agent?

337
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,940
Well,

338
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm hungry.

339
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,020
Please cook some food for me.

340
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,620
Cook it yourself.

341
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,020
Do you think I can't do anything
without you?

342
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,660
I'm gonna order the takeout.

343
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,180
But you forget that

344
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
my house is very remote.

345
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,740
I don't even think

346
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,700
you can get your takeout

347
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,780
before you starve to death.

348
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,220
Then let me starve to death.

349
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,300
I'll die in your house.

350
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,580
Then I'll always stay here as a ghost.

351
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,220
It's boring.

352
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,940
I'm gonna cook some food.

353
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,460
There are so many ingredients.

354
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,340
Stay here if you don't wanna eat.

355
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,940
Mean guy.

356
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,340
Please cook me some rice noodles.

357
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,260
How is it?

358
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,140
We'll take Qiao Yi to see the director
next Monday.

359
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,860
Is that so easy?

360
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,900
The boss is so cool.

361
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,780
But the next Monday

362
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,980
is your birthday.

363
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,740
Really?

364
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,980
You reserved seats

365
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,940
in Chuan Style Restaurant.

366
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,540
Yeah.

367
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,820
I reserved it half a month in advance.

368
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,660
Will it take a long time to talk
about the script with the director?

369
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,620
What time is the appointment?

370
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,500
Two in the afternoon.

371
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,460
If you talk fast,

372
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,700
it will be finished before five.

373
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,060
It won't take too long
for the first time.

374
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,460
Great.

375
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
But, Qiao Yi

376
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,900
may make trouble.

377
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,380
Could you finish your words at once?

378
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,380
But he may not

379
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,180
really make trouble.

380
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,180
However, Qiao Yi is a man

381
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,220
of high demands, just a little,

382
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,020
especially when it comes to scripts.

383
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,180
When his last novel
was revised to be the script,

384
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,660
he fired four scriptwriters.

385
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,820
- Four?
- Yeah.

386
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,500
So,
you have to gently remind him in advance

387
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,780
that he should at least respect

388
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,900
the director's ideas.

389
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,260
Hao,

390
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,820
I'll go back if there is nothing else.

391
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,660
Fine.

392
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,460
Take care.

393
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,100
Gigi.

394
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,620
It's a little late.

395
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,860
Go back early to have a rest.

396
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,140
Zhang Hao.

397
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,500
Look. I am a girl.

398
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,340
The shop closes at 10

399
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,460
every night.

400
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,660
I have to go home late every day.

401
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,500
Don't you think it's very dangerous?

402
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,620
I'll drive you back.

403
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,700
No bother.

404
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,700
In fact, the second floor

405
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,020
is not occupied.

406
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,180
Can I live upstairs?

407
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,180
Besides,
I've been short of money recently.

408
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,300
And I can guard the shop at night.

409
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,180
What do you think?

410
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,380
But the room upstairs

411
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,460
is messy and dirty.

412
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,300
It's not suitable for a girl to live.

413
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,220
It's OK.

414
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,140
When you were not here,

415
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,620
I've cleaned the room.

416
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,060
I also moved my luggage in.

417
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,460
Now I just need to tidy them up.

418
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,700
You already did it before you asked me.

419
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,580
Alright.

420
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,340
You can live here, but take care.

421
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,620
Thank you, Zhang Hao.

422
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,180
You are always so nice.

423
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,700
However,

424
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,380
you can't always

425
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,900
be so nice to everyone.

426
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,340
Or the people who care about you

427
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,900
will think you don't pay
enough attention to them.

428
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,580
Really?

429
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,420
Yeah.

430
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,820
I read this on the Internet.

431
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,220
Now I share it with you.

432
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,340
I'm going upstairs to tidy up my things.

433
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,580
OK.

434
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,340
(In that case,)

435
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,180
(I should be nicer to Zhou Tian.)

436
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,180
(Do it from her birthday.)

437
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,940
Hello, Yi.

438
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,260
I will arrive in about ten minutes.

439
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,340
Are you ready?

440
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,540
OK.

441
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,820
Should we go there a little earlier?

442
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,660
Then it will show our dedication to work

443
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
and respect to the director.

444
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,220
OK.

445
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,620
Get everything done before dinner.

446
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,540
Qiao Yi.

447
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,420
Both the novel and movie

448
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,380
are art to tell stories.

449
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,580
Is there any difference between

450
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,580
the ways they perform?

451
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,540
I'm just a rookie.

452
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
I don't know so much.

453
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,100
Could you teach me?

454
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,700
You have chosen

455
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,700
the right teacher.

456
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
About ten of my novels

457
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,620
have been revised

458
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,940
to make TV series and movies.

459
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,780
Indeed,

460
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,300
they are both art to tell stories,

461
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,860
but there is a big difference.

462
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,140
Writer, scriptwriter, and director
have different jobs.

463
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,980
(He is not that stubborn as I thought.)

464
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,140
(He knows the commen sense.)

465
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,780
But you have to know that

466
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,260
the reason why my novels
are so popular is that

467
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,700
I focus on the moods of characters
and the artistic conception.

468
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,460
Therefore,
I have to insist on these two points.

469
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,420
Then I won't fail my readers.

470
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
The summary meeting of this week

471
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,460
and the report of industry information

472
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,580
are arranged in tomorrow afternoon.

473
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,700
The headquarters have sent us

474
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,700
the running principles.

475
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,500
Five hundred pages in total.

476
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,740
We haven't translated it yet.

477
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,220
(- That's Roh Cake.)
(- Yeah.)

478
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,060
(It's expensive but very delicious.)

479
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,380
Who sent her this?

480
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,860
It's her fellow brother.

481
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Does he want to chase her?

482
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,420
Xia.

483
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,340
You are Zhou Tian's close friend.

484
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,300
Tell us about their relationship.

485
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,260
According to my observation,

486
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,100
they keep a special feeling

487
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,740
for each other.

488
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,060
But nobody confesses it first.

489
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,220
It seems that

490
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,460
Zhang Hao takes the initiative.

491
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,180
That's the ice cream cake
Zhou Tian likes very much.

492
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,340
Every time when she is unhappy,

493
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,100
she will buy it.

494
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,460
She said it could cheer her up.

495
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,540
Look at the huge bunch of flowers.

496
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,740
Is he going to propose?

497
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,860
No way.

498
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,140
He would come in person if he proposed.

499
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,500
Well.

500
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,940
He spent so much money
buying such a huge bunch of flowers.

501
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,140
What else does he want to do?

502
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,500
Mr. Ji.

503
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,820
- Mr. Ji.
- Mr. Ji.

504
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,540
Mr. Ji.

505
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,780
Where is this cake from?

506
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,180
It's Zhou Tian's birthday today.

507
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,180
Who sent such unhealthy food
on her birthday?

508
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,580
Where is she?

509
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,740
She went with Yi to set the makeup.

510
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,860
Since she's not here,

511
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
you can share the cake.

512
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,580
We don't have her permission.

513
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,660
If we eat her cake,

514
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,540
it will be impolite.

515
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,180
Should we put it in the refrigerator?

516
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,260
The ice cream cake is so huge.

517
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,540
It will take a large space
in the refrigerator.

518
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,820
But what a waste if we put it here.

519
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,980
Zhou Tian is generous.

520
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,500
She won't mind it.

521
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,300
Just share it.

522
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,700
Don't worry, Mr. Ji.

523
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,420
I often buy cakes in that shop.

524
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,900
They always put
a lot of ice on with cakes.

525
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,340
There won't be any problem
if we put it for four or five hours.

526
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,020
Yeah.

527
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,540
You like cakes in that shop very much.

528
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,220
From tomorrow on,

529
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,860
I will buy you three cakes every day.

530
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,660
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

531
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,940
But you don't have to buy so many.

532
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,860
You must finish them all.

533
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,020
Let me take a photo
and send it to Zhou Tian.

534
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,020
Give me the flowers.

535
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,660
Here.

536
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,180
Her fellow brother, Zhang Hao,
is so considerate.

537
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:29,820
Mr. Ji.

538
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,940
Are you bored?

539
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,220
The running principles.

540
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,220
Let her translate it.

541
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:36,580
Yes.

542
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,060
Five hundred pages
in a foreign language.

543
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,140
Finish them before getting off work.

544
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,700
Five hundred pages.

545
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,620
Today?

546
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,900
You shouldn't have provoked him.

547
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,140
Go for it.

548
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,340
How did I provoke him?

549
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,860
It's actually Zhou Tian's birthday.

550
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,220
Does her birthday have anything
to do with me?

551
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,100
A fortune-teller told my mom that

552
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,780
my future wife

553
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,180
was born on this day.

554
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,140
But I don't know what time
Zhou Tian was born.

555
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,380
Are you also bored?

556
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,420
Help her do the translation work.

557
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,860
(Is it your birthday today?)

558
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,820
(Is it your birthday today?)

559

(HR told me that
today is your birthday?)

560
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
(HR told me that
today is your birthday?)

561
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,700
(How about Qiao Yi?)

562
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,460
He said I didn't understand the movie.

563
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,380
But he doesn't even
understand "Silent Cry".

564
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,340
How annoying!

565
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,780
He doesn't even understand
what the novel says.

566
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,660
How can he be the director?

567
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,060
It's ridiculous.

568
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,900
As the saying goes,

569
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,940
there are a thousand Hamlets
in a thousand people's eyes.

570
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,500
It means that your novel is great.

571
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,860
Calm down. Look.

572
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,780
Have a rest first.

573
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,060
I'll talk to the director.

574

(Dressing Room)

575

(Dressing Room)

Hello, Miss.

587
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
This is the director's new idea.

588
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,340
Please let Qiao Yi read it.

589
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,220
OK.

590
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,220
And it's about dinner time.

591
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,900
Should we send food to Qiao Yi?

592
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,220
Do we have to continue this
after dinner?

593

We're just afraid that he may be hungry.

We'd better be quick

and finish this before dinner.

596

If he feels hungry,

597
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,300
I will ask the driver to buy him food.

The first of January.

You share the same birthday

with the crocodile.

621
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,380
What a coincidence.

622

Oh.

623
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,740
Do you like

624

ice cream cake?

625
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,900
Not really.

626
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,580
When I was a child,

627
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,580
I couldn't often eat desserts

628
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,940
in the sports team.

629
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,060
I could only eat them

630
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,540
on my birthday.

631
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,620
So, I always expected my birthday.

632
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,060
I thought that I could go home

633
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
and spent my birthday

634
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,980
with my parents this year.

635
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,740
I could eat

636
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,220
the noodles my dad cooked.

637
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,460
But I can't eat anything,

638
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,900
and have to work overtime.

639

Why don't you

640
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,340
take them here?

641
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,660
I go to work early and come back late.

642
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,140
If they come here

643
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,860
and see me working

644
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,980
until midnight every day,

645
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,180
they will be sad

646
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,900
and teach me.

647
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,740
I'd rather not.

648
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,460
Oh,

649
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,500
you said the noodles your dad cooked

650
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,700
are very special.

651
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,780
Yeah.

652
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,500
The noodles my dad cooked

653
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,500
were all made by himself.

654
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,420
There are oil, green onion,

655
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,380
minced garlic,

656
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,180
an egg,

657
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,500
and four pieces of lunch meat.

658
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,260
Every year on my birthday,

659
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,380
when I open my eyes,

660
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,300
I would see the noodles.

661
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,100
But I haven't eaten it

662
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,180
for many years.

663
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,220
I can only see them on my phone.

664
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,660
What?

665
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,580
He wants me to write
according to his outline.

666
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,340
Are you kidding me?

667
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,460
Did you eat the noodles this year?

668
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,220
Qiao Yi.

669
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,940
This is the director's habit.

670
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,260
He needs to control the script
of every movie.

671
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,900
Or he can't make the best movie.

672
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,740
If he doesn't like my work,

673
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,060
he can give up on it.

674
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:56,860
Qiao Yi.

675
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,180
Answer the phone, Kevin.

676
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,300
(You can leave if you don't want to.)

677
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,500
But this is my novel.

678
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,780
I must be responsible for my novels

679
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,380
and their derivative products.

680
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,100
You must be responsible for your novels.

681
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,740
And I must be responsible for my movies.

682
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,820
If you don't respect the difference

683
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,500
between novels and movies,

684
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,380
though you are the original author
of the novel,

685
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,620
I will refuse to work with you.

686
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,100
Great.

687
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:29,820
I also refuse to work

688
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,260
with the director
who doesn't respect the original work.

689
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:31,900
Qiao Yi.

690
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:38,940
Director.

691
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,340
We are just here

692
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,300
to talk casually.

693
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,900
I saw you talking well

694
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,020
when we just came here.

695
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,060
Why...

696
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,140
It comes to my movie.

697
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,380
Neither the famous scriptwriter

698
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,740
nor the original author can butt in it.

699
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,500
I have my own creative ideas.

700
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,140
That's respect to the movie art.

701
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,380
If he refuses to respect it,

702
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,780
I also refuse to make the movie.

703
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,260
She's gone.

704
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,380
What are you waiting for?

705
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,260
I'm waiting for you.

706
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,060
Hey, today is her birthday.

707
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,020
But you asked her

708
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,980
to do so much work.

709
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,540
I didn't know it.

710
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,900
You know it now.

711
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,740
Won't you do anything?

712
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,940
Go to find her.

713
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,180
Bring her some food.

714
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,620
Ridiculous.

715
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,740
That's just an employee's birthday.

716
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,380
Why should I do something?

717
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,900
OK.

718
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,540
If you refuse,

719
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,540
never regret it.

720
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,220
(It's just a birthday.)

721
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,500
I also spent my last birthday
working overtime.

722
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,140
What's the difference of her birthday?

723
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,180
Mr. Ji, bad news.

724
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,260
Something happened to Qiao Yi.

725
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,100
He is arguing

726
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,140
with the director.

727
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,900
Really?

728
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,580
Great.

729
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,420
Well, Mr. Ji.

730
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,340
I was too anxious just now.

731
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,860
Did I...

732
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,740
I heard it very clearly.

733
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,540
Let's go there.

734
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,780
Qiao Yi is arguing with the director.

735
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,540
Bring some gifts to them.

736
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,100
Get ready.

737
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,500
Ah, yeah.

738
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,060
Mr. Ji, you are so wise.

739
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,820
Should we take

740
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,940
the president's wine

741
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,660
or the herb

742
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,140
Mr. Jiang Hanyi sent you?

743
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,460
Director Li Han likes Sichuan cuisine.

744
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,540
Listen.

745
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,460
Go to the restaurant named Chuan Style,

746
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,340
and pack up all the popular dishes.

747
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,460
But, Mr. Ji.

748
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,180
The restaurant is too far.

749
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,380
If we pack up the food there...

750
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:32,900
Make sense.

751
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:33,860
Listen.

752
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,140
Go to Chuan Style Restaurant directly,

753
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,860
and take the chef.

754
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,580
Is there any problem?

755
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,580
No problem.

756
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,540
Let's go.

757
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,340
I'll call Zhou Tian first,

758
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,260
and tell her we are going there.

759
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,060
She needs to keep Qiao Yi there.

760
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,540
Mr. Kevin.

761
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,100
Are you and Mr. Ji going
to find Qiao Yi later?

762
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,740
What's the matter?

763
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,620
Could you please

764
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,060
take this cake to Zhou Tian?

765
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,540
The ice can't keep it for too long.

766
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,540
It is going to melt.

767
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,540
We are busy now.

768
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,460
Forget the cake.

769
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,740
But it will be wasteful if it melts.

770
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,420
Or I'll call a deliveryman.

771
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,140
Give it to me.

772
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,260
I said to give the cake to me.

773
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,380
Xia is right.

774
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,460
We can't waste it.

775
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,140
Give it to me.

776
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,460
(23℃)

777
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,060
Turn on the air conditioner. Warm air.

778
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:06,940
Mr. Ji.

779
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,780
Heating mode in this weather?

780
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,060
I feel cold.

781
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:12,740
OK.

782
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,060
Mr. Ji.

783
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,820
Are you sick?

784
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,460
Are you drained

785
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,420
because of overworking?

786
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,660
It's all my fault.

787
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,940
Turn the heat up to full blast.

788
