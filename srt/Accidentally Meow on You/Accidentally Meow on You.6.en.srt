But my experience

Mr. Ji, you're so calm.

Nope.

It can't be that easy.

61
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,500
perhaps we should go back

about the NK campaign.

I have an idea.

shows how Zhang Hao

About the ad shooting,

I told him you are impetuous.

you were culpable.

Since I was a child,

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,340
you have controlled everything

in my life.

135
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,740
I wasn't allowed
to do anything I wanted.

But I had to do everything

you wanted me to do.

and college selection.

141
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,460
Everything was under your control.

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,020
You know?

143
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,940
I feel you have chained me

144
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,180
with an invisible rock.

145
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
But now,
I want to get rid of it and get away.

146
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,220
If you had a better taste

about men,

148
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,660
I wouldn't have to intervene.

As for the college selection,

150
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,500
I thought you liked music.

151
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,740
That's why I got you
into the Juilliard School.

152

But do you know

why I like music?

154
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,900
Because it was the only thing

155
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,100
you allowed me to like.

156
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,900
However, since the day

157
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,940
when you got me
into the Juilliard School,

158
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,180
everything changed.

159
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,740
I got unhappy.

160
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,060
So I wanted to do something

161
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,940
that could make me happy again.

162
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,500
Now,

I did come across Zhang Hao,

but I didn't mention you.

167

I sent the message

168

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,620
Chen,

173
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,180
I know you had to be responsible

174
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,460
and take care of me

175
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,420
since our parents

176
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,300
died from that car accident.

177
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,060
It's just sometimes,

178
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,820
you can be pretty overwhelming.

179
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,340
I just can't take it anymore.

180
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,340
I want to live somewhere

181
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,380
you can't find me

182
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,460
and have a life of my own.

183
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,940
No, you naughty girl.

184
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,740
You can't always have canned food.

185
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,780
That guy 1003 has spoiled you.

186
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,380
Now, go ahead and eat.

187
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,820
I want to talk to you.

188
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,180
What? Is this a bad time for you?

189
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:50,900
(No, it's OK.)

190
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,260
(What do you want to talk about?)

191
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,140
Qiuqiu began to grow

192
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,540
particular about food lately.

193
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,220
She often yearns for meat
and canned food.

194
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
So, I'm thinking

195
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,140
maybe we should

196
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,820
make a dietary plan for her.

197
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,900
I'll do it and make sure
she eats healthily.

198
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,300
What do you think?

199
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,340
I like your idea.

200
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,700
I hope she can change.

201
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,380
She's been such a troublemaker.

202
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,660
Compared to kids,

203
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,740
cats are such good companions.

204
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,840
Huh?

205
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,500
(Your kids made troubles?)

206
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,700
It's my little sister.

207
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,140
Oh, your sister.

208
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,780
If you don't mind,

209
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,300
you can tell me about her.

210
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,140
We've all been teenagers once.

211
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,140
I may help you somehow.

212
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,300
She finally got into her ideal college,

213
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,540
but she chose to do something else,

214
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,260
something of no worth.

215
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,540
She even ran away from home.

216
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,140
You two had different opinions.

217
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,340
I had the same problem before.

218
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
The difference

219
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,740
is that my parents, though unhappy

220
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,060
with my life choices,

221
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,380
respected my decision.

222
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,780
My dad said

223
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,620
young people would never learn

224
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,860
if they don't face the grim reality.

225
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,500
He hoped

226
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,100
that I could face the reality

227
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,420
and work my way up to something great.

228
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,220
It would be fine

229
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,060
if I couldn't achieve anything.

230
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,940
He would take me in

231
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,300
and welcome me back.

232
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,460
Your dad sounds wise.

233
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,380
Indeed.

234
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,660
If my parents continued to oppose me,

235
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,460
I might

236
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,740
have to run away as well.

237
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,140
Teenagers

238
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,700
can be quite rebellious.

239
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,700
She will do anything

240
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,980
that you forbid her to do.

241
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,260
You might as well let her.

242
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
If she can't make it work,

243
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,340
she will come back herself.

244
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,860
But if she makes it work,

245
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,180
it's a win-win situation for you both.

246
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,420
Dad,

247
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,220
did you find what I asked for?

248
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,700
(Don't you think)

249
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,380
(you should at least say hello)

250
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,300
(and ask how I'm doing first?)

251

253

I assume Mom left you

254
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,420
for the square dance.

255
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,980
She got my approval.

256
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,620
Oh, really?

257
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,660
I can't believe Mom went without you.

258
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,980
I couldn't be home for you.

259
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,020
She should take the responsibility

260
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,540
of keeping you company

261
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,900
and comforting you.

262
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,300
She can't

263
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,460
just go out without you.

264
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,820
(You do know me, my daughter.)

265

(Yeah, better.)

268
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,180
find what I need?

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,300
(I'll send them to you.)

274
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,100
OK. Thanks, Dad.

275
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,380
Tian,

276
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,420
I'm curious.

277
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,740
Why, all of a sudden, do you

278
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,820
need the training videotapes

279
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,940
of Zhang Hao and you?

280
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,260
(Do you need it for the wedding?)

281
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,940
Huh?

282
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,340
No, of course not.

283
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,940
I need it for work.

(OK, sure, for work.)

285

(I'll express them to you
tomorrow morning.)

286
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,860
I can't believe you said that.

I'll respect every choice you make.

290
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,860
I won't try to control your life.

291
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,820
But you have to prove

292
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,060
you can be responsible for yourself.

293
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,860
To live free from me,

294
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,220
you have to be
financially independent first.

295
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,740
So simple?

296
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,820
We'll have to see later.

297
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,420
Do you think

298
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,900
I can't live without you?

299
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,860
OK, I take back the credit card then.

300
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,580
No strings attached?

301
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
You've made it clear yesterday

302
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,940
that I should have been
a better brother to you.

303
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,620
I must take it as a lesson.

304
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,420
That sounds about right.

305
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,580
You just said you wanted me to be free.

306
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,700
I don't want to befriend you on WeChat.

307
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,340
Why not? It's only WeChat.

308
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,420
Still no.

309
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,660
It's a matter of principle.

310
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,340
You have to respect me,

311
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,980
and I'll befriend you

312
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,180
when I know you mean what you said.

313
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,260
Fine, I'll wait.

314
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,900
Oh, my goodness.

315
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,340
It's Mr. Ji.

316
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,940
What?

317
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,940
I thought he didn't like small shops.

318
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,340
Perhaps Xiao Hei and other cats
changed his mind.

319
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,420
Zhou Tian didn't know

320
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,580
you are my brother.

321
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,620
You can't tell her, either.

322
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,460
Is there something wrong
with our relationship?

323
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,700
Yes, quite wrong.

324
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,220
Fine, whatever.

325
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,420
If you tell her,

326
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,060
I'll tell her
every embarrassing moment of yours,

327
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,100
starting from your childhood.

328
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,260
I also have pictures of you
in the shower.

329
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,700
You will be a disgrace in Xing Yi.

330
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,140
Oh, she's coming. Behave.

331
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,140

Morning.

334

Good morning, Mr. Ji.

335
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,020
You know each other?

336
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,060
No.

337
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,140
Sir.

338
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:30,940
Thank you for choosing our shop

339

and becoming a member.

340

That would be 10,000 yuan.

341
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,020
Thanks.

342
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,260
Tian,

343
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,460
your usual?

344
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,340
Yeah.

345
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,100
Make me two sandwiches too.

346
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,100
No problem.

347
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,740
Mr. Ji.

348
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,380
I wasn't expecting

349
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
to see you here.

350
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,940
You mentioned it's Zhang Hao's shop.

351
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,140
I thought I could give it a try.

352
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,060
Have you finished your work?

353
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,940
You look leisurely.

354
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,620
I asked team members,

355
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,420
went to the archive,

356
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,420
and went through videos and pictures

357
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,180
my dad collected.

358
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,220
And I managed

359
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,420
to find all the video materials
about Hao.

360
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,100
I'll have someone
make a video clip out of them.

361
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,140
You keep an eye on it as well.

362
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,900
You know this field
better than anyone else.

363
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,860
Emm...

364
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,380
Mr. Ji.

365
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,060
If you have an employee

366
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,660
who has found important

367
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,700
video materials

368
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,740
and can help edit them,

369
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,580
would you consider

370
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,300
giving her resignation letter back?

371
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,460
I'm not sure.

372
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,580
But I'll fire her

373
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,420
if she can't get the video clip done.

374
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,460
Tian!

375
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,020
Good morning, Mr. Ji.

376
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,940
Mr. Ji, here is our contract with NK.

377
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,140
The director of the Sports Division
has been fired,

378
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,060
and we've already issued a job posting.

379
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,940
Mr. Ji.

380
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,220
Zhou Tian is the agent assistant
of the Literature Division.

381
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,740
What is she doing in the NK project?

382
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,020
Do you know

383
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,100
how to build a trans-department team

384
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,740
by flexible cooperation?

385
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,520
I...

386
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,660
Zhou Tian is passionate,
capable, and resourceful.

387
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,460
Why don't we use her?

388
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,460
Right.

389
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,260
Inform the HR Department

390
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,940
that I will give Zhou Tian

391
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,300
a three-month job transfer training.

392
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,540
Mr. Ji, you are planning

393
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
to transfer her to the Sports Division.

394
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,700
Why are you so happy about it?

395
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,300
I'm happy for Zhou Tian.

396
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,460
She's been working so hard,

397
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,940
and her efforts are finally paid off.

398
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,700
Qiuqiu.

399
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,380
Look

400
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,380
what I got for you.

401
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,900
What's this?

402
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,460
(Do you like my candies?)

403
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,100
I don't eat candies.

404
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,460
You don't like them?

405
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,860
I've never tasted them.

406
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,580
Well, have a try.

407
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,020
Recently,

408
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,300
to avoid being targeted
by the crocodile,

409
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,700
I worked extremely hard.

410
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,580
And now I'm exhausted.

411
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,220
Only candies can make me feel better.

412
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,260
(It sounds hard to tame)

413
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,620
(crocodiles in your zoo.)

414
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,820
Forget about that.

415
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,660
You should have a taste of my candies.

416
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,940
At least
try one and then judge for yourself.

417
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,060
And it's my favorite flavor,

418
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,340
mint flavor.

419
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,500
(I bought those candies
at a shop called Mimi Faso.)

420
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,940
It's located on Mingzhi Road.

421
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,860
Zhang Hao,

422
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,300
what's so funny?

423
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,860
Tian went to collect materials

424
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,940
of our Youth Sports School,

425
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,340
and here is what she sent me.

426
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,580
Is that Tian?

427
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,340
Yeah.

428
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,860
Isn't she lovely?

429
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,300
Zhang Hao,

430
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,540
you like Tian, right?

431
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,260
Hao.

432
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,500
Gigi.

433
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,500
Tian,

434
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,740
why the hurry?

435
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,340
I have to.

436
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,820
I know you'll be on a plane tomorrow.

437
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,140
I have to bring you the contract

438
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,500
before you leave for the competition.

439
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,820
Check it yourself.

440
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,420
You've read it for me, right?

441
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,020
Still, you should read it yourself.

442
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,260
(Party A: Xing Yi Media
Party B: Zhang Hao)

443
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,900
I trust you.

444
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,860
We should celebrate it.

445
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,980
OK.

446
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,340
Your chef is getting better.

447
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,540
Hao.

448
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,900
I think

449
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,580
you may consider expanding
your business.

450
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,700
This coffee shop

451
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,660
shall sell not only desserts and coffee,

452
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,300
but also western food.

453
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,260
Really?

454
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,220
Here.

455
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,820
Have a taste.

456
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,820
OK.

457
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,020
This mushroom soup

458
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,980
is amazing!

459
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,980
Yeah.

460
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,220
Right?

461
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,020
Look how messy you got.

462
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,060
It's so good.

463
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,380
Have a bite of the corn.

464
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,940
Corn.

465
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,620
You got a great chef there.

Hi,

I'll have five hundred grams
of mint candies.

Sure. Wait a moment, please.

No, I'm Saturday.

Do you like Morning or Evening?

484
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,940
I'm so sorry.

I can change my name to Sunday.

Your birthday is coming up next week.

What do you want as a present?

489

Anything you like.

490
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,780
You already gave me one.

491
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,300
The contract.

492
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,700
That's not a present.

493
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,740
I know

494
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,820
you are not a fan

495

of business cooperation.

496

to Xing Yi so quickly

498

Tian.

502

I did sign the contract with Xing Yi,

503
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
but it wasn't only because of you.

504
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,540
Xing Yi Media is a reliable company.

505

It's better than

506

any other companies that reached me.

507

So, you don't have to overthink it.

508

OK. That is a relief.

I approached my sister, and we talked.
