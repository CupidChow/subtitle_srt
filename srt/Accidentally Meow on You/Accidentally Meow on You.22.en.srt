00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,930
These are today's papers.

174
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,290
There's still another stack on the car.

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,570
Let me finish them first,

176
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,810
and you get me the rest.

177
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,450
Hurry up.

178
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,290
Okay.

179
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,000
Mr. Ji,

180
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,290
if things go on like this,

181
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,170
I guess I'll lose a ten-year lifespan.

182
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,640
You'll get a salary rise.

183
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,970
Mr. Ji,

184
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,930
when will you

185
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,360
return to the company?

186
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,330
When Zhou Tian allows to let me go.

187
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Zhou Tian

188
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,640
is too overbearing.

189
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,450

Oh, hell!

193
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,570
Zhou Tian woke up.

194
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,570
Put them away.

195
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,720
Zhou Tian.

196
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,480
What are you doing at this late hour?

197
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,880
I have got the runs,

198
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,450
and I came to the bathroom.

199
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,720
You have a bathroom in your room.

200
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,050
A different place

201
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,000
brings me a fresh feeling.

202
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,480
A different place?

203
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,090
You mean in the study?

204
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,200
I'd love to read a book

205
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,480
sitting on the toilet.

206
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,120
No.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,970
I seemed to hear

208
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,210
Kevin's voice.

209
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,840
Zhou Tian, I...

210
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,810
Are you nervous?

211
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,760
For what is there to be nervous?

212
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,810
So weird.

213
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,450
Did I have an auditory hallucination?

214
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,210
It must be.

215
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,880
You have been doing a hard time

216
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,760
taking care of me recently,

217
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,810
and you had an auditory hallucination.

218
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,520
But I'm sure I heard his voice.

219
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,000
You probably heard it in your dream.

220
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,810
Go to sleep.

221
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,170
I did hear his voice.

222
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,090
No.

223
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,000
Move to my house tomorrow.

224
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:30,810
Your house is too large.

225
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,480
I can't make good supervision of you.

226
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,240
You gotta take a good rest.

227
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,720
Well.

228
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,170
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

229
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,720
Go to sleep now.

231

Mind your steps.

Sit here.

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,640

234
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,520
Done?

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,880
Wait.

237
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,360
Mr. Ji,

238
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,040
I still have something to do.
See you around.

239
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,170
Look,

240
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,610
the rest-cure environment
I prepared for you

241
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,300
is cozy, right?

242
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,330
Very good.

243
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,520
H-How do we live?

244
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,210
What do you mean?

245
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:35,930
Er...

246
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,050
There's only one room.

247
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,000
What's wrong with that?

248
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,640
Then...

249
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,360
Where do I sleep?

250
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,410
On the bed.

251
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,000
Come in.

252
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,080
What's up?

253
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
What are you doing?

254
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm getting a pillow.

255
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Have a good night.

256
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,890
Can't you stop making trouble?

257
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,410
Rest-cure!

258
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,560
I...

259
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,040
I can't fall asleep,

260
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,210
so I wanted to take a walk.

261
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,040
I think

262
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,010
I'm almost recovered.

263
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,700
I can deal

264
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,520
with some simple work.

265
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Why can't you listen
to the doctor's instructions?

266
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,210
The doctor said
you should have a rest-cure.

267
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,560
But you have to walk around.

268
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,550
What if there's anything wrong

269
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,600
with your body?

270
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,410
What can I do?

271
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,450
Is this how you take care of yourself?

272
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,850
Zhou Tian,

273
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,170
I know you're worried about me.

274
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,650
But your way

275
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,450
of the rest-cure has been too much.

276
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,760
Do you mean

277
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,170
I take it too seriously?

278
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,800
I once thought

279
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,390
everyone is

280
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,680
as strong as me.

281
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
But ever since I have known you,

282
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,660
I notice another side of life.

283
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,950
The way you cherish your life,

284
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,600
and how fragile you are

285
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,210
stimulate my desire to protect you.

286
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
I love you,

287
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,620
so I want to take care of you.

288
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,920
I don't wish
to see anything bad happen to you.

289
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,370
Silly girl,

290
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,410
I know you're worried about me.

291
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,890
But I used to think that

292
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,370
life lies in stillness.

293
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,170
But after the rest-cure
for a couple of days,

294
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,970
I found out that

295
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,760
there's a limit to everything.

296
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,040
Too much water drowned the miller.

297
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,130
Do you still
want the absolute rest-cure now?

298
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,080
Nope.

299
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,410
I just want

300
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,650
to take some exercise now.

301
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,130
Take some exercise.

302
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,410
Have you made up your mind?

303
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,170
Yes.

304
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,970
Life lies in movement.

305
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,560
Okay.

306
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,450
Let's add some

307
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,130
proper exercise

308
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,410
from now on.

309
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:26,970
I have asked

310
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
my former team doctor

311
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,660
to work out a set of

312
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,050
exercise recovery plan for you.

313
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,450
So in the following days,

314
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,080
do as I say.

315
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,470
You have planned everything well, right?

316
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,400
I learned it from you.

317
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,210
Good night.

318
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,890
Good night.

319

to increase
your cardio-pulmonary function.

321

When you are running,

322
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,080
your pulmonary lobes

323
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,560
get great training.

324
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,040
Shift your center
of body weight forward.

325
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,970
Keep your elbows by your waist.

326
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,360
While you are running,

327
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,040
the average speed is 170 to 180 steps
per minute.

No.

I have run out of my strength.

Can I take a break?

Hang in there a bit longer.

You haven't got enough exercise yet.

I'm exhausted.

Look at you.

You are no good at running,

368

nor can you ride a bike.

369

I can't ride a bike,

370

Ji Chen,

have you seen

378
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,040
those cartoons

379
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,930
Gigi draws on the blackboard

380
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,320
at the door of the café?

381
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,760
And she posted them on social media.

382
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,800
They became popular on the Internet.

383

Many guests in our café

came to take photos.

But

387
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,970
I have a feeling that

388
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,800
the cartoons she drew
weren't in a good mood.

389
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,090
They are always something like farewell,

390

appreciation, or something.

391
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,660
Is she planning to resign?

What do you think?

393
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,710
Is she?

394
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,070
Didn't she just say that

395
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,550
she rejected the producer?

396
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,790
Where else can she go?

I'm just checking.

If she's really going to resign,

401
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,380
will you keep her or not?

402

I don't want to go home.

Why do you want to stay at my house?

409

You're my girlfriend.

410

I'm having a relationship with you,

411

not a marriage.

Go home.

Stay in your big villa.

Go.

00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,860
Good boy. Go home.

416

Go.

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,790
Well.

418

What's up?

419
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,070
One more kiss here.

420

What's wrong again?

421

Send me home.

422
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,310
But in most situations,

423
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,900
it's a man sending a woman back.

424
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,580
I can send you back again.

425

Fine, let's go.

426

I'll walk you to the door.

See you.

Why don't you go upstairs?

431
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,270
I want to watch you leave.

You go ahead.

443

I told you.

- I want to watch you leave. Go.
- Enough.

just stay here

Now?

We'd better avoid arousing suspicion.

It's no big deal.

497

But I don't think

501
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,370
it's a perfect time
to publicize our relationship now.

Why?

503

Office romances are not advocated
in Xing Yi.

Is it true?

505

I never heard about that.

It's against human nature.

507
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,820
I'll tell the HR Department

508
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,620
to remove the rule,

509

511

provided they do their jobs well.

00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,180
my biggest concern.

514
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,900
After my hard work,

515
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,030
it won't take me

516
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,340
a long time

517
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,070
to fulfill my dream

518
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,860
of entering
the Sports Division Department.

519
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,270
It's an undoubtedly

520
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,580
logical thing.

521
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,720
But if they know our relationship

522
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,230
ahead of time,

523
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,710
the whole story

524
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,820
will get twisted.

525
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,990
I can't stop the rumors.

526
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,830
But I have the final say

527
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,260
of their lives.

528
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,870
That's the point.

529
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,430
We are romantically involved now,

530
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,390
and I need to prove myself

531
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,030
with my own strength.

532
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,690
Never expected my girl

533
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,100
to be push-and-go.

534
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,660
Good, I support you.

535
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,470
The quarterly performance appraisal

536
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,030
is around the corner.

537
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,180
If you could finish

538
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,180
the target,

539
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,300
I'll transfer you

540
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,180
to the Sports Division Department
aboveboard.

541
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,140
Sounds weird.

542
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,030
However,

543
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,390
even though I go to another department,

544
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,220
I still can't get away

545
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,990
with your claws.

546
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,390
Claws?

547
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,260
I'll show you

548
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,180
the real power of my claws!

549
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,660
Tell me that again

550
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,780
when you catch up

551
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,180
the champion of the race.

552
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:03,950
See you later.

553
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,910
Hi.

554
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,430
Morning.

555
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:14,990
Morning.

556
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,260
Hi.

557
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,770
Morning.

558
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Morning.

559
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,560
Morning.

560
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,240
Morning.

561
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,220
You're all here.

562
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,780
Good morning, Mr. Ji.

563
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,830
How's it?

564
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,550
My speed from the underground

565
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,620
to the elevator

566
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,780
didn't lose to the champion of the race,
right?

567
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,550
Come on.

568
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,220
You are not going upstairs?

569
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:58,930
We do.

570
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,120
Don't you take the elevator?

571
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,140
We do.

572
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,870
Why don't you come in?

573
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,470
You may go upstairs first.

574
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
It's too crowded.

575
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,910
Right?

576
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,100
Look,

577
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,260
they don't dare

578
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,700
to take the elevator with us now.

579
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,910
So I make three rules

580
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,910
with you from now on.

581
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,160
First,

582
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,040
no intimate actions in the company.

583
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,780
Second,

584
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,950
keep our relationship

585
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,730
from everyone else.

586
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,550
Third,

587
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,100
business is business.
Don't treat me with private emotion.

588
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,070
Okay, I promise you.

589
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,140
You are the boss.

590
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,240
If you break the rules,

591
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,660
we're over.

592
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,000
Once out of the elevator,

593
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,240
our relationship is boss-employee.

594
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:54,990
We will get on our own ways.

595
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,140
But we are

596
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,870
still a couple now.

597
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,550
What a coincidence.

598
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,740
The elevator is a bit crowded.

599
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,870
How about we take the next one?

600
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,780
- OK.
- OK.

601
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,100
No. It's alright.

602
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,660
Come in, please.

603
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,870
Come in.

604
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,530
Yes.

605
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,350
