(Not a festival.)

173
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,460
(He prepared so much stuff.)

174
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,460
(And he asked Zhou Tian out.)

175
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,020
(What is he up to?)

176
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,820
(I bet he's not up to something good.)

177
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,860
Hi, Hao.

178
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,260
I'm at the gate.

179
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,900
Didn't I ask Xin Xin to do this?

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,780
What? I'm not welcomed?

181
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,860
No, no.

182
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,900
Wait for a second.

183
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,860
I'll be there in a minute.

184
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,060
Gigi.

185
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,380
Hao.

186
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,980
Thank you so much.

187
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,220
You drove a long way

188
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,860
to deliver them to me.

189
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,220
No biggie.

190
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,260
They are in the trunk.

191
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Give this to me.

192
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,260
- Be careful.
- OK.

193
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,380
It's heavy.

194
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
By the way, Hao.

195
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,340
Is this the place

196
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,260
where you usually take the training?

197
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,180
Yes.

198
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,460
It's our training center.

199
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,700
But our normal training
takes place downtown.

200
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
We only come here once a year

201
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,620
for closed intensive training.

202
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,220
Oh,

203
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,380
I was planning to ask Xin Xin

204
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
to do me a favor.

205
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,180
Tell me. I can help you.

206
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,900
OK.

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,060
Let's get in first.

208
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,620
Yeah.

209
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,500
Let's go.

210
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,260
Eh,

211
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,980
it's quite far from the city.

212
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,660
I can't rest assured

213
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,660
to let you drive alone in the evening.

214
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,900
I'm thinking

215
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,740
you'd better stay here for a night.

216
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,540
There are no more rooms

217
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,540
in that building where we stay.

218
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,620
But I'll get you one somewhere else.

219
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,100
I'm good with it.

220
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,020
Good.

221
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,260
Hao,

222
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,900
what are you doing with so many lamps?

223
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,540
That's why

224
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,420
I need your help.

225
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,740
You'll know soon.

226
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,100
Gigi, what are you doing here?

227
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,380
I delivered something

228
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,220
to Zhang Hao.

229
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,900
Let me carry it for you.

230
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,420
It's OK. I can handle it.

231
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,780
Ji Nian...

232
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,540
Mr. Ji,

233
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,140
you know her name?

234
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,500
I saw her in the café.

235
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,540
I don't think

236
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,660
I have an impression of the guest.

237
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,340
Wait.

238
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,140
Gigi, you are also surnamed Ji.

239
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,180
Do you have any family ties?

240
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,420
You are also surnamed Ji?

241
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,940
What's your name?

242
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,420
Ji Chen.

243
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,140
Ji Chen?

244
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,980
Not a good name.

245
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,460
Hao,

246
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,220
what are these in the cases?

247
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,660
N-Nothing.

248
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,620
Gigi.

249
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,060
Come and help me with something.

250
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,140
Let's go.

251
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,820
- We're off, then.
- OK.

252
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,660
Be cautious.

253
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,340
Put them here.

254
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,260
OK.

255
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,300
These are solar-powered lamps.

256
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,260
Gigi,

257
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,060
place them in the shape of a heart

258
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,140
on the beach.

259
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,300
They will give out the light at night.

260
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,940
The shape of a heart?

261
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,900
Hao,

262
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,020
you are gonna confess your feeling
to someone, aren't you?

263
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,060
I'm wondering

264
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
who is so lucky?

265
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,100
Is she Tian?

266
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,180
Yes.

267
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,300
Why?

268
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,380
Nothing.

269
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,340
It's a bit surprising to me.

270
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,460
So none of you know

271
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,620
I have a thing for Tian.

272
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,060
You are nice

273
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,100
to every girl.

274
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
How could I know

275
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,860
who you like.

276
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,340
That's my problem.

277
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,140
I gotta make my feelings clearer to her.

278
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,100
Speaking of that,

279
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,500
I should thank you.

280
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,140
Gigi,

281
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,860
you enlightened me.

282
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,140
You told me last time that

283
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,380
the confession should be made at a place

284
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,740
where it's special to both parties.

285
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
It reminded me of the beach.

286
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,780
We took the training here
when we were young.

287
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,140
I found her on this beach

288
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,980
when she ran out of the training center.

289
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,420
That night,

290
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,180
we saw the Bioluminescent Oceans.

291
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,740
It was so amazing.

292
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,780
I still remember her

293
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,340
rushing into the sea

294
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,140
and dancing around.

295
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,380
She said

296
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,100
she would come to see this every year.

297
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
But the Bioluminescent Oceans

298
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,020
only appears
for a short period every year.

299
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,860
Sometimes,

300
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,500
it hits our training time.

301
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,220
Or I went out for competitions.

302
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,460
Anyway,

303
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,420
we've been missing the view
all these years.

304
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,220
But this year,

305
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,420
it appears right in recent days.

306
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,100
So I was planning

307
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,260
to confess my feelings to her

308
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,580
in the place

309
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,820
where we share the same memory.

310
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,820
I want to give her

311
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,420
another memorable experience.

312
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,020
Tian is really lucky

313
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,860
to have such a good man in her life.

314
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,580
Hao,

315
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,020
hope you can make it.

316
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,780
Come on.

317
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,060
Here.

318
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,060
What's up?

319
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,060
Where are you?

320
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,960
(Why?)

321
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,740
Are you trying to watch me?

322
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,420
Is caring for you
what you call watching?

323
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,100
Well. It's not.

324
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,820
By the way,

325
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,500
what are those in the cases

326
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,580
that Zhang Hao asked you to deliver?

327
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,740
(Ball lamps.)

328
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,900
What are they used for?

329
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,060
He...

330
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,780
He's gonna make those lamps
the shape of a heart

331
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,260
on the beach,

332
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,780
and confess his feelings to Tian.

333
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:41,940
What are you doing?

334
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,060
Zhang Hao is gonna take action!

335
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,260
So what?

336
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,460
"So what?"

337
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,020
You just wanna stand aside

338
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,220
and watch them

339
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,300
have a happy ending?

340
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,780
What does it

341
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,740
have to do with me?

342
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,180
Stop talking back!

343
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,740
The moment you knew

344
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,620
Zhou Tian was Sunday,

345
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,260
you'd fallen in love with her.

346
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,780
Don't deny it.

347
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,340
Think over what you've done for her.

348
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,940
Every single thing is a proof

349
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,980
of your affection for her.

350
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,260
Sent meals to the crew,

351
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,980
or made noodles for her.

352
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,740
You know what?

353
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,780
Since Nian went away to her school,

354
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,380
I've never seen you

355
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,620
make noodles for anyone else.

356
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,380
I...

357
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,940
Not now.

358
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,060
Let me finish.

359
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,100
And you came to the training center.

360
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,580
Did you come for Qiao Yi?

361
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,460
Come on.

362
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,380
Qiao Yi just came to shoot some videos.

363
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Does something as trivial as that

364
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,820
require a CEO to deal with?

365
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,100
What's more,

366
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,700
you didn't intend to come.

367
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
You heard that Zhang Hao would come.

368
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,060
That was why you followed them here.

369
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,580
How calm a man you have always been.

370
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,140
Your heart rate

371
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,580
never rises above 120 per minute.

372
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,020
Look at you.

373
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,260
How many times has it gone
beyond the rate?

374
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,460
Stop it.

375
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,020
You're so nagging.

376
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,660
Are you done?

377
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,660
It means that a nagger

378
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,460
is living in your heart,

379
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,900
but you just refuse to admit it.

380
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,220
Well.

381
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,460
Come up with a way for me.

382
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,100
What can I do?

383
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,540
You are an expert at it.

384
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,500
You know best

385
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,420
how to play tricks.

386
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,540
For our beloved,

387
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,300
just do it.

388
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,460
(I can't make Zhang Hao's confession)

389
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,420
(a good ending.)

390
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,820
I'm worn out.

391
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,140
Didn't sleep well.

392
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,060
Do you have any food here?

393
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,660
Like rice noodles or something?

394
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:36,940
Qiao Yi,

395
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,660
don't you think you have lost

396
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,820
a good deal of your hair in recent days?

397
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,540
You also discovered that?

398
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,060
My hair falls out

399
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
when I'm in a fuzzy state of mind.

400
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,860
It appears that your stay here

401
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,740
is not that satisfactory.

402
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:48,860
How about this?

403
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,460
I arranged you interviews

404
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,620
for a few athletes.

405
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,580
How about we knock off

406
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,860
ahead of the time?

407
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,740
You, me,

408
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,620
and Zhou Tian.

409
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,620
Let's leave together.

410
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,260
Now,

411
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,700
I'll ask the driver to get the car here.

412
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,740
Let me pack your luggage for you.

413
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,140
I bet you won't hang in there
for three days.

414
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,700
Are you happy with that?

415
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,220
I'm not going to leave.

416
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,540
Aren't you worn out,

417
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,020
and in a fuzzy state of mind?

418
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,860
That's true.

419
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,620
But staying in such a beautiful place,

420
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,780
and leading a regular life,

421
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,060
with substantial food and drink,

422
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,260
and fresh air,

423
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,380
I've been in love with the place.

424
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,300
Honestly,

425
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,740
since I came here,

426
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,220
though I haven't had much inspiration,

427
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,540
I believe those experiences

428
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,620
and accumulations of life

429
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
would sooner or later

430
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,060
make their way in my mind.

431
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,700
So I decide to stay longer here.

432
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,100
What a stubborn guy.

433
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,260
Mr. Kevin,

434
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,780
Mr. Kevin,

435
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,940
this is Qiao Yi's schedule
for next week.

436
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,980
Please check it.

437
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,620
Among them,

438
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,740
Baoli Show on Thursday

439
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,860
remains a top priority.

440
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,500
I heard you're responsible for this.

441
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,660
Mr. Ji specially put me
in full charge of the event

442
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
before he left.

443
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,980
Mr. Ji is said to be planning

444
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,860
to promote a vice chairman

445
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
from the current staff.

446
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,980
You are doing great with Mr. Ji.

447
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,660
It seems...

448
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Keep it low.

449
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,180
Let me take it.

450
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,700
Hello, Mr. Ji.

451
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,300
How are you doing there?

452
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,100
How's the build-up

453
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,980
to the Baoli Show going?

454
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,060
(I'll go through the process today)

455
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,940
including the styling designer,

456
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,820
dressing room, etc.

457
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,820
(All of them will be confirmed today.)

458
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,780
(Please rest assured.)

459
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,620
Well,

460
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,580
you don't have to take care of this.

461
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,300
I'll ask Zhou Tian to come back

462
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,020
and deal with it.

463
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,460
(What happened to Mr. Ji?)

464
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,220
(Why doesn't he trust me?)

465
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,620
(Hello?)

466
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,940
O-OK.

467
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,260
(No.)

468
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,340
(It must be Zhou Tian's trick.)

469
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,340
(I must show Mr. Ji.)

470
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,500
(I, Kevin,)

471
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,220
(is all-powerful.)

472
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,380
(I'm doing my job 100 times)

473
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,460
(better than Zhou Tian is.)

474
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,300
Er...

475
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,420
Er...

476
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,180
Mr. Ji,

477
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,100
anything I can help you with?

478
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,780
Qiao Yi has a brand event next week.

479
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,540
You go back to the company now

480
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,420
to confirm the general process
with them.

481
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,980
Confirm the style with the designer.

482
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,300
Then choose Qiao Yi's dresses
in advance,

483
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,220
and send pictures to me.

484
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,420
Go to the event site

485
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,900
to identify the location
of the dressing room.

486
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,660
Then draw a detailed

487
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,620
timetable and roadmap from Qiao Yi

488
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,980
gets off the car to the red carpet.

489
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,180
Accurate to minute.

490
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,300
S-So many tasks.

491
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,860
I shall leave now?

492
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,380
Yep.

493
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,660
Right away.

494
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,020
I guess I can't

495
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,140
make my return here tonight.

496
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,340
Don't worry about that.

497
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,540
Just stay in the city.

498
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
You have some other work to do tomorrow.

499
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,700
I see.

500
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

501
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,500
I'll go pack my stuff up.

502
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,860
Don't bother.

503
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,660
I'll find someone
to pack them up for you.

504
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,540
Just set off right now.

505
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,780
The driver is waiting for you
at the gate.

506
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,020
Okay, I'll take my bag.

507
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,100
Hello, Hao.

508
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
I have to go back
for some urgent business.

509
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,100
I'm afraid

510
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,620
I can't come back tonight.

511
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,380
(What sudden news.)

512
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Can't you deal with it tomorrow?

513
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,380
It's urgent.

514
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,140
I'm so sorry.

515
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,420
Can we take a rain check?

516
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,220
All right.

517
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,020
Rain check.

518
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:52,900
Mr. Ji,

519
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,460
I want to verify the stuff with you.

520
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,020
I'll first confirm the process,

521
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,500
and then the designer.

522
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,820
After that,

523
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,980
I'll verify the styles,

524
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,780
and then send the pictures
of the dresses

525
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,540
to you.

526
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,580
Finally, it's the roadmap
from getting off the car

527
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,260
to the dressing room.

528
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,460
Apart from them...

529
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,180
Hello, Mr. Kevin.

530
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,340
(Zhou Tian,)

531
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,460
(I just want to tell you that)

532
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,740
(I've done everything Mr. Ji bid.)

533
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,700
(You don't have to come back.)

534
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,700
(The process,)

(have all been sent to Mr. Ji.)

538
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,900
Mr. Kevin is awesome.

539
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,860
He has done everything you bid.

540
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:46,980
Mr. Ji,

541
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,220
should I still go back?

542
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,940
Zhang Hao has something to settle

543
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,140
with me tonight.

544
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,020
Had there been no other emergency,

545
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,300
could I return to the company

546
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,180
tomorrow morning?

547
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,220
I can leave at the early hour.

548
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,500
Hello, Hao.

549
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,460
I don't have to go back.

550
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Just keep our original schedule.

551
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,420
See you tonight.

552
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,020
(You think you're cool)

553
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,500
(when you're saying this, right?)

554
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,620
(But it only proves you're dictatorial
and cheap.)

555
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,540
(Then you tell him)

556
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,380
(your education background,)

557
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,220
(and what job you've ever done?)

558
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,460
What's wrong with my education?

559
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,380
(You're just a ruthless crocodile)

560
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,380
in his heart.

561
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,420
(I'll definitely fight till the end)

562
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,620
with the evil force.

563
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,660
I like her.

564
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,780
(No one knows us)

565
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,500
(better than we know each other.)

566
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,500
(We shall never be apart in my life.)

567
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
(Night)

568
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,300
Tian.

569
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,180
Hao.

570
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,420
Didn't we agree to meet on the beach?

571
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,220
It's still early,

572
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,580
so I came to wait for you.

573
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,100
Do you remember

574
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,340
our first visit here?

575
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,180
Sure.

576
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,620
I ran away

577
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,300
because the training

578
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
was too tough.

579
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,260
I got lost here.

580
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,700
I cried,

581
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,500
and you came to look for me.

582
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,060
What happened then?

583
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,460
Then?

584
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,180
Then we saw
the beautiful Bioluminescent Oceans.

585
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,940
The whole sea was glowing
with blue light.

586
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,300
The waves rose and fell.

587
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,940
So amazing it was.

588
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,460
I said back then that

589
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,020
I would come here every year.

590
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,340
But we never make it happen.

591
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,380
Chen,

592
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
you wanna follow them?

593
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,220
I didn't expect you to like Zhou Tian.

594
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,180
No.

595
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,220
Then why don't you follow them?

596
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,540
You just want to stand here

597
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,820
and watch Zhang Hao

598
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,900
express his feelings to Tian?

599
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,980
It's not your style.

600
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,260
You never allowed yourself

601
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
to be a coward.

602
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,620
I'm not.

603
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,940
But I found out that

604
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,980
they do have a great deal

605
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,900
of common memories.

606
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,220
While I'm in no position

607
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,060
to step into his shoes.

608
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,780
If Zhou Tian said yes to Zhang Hao.

609
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,020
I...

610
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,740
I will respect her choice.

611
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,740
I will not trouble her

612
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,020
with my wishful thinking,

613
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,500
and leave her in a quandary.

614
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,940
Not trouble her

615
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,860
with your wishful thinking.

616
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,500
By the way,

617
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,980
what are you doing here?

618
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,420
To witness the critical moment
of my idol.

619
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,820
Chen,

620
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,180
do you wanna listen
to what they will say?

621
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,940
Come with me.

622
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,620
It's as beautiful as it was years ago.

623
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,060
Yeah.

624
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,820
I always want

625
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,420
to take you back

626
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,180
and watch this one more time.

627
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,100
Hao,

628
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,540
I really appreciate it.

629
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,740
Tian,

630
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,100
come with me.

631
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,460
Tian,

632
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,100
come in here.

633
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,580
Tian,

634
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,900
I asked myself one day

635
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,980
since when

636
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,980
I had a crush on you.

637
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,300
I had no idea, either.

638
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,660
Cause I've been used

639
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,420
to having you in my life

640
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,540
since we were young.

641
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,420
We never parted

642
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,900
either in life

643
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
or in training.

644
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,620
You have appeared

645
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,020
in every one
of my unforgettable memories.

646
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,940
Tian.

647
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,060
Maybe you feel like

648
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,460
it's a bit abrupt.

649
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,780
But I've told you long ago that

650
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,460
I always think

651
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,580
we are family.

652
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,900
More than the past,

653
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,660
but now,

654
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,980
and even the future,

655
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,220
I hope

656
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,420
I can protect you,

657
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:04,820
take care of you,

658
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,500
and stay with you forever.

659
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,700
I want to make you

660
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:10,900
the happiest

661
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,780
and most carefree girl in the world.

I've always liked you.

But my feelings for you

674

are merely something between

fellows, friends,

I've always been lucky.

I have you to protect me

00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,020
I made a good result,

685
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,580
you were there to cheer for me.

686
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,660
But I've grown up.

687
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,580
I'm no longer the little girl

688
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,700
you took under your wings.

689
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,260
I could face the ups and downs myself,

690
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,060
and pursue a better me.

691
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,140
However,

692
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,900
you still treat me

693
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,540
like a child.

694
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,020
I know

695
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,420
it's a care to me,

696
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,180
just like the care

697
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,580
between siblings.

698
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,420
So my feelings for you

699
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,380
cannot be called love.

700
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,940
Maybe your feelings

701
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,980
all these years

702
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,460
were for that girl

703
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,820
who secretly came here to cry

704
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,580
because of exhaustion,

705
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,020
grievance, and homesickness.

706
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,700
For that girl

707
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,060
who needed your help,

708
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,740
comfort, and protection.

709
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,100
But I'm not the little girl

710
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,460
I used to be.

711
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,980
I'm sorry.

712
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,220
I can't give you the answer

713
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,660
you wish to hear.

714
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,740
Maybe

715
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,260
you don't want to see me anymore.

716
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,580
I understand it.

717
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,540
Yet I'll wait patiently

718
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,580
until you cool down.

719
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,420
I'll feel better

720
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,300
if you think

721
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,980
we could keep it

722
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,340
as we used to be.

723
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,100
You should give a part of care for me

724
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,020
to someone else.

725
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,180
In that case,

726
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,380
you'll encounter

727
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,020
your true love.

728
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,580
So,

729
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,980
I don't have the chance, right?

730
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,900
I truly treat you

731
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,940
as my brother.

732
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,060
And that's all.

733
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:21,900
See?

734
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,380
What did I say?

735
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,420
They're just brother and sister,

736
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,980
and that's all.

737
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:29,620
It's OK.

738
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,180
The wind blows from them to us.

739
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,420
We can hear what they say.

740
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,460
But they can't hear us.

741
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Thank you for everything

742
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,380
you've done for me.
