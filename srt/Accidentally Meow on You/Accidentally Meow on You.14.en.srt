you are.

74
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,290
There's a petty thing

75

that I want to learn from you.

76
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,180
I happened to see

77
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,620
you took a cat to the pet store
the other day.

78
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,580
You saw that?

79
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,180
Then?

80
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,530
I remember that you said

81
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,210
you hated cats.

82
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,450
You looked after the cat

83
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,100
for an important person.

84
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,940
Do I know

85
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,260
that person as well?

86
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,620
Why bother to ask so much?

87
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,060
Does it have to do with the work?

88
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,770
Sure.

89
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,580
I guess the person

90
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,820
is both crucial to you and Xing Yi.

91
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,650
Am I right?

92
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,850
I do have some experience

93
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,410
in keeping cats.

94
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,090
So I want

95
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,970
to put up some ideas for you.

96
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,660
I knew you weren't
harboring good designs.

97
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,580
What a pity.

98
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,770
You would never snatch the cat from me.

99
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,260
He's such a self-centered man,

100
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,580
but he asked me to take care of his cat.

101
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,530
What does it stand for?

102
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,820
It's his trust to me.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,850
He thinks highly of me.

104
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,260
And we are intimate mates.

105
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,820
So the man

106
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,020
is really Mr...

I didn't even know you had a girlfriend,

110

Don't have them affect your work.

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,810
You started arguing again.

342
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,260
Save it.

343
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,770
Let's get back

344
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,180
to the business.

345
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,220
Right.

346
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,770
We are discussing

347
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,290
Zhou Tian and Zhang Hao.

348
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,900
Let's stop fighting.

349
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,980
Alright.

350
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,020
They have known each other

351
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,500
for so long.

352
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,330
They should lose no time
and get married.

353
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,610
Yes.

354
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,130
I have prepared the deposit
for the hotel.

355
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,260
No matter who Zhou Tian is dating

356
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,460
in the future,

357
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,220
we are ready for her wedding
at any time.

358
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,570
No matter who?

359
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,370
He must be Zhang Hao!

360
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,420
Come on.

361
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,050
Let's discuss

362
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,330
how to get them back

363
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,660
and get married.

364
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,740
Come on!

365
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,500
The situation now...

366
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,290
Yeah.

367
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,530
What brought you here?

368
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,570
For work, of course.

369
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,020
Do you think I have any evil designs
for you?

370
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,530
Since it's about work,

371
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,850
we can talk about it in the company.

372
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,700
I have to deal with the thing
at your home.

you also know that

I have to meet Qiao Yi's demand.

381
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,290
This is not

382
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,420
a hard thing.

383
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,660
I just have to visit

384
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,420
your house,

385
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,130
so I can

buy the stuff online.

387
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,740
Mr. Ji,

388
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,700
you can do your business.

389
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,180
Leave me alone.

390
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,330
I'll show myself around.

391
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,420
The Intelligent audio is pretty good.

This thing is more than intelligent.

It's super intelligent!

405
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,330
It's customized for me.

406
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,700
Therefore, it doesn't have a brand.

407
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,660
This sound is too much.

408
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,810
I should go to Qiao Yi's,

409
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,260
and get his sound.

I think that robot might be useful.

Qiao Yi will like it.

It's alright.

425
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,180
Her boss might be a female.

426
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,180
What do you mean?

427
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,940
I'd rather her boss is a man.

428

Oh my, it hurts so bad.

429

Zhou Tian.

I'll have all the information

431
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,090
about those electronic
appliances checked

432
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,940
and sent to you later.

433
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,980
It's fine.

434
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,220
I have checked their models already.

435
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,530
No need to send them.

436
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,330
Then,

437
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,370
Qiao Yi is short-tempered.

438
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,700
He won't wait for me.

439
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
We need to see our client at 19:00.

440
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,700
You should go back to the company now.

441
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,290
No.

442
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,570
I should stay and check
if there is anything else.

443
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,420
Did you find what you need?

444
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,530
If no, you should go.

445
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,290
There is nothing here

446
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,980
that Qiao Yi may like.

447
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I should go upstairs and check again.

448
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,290
Sure.

449
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,460
(He wants me to leave so bad.)

450
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,220
(He must be really worried.)

451
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,220
(I think Qiuqiu is hidden somewhere.)

452
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,260
What's the matter, Mr. Ji?

453
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,460
It's getting dark.
Those curtains should be drawn.

454
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,420
You drew the curtains so fast

455
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,260
that I thought you were
planning something evil.

456
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,460
(Perhaps Qiuqiu is behind the couch.)

457
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,180
This intelligent lamp seems amazing.

458
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,460
What are you doing?

459
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,900
Mr. Ji, you didn't seem

460
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,810
quite right from the beginning.

461
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,330
You acted like you
were hiding something.

462
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,810
(So awkward.)

463
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,660
(Is he going to kiss me?)

464
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,700
(What's this?)

465
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,570
(It's my number code.)

466
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,660
What do these numbers stand for?

467
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,370
Every two numbers represent one letter

468
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,850
according to the order of the alphabet.

469
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,900
Zero eight represents "H".

470
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,220
Zero one represents "A".

471
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,980
Do you have anything you want to say?

472
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,850
Yes.

473
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,770
But we don't have time now.

474
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,940
I'll tell you on our way to dinner.

475
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,460
Mr. Ji.

476
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,770
Let me tell you a story.

477
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,460
A close friend of mine

478
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,090
recently met someone online.

479
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,570
That guy also likes

480
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,290
to hide secrets with numbers.

481
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,050
They had a great time

482
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,420
talking with each other.

483
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,770
My friend even shared

484
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,020
her personal feelings with that guy.

485
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,050
However, she found out

486
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,290
that guy was her boss.

487
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,500
It was all premeditated.

488
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:24,980
Tell me.

489
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,740
What should she do?

490
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,130
I say...

491
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,500
We are really out of time now.

492
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,180
Do you really have nothing
to share with me?

493
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
I can't tell you now.

494
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,330
Now, let's go.

495
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,850
Mr. Ji.

496
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,050
I'm not feeling well.

497
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,770
So, I'm not going to meet our client
with you tonight.

498
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,260
Kevin will company you.

499
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,740
Bye.

500
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,740
Zhou Tian.

501
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,530
Zhou Tian.

502
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,530
Zhou Tian.

503
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,700
Wait a minute, Zhou Tian.

504
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,420
Zhou Tian.

505
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,740
Please come with me.

506
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,770
You will know everything.

507
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,370
I already knew.

508
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,220
You are that guy 1003.

509
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,050
According to the alphabet,

510
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
No. 10 stands for letter J.

511
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,770
And No. 03 stands for the letter C.

512
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,370
Therefore, 1003 actually represents JC,

513
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,770
which is the abbreviation for Ji Chen.

514
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
It was so obvious.

515
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,090
I can't believe
I didn't realize it earlier.

516
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,570
And I let you deceive me for so long.

517
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,980
What a wily CEO you are!

518
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,530
So smart! Well done!

519
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,850
You took advantage of my trust,

520
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,090
and got information from me.

521
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,020
I have said so many things to you.

522
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,090
You must have

523
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,500
planned how to get back to me

524
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,900
while listening

525
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,050
to my complaints.

526
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,570
I can't believe I walked
right into your trap.

527
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,500
Zhou Tian.

528
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,980
I really need you
to go somewhere with me.

529
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,900
You will see.

530
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,130
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

531
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,330
I'm going home.

532
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,700
I...

533
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,020
And Qiuqiu,

534
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,900
you lied to her as well.

535
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,740
Please leave her alone from now on.

536
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,130
Zhou Tian.

537
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,290
Zhou Tian.

538
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,820
(There are 20 minutes left.)

539
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,330
Zhou Tian.

540
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,500
Zhou Tian.

541
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,810
Please don't be mad, Zhou Tian.

542
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,610
Please get in the car. Let's talk.

543
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,370
Zhou...

544
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,810
Zhou Tian.

545
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,130
Mr. Ji.

546
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,260
If my memory serves me right,

547
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,420
I'm off work right now.

548
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,500
It's beyond work hours.

549
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,770
You don't get to boss me around now.

550
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,050
Please don't be mad, Zhou Tian.

551
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,020
We can talk in the car.

552
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,810
Ji Chen.

553
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,770
Do you think it's some kind of joke?

554
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,460
As a retired athlete,
I had to start over in Xing Yi.

555
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,330
I need to build a new career,

556
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,900
adapt to my new job, and deal
with interpersonal relationships.

557
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,570
It was a difficult time for me.

558
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,980
Suddenly, there was a guy

559
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,220
who was willing to help with my cat.

560
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,020
He understood me, cared about me,

561
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,290
and complained about my boss with me.

562
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,660
It turned out

563
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,700
that guy was my boss.

564
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,130
You sweet-talked me on WeChat,

565
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,980
while giving me a hard time
in the company.

566
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,220
Is it fun to see me

567
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,610
being fooled around like that?

568
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,220
Zhou Tian.

569
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,090
I know I shouldn't have deceived you,

570
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,260
and I didn't mean that.

571
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,370
I met Qiuqiu by accident.

572
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,370
And I did find you repulsive
in the beginning.

573
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,850
Look at you,
you don't have an advanced degree,

574
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,660
and you don't really know
how to dress up.

575
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,900
Plus, when you play,

576
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,220
you don't seem like a girl.

577
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,180
When I give you a task,

578
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,180
you always mess it up.

579
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,460
And you always did the opposite
even if you promised to do as I asked.

580
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,420
However,

581
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,530
I don't know why, but I...

582
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,130
- That's enough!
- But I...

583
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,020
Since I'm such a terrible employee,

584
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,530
you can fire me.

585
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,370
You can ask the human resources
to terminate my employment tomorrow.

586
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,570
Zhou Tian.

587
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,420
But I...

588
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,020
I'm not done talking yet.

589
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,770
Mr. Ji.

590
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
Where is Zhou Tian?

591
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,330
I see, Mr. Ji.

592
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,570
You must have come around,

593
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,500
and decided not to call her.

594
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,020
That's great!

595
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,660
I know

596
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,260
that you will come to your sense.

597
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,330
I'm telling you,

598
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,260
I thought

599
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,220
you were beyond yourself before.

600
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,330
I almost wanted to find a shrink

601
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,090
for you.

602
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,130
And that day
when Miss Jiang called you...

603
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,770
So, Mr. Ji is the actual 1003,

604
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,700
who raised the cat with you

605
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,020
and complained about our boss?

606
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,180
Well...

607
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,570
Did you tell him

608
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,260
a lot about our work?

609
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,460
Did you tell him

610
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,290
that we cursed him behind his back?

611
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,130
Oh, no.

612
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Tian, you are killing me here.

613
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,260
Stop that.

614
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,130
I didn't mention you.

615
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,610
All I did was complaining about my work.

616
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,020
He's such a pervert.

617
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,980
I can't believe he enjoyed fooling me.

618
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,740
I yelled at him hard

619
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,820
today.

620
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,570
But Tian,

621
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,500
you yelled at him,

622
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,700
and you asked him to fire you.

623
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,020
What if he does ask the human resources

624
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,220
to fire you?

625
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,460
That's fine. I'll just go.

626
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,770
I don't want to see his face again.

627
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,500
What's going on here?

628
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,850
How much did he drink?

629
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,180
It should be the fifth glass.

630
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:27,740
Can I have a cup of Irish coffee?

631
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,220
No...

632
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,810
Coffee, please.

633
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,460
Give him this.

634
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,420
This can work?

635
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,130
He's drunk now. He won't tell.

636
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:45,900
Thanks.

637
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,050
He really couldn't tell tea from wine.

638
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,420
Chen,

639
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,060
is there something bothering you?

640
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,420
Perhaps you can tell me
and let me be amused.

641
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,650
Don't you always

642
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,050
want to be a sports agent?

643
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,650
I was furious today.

644
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,860
That's why I asked him to fire me.

645
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,090
But come to think about it,

646
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,020
it's his fault.

647
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,650
Why do I have to leave?

648
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,340
I don't care.

649
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,220
I'll go to work tomorrow as usual.

650
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,210
And I'll continue to work there

651
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,340
as long as he allows.

652
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,820
You don't think he will skimp my wages,
do you?

653
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,340
I'll just

654
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,130
ignore him in the company.

655
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,250
He is your boss,

656
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,380
and he's so handsome.

657
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,300
He did lie to you. So what?

658
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,500
Don't you forget

659
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,300
how gentle, caring,

660
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,940
and considerate

661
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
when he was just 1003.

662
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,730
Wouldn't it be nice when Mr. Ji

663
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,650
actually acts like that in real life?

664
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,980
Xia Chunqiu,

665
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,060
who do you support here?

666
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,610
I am your friend,

667
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,210
not Ji Chen.

668
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,610
Let's be clear.

669
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,090
I'm your friend,

670
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,860
and I was deceived
and humiliated by Ji Chen.

671
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,210
Yeah, you are my friend,

672
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,090
but...

673
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,090
Ji Chen is my idol.

674
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,380
I wish he could deceive me.

675
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,130
You know what?

676
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,860
A character
with inappropriate life values

677
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,820
like you will be banned to talk

678
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,130
in a TV series.

679
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,460
If you dare to fall

680
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,610
for a crazy boss like him,

681
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,530
I will...

682
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,050
You are health-conscious all the time,

683
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,020
and especially so after
our dad passed away.

684
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,020
You were so careful

685
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,820
that you didn't drink once.

686
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,650
But now, look how drunk you are.

687
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,130
Did Tian refuse your love?

688
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,250
I didn't finish talking.

689
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,050
She just...

690
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,380
got mad and left.

691
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,340
So, what did Mr. Ji say?

692
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,130
"I met Qiuqiu by accident."

693
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,460
"I did find you repulsive
in the beginning."

694
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,610
"Look at you,"

695
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,210
"you don't have an advanced degree."

696
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,460
"You don't really know"

697
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,420
"how to dress up."

698
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,420
"You don't look like a girl
when you play."

699
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,820
"You were very imprudent"

700
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,210
"at the beginning."

701
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,820
"And you always caused trouble for me."

702
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,610
"You always did the opposite,"

703
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,130
"even if you promised to do as I asked."

704
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,340
What happened then?

705
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,420
Then, I...

706
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,940
I yelled at him.

707
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:45,780
No, that's not right.

708
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,090
Judging from his tone,

709
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,530
he was going to say but next.

710
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,380
But...

711
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,860
He did seem to say but.

712
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,900
But what?

713
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,130
I was outraged,

714
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,020
and I left after I yelled at him.

715
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,860
I didn't stay to let him finish.

716
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,940
What are you laughing about?

717
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,460
It's nothing.

718
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,570
I can imagine how ugly it was.

719
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,130
Chen.

720
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,650
It seems you are not

721
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,500
good at this.

722
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,340
That's the problem.

723
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,050
I mean, look at you.

724
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,460
You are complaining about him to me,

725
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,340
and you are doing it while having coke

726
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,500
and junk food.

727
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,690
You look exactly like a girl
who just broke up with her boyfriend.

728
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,250
I'm not good at this?

729
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,780
I graduated

730
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,730
from a top business institution
as the valedictorian.

731
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,610
I was a straight-A student,

732
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,860
and the chief editor
of our school journal.

733
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,210
I can speak

734
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,020
fluent English and French.

735
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,130
I became the youngest vice president

736
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,730
of An Sheng Group

737
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,380
after working there for only five years.

738
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,340
I'm the best among the elites.

739
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
You are highly educated, so what?

740
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,170
It doesn't mean
that you can insult people.

741
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,250
He does have an advanced degree
and he is rich.

742
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,860
But he's mean.

743
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,940
I dare him to compete
with me in the running.

744
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,780
He is good at business,
but I'm good at sports.

745
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,650
Can you win bread by running?

746
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,210
Plus, I did see your potential.

747
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,860
That's why I hired you,

748
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,460
and let you be involved
in all those projects.

749
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,530
I just wanted you

750
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,210
to grow fast.

751
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,210
So I happen to be 1003.

752
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,780
It's not my fault.

753
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,730
It was by accident that I found out

754
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,020
Zhou Tian and Sunday

755
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,210
are the same person.

756
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,690
By accident?

757
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,530
Why don't you tell me

758
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,460
when you found out?

759
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,730
Instead of telling me,

760
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,210
you hid the fact and watched me
making a fool of myself.

761
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,020
And when I revealed your trick,

762
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,780
you insulted me some more

763
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,050
by listing all my shortcomings.

764
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,210
You degraded

765
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,570
and humiliated me

766
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,570
so that
you could keep your own self-esteem.

767
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,980
That's just disgusting.

768
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,530
