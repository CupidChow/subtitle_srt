=Episode 17=

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,930
I've dug everything out.

21
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,880
He has a house and a car.

22
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,320
But there's one thing

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm sorry about.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,600
Both his parents are dead.

25
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,010
So,

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,490
in the future,

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,490
we have to look after

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,040
the two kids more.

29
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,760
But Chen

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,570
is tall and handsome.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,440
Loyal and omnipotent.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,130
Obedient and capable.

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,720
He doesn't smoke or drink,

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,040
and seldom hangs out with people.

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,250
No first love or romantic history.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
No bad habits.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,880
So reliable and can be trusted.

38
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,600
I have observed him for a whole day.

39
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,370
Ji Chen treats Tian

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,850
really well.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,290
But I'm worried

42
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,040
what we said

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,010
and we did today

44
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,090
would make him think

45
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,720
we are greedy.

46
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,880
How dare he?

47
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,090
He won't.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,040
We did all for our daughter.

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,600
When I was still a poor wretch,

50
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,200
didn't you choose me
from a group of men?

51
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,690
That's different.

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,690
Children now

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,090
are different from when we were young.

54
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,370
Chen said we could stay

55
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,570
in the house tonight.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,970
Really?

57
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,130
No way.

58
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,370
You...

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
It's impolite

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
to refuse Ji Chen's invitation.

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,880
It's not good.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,480
If you wanna stay here,

63
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,090
I'll go.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,440
There are two floors.

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,320
Which floor

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,200
do we live on?

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
The second floor.

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,690
There are many rooms
on the second floor.

69
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,090
Really.

70
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,970
The sea is visible

71
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,130
from the bathroom.

72
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,370
Great.

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,810
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,810
there are enough rooms.

75
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,130
You can choose
which room you wanna stay.

76
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,850
How about we go upstairs now?

77
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,410
OK.

78
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,480
Now?

79
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
How about waiting for a while?

80
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,760
It's still early now.

81
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,250
I can't fall asleep.

82
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,130
Do you have mahjong at home?

83
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,370
I think we can

84
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,970
play mahjong together.

85
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,970
How could he have mahjong at home?

86
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,690
I do.

87
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,690
Definitely.

88
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
I have whatever you want at home.

89
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,640
That's terrific!

90
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,440
Hao.

91
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,320
You came back to the café alone.

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,880
I'm worried that

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,370
you would break something.

94
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,690
I have been living here

95
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,250
for a good while.

96
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,080
Nothing has ever happened.

97
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,760
Are you just worried about me?

98
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,200
Sorry, I knocked on the wrong door.

99
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,960
Is this Mr. Ji's house?

100
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,840
Why is there a woman

101
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,840
who looks so much like Zhou Tian?

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,010
I must be so annoyed with her

103
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,130
that I had an illusion.

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,200
Kevin.

105
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,130
You are really Zhou Tian?

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,840
What's wrong?

107
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,690
I see.

108
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,690
Rest assured.

109
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,760
I didn't come here tonight,

110
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,440
nor did you.

111
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,570
What happened at night

112
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,010
will disappear at dawn.

113
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,610
Where is mahjong?

114
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,400
Mr. Ji,

115
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,570
I brought it for you.

116
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,730
Sorry, it's too late.

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,640
I only found this
made of common materials.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,810
Carry it in.

119
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,520
Mr. Ji,

120
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,730
are we playing Shanghai mahjong,

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,370
Beijing mahjong,

122
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,520
or Sichuan mahjong?

123
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,730
You may be excused.

124
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,320
OK. Goodbye.

125
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,880
Go, let's go.

126
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,520
Three of Bamboo.

127
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,810
North Wind.

128
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,010
Chen,

129
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,610
playing mahjong is simple.

130
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,200
Don't worry.

131
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,640
I promise

132
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,320
to teach you how to play.

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,010
I only watched

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,640
some tutorials online.

135
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,760
Chen,

136
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,170
you are so smart.

137
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,280
Play it with us and you'll know.

138
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,840
Eh...

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,810
Can you make it faster?

140
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,840
Even the old people

141
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,520
are faster than you.

142
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,610
Of course.

143
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,930
Old people

144
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,490
play mahjong every day.

145
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,200
Chen,

146
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,730
take your time.

147
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,280
Bingo!

148
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,400
Hold on.

149
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,370
I suspect that

150
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,440
Chen made a wrong move.

151
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,050
Chen,

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm on my honor.

153
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,640
Trust me.

154
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,690
I'll check your cards for you.

155
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,640
See? You shouldn't gave this.

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,490
A wrong step.

157
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,280
You missed it.

158
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,400
Take this one back.

159
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,320
And exchange this one.

160
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,730
You can't take it back.

161
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,320
Who do you learn it from?

162
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Kiddo,

163
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,520
don't be that mean.

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,930
I didn't teach you like this.

165
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,840
We are family. Be nice.

166
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,490
Forget it.

167
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,130
I'll give you a chance.

168
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,130
I will win by my own draw.

169
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,370
Good for you.

170
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,200
Seven Dot.

171
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,050
Three Dot.

172
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,400
South Wind.

173
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,370
Chen,

174
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,370
you made it.

175
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,760
Look.

176
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,880
You won.

177
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,760
Exactly.

178
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,250
Look.

179
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,200
I won?

180
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,690
I won.

181
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,610
Who on earth

182
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,130
is your birth child?

183
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,400
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,010
I shouldn't have

185
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,640
asked you to get off...

186
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,960
No worries.

187
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,610
I know

188
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,570
I must have said something wrong.

189
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,640
No.

190
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,880
My parents are conventional.

191
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
But you are straightforward.

192
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,840
I was afraid
that they couldn't accept you.

193
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
I understand.

194
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,880
Why didn't you

195
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,760
mention your parents before?

196
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,210
You didn't even ask me.

197
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,010
Yeah.

198
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,250
I had no idea Ji Chen is your brother,

199
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,640
let alone your parents.

200
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,160
My father had a sudden heart attack

201
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,730
when he was driving at my 11.

202
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,330
And we had an accident.

203
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,130
My mother was also in the car.

204
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,130
No.

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,850
No.

206
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,090
Don't leave us.

207
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,250
Please.

208
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,210
Don't leave us.

209
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,560
(My parents)

210
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,760
(left a sum of insurance benefit
and deposit)

211
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,010
(to us.)

212
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,400
(Ji Chen was 18 then.)

213
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
(To take better care of me,)

214
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,490
(he took me)

215
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,250
(to seek shelter
with one of our relatives abroad.)

216
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,280
He finished

217
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,130
his study over there,

218
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,450
and sent me to a college of music.

219
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,520
After he started to work,

220
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,090
he got promoted soon

221
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,800
because of his capability.

222
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,850
He was assigned home

223
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,040
as Xing Yi's CEO by An Sheng Group.

224
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,920
While I was

225
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,450
in the Juilliard School then.

226
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,450
Since Ji Chen was transferred home,

227
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:04,970
I hid it from him

228
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,490
and bought a flight ticket to return.

229
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,130
You know

230
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,210
what happened later.

231
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,010
You look happy

232
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,370
like a princess,

233
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,090
but I didn't expect you
to have such bad stories.

234
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,730
I still have a lot of things

235
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
you never heard of.

236
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,800
We have a long way to go.

237
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,520
You can learn about me later.

238
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,210
Good.

239
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,850
Good phrase.

240
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,880
Because I'm born wise.

241
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,490
But

242
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,760
I have never seen you

243
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,090
show your musical skills.

244
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,850
It's not

245
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,680
a free show.

246
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,250
Wait.

247
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,920
I made it.

248
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,800
Wait.

249
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,400
You can't make it.

250
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,880
It's unlucky.

251
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,210
You can't.

252
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:14,880
Mom,

253
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,210
don't play tricks.

254
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,800
Your mother is right.

255
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,280
Fine, I quit.

256
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,490
I'm sleepy.

257
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,400
I feel a bit

258
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,490
hungry.

259
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,210
Mrs. Zhou,

260
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,250
there are all kinds of food
in the fridge.

261
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,130
Please come with me.

262
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,160
Really?

263
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,250
What do you mean?

264
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,250
You are partial to Ji Chen.

265
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,730
The son-in-law
is better than the daughter.

266
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,640
What the hell son-in-law?

267
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,370
I haven't accepted him.

268
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,160
Then why did you take us to meet him?

269
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,160
Right.

270
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,450
I'm satisfied

271
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,610
with Ji Chen.

272
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,010
Are you sure?

273
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,330
Do you have any idea how many

274
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,610
health care products he eats every day?

275
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,680
He's so weak.

276
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,160
You still take health care products
of the brand?

277
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,970
So do I.

278
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,250
I just started to eat it.

279
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,330
It's pretty good.

280
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,250
Yeah.

281
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,250
I'm a platinum member

282
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,010
of this brand.

283
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,010
I can get a 22% discount

284
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,250
on their products.

285
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,160
Feel free to tell me

286
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,090
if you want to buy.

287
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,400
A 22% discount

288
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,880
can save a lot of money, right?

289
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,760
Sure.

290
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,280
What's this?

291
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,760
It's a new arrival.

292
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,330
For people of different ages,

293
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,450
it has different functions,

294
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,880
which contains over 20 vitamins.

295
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,730
Moreover,

296
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,330
its shelf life is only one month.

297
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
After a month...

298
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,010
Are you obsessed with me?

299
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,970
I

300
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,520
am not.

301
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,010
You liar.

302
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,010
What if

303
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,160
I'm going to kiss you now?

304
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,090
Fine.

305
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,450
I was joking.

306
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,330
Before you really

307
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,880
fall in love with me,

308
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,680
I won't take advantage of you.

309
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,970
It's getting late.

310
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,490
Go back and have a good sleep.

311
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,730
I have to go back.

312
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,680
I'm also sleepy.

313
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,250
Hao,

314
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,610
please turn off the lights
and close the door

315
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,850
before you leave.

316
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,850
Good night.

317
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,210
Mr. Ji,

318
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,970
these are

319
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,160
what you want.

320
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,450
So many boxes.

321
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,010
It's OK. Don't mention it.

322
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,520
But it's hard for us

323
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,760
to take these boxes back.

324
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,450
Eh...

325
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,850
I see.

326
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,400
Kevin,

327
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,330
take them away.

328
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,010
Send them through the post tomorrow.

329
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,400
No need.

330
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,370
The post would only

331
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,400
put it downstairs.

332
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,520
We are

333
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,760
unable to carry them...

334
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,450
Kevin,

335
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,560
arrange two cars tomorrow.

336
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,560
One is to take Mr. and Mrs. Zhou back,

337
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,250
and the other takes these gifts.

338
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,520
Remember to carry them into their house.

339
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,970
Got it.

340
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,800
T-That's too troublesome.

341
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:01,800
Eh...

342
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,760
Eh...

343
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:03,800
Well...

344
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,010
Thank you so much.

345
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,280
We brought much trouble to you.

346
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,680
It's no biggie.

347
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,640
Don't mention it.

348
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,450
Watch your steps.

349
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,210
Thank you.

350
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,760
So many things.

351
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,730
Eh...

352
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,680
We really brought him too much trouble.

353
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,450
Chen

354
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,400
is too thoughtful.

355
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,010
What a considerate boy.

356
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,090
He's really nice.

357
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,400
- I feel sorry.
- It's not good.

358
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,090
Really.

359
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,330
He prepared so many gifts for us.

360
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,970
Dad, mom,

361
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,330
you know.

362
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,520
Ji Chen lies on the massage armchair

363
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,850
every day like a turtle.

364
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,800
Chen,

365
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,640
this is so comfortable.

366
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,610
We still have one at home.

367
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,730
Once I use it,

368
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,680
my whole body aches.

369
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,760
Mr. Zhou,

370
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,040
the massage armchair

371
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,090
is a limited edition.

372
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,610
I booked the same one for you.

373
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,410
I didn't mean that.

374
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,170
I'll help you move the old one away.

375
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,970
I really didn't mean that.

376
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,080
Alright.

377
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,800
Since both of you like him that much,

378
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,040
stay here with him.

379
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,320
If you don't want to go,

380
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,410
I'll go.

381
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,280
Eh...

382
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,730
Choose a good date,

383
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,320
and have them engaged.

384
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,760
No need

385
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,010
to engage.

386
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,970
They can directly get married.

387
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,560
Okay.

388
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,520
Let's choose the best date.

389
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,890
No way.

390
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,010
What's wrong with you?

391
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:35,760
Didn't you go home already?

392
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,730
What are you doing here?

393
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,040
I changed my mind.

394
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,450
I'll stay.

395
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,280
You are changeable as your mother.

396
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm telling you.

397
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,970
You always get up

398
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,250
at noon.

399
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,970
Before 6 a.m. tomorrow,

400
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,120
you'll be woken up by this guy.

401
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,320
I just want

402
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,450
another opportunity.

403
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Save it.

404
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,080
I don't want to talk to you.

405
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,650
Why don't you listen to my explanation?

406
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,890
Do you think

407
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:25,730
make my parents satisfied with you

408
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,040
and you'll get a pass card

409
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:27,650
of me?

410
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,650
Listen,

411
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,250
it's impossible!

412
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,840
♪Never thought my heart♪

413
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,690
♪Would pound for you♪

414
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,170
♪The first time I encountered you
in the crowd♪

415
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,410
♪In my eyes♪

416
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,690
♪You are distinguished
from the whole planet♪

417
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,800
♪I hope♪

418
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,210
♪You could understand♪

419
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,360
♪I want more than
just being your friend♪

420
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,760
Tian,

421
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,040
Tian,

422
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,600
the electricity is off!

423
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,650
It's so dark.

424
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,010
I can see nothing.

425
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,250
The power is cut off.

426
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,650
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

427
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,650
Hey, Zhou Tian,

428
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,080
listen to me...

429
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,250
Night, Mr. Ji.

430
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,760
I can't be tricked

431
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,730
by his sugar-coated bullets.

432
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,120
My hormone went wrong.

433
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,520
What a day.

434
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,210
What's wrong with this guy?

435
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,650
Playing music at this early hour?

436
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,280
Is he playing Tai Chi

437
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,970
like old people do?

438
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,890
So noisy.

439
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,080
Can't you consider your guests at home?

440
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,840
What the hell are you doing?

441
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,360
Tian,

442
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,360
time to get up.

443
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,600
It's not your style.

444
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,360
The eight sections brocade

445
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,450
that Chen taught us

446
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,120
stretched my whole body.

447
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,560
It seems that

448
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
going to bed and getting up early

449
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,970
is a healthy lifestyle.

450
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,280
It's the best way

451
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,080
for us old people.

452
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,690
You are incurable.

453
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,600
It was hard for Zhou Tian

454
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,410
to get up

455
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,010
when she was on the sports team.

456
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,970
To make her get up

457
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,890
on her own,

458
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,320
I made a lot of food for her.

459
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,690
She was a foodie.

460
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,210
To enjoy the breakfast

461
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,280
I made for her,

462
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,080
she got up early,

463
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,560
sitting at the table

464
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,690
as she yawned,

465
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,690
and waited for the yummy food

466
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,210
I cooked.

467
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,840
Later,

468
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,690
she entered the provincial team.

469
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,600
Each time I visited her,

470
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,520
I took the rice ball to her,

471
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,970
with "keep up" on it.

472
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,520
Gradually,

473
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,010
she is no longer the little girl,

474
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,730
and has a boyfriend.

475
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,360
Mr. Zhou,

476
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,080
please rest assured.

477
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,890
I'll take care of Zhou Tian.

478
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,800
Taking care of her is

479
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,490
not as simple as the four words.

480
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,210
Learn to cook the rice ball.

481
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,320
If she feels tired

482
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,170
or upset,

483
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,170
cook this for her.

484
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,410
I promise she'll beam.

485
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,650
Tian is amenable

486
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,560
to persuasion but not to coercion.

487
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,320
This is the rice ball

488
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,650
I cooked with Chen.

489
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,010
(Morning)
I see "keep up" and "morning".

490
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,360
This one

491
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,650
is a bit abstract.

492
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
It's a small hill.

493
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,970
It's Qiuqiu.

494
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,560
I have been watching my phone

495
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,970
too much recently.

496
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,450
My eyes blurred.

497
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,650
I can't see it clearly.

498
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,280
Zhou Tian, what are you laughing at?

499
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:52,840
Zhou Tian,

500
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,250
stop laughing.

501
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
It's good that

502
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,600
Chen would love to learn cooking.

503
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,450
Though he is innocent,

504
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,600
you cannot pick on him

505
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,320
because of his innocence.

506
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,040
Innocent?

507
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,010
Are you sure

508
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,520
he's innocent?

509
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,490
He is such a cunning guy.

510
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,730
I'm the one

511
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,890
who's innocent.

512
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,760
I'm afraid he'll sell me someday.

513
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,120
He's so rich.

514
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,930
Why should he sell you?

515
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,280
Besides, you are a fool.

516
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,010
How much do you value?

517
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,970
Mom!

518
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,840
Tian,

519
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,730
your mother is right.

520
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,840
You were born stupid.

521
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,320
Accept the fact.

522
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,010
You got your IQ from your father.

523
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,280
But it's not the reason

524
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,730
you pick on him.

525
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,560
Understand?

526
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,080
Who is stupid?

527
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,210
I'm talking about Zhou Tian.

528
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,360
None of your business.

529
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,800
Well.

530
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,760
Dad,

531
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,840
are you my birth father?

532
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:47,930
Why not?

533
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,170
I'm not stupid.

534
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,690
How could you

535
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,560
- ask such a stupid question?
- Right?

536
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,930
- He's of course your birth father.
- Yeah.

537
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,560
I'll open the door.

538
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:56,520
No.

539
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,410
Didn't I say this for Zhou Tian's good?

540
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,520
You have such a bad memory.

541
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,490
How?

542
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,120
I...

543
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,320
Kevin?

544
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:06,760
You...

545
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:07,930
What...

546
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,210
Have you prepared everything

547
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,210
I told you?

548
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,890
Mr. Ji, everything is ready.

549
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,170
Where are they?

550
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,700
(Express)

551
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,520
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

552
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,930
I prepared two cars here.

553
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,250
You take the one ahead.

554
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,450
After picking up Mr. and Mrs. Zhang,

555
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,280
you can go home.

556
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,040
I prepared some gifts

557
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,800
and health care products

558
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,800
on this car.

559
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,170
Don't forget to eat and use them.

560
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,650
I'll deliver to you
when you need anything.

561
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,120
That's too many things.

562
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,650
Not at all.

563
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,760
Dad, mom.

564
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,010
Hao,

565
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,040
your father wants
to have a word with you.

566
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,520
Me?

567
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Isn't there a conversation of men

568
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,490
between the two of you?

569
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,080
Hao.

570
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:16,800
Dad.

571
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,490
Your mother and I
talked the whole night.

572
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,520
You have been staying outside alone

573
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,040
all these years.

574
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,560
Well.

575
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
We are far from you,

576
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,690
and we cannot... you know.

577
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,520
You are alone,

578
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,970
and we, you know.

579
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,650
I'm still, you know.

580
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,840
You know what I mean?

581
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,930
But

582
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,080
sometimes I didn't really...

583
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,080
You know?

584
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,250
Anyway,

585
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,520
no matter what you want

586
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,890
you know.

587
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,080
You got me?

588
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,690
We...

589
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,320
We don't have to be that... you know?

590
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,760
What the hell are you talking about?

591
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,690
Don't you know?

592
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,280
Well. I see.

593
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,520
What?

594
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,360
Our son is of course outstanding,

595
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,490
right?

596
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

597
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:35,890
here.

598
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,250
Gigi, it's so beautiful.

599
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,120
Beautiful flowers should be presented
to a beautiful woman.

600
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
What a smooth talker.

601
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,010
What are you doing here?

602
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,930
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang will go back today.

603
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,690
I surely have to see them off.

604
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,120
Thank you.

605
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:49,760
We appreciate it.

606
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,730
Where is your brother?

607
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,800
He said he would come.

608
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,010
Why hasn't he arrived?

609
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,360
Zhang.

610
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,210
Zhang.

611
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:11,760
What good weather.

612
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,560
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Zhou.

613
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:19,650
Zhang.

614
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,490
My son-in-law

615
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,040
sent us a truck of gifts.

616
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,360
How's it?

617
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,840
What's inside?

618
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,170
Health care products.

619
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,690
Is it amazing?

620
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,800
Amazing.

621
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,650
Right.

622
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,450
Eh...

623
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Health care products

624
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,560
are really suitable for you.

625
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,520
You do need

626
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,170
some nutrition
from the health care products.

627
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,320
One truck is not even enough.

628
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,650
L-Look at me.

629
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,650
I'm healthy.

630
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,560
I don't need any health care products.

631
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,410
Here is the thing.

632
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,250
Right.

633
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,280
Ji Chen said that

634
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,560
he prepared these gifts for both of us.

635
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,450
If you don't need it,

636
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,450
I'll

637
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,320
take them for you.

638
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,210
Zhou,

639
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,560
stopping kidding him.

640
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,320
Zhang,

641
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,800
just ignore him.

642
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,040
These are

643
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,690
gifts from Ji Chen and Ji Nian.

644
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,280
From Ji Nian?

645
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,800
I certainly will receive the gifts

646
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,450
from my future daughter-in-law.

647
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,320
Come on.

648
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,250
You can't.

649
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,690
You will have a nosebleed.

650
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,360
I don't care.

651
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,450
Come on.

652
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,490
Dad, mom, hurry up.

653
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,600
You'll arrive home at night
if you still delay.

654
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,410
Yes.

655
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,520
Well, just go back.

656
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,730
Let's go.

657
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,730
We are leaving. Get in the car.

658
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,360
See you around.

659
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,250
See you around.

660
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,010
See you.

661
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,410
OK.

662
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,170
I'm going back.

663
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,010
Chen,

664
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,170
come with me.

665
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,010
Let's have a conversation

666
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,490
between men.

667
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,010
If you pick on Tian,

668
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,450
I'll break your door

669
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,840
and destroy your sea-view house.

670
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,080
As long as I hear

671
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,520
Zhou Tian says that

672
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,600
you annoy her,

673
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,490
wherever you are,

674
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,040
I'll catch you,

675
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,280
tie you up,

676
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,080
and hang you up

677
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,010
on the pear trees of our garden.

678
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,760
You won't have a good end.

679
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,250
Mr. Zhou,

680
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,560
please rest assured.

681
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,010
I won't give you the opportunity.

682
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,520
P-Please take care of my daughter.

683
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,280
If he picks on you,

684
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,800
let me know. I'll teach him a lesson.

685
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,800
I see.

686
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,010
Nice flowers.

687
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,650
Sure.

688
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,010
I chose it myself.

689
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,970
Thank you for receiving my parents.

690
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:07,970
I'll pay you back

691
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,800
the money of those gifts

692
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,040
in monthly installments.

693
