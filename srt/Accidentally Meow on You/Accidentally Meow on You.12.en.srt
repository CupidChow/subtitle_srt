I didn't do anything wrong.

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,100
Aren't you the one who said

71
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,860
that we should do something

72
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,420
to help Hao move on?

73
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
I meant something like bungee jumping,

74
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
not introducing girls to him.

75
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,220
OK, please.

76
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,860
Don't blame him, Gigi.

77
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,580
I know you both mean well.

after being back from the seaside.

84
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,980
You can pass my bungee jumping offer,

85
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,820
but you still need to get it out
of your system.

86
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,820
You don't have to bear it alone.

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,180
Mr. Ji cherishes his life a lot.

174
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,420
He would never have barbecues here.

175
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,260
He would say

176
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,420
barbecue is carcinogenic

177
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,340
and unhealthy.

178
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,580
Mr. Ji!

179
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,620
Why are you here?

180
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,180
Because I, who cherish my life,

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,660
love barbecue most.

182
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,420
This is a promotion celebration.

183
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,900
I'm also a colleague of yours.

184
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,860
How did Mr. Ji find out

185
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,740
about the time and place?

186
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,420
He must have a spy inside us.

187
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,820
It's a get-together among colleagues.

188
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,260
We should have invited our boss.

189
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,300
Right, Kevin?

190
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,300
Yeah.

191
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,300
We all

192
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,340
made gradual progress

193
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,380
under Mr. Ji's leadership.

194
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,380
Mr. Ji should get to celebrate
our promotion and pay rise with us.

195
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,980
Please sit at the host seat, Mr. Ji.

196
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,060
We are not at the company.

197
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,900
Any seat is OK for me.

198
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,980
Take my seat, Mr. Ji.

199
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,620
You want my seat, Mr. Ji?

200
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,860
Here, Mr. Ji.

201
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,140
Come here, please.

202
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,020
How did he know about this?

203
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,300
Please sit, everyone.

204
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,100
(Why do you have to sit beside me?)

205
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,700
Mr. Ji, I didn't expect to see you here.

206
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,100
I know you don't usually

207
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,420
join us.

208
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,460
I probably should join you more.

209
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,100
Mr. Ji.

210
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,500
I have to say,

211
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,780
you do look superior

212
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,300
in the company.

213
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,140
If you want to be one of us,

214
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,460
perhaps you should do something today

215
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,260
to show your sincerity.

216
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,860
What do you have in mind?

217
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,660
How about we play a game?

218
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:32,820
OK.

219
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,780
Let's play a game.

220
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,420
- I like games.
- Good thinking.

221
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,340
- Game is the best.
- Great idea.

222
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,340
We are going to roll the dice?

223
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,620
It's simple.

224
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,980
We will all be numbered.

225
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,340
For example, Li Ang will be No.0.

226
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,100
I'll be No.1.

227
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,740
And you are No.2, 3, 4, etc.

228
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,220
Then, we roll the dices.

229
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,180
If we get your number,

230
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,860
you'll have to kiss

231
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,860
who rolls the dices.

232
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,980
Those who can't go through it

233
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,740
will have to drink.

234
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm OK with that.

235
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,340
Let's do this.

236
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,140
Yeah!

237
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,820
Wait a minute.

238
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,260
Wait.

239
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,500
There are two dices here.

240
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,460
It's impossible to have No.0 or 1.

241
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,620
Qiao Yi,

242
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,180
you are not fooling anybody here.

243
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,780
Fine.

244
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,700
How about this?

245
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,060
He will be No.2.

246
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,780
I'll be No.3.

247
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,780
And you are No.4, 5, 6, etc.

248
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,100
You can either drink

249
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,300
or kiss somebody.

250
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,220
Mr. Ji.

251
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,260
Let's start with you.

252
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,500
Me?

253
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,340
Yeah.

254
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,860
I thought

255
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,740
you wanted to be one of us.

256
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,780
We should start with you.

257
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,500
Mr. Ji.

258
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,900
Are you scared?

259
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,020
Why am I scared?

260
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm here today

261
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,220
to have fun with you guys.

262
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,060
I'll start.

263
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,980
(Five, please.)

264
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:09,700
(Please be five.)

265
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Six.

266
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,740
Xia?

267
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,460
Here.

268
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,300
I choose to kiss Mr. Ji.

269
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,940
Hey,
don't you know that Mr. Ji can't drink?

270
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,820
He's keeping a diet.

271
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,740
I can beat you all

272
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,300
in drinking.

273
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,340
I'll have this drink for you, Mr. Ji.

274
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,100
In fact, I'll help you

275
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,380
drink all the beer here.

276
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,900
Let it be five.

277
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Qiao Yi.

278
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,380
It's five.

279
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,220
Zhou Tian is No.5.

280
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,220
Zhou Tian.

281
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,660
Zhou Tian,

282
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,860
it's your turn.

283
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,060
Zhou Tian!

284
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,660
Go kiss Mr. Ji.

285
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,500
What are you waiting for?

286
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,780
Come on.

287
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,580
Drink or kiss. Make your pick.

288
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
We are all waiting.

289
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,820
Mr. Ji has already had a lot of drinks.

290
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,620
Are you thinking of kissing Mr. Ji?

291
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,300
Let me drink this for him.

292
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,500
No, I'll drink.

293
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,820
Mr. Ji, please let me.

294
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,740
So you wanna kiss me?

295
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,380
Boring.

296
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,220
Your turn, Zhou Tian.

297
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,820
My turn?

298
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,020
See?

299
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,180
This is what I'm talking about.

300
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,700
It's your fate.

301
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,740
You can't avoid it.

302
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,580
What are the odds?

303
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,340
Now,

304
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,020
we are out of beer.

305
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,780
There is only one option left.

306
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,980
You have to kiss her.

307
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,900
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

308
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,420
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

309
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,860
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

310
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,940
Kiss her.

311
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,700
Kiss.

312
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,420
We're gonna go. Bye.

313
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,260
Bye.

314
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,220
Bye, guys.

315
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,260
It's really late.

316
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,700
Tian,

317
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,740
I'll send him back.

318
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,900
You take care of Mr. Ji.

319
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,340
OK.

320
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:40,780
Qiao Yi, let's go.

321
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,820
You should leave too.

322
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,060
I haven't had enough beer.

323
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,180
You can't leave him to me.

324
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,460
Mr. Ji...

325
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,940
I have no idea

326
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,140
where Mr. Ji lives.

327
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,340
(Mr. Ji's address: No.602,
Aegean Sea Villa District, Mingzhi Road)

328
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
What?

329
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,780
Mr. Ji

330
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,940
lives across from my neighborhood.

331
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,020
Easy.

332
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,540
Watch it.

333
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,060
Sir,

334
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,540
we'll go
to the Aegean Sea Villa District.

335
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,260
Sir,

336
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,980
to the Aegean Sea Villa District.

337
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,260
Zhou Tian.

338
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,820
I...

339
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,940
wanna...

340
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,300
kiss...

341
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,820
Careful.

342
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,380

Thank you for taking me home.

347

I...

348
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,780
would like to grant you a wish

349

to show my appreciation to you.

350
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,980
You are drunk. Your words don't count.

351
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,260
No, I'm not drunk.

352
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,380
It's a promise...

353
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:09,980
Promise.

(Certificate of Job Transfer)
and serving as a sports agent.

358
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,100
I'll have Mr. Ji sign this.

359
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,540
Mr. Ji,

360
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,220
here is the Certificate of Job Transfer.

361
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,580
Please sign.

Sign your name here.

364
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,300
No need to sign.

365
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,060
I'll put my thumbprint on it.

366
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
You are so smart, Mr. Ji.

367
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,300

I managed to take him back
to his bedroom.

378
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,660
It's harder to handle him than a child.

379
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,660
Don't leave, Zhou Tian.

380
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,140
This will sober you up.

(Your cat.)

Your cat.

Well,

408
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,900
my internet was cut off last night.

409
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
I meant to say,

410
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,700
I like your cat.

411
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,060
But the last two words
failed to get through.

I...

413
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,460
I only realized it today.

414
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,900
So, I resent the message.

415
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,380
I see.

416
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,460
That's a relief.

417
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,700
I thought you were confessing to me.

418
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,380
Would you accept my love

419
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,220
if it was a confession?

420
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,260
Well...

421
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,260
- I actually...
- I won't.

422
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,900
It's a serious matter.

423
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,780
No man should confess his love
to a girl on WeChat.

424
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,820
Such man

425
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,460
is very likely to be a male chauvinist.

426
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,380
He can't expect that girl to say yes.

427
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,300
It's ridiculous.

428
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:11,980
But, I'm glad

429
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,580
you are not such a man.

430
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,500
No, I'm not.

431
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,380
I was just asking.

432
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,300
By the way,

433
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,180
why did you say

434
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,460
you like my cat?

435
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,620
Did Qiuqiu do anything?

436
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,940
Qiuqiu came over again.

437
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,500
And she was covered with mud.

438
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,540
I wanted to take her to have a bath

439
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,420
before I go to work.

440
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,620
But I have to meet a client
this afternoon.

441
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,100
I'm afraid I can't pick her up later.

442
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,540
That's not a problem.

443
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,620
You can leave her at the pet store.

444
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,060
When I pass the pet store later,

445
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,820
I'll pick her up

446
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,300
and drop her off at Hao's shop.

447
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,460
OK.

448
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,580
Settled, then.

449
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,620
In this case,

450
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,940
if I wait at the pet store

451
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,420
in advance,

452
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,820
I could finally have the chance

453
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,060
to see him?

454
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,700

talk about personal things here?

you want our relationship to be public?

00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,540
When did I say that? Can you prove it?

514
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,260
Of course, I can prove it.

515
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,380
Check this out.

516
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,660
This is the proof.

517
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,300
(Certificate of Job Transfer)
You planted this lip print.

518
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,820
Mr. Ji,

519
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,820
are you gonna deny it?

520
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,820
(Last night, I actually)

521
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,260
(kissed this)

522
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,700
(instead of Zhou Tian?)

523
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,860
Apart from the fact

524
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,780
that this isn't a normative certificate,

525
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,420
this handwriting

526
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,940
isn't mine.

527
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,580
I wrote this.

528
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,780
But

529
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,180
this lip print

530
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,020
was put on by you yourself.

531
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,500
Look at the shape

532
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,140
and the lip lines.

533
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,020
It's yours,

534
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,460
for sure.

535
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,100
Is my mouth really that big?

536
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,780
If you don't believe it,

537
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,580
you can make another lip print.

538
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,100
Then you'll see.

539
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,940
But there is no inkpad
in the conference room.

540
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,380
Luckily, Mr. Ji,

541
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,540
I have lipstick.

542
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,100
Come on.

543
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:09,940
Mr. Ji.

544
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,140
We got a phone call
from Tiansha Real Estate.

545
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,300
They want to...

546
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

547
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,900
I didn't see anything.

548
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,100
Please continue. Enjoy.

549
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:20,900
Hold on!

550
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,020
Zhou Tian.

551
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,900
I told you this lipstick smells bad.

552
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,220
Why did you have to fix your make-up

553
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:34,980
in the conference room?

554
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,620
This isn't a dressing room.

555
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,060
P-Put it away.

556
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,900
OK, Mr. Ji.

557
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,660
I have work to do.

558
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,740
Bye, Mr. Ji.

559
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,460
That was weird.

560
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,140
Mr. Ji, you were...

561
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,260
Shut up.

562
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,820
Kevin!

563
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,180
But

564
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,420
you said that guy

565
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,980
was so manly and gentle.

566
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,020
Kevin is a little effeminate.

567
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
He confessed his love to me

568
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,740
on WeChat yesterday.

569
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,180
He did make an excuse this morning,

570
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,020
but I'm sure he meant what he said.

571
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,860
Why is that guy Kevin?

572
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,860
Kevin...

573
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,580
I thought Kevin was a celibatarian.

574
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:24,980
Yeah.

575
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,540
I thought that too.

576
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,340
Clearly, he's not now.

577
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,500
Perhaps people can change

578
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,620
their doctrine?

579
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,700
This morning,

580
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,740
I saw Kevin with Qiuqiu

581
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,300
at the pet store.

582
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,700
He didn't see me though.

583
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,060
Why do I feel

584
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,580
your guy isn't actually Kevin?

585
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,220
Kevin,

586
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,580
Zhou Tian wants to talk to you.

587
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,700
Ask him. Make it clear.

588
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,780
Kevin.

589
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,620
I was wondering

590
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,540
if you have a cat.

591
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,260
Cat?

592
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,180
I hate animals that shed fur.

593
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,100
It's disgusting.

594
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,260
Why do I see cat hair on you?

595
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,740
Why do you care?

596
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,580
This cat is different.

597
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,820
To me,

598
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,660
it's an indispensable part

599
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,780
in my relationship with its owner.

600
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,060
It's a demonstration

601
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,220
of appreciation
and trust its owner puts in me.

602
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,420
No one can replace my role

603
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,700
in the owner's life.

604
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,660
I don't have to tell you this.

605
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,100
It's clear now. He is that guy.

606
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,460
Did you hear that?

607
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
He said my cat is an indispensable part
in a relationship.

608
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,300
But he's such a pervert!

609
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,700
I can't believe it!

610
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,700
I have got to delete 1003 on WeChat.

611
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,500
No, you can't.

612
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,860
Kevin seems
to value this relationship a lot.

613
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,140
If you delete his contact,

614
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,580
he may do something extreme to you.

615
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,460
You think?

616
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,460
Well,

617
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,980
I can block him from seeing my Moments.

618
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,300
Yeah, you can do that.
