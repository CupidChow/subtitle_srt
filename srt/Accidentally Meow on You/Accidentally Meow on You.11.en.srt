If,

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,860
by mere presumption,

84
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,260
you were rebuffed

85
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,860
in your confession to a girl,

86
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,340
would you do anything dangerous?

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,140
How could it be possible?

88
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,340
My confession

89
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,460
would definitely be a success.

90
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,740
Your tone suddenly reminded me

91
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,940
of a person.

92
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,780
I mean,

93
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,820
before the confession,

94
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,780
you gotta make clear the attitude
of the other party.

95
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,140
A leap in the dark is not sensible.

96
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,220
May I ask

97
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,980
how many girls
have you ever confessed to?

98
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,380
I haven't yet met the one

99
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,060
I want to pursue.

100
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,900
So it was just your idea on the paper.

101
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,980
Let me guess.

102
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,140
Someone confessed to you today,

103
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,660
and you refused him, right?

104
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,340
Actually, I'm upset.

a decisive refusal
makes your relationship simpler.

114

You make it clear to him,

170
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
to explore every day.

171
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,700
It, on the contrary,

172
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,660
makes me feel more secure.

173
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,660
I haven't had

174
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,740
such a full schedule

175
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,420
since I left the sports team.

176
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,580
Gotta go to bed now.

177
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,020
Good night, bye.

178
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,220
Was I

179
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,500
really so ruthless to her?

180
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,340
Didn't you hear what she said?

181
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,980
She enjoys new challenges every day,

182
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,700
which makes her feel secure.

183
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,580
(But I have grown up.)

184
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,380
(I'm no longer the little girl)

185
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,420
(you took under your wings.)

186
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,780
(I could face the ups and downs myself,)

187
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,580
(and pursue a better me.)

188
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,660
(However,)

189
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,220
(you still treat me)

190
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,740
(like a child.)

191
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,540
(I know)

192
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,980
(it's a care to me,)

193
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,660
(just like the care)

194
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,100
(between siblings.)

195
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,940
(So my feelings for you)

196
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,700
(cannot be called love.)

197
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,700
See?

198
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,180
She doesn't like growing up

199
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
in the greenhouse.

200
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,020
She enjoys getting strong in the storm.

201
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:27,900
Therefore,

202
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,180
make her experience

203
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,060
the violent storm,

204
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,980
and enable her a fast growth.

205
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,540
Right. Just do it.

206
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,340
Get ready

207
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,500
for a new round of challenges.

208
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,660
Hi, Kevin.

209
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,100
There will be an important job change.

210
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,140
Please deal with it.

211
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,780
Morning.

212
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,740
Ma'am,

213
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,060
where are my belongings?

214
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,740
Mr. Ji asked someone
to clear them away this morning.

215
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,460
Clear away?

216
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,060
W-What does that mean?

217
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,460
I have got no idea.

218
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,380
Based on my past experiences,

219
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,420
you might be fired.

220
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,860
Fire?

221
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,260
(No wonder I felt that)

222
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,020
(he became more humane
in the training center.)

223
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,220
(So he wanted to settle the score
with me after returning.)

224
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,340
Stop being in a daze.

225
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,180
Your department
is holding a temporary conference.

226
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,460
Everyone is in the meeting room.

227
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,700
Why don't you

228
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,860
entreat your leader to let you stay?

229
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,060
Entreat him?

230
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,380
I'll protest against him!

231
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,860
The labor law

232
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,860
protects me, anyway.

233
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,260
Zhou Tian,

234
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,660
you came just in time.

235
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,420
I'm gonna announce

236
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,500
an important change of personnel.

237
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,140
Have a seat.

238
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:00,900
Mr. Ji,

239
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,420
can you tell me why?

240
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,580
Because you deserve it.

241
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,780
I didn't expect Mr. Ji

242
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,260
would be so mean to your employee.

243
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,300
It's a kind of push

244
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,660
and higher demand on you.

245
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,740
I don't think

246
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,100
you fit into

247
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,940
the present position anymore.

248
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,340
So I announce,

249
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,980
from today on,

250
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,100
Zhou Tian

251
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,300
is promoted as...

252
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,820
You have gone too far!

253
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,620
Promoted?

254
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,660
I said

255
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,780
you deserved this.

256
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,260
Work hard in the new position.

257
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,940
You'll be grateful to me in the future.

258
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,380
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

259
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,260
Thank you for your help, guys.

260
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,700
Well,

261
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,860
you can dismiss now.

262
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,620
Keep it up.

263
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,540
Tian was promoted.

264
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,180
That's great.

265
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,020
I'm leaving.

266
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Congrats, Zhou Tian.

267
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,580
Good for you, Tian.

268
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,700
Tian.

269
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,060
Xia,

270
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,740
slap me

271
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,340
to wake me up.

272
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,340
I came to get my phone.

273
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,820
It's true.

274
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,500
You got promoted.

275
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,380
That's true, right?

276
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,860
It seems that their friendship

277
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,740
was defeated by the jealousy.

278
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,220
How much bonus would you get

279
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,820
through the project?

280
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm not sure.

281
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,980
Zhou Tian,

282
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,060
since you gained a promotion,

283
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,460
how do you want to celebrate it?

284
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,780
Well,

285
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,380
let's dine together. My treat.

286
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,100
Great!

287
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,660
I'll get everyone informed.

288
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Congratulations!

289
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,060
Share some tips with me

290
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,300
how you made it so fast.

291
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,820
Did you give away yourself,

292
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,260
or did you draw Kevin over to your side?

293
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,820
Stop gossiping.

294
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,060
Can't I get it

295
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,100
through my own strength?

296
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,380
How could I draw Kevin over to my side?

297
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:08,940
He...

298
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,460
What are you talking about me?

299
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,700
Mr. Kevin,

300
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,900
are you also here
to congratulate Zhou Tian

301
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,940
on her promotion?

302
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,140
Mr. Kevin is such a nice person.

303
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,620
Just send me a red packet

304
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,780
as a gift.

305
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,780
Red packet?

306
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,580
I have a bigger surprise for you.

307
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,900
Mr. Ji has just said

308
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,140
this is not the area

309
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:27,980
where the executive agent works.

310
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,500
You should switch to your seat now.

311
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,980
Switch the seat?

312
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,260
Where am I supposed to go?

313
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,540
At the door of CEO's office.

314
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,380
Isn't it your position?

315
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,260
You are unreliable,

316
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,380
so you need Mr. Ji's
close up instruction.

317
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,460
I'm the backbone of the company,

318
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,420
so I'm assigned

319
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,500
to take the lead in the office.

320
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,900
Hurry up.

321
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,100
M-Mr. Kevin.

322
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh my goodness!

323
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,940
What darn good luck

324
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,340
you have to sit so close to Mr. Ji.

325
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,380
You could enter his office
at any time you please.

326
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,220
Don't forget to pull the curtain down.

327
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,900
What the hell is on your mind?

328
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,980
Good luck?

329
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,580
You should say what evil thing I did
to pay the price.

330
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,100
Go ask everyone else.

331
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,060
Who wants to sit right

332
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,340
in the face of the boss?

333
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,300
Kevin does.

334
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,620
Kevin is an exception.

335
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,740
He's Mr. Ji's henchman.

336
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,020
The thing is definitely not
as simple as it looks.

337
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,140
How could Ji Chen,

338
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,980
that scheming guy,

339
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,660
arrange his henchman

340
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,300
around the people?

341
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,500
Do you mean...?

342
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,620
Ji Chen asked Kevin

343
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,260
to watch us.

344
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,420
Zhou Tian, you are so scary.

345
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,020
You got promoted

346
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,900
but leave a timebomb

347
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,740
around us.

348
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,860
Did I owe you much

349
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,860
in my last life

350
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
to have such a friend like you?

351
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,300
Come on. Drop the act.

352
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,580
It's not that serious.

353
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,140
No.

354
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,220
I bet

355
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,140
it's not that simple.

356
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,980
Kevin,

357
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,700
please come to my office.

358
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,740
Chen Can.

359
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,260
Yeah.

360
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,100
Come here.

361
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,700
Stand up, please.

362
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,340
Stand up.

363
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,260
W-Would you mind

364
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,500
standing aside?

365
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,660
You can be off.

366
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Mr. Kevin, what are you...

367
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,060
The geomancy works better this way.

368
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,540
Didn't you also

369
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,780
set the table the same way before?

370
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,900
Your eight characters
are not well-matched.

371
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,900
A slight adjustment of the position

372
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,180
makes sure the geomancy works well.

373
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,180
(What's the stupid crocodile
planning to do?)

374
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,060
My waist...

375
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,460
You want me

376
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,860
to face the glass

377
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,780
and turn my back on everyone else?

378
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,980
You want to torture me, right?

379
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,540
It brings you good fortune
in this way.

380
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,540
(No wonder he wanted me to face him.)

381
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,100
(It seems that he wants to)

382
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,380
(watch me doing work.)

383
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,940
(Judging from her reaction,)

384
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,500
(she should have felt)

385
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,780
(my encouraging eyes on her.)

386
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,540
(I do have a feeling that)

387
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,660
(someone is staring at me.)

388
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,900
(What does he mean?)

389
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,260
(Is this some role-playing
of an invigilator)

390
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,580
(and an examinee?)

391
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,900
(Perfect.)

392
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,460
(I still have the feeling)

393
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,780
(of being stared at.)

394
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,500
(What a perv!)

395
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,940
Mr. Ji,

396
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,020
it's not that convenient

397
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,340
to have coffee and deal with the work

398
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,660
in this position.

399
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,900
I suggest that

400
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,780
you should return

401
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,420
to your luxurious table.

402
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,820
You'll be more productive

403
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,180
in that way.

404
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,260
Don't get me wrong.

405
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,980
I only want to stay away
from the computer,

406
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,940
relieve my mood,
and sort out my thoughts.

407
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,820
Mr. Ji,

408
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,180
I'm now

409
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,540
the executive agent.

410
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,780
My wage, bonus,

411
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,380
and even well-being
will increase, right?

412
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,340
But all this morning,

413
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,220
apart from moving here
and adjusting the table,

414
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,300
all I have done

415
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,900
was to lighten the mood with my boss.

416
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,260
Don't you think it's a loss
for the company?

417
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,340
I surely know that.

418
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,100
So,

419
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,020
since we returned
from the training center,

420
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,900
I have understood that

421
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,220
you need

422
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,020
to accomplish the new challenge

423
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,180
at a new position,

424
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,420
so that you could become

425
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,780
an elite employee.

426
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,380
Jot down

427
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,820
what I'm going to say next.

428
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,060
These are your job placement

429
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,340
since you became the executive agent.

430
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,100
At 9:30 a.m.,

431
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,100
you should learn the plans
of the Publicity Department,

432
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,540
and work with them to complete

433
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,620
the publicity programme
of Qiao Yi's new book.

434
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,780
Have a meeting with
the Marketing Department

435
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,060
to confirm the design
of the book's belly band.

436
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:49,820
Besides,

437
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,860
sort out the data of novels

438
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,060
of a total of 2GB

439
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,900
by 50 authors
in Department Ⅱ.

440
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,740
And you need to pick some video clips

441
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,740
from the eight-hour footage

442
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,900
and make them

443
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,140
into a new promotional video.

444
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,980
Kevin's seat

445
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,860
is far from my office,

446
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,820
so you should undertake a part of work
as my assistant.

447
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,020
I have a video meeting
with the headquarters at 1 p.m.

448
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,100
Collect the process of the meeting

449
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,140
for me before 10 a.m.

450
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,180
The quarterly performance
appraisal meeting

451
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,260
will be held soon.

452
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,180
Verify the completion

453
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,900
of each department's performance,

454
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,980
and tabulate them for me.

455
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,460
Mr. Ji,

456
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,900
can you please repeat them?

457
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,260
Some of them...

458
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,540
No need.

459
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,460
I have sent them

460
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,620
to your Enterprise WeChat.

461
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,460
(Then why did you)

462
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,180
(ask me to jot them down just now?)

463
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,420
(You did it on purpose!)

464
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,940
Is it clear enough to you?

465
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,060
Yes.

466
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,420
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

467
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,620
It's very clear.

468
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,180
I have received it.

469
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,820
I'll do my best

470
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,740
to complete the tasks this month.

471
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,820
These are tasks for this week.

472
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,220
But it's Thursday today.

473
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,740
I trust you.

474
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,260
Pressures drive you to grow faster.

475
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,300
You'll be grateful for me someday.

476
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,020
Thanks, Mr. Ji.

477
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,700
(I really appreciate you.)

478
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,900
(You stupid crocodile.)

479
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,660
Xia,

480
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,500
how about we go to this restaurant

481
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,780
to celebrate Zhou Tian's promotion?

482
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,820
I think...

483
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,580
I...

484
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,700
Chen Can,

485
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,300
I think I have an illusion.

486
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,820
I saw a dim figure

487
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,700
haunt and disappear again and again.

488
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,340
I think,

489
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,820
here,

490
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,780
drink some coffee
and calm yourself down.

491
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
Zhou Tian?

492
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,180
So fast.

493
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,620
Take your time.

494
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,500
Take your time.

495
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,740
She left?

496
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,620
Zhou Tian

497
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,860
works like a dog in recent days.

498
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,700
Will this weekend's get-together

499
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,780
be called off?

500
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,420
It's hard to say.

501
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,580
People in our industry

502
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,940
are on 24/7 standby.

503
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
The director of the Marketing Department

504
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,020
divorced two years ago.

505
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,140
I heard it was because

506
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,500
she didn't take a day off

507
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,300
for entire two years.

508
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,100
Don't you know her gossip?

509
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,220
Tell me about it.

510
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,020
She was

511
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,140
seeing a guy

512
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,300
in her department.

513
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,740
Really?

514
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,660
Can't believe she got time for
a relationship from her hectic schedule.

515
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Nah.

516
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,300
You know what?

517
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,220
Since she got divorced,

518
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,860
she has worked overtime every day.

519
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,100
So they

520
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,540
keep each other company,

521
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,460
have takeout in the office together,

522
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,100
and work overtime together.

523
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,220
Gradually,

524
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,660
they fell in love.

525
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,460
That makes sense.

526
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,500
The greatest opportunity

527
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,740
for us desk jockeys
to have a relationship

528
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,540
takes place in the work area.

529
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,700
At how many dawns

530
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,380
and in the cab on the homeward way

531
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,780
romantic relations
have secretly germinated.

532
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,380
M-Mr. Ji.

533
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,340
Mr. Ji.

534
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,300
- We are returning to work.
- Mr. Ji.

535
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,300
It's OK.

536
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,620
This is lunchtime. Sit down.

537
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,580
I heard you guys said

538
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
working overtime together

539
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,620
grows the seed of love.

540
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,140
What's that going on?

541
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,980
We were just kidding.

542
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,420
Yeah.

543
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,460
We were kidding,

544
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:41,860
Mr. Ji.

545
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,340
I saw you were talking vividly

546
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,980
and included the details.

547
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,900
I'm interested in that.

548
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,060
Actually,
we are not very clear about that.

549
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,900
I just know that

550
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,140
they often worked overtime
until midnight.

551
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,100
Only they were left in the office.

552
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,660
And then,

553
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,860
the man bought coffee and chocolate

554
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,540
for that woman.

555
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,740
The next day,

556
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,300
they took the cab together...

557
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,220
Mr. Ji,

558
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,780
this is the publicity programme

559
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,820
of Qiao Yi's new book.

560
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,760
These are the completed performance

561
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,140
of each department signed

562
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,700
by each department's director.

563
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,100
These are the cash flow forecast

564
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,100
for next season.

565
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,340
And,

566
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,340
the flow of activities, the route,

567
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,780
content of speeches, and lists of dishes

568
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,220
of all the clients
you have made a reservation with.

569
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,980
Please check them.

570
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,300
Go get the file
of the publicity programme

571
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,740
from the Marketing Department.

572
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,540
It was delivered

573
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
to your mailbox five minutes ago.

574
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,220
Get the advertising schedule
on official accounts

575
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,540
from the Media Department.

576
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,740
In your mailbox.

577
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,940
Three minutes ago.

578
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,780
Get me a coffee

579
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,580
at the café downstairs.

580
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,780
Arabica cold brew coffee.

581
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,860
No room, no sugar.

582
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,500
Proper temperature.

583
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,500
Please enjoy it, Mr. Ji.

584
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,580
If there's nothing else

585
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,460
I could do for you,

586
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
I'll excuse myself.

587
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,500
I finally finished everything.

588
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,740
Finished?

589
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,580
In your dream!

590
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,220
Mr. Ji said

591
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,740
Qiao Yi's fans
have been leaving comments

592
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,300
on his studio's official Weibo account.

593
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,780
You need to sort them out.

594
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Those that were made three months ago

595
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,860
could be excluded.

596
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,100
Read all these

597
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,100
in recent three months.

598
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,940
Collect everything related

599
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,740
to endorsement, or complains,

600
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,780
and send the e-mail

601
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,260
to the relevant departments.

602
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,740
But

603
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,860
he didn't tell me that just now.

604
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,820
Three months.

605
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,260
How many comments do I have to read?

606
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,780
Even if I don't blink my eyes

607
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,940
and read until midnight,

608
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,180
I don't think I can finish it.

609
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,220
Come in.

610
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,180
(I knew it.)

611
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,140
(He is deliberately torturing me.)

612
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,020
Mr. Ji,

613
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,660
I have some thoughts,

614
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,260
but I don't know if I should say.

615
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,740
You shouldn't,

616
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,380
but I know what you wanna say.

617
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,940
I have thought about it.

618
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,180
There are
hundreds of thousands of comments

619
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,740
in recent three months.

620
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,660
It's indeed a bit inhumane

621
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,860
to ask you to finish it within a day.

622
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,580
It seems that Mr. Ji

623
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,820
is thoughtful to your employee.

624
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,500
Read one week's comments every day.

625
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,980
Working overtime

626
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,220
four or five hours a day.

627
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,500
Keep it for a week,

628
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,620
and they could be all finished.

629
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,460
What?

630
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,180
Any problems?

631
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,020
If you are good with it,

632
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
start it now.

633
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,980
No.

634
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,900
I promise to finish it on time.

635
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,020
This is no big deal.

636
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,100
Mr. Ji was crueler to me

637
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,660
back then.

638
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,820
Was I?

639
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,660
No, no, no.

640
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,660
You were pushing me forward.

641
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,060
Besides,

642
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,700
order two M9 steaks for me.

643
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,740
Ask the chef to cook them in the company

644
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,140
at 8:30 p.m.

645
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,180
But I don't remember

646
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,380
you have work tonight

647
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,740
on your schedule.

648
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,900
Why do you...

649
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,260
You need me to explain it to you?

650
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,580
It seems that I haven't pushed you

651
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,340
far enough.

652
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,100
I guarantee you

653
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,020
a satisfactory dinner.

654
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,060
Working overtime together

655
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,020
grows the seed of love.

656
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Good idea.

657
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:01,940
Xin Xin,

658
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:02,980
look.

659
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,060
Zhang Hao is not himself,

660
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,420
right?

661
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,740
You know it better than me.

662
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,180
He's lovelorn.

663
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,260
He didn't really date Tian.

664
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,940
He was just refused.

665
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,740
When I was abroad,

666
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,900
it's a common thing

667
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,580
for everyone.

668
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,940
No one takes it...

669
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,300
Hao is different from those men you said.

670
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,100
He has never been romantically involved.

671
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,940
If we want to cheer him up,

672
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,220
I think we gotta get him a strong dose.

673
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,020
A strong dose?

674
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,700
You mean...

675
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,420
Yep!

676
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,020
That's what you are thinking.

677
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,700
Xin Xin,

678
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,220
you are reliable
at this critical moment.

679
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,060
What works to take the pressure off him?
