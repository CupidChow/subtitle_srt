Mr. Ji?

Heating mode in this weather?

00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,900
I feel cold.

OK.

because of overworking?

It's all my fault.

Mr. Ji,

it's the warmest already.

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,260
What happened?

36
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,060
- You look like you were in a sauna.
- Listen to me.

37
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,980
Mr. Ji has been overworked recently.

He's a bit weak.

Remember

40
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,980
to get everything that can warm him up.

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,060
Don't make him freeze.

42
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,580
OK.

Xia told me to bring it to you.

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,820
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,620
It completely melted...

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,380
It has been a whole day, anyway.

50
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,460
Throw it since it melted.

51
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:00,860
You...

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,660
I'll tell Kevin

53
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,540
to buy you a new one tomorrow.

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,620
It's the new policy.

55
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,940
To celebrate every employee's birthday.

56
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,780
Oh, right.

57
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,740
Mr. Ji, I'll go pick someone up now.

What's going on in there?

62
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,580
Ji Chen,

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,860
you are just in time.

64
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,900
I want to replace the director.

65
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,820
I bet Li Han is unworthy of the name.

66
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,340
Go meet the director.

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,340
You have to if you still want

68
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,540
to present your story.

69
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,540
What do you mean?

70
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,980
This project will be shut down
if it's not Li Han?

71
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,460
Why?

72
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,220
Why do I have to listen to him?

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,540
Because this is his specializing.

74
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,860
Yeah, "Silent Cry"

75
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,340
is your original work.

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,180
But novels and films

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
are two different kinds of art.

78
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,220
You can't teach him

79
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,020
how to do his job

80
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,540
just because

81
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
it's your original work.

82
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,860
If you had chosen
to be its scriptwriter,

83
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,740
you should have said it

84
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,380
at the very beginning.

85
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,580
You can't jump out now

86
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,020
and attack the director.

87
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,100
Nothing good will come of it.

88
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,020
It'll harm the whole project,

89
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,180
your novel, and even you.

90
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,740
You can't act recklessly

91
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,300
just because you
are the original author.

92
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,300
I...

93
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,740
I told you when we

94
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,340
renewed your contract.

95
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,900
I hope our cooperation

96
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,860
is a long-term thing.

97
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,620
I hope

98
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,780
to present 80% of your work

99
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,860
on the screen.

100
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,620
This is also your hope.

101
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,180
That is why I came here in person.

102
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
But your coming

103
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,500
is counterproductive.

104
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,660
I know you've read
several versions of the script.

105
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,500
You're worried that

106
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,580
he can't present the core of your novel.

107
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,620
Yet the script and the film

108
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,820
can present
two totally different things.

109
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,420
You should trust the professionals

110
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,140
and give the director a chance.

111
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,180
Just like
we trust your novel unconditionally.

112
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,900
It is 18:15 now.

113
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,620
You have 15 minutes to think about it.

114
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,140
If you agree,

115
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,180
go meet with the director.

116
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,140
If you don't,

117
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,140
I'll tell the producer

118
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,460
that you won't be its scriptwriter

119
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,580
at 18:30.

120
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,380
Zhou Tian.

121
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,180
Come out.

122
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,300
Shoot.

123
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:27,860
Mr. Ji,

124
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,980
I was a little dumb.

125
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,260
You said

126
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,380
the agency was to serve,

127
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,220
right?

128
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,860
Shouldn't we

129
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,340
serve Qiao Yi,

130
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,380
a top writer,

131
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,820
and make him happy?

132
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,380
Even you, the boss of the company,

133
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,660
should also try to please him.

134
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,660
But just now, you...

135
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,540
Agency

136
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,940
is indeed to serve.

137
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,180
Our service contains

138
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,060
leading them to see their shortages

139
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,660
and to know the truth about themselves.

140
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
We won't just flatter them

141
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,380
and keep them in their dreams.

142
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,580
We share a mutual stake

143
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,620
with them.

144
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,100
Xing Yi is a brand.

145
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,380
We won't use writers.

146
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,900
Instead, we try our best

147
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,060
to make them go further.

148
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,580
We created Qiao Yi.

149
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,420
We can create more

150
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,300
the likes of him.

151
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,740
Why isn't here a heating mode?

152
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,500
What are you doing?

153
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,020
Stay here.

154
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,340
Kevin told me before he left

155
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,980
you're algid recently.

156
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,060
He told me

157
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,900
to keep you warm.

158
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,260
Mr. Ji,

159
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,780
take these.

160
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,500
If it's not enough,

161
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,420
use these heat patches.

162
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,300
Remember.

163
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,740
Stick them to the outside

164
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,980
of your underwear.

165
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,060
If you still feel cold,

166
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
just tell me.

167
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,780
I'll try to find something more.

00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,380
(Dressing Room)

175
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,340
How do you feel?

176
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,060
You were panicking just now, right?

177
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,540
Afraid that I wouldn't go out,

178
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,060
and you would be embarrassed.

179
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,820
Honestly,

180
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,540
I knew
it was just a face-threatening act.

181
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,460
You are so bad an actor.

182
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,940
I saw you through at the very start.

183
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,540
Prepare yourself mentally.

184
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,660
I'll invite the director over.

185
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,660
Tell me.

186
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,780
He was anxious and worried

187
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,300
that I wouldn't compromise, right?

188
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,100
To be fair,

189
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,780
I compromise

190
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
because I feel sorry for him.

191
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,220
This is how soft-hearted I am.

192
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,180
Please.

193
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,380
Mr. Li.

194
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,940
Sorry.

195
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,140
I was a little rude just now.

196
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,220
It's OK.

197
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,140
I was also a little rude.

198
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,820
(What just happened?)

199
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,860
(He handled)

200
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,660
(the director just now?)

201
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,180
I think our main divergence

202
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,740
is about emotional expression.

203
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,420
Can we talk

204
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,940
about the specific scenarios?

205
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,980
That's also what I think.

206
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,300
Turns out we're on the same page.

207
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,020
Divergence in content creation

208
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,420
is really common.

209
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,140
Not just among directors,
scriptwriters, and authors.

210
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,740
It happens a lot even among directors.

211
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,900
Divergence is actually a good thing.

212
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,700
It means this novel

213
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,660
is deep in content

214
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,100
and can be explained in different ways.

215
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,500
You're right.

216
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,620
I didn't expect

217
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,300
this scene would look great

218
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
when being expressed in a silent way.

219
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,180
The author does know his story better.

220
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,980
Thank you.

221
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,580
I should have gone to you earlier.

222
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,340
Well,

223
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,260
let's call it a day.

224
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:54,900
OK.

225
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,540
Let's call it a day.

226
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,180
Thank you, Mr. Ji and Yi.

227
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,220
Good job, everyone.

228
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,420
Today, Yi will treat you to dinner.

229
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,900
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

230
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,780
Thank you, Yi.

(I can't even have a happy birthday.)

239
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,700
Yi invited the culinary team

240
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,340
of Chuan Style Restaurant

241
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,700
here to cook us dinner

249
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,260
I wanted to visit this diner long ago.

250
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,140
I made a reservation

251
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,660
to visit the diner today.

252
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,580
Thank you, Kevin.

253
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,620
Mr. Ji said the director likes it,

254
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,300
so I invited them.

255
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,460
Guess you're lucky today.

this spicy boiled fish

258
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
is their signature dish.

259
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,540
Have a taste.

260
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,300
Thanks.

261

I don't really eat spicy food.

Sorry, Mr. Li.

346
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,020
A great material.

Mr. Li, here.

OK.

By the way,

386
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,860
my mom called me today.

387

She asked me

388
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,860
what birthday gift I got for you.

389
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
She said mine was not good enough.

390
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,860
She has been very fond of me
since I was a kid.

Yeah.

392
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,620
My mom always wants you

to be our family.

394
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Hasn't she given it up?

395
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,260
She said your parents
also wanted to know.

396
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,940
They don't believe us

397
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,380
no matter what we say.

398
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,420
They think

399
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,940
we're just too shy.

400
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,340
It seems that

401
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,540
we need a serious talk with them.

402
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,940
Make it clear to them.

403
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,540
To stop them from setting us up.

404
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,700
If this doesn't work,

405
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,100
maybe I should recognize her
as my second mom.

406
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,380
Mr. Ji,

407
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,340
I heard people praising you.

408
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,460
They said you were considerate
to your employees.

409
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,060
You didn't inform Zhou Tian
about overtime,

410
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,300
knowing it was her birthday today.

411

I take back what I said this afternoon.

412

Zhang Hao really made it back.

413

Does he really plan to propose?

414
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,940
Very likely.

what a kind person you are.

418
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,700
Maybe Zhou Tian

419
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,940
will come to resign tomorrow.

420
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,700
Zhang Hao

421
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,660
is a world champion.

422
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,780
He can make

423
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,100
at least a few million a year.

424
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,780
After she becomes Mrs. Zhang,

425
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,420
she won't have to work

426
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,540
for a small salary.

427
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,340
Great.

428
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,140
I don't have to listen
to her gibberish anymore.

429

Can't you shut up?

430

She didn't tell me anything.

I'm on my way.

Speaking of which,

they two
are basically childhood sweethearts.

461

So,

462
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,420
you think childhood sweethearts

463
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,180
can be together?

464
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah, totally.

is it possible...

Nothing.

Sorry.

Uh,

to prepare you a birthday gift,

So cute.

Then I'll buy them all.

Pick one, then.

Wait a second. It's my friend.

516
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,620
Tian.

517
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,460
Wait.

518
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Yesterday was your birthday.

519
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,060
I didn't have time to send you a gift.

520
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,140
I'll give it to you today.

521
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
You don't have to.

522
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,020
What is this?

523
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,860
It's my number code.

524
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,780
I played code games

525
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,620
with my brother a lot.

526
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,100
How do you decode it?

527
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Every two numbers represent one letter

528
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,380
according to the order of the alphabet.

529
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,420
Zero eight represents "H."

530
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,460
Zero one represents "A."

531
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,820
So it's "Happy."

532
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,500
Bingo.

533
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,900
Thank you.

534
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,580
Xia?

535
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,340
Xia?

536
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,260
Xia Chunqiu!

537
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,220
I wasn't sleeping!

538
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,660
Wake up. It's morning now.

539
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,300
Morning...

540
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,020
You worked a whole night?

541
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,220
Why wasn't I informed?

542
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,900
Mr. Ji told us

543
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,340
not to inform you.

544
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:25,820
Mr. Ji.

545
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,300
What do you want?

546
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,260
Just a question.

547
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,980
Chen Can said

548
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,620
you asked him not to inform me

549
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,980
of yesterday's overtime.

550
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,700
You wouldn't help even if you were here.

551
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,700
And I would waste time

552
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,540
mentoring you.

553
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,300
You did a good job last night.

554
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,820
The expectations

555
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,100
for Silent Cry's film adaptation

556
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,620
has sharply increased.

557
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,860
The original novel is also better known.

558
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,460
You all will have your bonus doubled.

559
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,220
We now

560
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,820
have to escort

561
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,660
Qiao Yi's new book.

562
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,540
He wants to write a non-fiction book

563
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
about cross-country races.

564
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,140
Guys, any thoughts?

565
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,020
Zhou Tian,

566
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,620
do you?

567
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,260
I think

568
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,580
we can give Qiao Yi

569
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,220
a taste of what it is like

570
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,900
to be a real athlete.

571
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,820
Let him experience the character's life.

572
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,980
Good one.

573
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,180
This task is over to you.

574
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,340
Copy that.

575
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,620
OK.

576
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,020
Training center, right?

577
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,900
No problem.

578
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,100
Just leave it to me.

579
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,300
(Thank you.)

580
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,700
(So, you think childhood sweethearts)

581
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,580
(can be together?)

582
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,020
Yeah, totally.

583
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,100
Then,

584
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,540
is it possible...

585
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,060
What should I do

586
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,540
to make her understand it?

587
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,540
Zhang Hao?

588
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,620
What's on your mind?

589
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,100
Gigi, you came just in time.

590
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,260
Help me analyze it.

591
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,140
How do you

592
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,740
let a girl know

593
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,900
you like her?

594
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,140
Who do you like?

595
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,180
No, no.

596
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,500
Not my problem.

597
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,540
It's about my friend.

598
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,020
He just called me

599
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,380
and wanted me to help him with this.

600
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,460
Let her know you like her.

601
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,300
How easy.

602
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,540
Confess your feelings directly.

603
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,580
"Confess your feelings directly?"

604
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,180
What does he need to prepare

605
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,020
before confessing feelings?

606
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,060
My friend

607
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,340
is really dull.

608
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,140
We have to think everything for him.

609
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,460
He's my friend, anyway.

610
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,060
It varies from person to person.

611
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,100
Some like it dramatic.

612
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,660
Some like it happen

613
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,740
when being alone.

614
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,300
Some hope it romantic.

615
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Some want it simple.

616
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,300
Some want it to happen in fresh places.

617
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,700
And some hope

618
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,700
it is someplace

619
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,940
where two people share memories.

620
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,420
Gigi, you're so clever.

621
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,260
I said it.

622
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,300
I want to experience

623
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
a real athlete's life.

624
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,540
I don't want you

625
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,340
to arrange "The Truman Show" for me.

626
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,100
Didn't you tell him?

627
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,300
Twice on the way here.

628
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,220
How about this?

629
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,860
To ensure everything

630
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,300
is real but not phony,

631
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,380
you have to go with me.

632
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,580
I'll go to you

633
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,820
if I find anything phony.

634
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,460
And they'll fix it on the spot.

635
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
But I have a condition.

636
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,780
You must go with me.

637
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:34,740
Me?

638
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,100
You're my agent.

639
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,340
Shouldn't you go with me?

640
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,700
I'm the president of Xing Yi.

641
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,180
And I'm the pillar of Xing Yi.

642
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,620
Xing Yi has more than one pillar.

643
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,900
They have their agents.

644
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,860
They don't need you.

645
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
They don't make such requests

646
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,860
to their agents.

647
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Someone has to try tomato first.

648
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,420
That someone doesn't have to.

649
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,540
I'm not used to being turned down.

650
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,300
Start to get used to it.

651
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,380
(It's a good thing,)

652
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,700
(but why are they arguing?)

653
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,340
Zhou Tian.

654
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,540
Yeah.

655
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,220
I have a meeting.

656
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,180
I'll leave him to you.

657
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,180
(When will Bioluminescent Oceans
appear on the Rong Sea?)

658
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,500
Mid-April to early May.

659
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,780
That should be just the right time.

660
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,460
I'm not going unless he goes with me.

661
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,660
Yi,

662
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,940
I think it's a good thing

663
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,100
if he doesn't go there

664
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,660
with you.

665
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:02,940
Think about it.

666
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,900
He's our CEO.

667
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,060
If he's here,

668
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,860
others may be restrained.

669
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,700
It'll be phony in that case.

670
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,620
You won't really experience

671
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,980
the training.

672
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,060
But if he doesn't go...

673
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,700
I've talked to my friend.

674
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,940
He's an awesome trainer.

675
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,340
He can design a plan

676
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,740
according to your physical fitness.

677
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,140
Nothing fake, all real.

678
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,620
I promise

679
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,300
you'll experience an athlete's life.

680
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,300
You are out of sight, girl.

681
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,020
Quite considerate.

682
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,740
OK.

683
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,900
He doesn't have to go.

684
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,340
He can't go!

685
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,540
Ji Chen, I've decided.
