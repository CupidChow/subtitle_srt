20
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,580
I'd like to thank

21
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,780
all the media

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,900
coming to this event briefing.

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,780
We will officially respond

24
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,940
to Qiao Yi's plagiarism incident

25
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,780
that has been

26
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,260
raging online.

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,700
Now, Qiao Yi

28
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,900
will make a formal response

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,540
to that.

30
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,660
First of all,

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,100
I'd have to say sorry to everyone,

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,060
to those who cared for me

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,100
and loved me.

34
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,940
Sorry to keep you worrying for so long

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,780
before I step out to respond about that.

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,420
Hello, everyone.

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,580
We all came

38
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,180
here today

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
for the truth,

40
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,340
so I brought

41
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,860
the most important witness in it

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,980
to the scene.

43
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,860
Whether Qiao Yi plagiarized or not,

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,860
you'll be able to judge it

45
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,740
after hearing his speaking.

46
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,500
(Briefing of the Event)

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
He's Li Xiang's husband,

48
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,980
the prototype of the role in the story.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,420
Hello,

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,700
I'm Han Sen.

51
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,220
Li Xiang is my wife.

52
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,620
After I communicated with my wife,

53
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
she agreed to let me announce the truth

54
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,860
of the whole matter instead of her.

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,940
My wife and I grew up together.

56
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,420
There used to be a sea of pseudotsuga

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,780
near our village,

58
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,420
we had a protection policy about it,

59
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,580
but there was still
excessive deforestation happening.

60
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,940
I almost lost my life once

61
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,980
when I was trying to stop them.

62
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,500
That's how the story began.

63
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,500
Li Xiang posted a short story about it,

64
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,140
and then Qiao Yi's agent found us.

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,620
She wanted to buy the copyright

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,300
for the re-creation
of the story for him.

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,180
We agreed and signed an agreement.

68
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,100
However, just a few days ago,

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,540
she suddenly found Li Xiang,

70
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,740
gave her a sum of money
and arranged for her to go abroad.

71
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,460
She asked Li Xiang
to accuse Qiao Yi of plagiarism.

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,460
Qiao Yi,

73
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,940
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,900
I specifically declare here

75
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,180
that I'm responsible for what I've said.

76
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Words alone are not convictive.

77
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,260
Do you have any evidence?

78
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,860
How can we believe you

79
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,140
for your side of the story?

80
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,340
- Yeah.
- That's it. Do you have any evidence?

81
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,780
- Show us the evidence.
- She has got the point there.

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,060
- Where's your evidence?
- Show us about it.

83
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,090
Did you bring the original
copyright agreement with you?

84
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,660
I looked for it but didn't find it.

85
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,020
Li Xiang said that
Qiao Yi's previous agent bought it away.

86
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,980
Show us the evidence.

87
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,020
- Yeah.
- Show us about it.

88
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,660
Be patient, everyone.

89
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,580
I'd like to show you a video.

90
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,700
Hello, everyone.
I'm the writer Feng Xue,

91
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,500
and also the licensee of the story,

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,860
Underwater Warrior,
in Qiao Yi's new book.

93
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,100
A year ago,

94
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,820
Qiao Yi's agent,

95
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,300
Ms. Li Luxi found me.

96
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,860
She wanted me to license the story

97
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,260
to Qiao Yi for re-creation.

98
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
I agreed, and we signed the agreement.

99
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,300
However, a few days ago,

100
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,140
she found me again.

101
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,980
But this time, she asked me
to accuse Qiao Yi of plagiarism.

102
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,060
And she told me that she had

103
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,900
the agreements we had signed before,

104
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,060
so Qiao Yi wouldn't be able

105
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,620
to offer any evidence to clarify it.

106
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,500
And she also promised
to give me a sum of money for that.

107
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,580
However, my principles

108
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,340
are more important than money.

109
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,100
I don't want to get into trouble,

110
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,220
so, I didn't think of telling the truth

111
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,420
until Mr. Ji came to me yesterday.

112
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:51,860
Oh,

113
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,580
I've had a habit of recording calls.

114
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,340
So I have the complete recording

115
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,580
between Ms. Li Luxi and me.

116
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,460
OK, I got it.

117
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,620
Mr. Ji,

118
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,140
now that incident is perfectly resolved,

119
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,660
can you give me my resignation letter

120
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,900
back now?

121
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,020
It was my fault.

122
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,020
I was short-sighted.

123
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,980
And I shouldn't gauge you

124
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,460
with my mean measure.

125
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,220
Please forget about my recklessness.

126
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,580
The witness I brought here

127
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,980
was somewhat useful, right?

128
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,060
Although it wasn't me who solved it,

129
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,140
I made a lot of effort.

130
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,460
As an agent,

131
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,700
your integrity is the most important.

132
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,740
You must suit the action to your word.

133
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,300
When I said that

134
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,100
you'd regret it,

135
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,780
what did you say?

136
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,620
I...

137
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,300
I said that I'd never regret it,

138
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,740
or I'd be a puppy.

139
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,420
Fine. I get it.

140
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,140
Woof...

141
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,300
Mr. Ji,

142
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,260
did you see my sincerity?

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,260
Can you give me my resignation letter

144
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,340
back now?

145
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,020
Don't get me wrong,

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,980
I didn't promise you that.

147
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Are you fooling me?

148
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,060
But since you are so sincere,

149
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,460
I'll think about it.

150
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,020
You!

151
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,060
I heard that you resigned.

152
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,940
Mr. Kevin,

153
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,860
I heard you and Mr. Ji said

154
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,380
you'd terminate with Qiao Yi,

155
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,940
and the agreement was prepared,

156
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,740
so I defended him against injustice.

157
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,380
I didn't expect I'd be hit in the face
so quickly.

158
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,540
You didn't hear the whole thing.

159
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,540
Mr. Ji,

160
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,460
Lucy sent this termination agreement

161
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,220
to us.

162
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,500
And Mr. Chen

163
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,820
deliberately called to talk about that.

164
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,180
She's so impatient,

165
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,620
even can't wait for days.

166
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,860
I guess she'll definitely

167
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,460
go to the briefing site tomorrow.

168
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,100
I'll make her exposed on the spot.

169
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,780
The board did propose

170
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,540
to terminate with Qiao Yi,

171
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,260
but Mr. Ji never agreed with it.

172
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,260
Maybe someone
deliberately exposed the news.

173
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,100
Mr. Ji counterplotted it

174
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,220
and deliberately created a situation

175
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,860
that we could do nothing about it.

176
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,740
That way,

177
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,220
Lucy would think her plan was a success.

178
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,580
Only when she let her guard down

179
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,100
could we quietly turn the tables.

180
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,060
Mr. Ji has contributed

181
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,940
another classic case

182
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,180
of handling crisis PR this time.

183
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,380
The shocking reversal
of Qiao Yi's plagiarism

184
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,380
at the briefing this time

185
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,780
was such a shock.

186
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,740
Ex, the brand that had given up

187
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,860
cooperating with Qiao Yi,

188
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,580
has announced a three-year contract
with him.

189
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,220
That's amazing!

190
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,180
It shows that good prevails over evil.

191
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,180
Justice will never be absent,

192
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,060
but sometimes late.

193
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,820
Yes.

194
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,740
This has been heating on online...

195
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,860
Have you finished packing?

196
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,420
Right away.

197
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,420
Sorry to bother you these days.

198
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,260
You did bother me a lot,

199
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,620
but it's OK.

200
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,460
Luckily, he is finally innocent.

201
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,380
It's somewhat worthy

202
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,700
I endured the torture these days.

203
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,220
You endured the torture?

204
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,660
I was the one who suffered a lot, OK?

205
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,500
I could bear it with being exposed,

206
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,540
suffering network violence,
and losing endorsements.

207
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,780
But Lucy,

208
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,340
I trusted her so much,

209
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,380
she actually stabbed me in the back!

210
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,500
That was too much!

211
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,740
Fortunately, I got a big heart.
If it were you,

212
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,900
you wouldn't be able to get over it.

213
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,580
Anyway,

214
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,700
from today onwards,

215
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,140
Lucy is just the past in my life.

216
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,980
Qiuqiu,

217
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,740
you know what?

218
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,860
Today, I thought I could

219
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,900
do a better job than my boss,

220
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,300
but instead,

221
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,140
I've misunderstood him.

222
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,060
So embarrassing.

223
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,420
Qiuqiu,

224
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,860
why are you getting fatter?

225
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,460
No.

226
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,180
I have to talk to 1003

227
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,460
to get him to lower your food standards.

228
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,740
I want to talk to you seriously

229
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,380
about Qiuqiu's weight problem.

230
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,700
I was going to talk to you about that.

231
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,220
From tomorrow on,

232
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,940
I'll cut its meal in half.

233
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,140
It has gained

234
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,660
too much weight lately.

235
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,500
Good.

236
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,460
You don't seem having a busy day.

237
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,860
The peacock thing is solved?

238
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,780
Yeah.

239
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,100
However, misfortune comes again to me.

240
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,180
Now the peacock is alright,

241
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,340
I got into trouble.

242
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,060
I did something embarrassing.

243
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,340
I dropped a very important thing

244
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,060
into the crocodile pool.

245
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,860
And I couldn't get it out.

246
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,300
So annoying.

247
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,580
Forget it.

248
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,780
Let's convert sorrow into appetite,

249
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,180
and have a feast.

250
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,740
It's unhealthy to eat late-night snacks.

251
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,580
It's also unhealthy to sleep hungry.

252
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,580
Do you wanna have instant noodles?

253
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,460
That's junk food.

254
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,260
Just a little bit of work,

255
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,340
you'll be able

256
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,300
to make a delicious noodle pancake.

257
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,740
I can teach you.

262
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,500
You have surpassed me a lot.

263
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,260
This is my first time trying
this kind of instant noodles.

264
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,940
It's nice.

265
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,780
Of course, it is.

266
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,860
It took me

267
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,900
most of my teenage years

268
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,780
to develop it

269
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,260
and make it so good.

270
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,540
I'll teach you to make other

271
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,540
of my late-night snacks next time.

272
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,740
I'm longing for it.

273
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,540
It's been a tough day.

274
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,060
Go to bed early after you finish it.

275
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,060
Good night.

276
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,380
Good night.

Even my mom never hit me like that.

That's why you need it.

340

I'll give you the lesson

341
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,020
in place of your mom.

342
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,300
You drove me into the corner.

343
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,300
So don't blame me for being brutal.

It seems to be too tough.

As a dominating president,

355
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,860
Mr. Ji should be able to be persuaded
by the weak but not by force.

it's too ruthless to watch

The resignation was just out of impulse.

Please don't make things difficult

HR hasn't had a conversation with you?

They did.

382
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
But I still want

383
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,620
to make the final struggle.

384
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,180
Show me your sincerity then.

385
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,940
I, Zhou Tian, swear to the lamp,

386
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
as long as I'm allowed to stay,

I'll work hard for sure.

388
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,940
I swear to submit to your direction,

389

and never act on my own from now on.

390

Is this sincere enough?

391
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,700
Not bad.

392
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,980
But as an agent,

393
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,580
the core quality is honesty.

394
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,580
You have to do

395
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,980
what you said.

396
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,140
What did you say to me

397
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,540
when you submitted
your resignation letter?

398
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,260
You put firmly

399
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,580
you'd never regret it.

400
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,740
Everyone makes mistakes.

401
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,660
Please give me an opportunity.

402
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,260
Opportunities fall only to those
who are ready for them.

You are out of the list.

Mr. Ji,

you are the kindest person in the world.

You should not

sink to my level.

Well.

410
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,780
Your education background
is not outstanding.

411
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,020
You have little experience
in this aspect.

412
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,940
You disobeyed the direction
of higher-ups,

413
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,060
and made mistakes several times.

414
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,860
It's hard to imagine

415
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,020
what job you will be up to

416
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,860
if you leave our company.

417
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,740
Mr. Ji, I admit that

418
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,780
I'm a nobody.

419
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,660
But you should know that

420
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,220
I'm a person with dignity.

421
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,100
Zhou Tian,

422
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,340
HR wants to have a talk with you.

423
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,540
I'm on it.

424
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,580
Mr. Ji, please take a look

425
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,540
at Zhou Tian's formal labor contract.

426
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,380
Labor contract?

427
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,420
M-Mr. Ji.

428
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,740
I know

429
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,340
what you just said to me

430
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,020
was a test

431
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,180
of my resolution in this job.

432
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,380
Please rest easy.

433
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,660
Since I joined Xing Yi,

434
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,820
I never meant to leave.

435
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,980
I promise to devote myself

436
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,860
to my work.

437
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,580
This is your so-called dignity?

438
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,180
It's the second time
you asked for a resignation.

439
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,580
I fully see

440
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,900
your resolution of leaving.

441
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,420
Mr. Ji,

442
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,300
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,660
I was impulsive and ignorant.

444
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,220
I didn't understand your instruction.

445
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,660
I think I'm too righteous,

446
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,540
meticulous and upright.

447
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,420
I'll make an effort

448
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,940
to improve my sense of humor,

449
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,660
and follow your lead.

450
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,340
I'll make myself a talent

451
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,580
of both high EQ and IQ,

452
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,820
and in full development.

453
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,620
Hello?

454
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,740
Please.

455
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,380
Yeah, hello.

456
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,060
OK, I see.

457
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,540

461
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,580
Then my resignation letter...

462
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,860
I'll keep it.

463
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,780
Its validity remains permanent.

464
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,820
But I feel uneasy

465
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,380
if you keep it.

466
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,060
But I do.

467
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,180

the theme of NK

They want an international superstar.

475

But the time given by NK

for filming

477

What's wrong with them?

481
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,180
None of your business.

482

Focus on your own duty.

Well,

484

I gotta go.

See you around, Mr. Ji.

What the hell was going on?

488

Did Mr. Ji mean

489
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,740
to disband

490
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,260
the Sports Division Department?

491
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,860
No way.

492

What I'm gonna do

493

Transfer her
to the Sports Division Department.

I've got no idea

what your relationship is with her.

But I'm sure the answer is no.

583
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,660
The professional field

584
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,180
should be left to professionals.

585
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,980
She used to be an athlete.

586
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,140
Sports is her speciality.

587

Even though
she's not an athlete anymore,

588

she should start

She can also

realize her growth

We have our rules.

Besides, Zhou Tian's current talent
and ability

603
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,180
do not meet the qualification

No one ever forced her.

In addition,

612
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,780
she's an adult.

613
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
She has the right

614
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,860
to choose her position.

615
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,860
None of us
could make the decision for her.

I know you're doing this

623
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,740
I've been dreaming

625
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,740
But I know

626
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,580
I'm indeed deficient in talent

627
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,940
and ability.

628
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,100
But I will follow
in everyone's footsteps

629

as far as I can.

630
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,420

00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,220
has been tweaked a bit.

679
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,700
The timing conflicts

680
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,060
with the filming of the ad.

681
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,980
No idea
if he could get the coach's approval

682
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,740
to take a half-day off.

683
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,340
But my experience

684
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,500
told me he couldn't.

685
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,700
Mr. Ji, you're so calm.

686
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,460
Have you thought of any plan B?

687
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,420
Nope.

688
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,660
Why aren't you

689
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,980
anxious about that?

690
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,420
At the worst situation,

691
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,780
I'll dissolve
the Sports Division Department.
