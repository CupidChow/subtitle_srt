20
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,890
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,650
Dad, Mom,

22
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,610
Your clothes are

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,090
so fancy!

24
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:55,970
Fancy?

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,970
Really?

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,530
These are new!

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,480
Your dad said

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,450
we had to look fancier
than Hao's family.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,200
Understand?

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,530
Seriously?

31
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,610
If others saw you,

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
they might think you would

33
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,370
go on a blind date.

34
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,810
You dummy girl.

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,560
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,330
But, Dad,

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,930
coming back to the point,

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,880
why do you want Hao and I

39
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,400
to be a couple

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,400
even you dislike Uncle Zhang so much?

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,880
If we actually get married,

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
you two will be related as well.

43
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:19,970
If you two become families,

44
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,120
your relationship
will become more troublesome.

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,530
You know nothing about this.

46
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,650
Experts on TV have said

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that when you have a son

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,210
who is not educated well,

49
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,880
he will harm your whole family.

50
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:29,770
However,

51
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,680
when you have a daughter,

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,930
who is not educated well,

53
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,330
she will harm someone else's family.

54
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,210
So,

55
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,840
if I don't like someone,

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,250
I shall spoil my daughter,

57
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,090
let my daughter marry into his family,

58
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,160
and make her harm his family.

59
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,840
Then, my revenge will succeed.

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,250
So,

61
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,000
you have to marry into the Zhang family.

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,440
Let's infiltrate our enemy.

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,330
Guess I'll disappoint you.

64
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,530
Pardon.

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,330
I said I was afraid

66
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,250
you would have a heart attack.

67
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,840
I'll have a heart stent then.

68
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,770
Two if it's necessary.

69
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,440
OK?

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Enough for this.

71
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,120
Both of you.

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,210
The Zhangs

73
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,090
are waiting for us inside.

74
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,930
Let's go.

75
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,810
- Go.
- Let's go.

76
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Go.

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,160
I'll have more if it's necessary.

78
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm fine with it.

79
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,250
Sweetie.

80
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,530
Tian.

81
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
You're finally here.

82
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,120
You're slimmer now.

83
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:22,930
Tian,

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
you get more pretty.

85
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,600
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang.
- Sit, please.

86
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,090
Come on.

87
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,680
Take a seat.

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
This way.

89
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,120
Come on.

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,840
Zhou.

91
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,250
Is it proper for you to sit there?

92
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,160
Isn't it?

93
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,370
Isn't it the head of the table?

94
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

95
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,560
It's you who beg

96
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,530
to have my daughter marry
into your family.

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,560
As the head of our family,

98
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,770
is it improper for me

99
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,090
to take the head seat?

100
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,600
What do you think?

101
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,210
Zhou, what are you

102
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,210
talking about?

103
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,840
Right?

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
We are all family.

105
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,240
It doesn't matter which seat we take.

106
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,010
Just take a seat.

107
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,570
Come on. Sit.

108
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,400
Sit down.

109
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,770
Sit down.

110
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,690
Sit down. Come here.

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,400
Come.

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,920
Just sit.

113
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,890
Take a seat.

114
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:39,920
Tian,

115
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,650
why do you sit so far away from me?

116
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,280
Come here.

117
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,240
Sit next to me.

118
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,720
I'll just sit here.

119
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,010
We'll have a guest come later.

120
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,920
There's no outsider.

121
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,570
Hao will arrive soon.

122
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,650
Today,

123
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,240
we two families gather here

124
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,770
to discuss your wedding.

125
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,690
Mr. Zhang,

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,090
there's nothing between us.

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,130
I know you two are doing fine.

128
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,090
But as parents,

129
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,090
we really want you two

130
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,480
to speed up a little.

131
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,400
Tian,

132
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,160
we really hope to have you

133
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,800
as our daughter-in-law

134
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,890
as soon as possible.

135
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,450
Yeah.

136
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,450
We have been looking forward

137
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,720
to that day for a long time.

138
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,480
I have a boyfriend now.

139
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,240
Y-You have one now?

140
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,570
Why don't you bring him with you?

141
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,360
He's on the way here.

142
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,400
Oh, my dear girl.

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,330
My girl's obviously a good liar.

144
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,010
She made it sound so real.

145
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,840
She learned it from you.

146
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,600
Stop this.

147
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,770
Tian.

148
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,720
I know

149
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,690
Zhang is not a kind person.

150
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,840
But his son,

151
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,090
grew up under my watch.

152
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,240
Good boy.

153
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,530
Totally.

154
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,450
Don't decline the matter

155
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,010
between you two

156
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,330
just because

157
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,160
of Zhang's problem.

158
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,280
This is not right.

159
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,330
Tian, don't listen to his nonsense.

160
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,650
You almost got me.

161
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,450
I have heart disease,

162
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,280
you know.

163
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,970
Am I right?

164
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm on your side.

165
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,280
If Hao can be my son-in-law,

166
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,450
I'll hold a three-day feast.

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,650
I'll hold a seven-day feast.

168
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Then, a 15-day feast.

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
I will hold a feast

170
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,130
that will last for a full month.

171
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,010
I...

172
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,450
I'll pay enough for them
to travel for a whole year.

173
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:36,530
This...

174
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,240
I manage the family finances.

175
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,890
We'll pay.

176
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,450
No way.

177
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:42,890
We...

178
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,800
Sorry, everyone.

179
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,450
I'm late.

180
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,280
There is a traffic jam.

181
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,770
Please,

182
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,720
allow me to introduce myself.

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,240
My name is Ji Chen.

184
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,330
I'm Zhou Tian's boyfriend.

185
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Boyfriend?

186
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,330
Boyfriend?

187
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,890
Boyfriend?

188
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,280
Boyfriend?

189
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,920
(Boyfriend?)

190
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
No.

191
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,530
Don't listen to his nonsense.

192
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,210
Then,

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,450
why is he here?

194
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,450
Why are you here?

195
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,840
To meet your parents

196
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,280
with you, honey.

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,330
Where is Xin Xin?

198
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,410
What...

199
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,240
Listen to me.

200
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,970
I asked Kevin to give him

201
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,280
a VIP card for the resort.

202
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,210
He doesn't need to pay a penny,

203
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,800
but it will be invalid tomorrow.

204
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,530
He's looking for a girl

205
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,130
who's willing to accompany him.

206
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,530
Didn't I make myself clear enough?

207
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,970
Why are you haunting me?

208
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you usually

209
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,970
treat your helper like this?

210
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,930
Who needs your help?

211
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,450
Not you?

212
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,450
Since I'm not welcomed here,

213
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll leave right away.

214
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,170
Excuse me.

215
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Fine.

216
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,570
You can help me.

217
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,640
But you'd better

218
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,760
not do anything else.

219
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,690
Yeah.

220
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
He is my boyfriend,

221
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,930
Ji Chen.

222
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,120
Wait.

223
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,600
This...

224
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,360
But you just said...

225
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,630
It is just a game

226
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,930
between us.

227
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,690
A game?

228
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,450
Yeah.

229
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,970
I was testing him.

230
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,410
He

231
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,480
has a short memory.

232
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,690
So I'm afraid

233
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,450
that he will forget me.

234
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,480
Zhou,

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
I don't think

236
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,760
we can have dinner together.

237
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,360
We...

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
We won't disturb

239
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,210
your family dinner.

240
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,090
Zhang,

241
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,240
we truly can't have dinner together.

242
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,450
I'll go with you.

243
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,170
That's my man.

244
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,170
Zhang.

245
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:52,720
Zhou.

246
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
Dad, Mom,

247
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,570
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,
sorry for keeping you waiting.

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,170
This is my girlfriend, Gigi.

249
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,640
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang.

250
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,720
- Wait.
- What is going on?

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:09,970
Since when did she

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,880
become your girlfriend?

253
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,520
Wait.

254
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,810
I should be saying that line.

255
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Recently...

256
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,240
Seriously?

257
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,120
Of course.

258
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,020
(One and a half an hour later)

259
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,360
Look at your boyfriend.

260
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,410
Why is he

261
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,450
staring at Hao's girlfriend?

262
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,410
Maybe

263
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,600
their gaze met?

264
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,330
Careful.

265
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,410
Didn't you say

266
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,090
Tian was your girlfriend?

267
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,880
You know each other?

268
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,450
Nope.

269
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,690
Never met before.

270
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,690
You two know each other, don't you?

271
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,480
You two have met

272
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,760
more than once.

273
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,720
We met but we don't know each other.

274
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,520
Who will want to know him?

275
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,930
Let's get to know each other today.

276
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,970
Tian said

277
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,290
you were a control freak.

278
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,760
You're basically a psychopath.

279
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,120
Being with you

280
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,290
is like being in prison.

281
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,520
Neither is free.

282
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,090
I...

283
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,410
I have never said so.

284
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,520
A spoiled,

285
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,600
current student

286
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
of the Juilliard School,

287
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,720
instead of going to school,

288
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,210
you go to work in a coffee shop.

289
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
I do believe you cause lots of trouble
for Zhang Hao.

290
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,170
Not really.

291
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,360
Not many troubles.

292
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,570
Spiritual abundance

293
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,050
is not
how many material things you have.

294
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,330
Unlike you,

295
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,450
I'm not kidnapped by money.

296
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,170
Vulgar.

297
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,360
What makes you believe you,

298
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,000
an immature girl,

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,970
can judge my values?

300
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,210
My ability

301
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,330
to think independently.

302
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,240
No one can take away

303
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,970
my right to speak.

304
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,640
You're fabricating the facts.

305
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,360
You're resorting to sophistry.

306
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,090
You're being unreasonable.

307
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,520
You...

308
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,170
Does Zhang Hao like you?

309
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:58,880
He confessed his love

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
for Zhou Tian not long ago

311
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,360
and was turned down.

312
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,170
How is possible

313
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,170
that he likes you now?

314
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:03,930
It's none of your business.

315
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,810
Keep it down.

316
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,640
What is that?

317
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,570
Your girlfriend?

318
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
There is nothing

319
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
between Zhou Tian and me.

320
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,120
We are not together.

321
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
But you can't just get

322
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
a random girl to be your girlfriend.

323
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,600
You heard it.

324
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,090
Spoiled.

325
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,450
Left school to work as a waitress.

326
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,690
Is that what a good girl does?

327
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,690
A normal girl

328
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,880
won't have a control freak

329
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,050
to be her boyfriend.

330
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,210
But you have one.

331
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,360
It's not what you think it is.

332
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,120
Then...

333
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,330
Then what is it?

334
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,930
I bet you did something

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,090
that hurt her.

336
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:39,840
Or she wouldn't have found

337
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,360
a psychopath

338
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,360
to be her boyfriend.

339
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,300
I'm telling you.

340
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,880
You two are erring from the right path.

341
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,810
We hope you

342
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,090
can realize your errors

343
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,240
and mend your ways.

344
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,480
Don't go any further

345
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,520
down the wrong path.

346
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,000
We've thought about it.

347
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,690
We think

348
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,290
there is no need for you

349
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,050
to continue dating that girl.

350
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,760
Guess we have to take the field.

351
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,760
Nian, I'm your brother.

352
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,120
Shush.

353
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:05,880
Are we doing this again?

354
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,290
We talked about it.

355
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,360
Don't interfere with my matter.

356
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm not interfering with your matter.

357
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,840
I care about you because I love you.

358
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
Is this how you love me?

359
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,880
Ji Chen.

360
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,690
We've talked it over

361
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,810
about Zhou Tian and you.

362
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,000
We agreed that

363
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,720
Zhou Tian and Hao

364
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,570
will make a great couple.

365
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,120
Yeah.

366
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,570
Right.

367
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:05,970
Right?

368
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,170
My daughter,

369
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,930
Tian was an athlete.

370
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,840
She has a simple mind.

371
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,520
She can't

372
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,050
catch up with your pace.

373
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,450
Yeah.

374
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,640
So,

375
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,120
you two couples are not good couples.

376
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,840
Right?

377
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

378
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,120
Yes.

379
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,000
And

380
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,240
Tian and Hao were together

381
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,240
when they were trained together.

382
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,600
They know each other well,

383
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,930
and have the same hobbies.

384
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,880
They should be a great couple.

385
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,450
So,

386
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,690
as parents,

387
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,450
we won't

388
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,360
interfere with your love affairs.

389
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,720
But love

390
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,000
shouldn't

391
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,970
be this complex.

392
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,570
Not complex at all.

393
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,240
It's pure.

394
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,090
I can see.

395
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,930
I think

396
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,450
you two

397
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,930
will make a perfect couple.

398
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,480
Yeah.

399
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:02,760
Yeah.

400
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,690
- Right.
- Yeah.

401
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,600
We...

402
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,520
- We all think so.
- Yeah.

403
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,420
Yeah.

404
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,450
Just now,

405
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,330
we were talking about it outside.

406
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,090
Right?

407
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,000
There must be something

408
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,330
between you two.

409
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,880
Since you haven't ended your love story,

410
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,330
now you can go back to each other.

411
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,290
Yeah.

412
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,480
Don't give up on each other

413
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,410
because of Tian and Hao.

414
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,110
Yeah.

415
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,640
Totally right.

416
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,990
Right?

417
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah.

418
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,810
Ji Chen is my brother.

419
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,570
Biological brother.

420
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,000
Girl,

421
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,520
this is a good joke.

422
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,290
Please,

423
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,330
listen to me.

424
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,520
We are brother and sister.

425
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,840
From the same parents.

426
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,570
My name is Ji Chen.

427
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,330
And her name is Ji Nian.

428
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,570
No wonder...

429
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,880
Every two numbers represent one letter

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,450
according to the order of the alphabet.

431
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Zero eight represents "H".

432
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,570
Zero one represents "A".

433
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,450
It's my number code.

434
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,320
I played code games

435
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,080
with my brother a lot.

436
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:10,970
Dad, Mom,

437
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,170
they two are brother and sister.

438
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:17,610
Gigi,

439
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,410
are you really his sister?

440
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,610
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang,

441
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,890
Tian,

442
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,280
and Hao.

443
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,690
My name is Ji Nian.

444
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,320
My English name is Gigi.

445
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,970
Ji Chen is my biological brother.

446
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,170
But I choose truth over kinship.

447
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,520
I think Tian is too good for Chen.

448
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,240
This...

449
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,170
Sorry.

450
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,760
I lied to you.

451
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,410
I sincerely apologize to you.

452
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,560
Sorry.

453
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
Forgive me, please.

454
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,480
Look at her.

455
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,370
See?

456
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,970
Even his biological sister says so.

457
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,560
Tian,

458
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,520
think of

459
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
having Hao as your boyfriend.

460
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,130
My daughter

461
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,080
is a wild girl.

462
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,410
And you're a control freak.

463
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:33,720
No.

464
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,210
She may cause you trouble in the future.

465
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,080
How about this?

466
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,760
Zhou Tian

467
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,690
and Zhang Hao's matter

468
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,040
will still go as we originally planned.

469
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,720
How's this?

470
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,000
Fair enough.

471
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,210
Dad.

472
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,890
Uncle Zhang.

473
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,040
We have to be serious
about the marriage.

474
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,760
Ji Chen is a control freak.

475
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,000
I have to explain this.

476
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,040
It's his occupational disease.

477
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,080
He is the CEO

478
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,850
of our company.

479
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,560
He's born to control.

480
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,690
But he

481
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,000
is very thoughtful

482
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,800
and considerate.

483
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,800
You know me.

484
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,520
I'm always rash.

485
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,320
If it weren't for him,

486
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,130
I would have made lots of mistakes.

487
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,480
But I have him now.

488
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,240
That's why I'm doing so well.

489
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,210
But, Tian,

490
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,690
even his sister

491
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,370
said he was a psychopath.

492
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,170
Yeah.

493
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,970
He is just like a psychopath

494
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,170
when he loves someone too much.

495
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,370
When he is in love,

496
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,970
he will die for his love.

497
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,240
He will give everything

498
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,130
to that person

499
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,890
and not think about himself.

500
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,130
He's smitten with me

501
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,040
in a psychopathic way

502
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,850
and will do anything for me.

503
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,520
So considerate his love is.

504
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,650
W-What about the kidnapped
by money thing?

505
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,450
Well...

506
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,450
This...

507
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,890
is because

508
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,610
he is really good at making money.

509
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,130
He doesn't want to work.

510
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:11,970
But

511
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,520
money keeps chasing after him.

512
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,650
So he's nearly kidnapped by money.

513
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,690
Well,

514
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,280
about this,

515
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,480
he is a better man than your dad.

516
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,800
And...

517
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,170
Any other questions?

(Renaissance Hotels)

519
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,720
Tian,

520
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,370
sorry for not telling you

521
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,000
that I am Ji Chen's biological sister.

522
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,450
Do you remember that

523
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,040
you gave me a card

524
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,650
on my birthday?

525
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,170
It said "Happy"

526
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,560
in a number code.

527
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,520
After that,

528
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,760
I noticed a painting

529
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,240
in Ji Chen's house.

530
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,000
It has "Love"

531
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,560
in number code.

532
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,800
This is quite apparent.

533
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,650
And your name, Gigi,

534
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,450
is pronounced similarly to Ji.

535
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,480
I should have guessed.

536
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,650
Sorry.

537
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,760
I won't do that again.

538
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Luckily that we didn't create chaos.

539
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,450
Don't even do that again.

540
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,320
I'll get a taxi.

541
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,450
Why?

542
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,170
My brother will drive you home.

543
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,450
I don't want his ride.

544
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,320
Zhang,

545
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,890
thank you for dinner.

546
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,650
Come on.

547
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,890
I'll take care of you.

548
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,170
Where will you stay tonight?

549
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,280
What about Hao's place?

550
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,610
Hao

551
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
just renovated his house.

552
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,170
Three bedrooms.

553
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,040
All face south.

554
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,560
Outside the window, it's the sea.

555
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,040
It's a real sea-view house.

556
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,370
We two will take one bedroom.

557
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,410
And there's still one.

558
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,280
Come with us.

559
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,040
Thanks.

560
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,210
But we have a place to stay.

561
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:41,850
Tian's place?

562
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,890
It's just a rented house.

563
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,800
How big can it be?

564
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,970
It must be crowded.

565
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,040
Come on.

566
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,760
Let's go.

567
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,690
To live in a real sea-view house.

568
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,760
Dad, Mom,

569
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,760
get in the car now.

570
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,410
This is...

571
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
You brat.

572
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,170
You bought one more new car?

573
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,890
Let's go, Zhou.

574
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,130
To the sea-view house.

575
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,130
Let's go.

576
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,970
I don't think so.

577
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,170
The car door.

578
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,610
I never saw it before.

579
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,690
So fancy.

580
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,000
Like a pair of duck wings.

581
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,410
It's all gull-wing doors.

582
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:24,890
It

583
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,890
is high-end and fancy.

584
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,450
But when parked in the parking lot,

585
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,690
it will have a car on this side,

586
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,480
and you can't open the door.

587
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,850
One car on this side,

588
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,760
and you can't get out of it.

589
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,850
Not practical at all.

590
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,450
I have a garage at my house.

591
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,650
Hear that?

592
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,970
It must be a villa.

593
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,280
How many bedrooms?

594
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,240
On the first floor,

595
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,520
one, two, three, four.

596
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,370
And on the second floor...

597
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,480
Tian, I'll go first.

598
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:56,890
Bye-bye.

599
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,520
Bye-bye.

600
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,890
Let's go.

601
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,040
What are you waiting for?

602
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:09,720
I...

603
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,520
Can't your boyfriend offer us,

604
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,240
your parents, a ride?

605
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,240
To the budget hotel on Mingzhi Road.

606
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,450
Poor environment there.

607
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,000
I booked an executive suite

608
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,890
at Coast Hotel.

609
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,610
You can eat well there.

610
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,210
Executive lounge, breakfast,

611
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,170
and afternoon tea.

612
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:30,970
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

613
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,210
I'll drive you there now.

614
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,650
No rush.

615
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,930
It's still early now.

616
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,930
We can drive around.

617
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,410
Yeah, just go for a drive.

618
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,690
Dad, what are you up to again?

619
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,280
Just drive around.

620
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,210
Then, Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

621
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,560
where do you want to go?

622
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,760
Any recommendation?

623
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,550
Night view on the mountain?

624
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm wearing high heels.

625
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,720
Not really convenient.

626
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,400
Walk along the beach?

627
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,240
Too windy.

628
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,280
I'll have a headache.

629
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,170
We're hoping for a cozy place.

630
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,890
We can sit,

631
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,210
and when we're sleepy,

632
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
we can just lie down

633
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,410
and sleep there.

634
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,450
We hope it will be an indoor place.

635
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,210
Indoor place.

636
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,890
Say it if you want to go to my place.

637
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,760
You don't have to keep dropping hints.

638
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,850
Yours is just a shabby house.

639
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,690
I've had enough
when video chatting with you.

640
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,930
I don't want to go there.

641
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:17,720
Then what...

642
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,720
What about my place?

643
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,230
You can see the sea there

644
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,210
and drink something.

645
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,480
Most importantly,

646
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,920
I have a massage armchair at home.

647
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,750
No way.

648
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,390
Chen is so considerate.

649
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,080
That's also what we want.

650
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,320
Let's go to Chen's place.

651
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,450
Yeah.

652
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,560
Gigi,

653
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,210
what do your parents do?

654
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,800
I think

655
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,520
they did foreign trade business.

656
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,970
I don't really remember.

657
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,320
Your parents must be really happy

658
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,970
to have a son and a daughter.

659
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,000
The boy is tall and handsome.

660
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,560
The girl is natural and graceful.

661
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,560
Mrs. Zhang,

662
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,370
you must be really happy too.

663
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,650
Zhang Hao is an excellent man.

664
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,480
Your mother

665
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,930
should be around my age.

666
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,970
No.

667
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,720
My mom is not this old.

668
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,240
Your mother

669
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,210
must be taking good care of her skin.

670
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,560
I'll ask her about skincare

671
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,280
if I get to meet with her.

672
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,410
Where are your parents now?

673
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,690
Wanshou Mountain.

674
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,170
So they've been living in the mountains

675
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,370
after retiring?

676
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,930
Maybe Hao can drive us

677
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,170
to visit them someday.

678
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,480
No need, Mrs. Zhang.

679
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,320
Wanshou Mountain Cemetery

680
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,610
is now being cleaned every day.

681
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,410
Your parents are...

682
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,610
Dead.

683
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,890
In a car crash.

684
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,280
Gigi,

685
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,520
you should get off.

686
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,040
What?

687
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,200
You said you left something

688
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,170
at the cafe.

689
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,130
It's near the cafe.

690
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,610
Go.

691
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,210
Call me when you get home.

692
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,760
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang.

693
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,480
Bye.

694
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,660
(Aegean Sea Stand-alone Villa)

695
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,320
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou, please.

696
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,610
How huge.

697
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,650
Is anyone home?

698
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,690
It's called the smart home.

699
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,760
This...

700
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,650
Dad, Mom,

701
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
you've seen his house.

702
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,450
Can we go now?

703
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,690
We just arrived.

704
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,970
We should sit down,

705
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,040
chat for a while,

706
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,480
and have some tea, right?

707
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,240
Yeah.

708
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,080
So fancy a house.

709
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,080
We gotta

710
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,130
have a close look at it.

711
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:38,930
Please,

712
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,560
feel free to look at whatever you want.

713
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,320
OK.

714
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,240
We'll have a look.

715
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Let's have a look.

716
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,280
Touch me again, and I'll punch you.

717
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,080
Dad, Mom, hurry.

718
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,970
And we can be back to the hotel to rest.

719
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,850
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

720
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,930
this side, please.

721
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,930
Mrs. Zhou, have some tea.

722
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,480
This cup is for Mr. Zhou.

723
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,480
How long have you two been together?

724
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,760
Over three months.

725
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,080
You're so capable.

726
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,690
What do you like about Tian?

727
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,210
She's smart and aspiring.

728
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,610
She doesn't follow the common template.

729
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:49,850
She

730
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,970
can surprise me every day.

731
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,450
(Now he's talking.)

732
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,930
Is she really that good?

733
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,040
But, in the future,

734
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,170
you'll have to give a lot of care

735
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,650
to look after her.

736
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,450
That's what I should do.

737
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,650
Mom,

738
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,080
where is my dad?

739
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,450
It's really late. We should go now.

740
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,760
He went to look around.

741
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,240
It's too huge a house.

742
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,170
Is he lost in the house?

743
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,240
He's an old man

744
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,130
who suffers from hypertension.

745
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,080
Go find him.

746
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,760
We don't want him

747
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,610
to get too excited and pass out

748
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,560
or whatnot.

749
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,210
Right?

750
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,000
Hurry. Go.

751
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,610
Don't be nervous. You don't have to.

752
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:35,930
Mrs. Zhou,

753
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,410
today,

754
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,130
Nian and I lost our composure

755
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,000
at the dinner table.

756
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,930
Sorry for that.

757
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,240
It's OK.

758
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,370
You two

759
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,370
are justicial and straightforward.

760
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,410
Especially Gigi.

761
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,080
She's so outspoken

762
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,850
and upright.

763
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,320
If one day Tian
becomes her sister-in-law,

764
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,850
I believe Gigi will help the right party

765
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,890
instead of the closer party

766
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,930
when you and Tian quarrel.

767
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:03,760
Nian

768
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,130
is a bit rash sometimes.

769
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,480
How...

770
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,170
How old are your parents?

771
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,610
My parents

772
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,370
died in a car crash

773
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,130
when I was 18.

774
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,930
Sorry.

775
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,720
I-I didn't mean to.

776
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,760
It's OK, Mrs. Zhou.

777
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,170
You need to know this.

778
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,370
I feel so sorry for them.

779
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,610
We haven't even met each other

780
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,560
before

781
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,800
they pass away.

782
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,320
Dad?

783
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,080
Dad?

784
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,130
Dad?

785
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:07,800
Dad?

786
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,410
Zhang.

787
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Do you see?

788
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,890
See this?

789
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,930
This is called a sea-view house.

790
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,520
(Listen carefully.)

791
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,760
(You can hear waves, right?)

792
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,040
(Hear that?)

793
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,520
(Even the bathroom)

794
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,970
(has a sea view.)

795
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,210
(See?)

796
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,210
Bro, you're so ill-informed.

797
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,240
Three bedrooms

798
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,210
mean nothing now. It's out of date.

799
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,450
Facing the sea
with spring flowers blossoming.

800
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,850
Dad?

801
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,800
(It can't be he passed out)

802
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,170
(because of hypertension.)

803
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,280
Dad?

804
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,370
Dad?

805
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,760
Wait a second.

806
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,410
Who is it?

807
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,720
What are you doing?

808
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,520
I...

809
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,720
I am trying to break in to save you.

810
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Save me?

811
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,280
Dad, what were you doing inside?

812
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,370
You scared me.

813
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,080
You didn't even respond to my call.

814
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,240
What else can I do inside the bathroom?

815
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,040
I'm old now.

816
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,410
It's normal for me to use more time.

817
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,210
It's late. Let's leave here now.

818
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,520
(Zhou,)

819

(what's yours is yours.)

(What's not won't be yours.)

(Tian is urging you to go home.)

822
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,240
Mr. Zhou, stay.

823
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,170
Stay as long as you like.

824
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,240
There are so many rooms here.

825
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,080
I don't have time for each of them.

826
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,650
I can't move

827
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,320
to a new bedroom every hour, right?

828
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,970
I won't have enough sleep this way.

829
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:58,930
Mr. Zhou,

830
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,610
maybe stay for a few days.

831
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,720
Each room a day.

832
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,800
This way,

833
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,320
you will have time for all of them.

834
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,720
Let's go downstairs later

835
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,760
to input your fingerprints

836
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,610
into the system.

837
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,970
Come at any time you want.

838
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,770
Zhang.

839
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,930
How's this?

840
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,450
What can I say?

841
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,810
You're the fox who doesn't get

842
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,890
any grapes.

843
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,930
I feel so sorry for you.

844
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,640
You can only stay

845
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,890
in Hao's small house these days.

846
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,480
You have no choice.

847
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,640
Unlike me. So many bedrooms.

848
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,450
I don't know which one to choose.

849
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,840
Bye.

850
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,340
(Call Ended by Another User)

851
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm just saying, OK?

852
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,680
I think your father

853
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:46,970
has a cute personality.

854
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,680
I'm sure we can get along well.

855
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,410
Don't flatter yourself.

856
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,120
I won't give your more chance

857
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,000
to brainwash them.

858
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,930
I'm taking them to the hotel now.

859
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,480
Wait.

860
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,120
You hear Zhou?

861
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,640
He sounded so excited.

862
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,600
Like a villain holding sway.

863
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,330
If Zhou Tian

864
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:11,970
was with someone

865
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,890
who was inferior to Hao,

866
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,520
would he show off now?

867
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,560
Zhou Tian

868
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,000
is indeed a good girl.

869
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,290
She deserves a good man.

870
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,890
Don't say that.

871
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,560
Dad, Mom.

872
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,890
Your son cut these for you.

873
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,000
I know

874
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,890
it was a bit of a surprise today.

875
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,160
But Tian and I

876
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,810
are really like family.

877
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,080
Nothing will work out between us.

878
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,330
You have to work on it

879
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,930
before something gets to work out.

880
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,410
Let me tell you the truth.

881
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,640
I told Zhou Tian how I felt.

882
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,810
But she turned me down.

883
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,640
I figured it out later.

884
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,930
The thing between us

885
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,850
is not love.

886
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm just used to having her.

887
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,080
Hao,

888
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,200
it's not like that.

889
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,480
It's not just about love.

890
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,810
The most important thing is that

891
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,730
you match each other.

892
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,330
What did you say?

893
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,560
No, I mean...

894
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,290
Dad,

895
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,810
I have always listened to you

896
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,770
since I was a child.

897
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,330
You arranged everything for me.

898
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,040
But this time, I want to choose myself.

899
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,410
OK.

900
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,480
I...

901
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,640
I won't force you or Tian, OK?

902
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,200
But the girl you showed us today.

903
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,160
She is so not the right one.

904
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,000
I'll focus on the worst part.

905
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,080
Chen is her biological brother.

906
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,120
At the dinner table,

907
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,450
she talked to him like that?

908
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,080
What a temper.

909
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,600
If you married her,

910
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,640
I'm sure she would bully you.

911
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,040
Right.

912
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,330
Hey. Are you smiling?

913
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
More smile?

914
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,890
That girl

915
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,730
is indeed indecent.

916
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,120
Especially when she talked
about her mom.

917
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:09,640
Yeah.

918
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,810
Her words made me

919
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,200
so uncomfortable.

920
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,410
Too straight.

921
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,410
Mom,

922
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,410
she grew up abroad.

923
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,370
The way she thinks and does things

924
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,040
is different from ours.

925
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,480
She's straight and frank.

926
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,160
But she's sincere with people.

927
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,410
I won't accept her.

928
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
I'm telling you. You have

929
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,000
to break up with her.

930
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,560
Dad.

931
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,680
I can't watch your ruin life.

932
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,970
This is my own thing.

933
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,290
Hao,

934
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,850
you can ignore his other opinion.

935
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,600
But I think you should accept

936
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,040
his opinion about this matter.

937
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,520
I know

938
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,810
what I'm doing.

939
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,810
I managed my training and competition

940
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,040
when I was on the sports team.

941
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,930
You used to stay out of it.

942
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,930
Now just keep out of it.

943
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,930
Wait.

944
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,080
Come. Let me tell you.

945
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,000
I've dug everything out.

946
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,850
He has a house and a car.

947
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,410
But there's one thing

948
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,370
I'm sorry about.

949
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,410
Both his parents are dead.

950
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,000
So,

951
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,370
in the future,

952
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,560
we have to look after

953
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,970
the two kids more.

954
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,640
But Chen

955
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,410
is tall and handsome.

956
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,520
Loyal and omnipotent.

957
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
Obedient and capable.

958
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,810
He doesn't smoke or drink,

959
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,120
and seldom hangs out with people.

960
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,330
No first love or romantic history.

961
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,560
No bad habits.

962
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,250
So reliable and can be trusted.
