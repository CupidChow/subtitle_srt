You didn't tell me

and watched me make a fool of myself.

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,410
After I knew your identity,

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,970
you followed me out
to give me an earful.

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
You listed my flaws.

You trampled and stomped

I still like you.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,290
Nothing was wrong with my confession!

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,320
It's called strategy.

43

Understand?

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,160
Haven't you ever seen a strategy before?

Everyone has flaws.

You didn't have to talk to me like that!

48

You're so arrogant and rude.

49
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,040
Has anyone ever taught you

50
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,720
how to be polite and respect others?

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,090
Calm down.

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,370
Don't be angry.

53
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,600
So rude!

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,570
I'm telling you,

55
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,640
if I ever chat with you again on WeChat,

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,160
I'll call myself the biggest fool alive!

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,010
Did you actually say that?

58
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,720
If I were her,

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,810
I would have slapped you.

60
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,410
Tian's temperament is good enough.

61
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,090
She didn't even beat you up.

62
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,410
But it was true!

63
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,410
Chen,

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,530
have you ever seen a man

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,290
confess to a woman

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,570
after listing all her flaws?

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,250
Then, as if he was unwilling,

68
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
he said,

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,880
"Even though you're full of flaws,"

70
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,090
"I still like you very much."

71
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,720
"You can kneel and thank me now."

72
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,880
Whatever you said to Tian

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,090
meant exactly the same.

74
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,880
Think about it!

75
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,480

76

you should properly

apologize to Tian.

79

What's wrong with this fish?

It's too greasy!

was it an adult pigeon

before you make it into a dish?

are those organic and pollution-free?

265
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,610
Did your chef graduate

No way.

Nice to meet you.

Sit.

He must be hungry.

Come on! Please eat.

277
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,850
Okay. Let's eat.

278
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,920
Try this. And this one.

279
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,640
It's tasty.

280
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,920
Waitress, the bill, please.

281
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,040
Hi, sir.

282
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,920
That will be 368 yuan in total.

283
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,970
Show me the ticket, please.

284
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,130
Well,

285
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,250
you see,

286
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,730
this meal costs 368 yuan.

287
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,450
This fish costs 88 yuan.

288
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,370
I didn't eat any of it,

289
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,370
so I need to subtract its price.

290
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,640
That will be 280 yuan in total.

291
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,370
This bowl of noodles costs 60 yuan.

292
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,090
But I only had a tiny bit of it,

293
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,330
and the three of you ate the rest.

294
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,610
I ate less than a quarter of that dish.

295
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,450
I guess,

296
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,490
I'll pay 10 yuan for it at most.

297
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,280
So, that will be 280 minus 60,

298
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,970
divided by four, then plus ten.

299
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,400
And... 65 yuan in total.

300
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,970
Do you want me to pay by WeChat

301
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,090
or cash?

302
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,160
This man

303
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,280
is the biggest miser I've ever seen!

304
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,250
No way.

305
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,330
Dad, Mom.

306
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,090
This is Xin Xin.

307
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,800
Nice to meet you.

308
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,610
What do you often do?

309
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,610
Me? I often hit the bar,

310
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,920
go to the nightclubs, and mess around!

311
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,850
Life is all

312
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,160
about partying and playing!

313
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,400
Xin Xin has a bubbly personality.

314
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,090
Are you sure you want

315
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,520
a playboy?

316
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,520
If...

317
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,160
I let him have a rehearsal in advance

318
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,760
and prepare some lines,

319
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,280
it should be fine.

320
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,730
Okay!

321
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,400
(Xin Xin)
I'll pick you!

322
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,280
A watch brand wants to invite Qiao Yi

323
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,210
to attend their event

324
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,160
and become one of their first guests
to experience their product.

325
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,680
They'll display Qiao Yi's photo

326
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,210
at every store nationwide.

327
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,090
However, Yi has been very busy recently.

328
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,160
He doesn't have enough time

329
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,280
to take a new photo.

330
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,040
Mr. Ji, what's wrong?

331
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm thirsty.

332
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,250
I'll get you some water.

333
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,800
No need.

334
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,520
I'll get it myself.

335
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,120
He doesn't need me anymore?

336
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,890
What?

337
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,730
Your parents forced you to get engaged?

338
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,890
Shush.

339
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,490
Calm down.

340
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,490
It's not like that.

341
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,040
(Pantry)
More or less.

342
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,840
Don't your parents

343
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,010
always want you and Zhang Hao
to be together?

344
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,840
Will they come over this weekend?

345
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,280
Are you prepared?

346
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,600
Of course!

347
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,970
I'll ask someone

348
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,490
to be my fake boyfriend.

349
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,890
They won't believe me

350
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,840
no matter what I say.

351
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,360
They always believe there is something

352
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,250
between Zhang Hao and me.

353
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,890
So, I decided to fool them.

354
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,210
Are your parents

355
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,650
easy to fool?

356
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,080
Of course not.

357
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,840
That's why I need a plan.

358
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,800
I've made a decision.

359
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,730
I want to take three days off

360
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,280
to go travel

361
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,520
with my fake boyfriend.

362
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,080
I'll take many photos

363
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,650
in case my parents ask me for proof.

364
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,650
This is a good plan!

365
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,800
By the way,

366
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,010
you can ask Mr. Ji for help.

367
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,320
The understanding between a couple

368
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,360
cannot be formed

369
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
within a short period.

370
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,890
It's a long-term thing.

371
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,930
You and Mr. Ji

372
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,520
have the advantage.

373
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,690
You've been working for a long,

374
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,690
so you know each other well.

375
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,600
You can also let him make it up to you

376
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,690
by giving him this opportunity.

377
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,930
You're so clever.

378
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:34,730
Of course.

379
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,040
Xia Chunqiu.

380
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,360
Did he bribe you

381
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,520
or bewitch you?

382
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,320
You must have lost your mind.

383
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,690
I...

384
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,970
Cancel all my schedules

385
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,040
of this week.

386
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:05,490
Mr. Ji.

387
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,930
I want to take three days off.

388
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,080
Our hands are full.

389
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,280
You can't take a day off
whenever you want.

390
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,600
You have to apply for it a week
in advance,

391
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,080
and fill out an application

392
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,210
in the OA system of the company.

393
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,280
You'll also need the permission

394
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,120
of your leader.

395
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,730
Don't you know?

396
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,320
I agree.

397
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,650
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

398
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,080
I finished the publicity proposal
of Qiao Yi's new book

399
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,650
and sent it to your email.

400
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,690
I'll be waiting for your comment.

401
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:33,930
Mr. Ji,

402
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,120
are you feeling unwell?

403
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,210
I'll make a reservation

404
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,410
with a respiratory physician.

405
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,690
Hey, Xin Xin.

406
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,080
Are you at the cat cafe?

407
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,490
I need to borrow you for a few days.

408
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,890
I'll see you soon,

409
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,120
and explain everything to you.

410
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:47,840
Okay!

411
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,410
What are you looking at?

412
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,690
Hello?

413
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,690
I'm looking at my girlfriend.

414
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,320
You're good.

415
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,520
I didn't even ask you,

416
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,760
and you already knew what I'm thinking.

417
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,410
You're good at this.

418
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,010
You should give me your blessing!

419
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,360
OK, bless you.

420
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,320
What do you need?

421
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,210
My parents are urging me to get married.

422
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,520
So I want to ask you

423
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
to be my fake boyfriend.

424
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,600
Please help me out.

425
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,930
Well...

426
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,970
Sorry.

427
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,520
It's too late.

428
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,970
Speak normally!

429
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,600
Well,

430
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,650
I did have a crush on you

431
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,520
at a particular moment.

432
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,760
But the past is the past.

433
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,520
I'm not asking you

434
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,120
to be my actual boyfriend.

435
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,450
I'm just asking you for help.

436
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,560
No, I can't.

437
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,600
My heart belongs to someone else.

438
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,250
I don't want to disappoint her.

439
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,250
You can...

440
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,650
You can ask Hao!

441
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,410
He can be your boyfriend.

442
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,520
No, he can't.

443
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,840
Zhang Hao

444
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,120
is my boyfriend now.

445
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,930
- What?
- What?

446
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,760
Ten-day couple?

447
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,210
If he still can't fall in love with me

448
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,120
after ten days,

449
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,170
I'll fail.

450
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,210
So,

451
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,650
this weekend,

452
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,840
Zhang Hao will take you

453
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,120
to meet his parents.

454
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,930
His parents?

455
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,280
Not only his parents,

456
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,170
mine as well.

457
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,760
They set a trap for us,

458
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,970
waiting for us to jump inside.

459
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,650
They set a trap

460
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
for you two?

461
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,930
Why? You're not their prey.

462
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,490
They want me to marry Hao.

463
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,360
Tian,

464
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,410
are you really going

465
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,690
to marry Zhang Hao?

466
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,490
Of course not!

467
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,520
However, this time,

468
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,280
the four of them will come together.

469
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,410
I have to be well-prepared.

470
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,490
I didn't expect

471
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,410
my dad to collaborate

472
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,250
with Uncle Zhang.

473
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,650
What do you mean?

474
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,010
Are they enemies?

475
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,010
For all these years,
my dad and Uncle Zhang

476
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,410
have been
competing with each other in secret.

477
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,010
Uncle Zhang was a section chief,

478
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,600
but my dad was a deputy section chief.

479
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,560
As a result,

480
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,280
my dad wasn't satisfied

481
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,410
of being a deputy,

482
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,730
so he accepted the buy-out offer

483
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,120
and returned home to build a farm.

484
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,120
Whenever they met,
they would jeer at each other.

485
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,360
Even so,

486
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,520
they still insist on you

487
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,760
being their daughter-in-law.

488
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,760
It seems

489
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,760
they really like you a lot.

490
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,970
Tian,

491
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,120
you won't surrender, will you?

492
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,320
Relax.

493
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,690
Hao is yours.

494
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,450
Xin Xin,

495
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,840
I need an answer right now.

496
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,800
Will you help me or not?

497
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,560
There are so many girls around.

498
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,560
I can always have another option.

499
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,600
Tian,

500
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,560
I'll give you another chance.

501
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,970
Don't let me down.

502
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,120
Otherwise,

503
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:14,970
we'll be broken.

504
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,210
I'll take that as a rejection.

505
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,320
Tian!

506
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,410
Don't go!

507
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,560
Why don't you ask me again?

508
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,170
Maybe I'll say yes this time!

509
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Come here.

510
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,360
Aren't we going to the airport?

511
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,760
Why should we go there?

512
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,120
Aren't you gonna take me

513
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,080
to travel around the world?

514
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,040
Is something wrong with your mind?

515
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,360
Then why did you ask me

516
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,490
to bring my clothes

517
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,520
for every season?

518
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,890
To take photos.

519
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,120
If I want to fake my relationship,

520
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,560
I'm gonna need some real photos.

521
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,760
I'm telling you,

522
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,210
my parents are hard to fool.

523
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:44,970
So,

524
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,840
today,

525
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,490
we'll go sightseeing

526
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,490
as a couple

527
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,600
and take photos together.

528
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,520
May I protest?

529
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,730
No, you may not.

530
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,410
Come on!

531
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,490
Here!

532
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,600
One, two, three.

533
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,010
Smile.

534
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,800
Okay.

535
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,250
Look at the camera.

536
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,250
One, two, three.

537
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,080
Perfect!

538
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,520
All done.

539
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:45,930
Hi,

540
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,080
your photos are ready.

541
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:47,730
Thanks.

542
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,560
No problem.

543
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,040
Tian,

544
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,170
I'm exhausted.

545
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,930
I don't want to take photos anymore.

546
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:56,840
Alright.

547
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,080
These are enough.

548
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,560
Let's go.

549
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,120
I can't.

550
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,690
I can't walk anymore.

551
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,360
I can carry you.

552
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:02,760
No need.

553
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,010
Can you say yes to my request?

554
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,120
What is it?

555
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,730
When we came in,

556
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,320
I saw an amusement park.

557
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,840
Can we go there together?

558
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,930
I love the carousel.

559
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,320
Yes, no problem.

560
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,760
This old perv.

561
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,600
He dared to follow me!

562
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,490
Come on, stop looking!

563
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
Come on!

564
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,250
Let's go to the amusement park!

565
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,360
Tian, look at the camera!

566
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,520
Hurry up!

567
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,120
Give me a "V"!

568
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,010
Let's take a photo of us kissing!

569
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,040
Give me a pose.

570
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,450
Please!

571
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,560
Come on.

572
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,690
Mr. Ji,

573
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,410
didn't we come out for work?

574
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,040
Why are we here?

575
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,690
That should be enough.

576
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,800
Are you done?

577
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,320
I've been helping you all day.

578
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,040
This place is my favorite.

579
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,520
You said you wanted

580
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,210
to improve our relationship

581
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,210
and deepen our understanding.

582
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,120
If you're so unwilling,

583
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,800
I can't guarantee my cooperation.

584
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,730
OK.

585
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,210
- Keep shooting.
- Come on.

586
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:54,970
Yeah!

587
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,760
What a boring ride.

588
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,360
Why is it popular?

589
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,520
Mr. Ji,

590
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,890
you don't understand.

591
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,730
Adults love carousel

592
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,320
because it has a special meaning.

593
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,280
Girls

594
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,320
enjoy the carousel

595
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,250
with their lovers

596
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,120
because during the ride

597
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,360
of circling around,

598
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,840
the view may be different,

599
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,890
the people around may come and go,

600
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,890
but the person next to you

601
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,840
is always the same.

602
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,520
However, the carousel

603
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,170
is the cruelest game in the world.

604
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,120
Chasing each other,

605
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,360
but there's always a distance
between them.

606
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,690
Pretty!

607
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,520
(Ji Chen?)

608
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,970
(This perv!)

609
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,760
(Did he follow me here?)

610
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,760
Zhou Tian.

611
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,760
Tian, look here!

612
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,970
This angle is perfect!

613
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,360
Here.

614
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
One more.

615
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,760
Hurry!

616
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,760
Let's go.

617
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,900
(Exit)

618
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,840
Mr. Ji? What happened?

619
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,520
Didn't you

620
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,410
come here to work?

621
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,170
But

622
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,450
why are you acting so weird?

623
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,010
I'm still

624
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,010
very confused.

625
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,600
Who are we hiding from?

626
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,560
Mr. Ji, what's wrong?

627
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,170
Thanks.

628
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,730
Thanks.

629
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,360
Bye.

630
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,040
Bye.

631
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,360
Don't eat it.

632
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,040
Why?

633
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,360
Let's take a photo first.

634
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,490
Again?

635
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Only one. Come on!

636
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,210
Hurry.

637
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:22,650
This way.

638
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,320
Here, look at the camera.

639
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,250
Three, two, one, cheese...

640
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,520
Hey!

641
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,970
S-Stop!

642
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,970
Here, wipe it.

643
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,650
Tian.

644
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,490
Look at my clothes!

645
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,650
How can I go
to a restaurant wearing this?

646
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,560
It's okay,

647
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,970
I will buy you another.

648
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,080
Don't be mad.

649
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,930
Let's go.

650
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,760
This brat

651
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,760
is so annoying.

652
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,890
Tian,

653
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,600
this crocodile is indeed following us.

654
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,760
Say it.

655
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,010
Why are you following us

656
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,210
like a thief?

657
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,800
I knew something was wrong.

658
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,690
Let me see who you are!

659
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,600
(It's you.)

660
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,040
Can you please

661
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,280
stop tangling me?

662
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,080
I am just

663
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,490
an ordinary girl.

664
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,080
Everything I do

665
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:40,890
cannot affect anything

666
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,760
in this world.

667
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,210
It never had,

668
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,320
and it never will.

669
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,250
You have a whole world of choices.

670
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,080
You can choose someone

671
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,040
who is prettier and smarter than me.

672
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,600
I'm not suitable for you.

673
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,930
I have countless flaws

674
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,970
and very few virtues.

675
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,080
Nevermind.

676
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,600
How can someone
understand the warmth of love

677
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,450
if his heart is cold?

678
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,080
Especially a crocodile like you.

679
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,410
You raised your head arrogantly

680
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,730
every single day,

681
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,010
waiting for your prey.

682
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,930
You wouldn't even shed a tear

683
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,490
when you devoured it.

684
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,840
And you even waited for the prey

685
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,120
to beg for your attack.

686
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:32,360
Didn't you?

687
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,210
You have determined to eat me alive,

688
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,320
haven't you?

689
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:41,840
Do it!

690
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,930
Do it!

691
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,010
What's wrong, Xin Xin?

692
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,520
I thought you were a sunflower,

693
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,520
but you are actually a cactus.

694
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,160
What's wrong with being a cactus?

695
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,410
Cactus can prevent radiation.

696
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,640
See?

697
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,240
There are too many thorns on you.

698
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,520
Thorns are good as well.

699
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,160
My thorns can protect me

700
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,770
and harm the bad guys.

701
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,850
No wonder you can't find a boyfriend

702
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,810
and even have to ask me for help.

703
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,850
Then will you help me or not?

704
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,720
I've already said yes.

705
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,370
Besides,

706
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,680
you took me to the carousel.

707
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,240
We're in the same boat now.

708
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,160
Good.

709
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:48,850
Well,

710
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,720
I'll see you then.

711
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,010
I'll text you the date

712
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,160
and the address.

713
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,640
No problem.

714
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,770
Mr. Ji!

715
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,450
Where have you been?

716
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,290
I've been looking for you.

717
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,450
I bought you water.

718
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,520
Mr. Ji, what's wrong?

719
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,080
Ji Chen.

720
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,010
You're an arrogant crocodile.

721
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,290
This... I...

722
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,600
Are you on the way?

723
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,330
Dad, Mom.

724
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,330
You don't need to worry

725
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,330
about my relationship with Zhou Tian.

726
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:04,720
Hello?

727
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:05,770
Hello?

728
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,680
Mom? Are you there?

729
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,930
Hello?

730
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,770
"My loved one"

731
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,200
"is my hero."

732
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,240
"I know"

733
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,240
"that someday,"

734
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,290
"he will marry me"

735
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,200
"under countless gazes,"

736
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,040
"wearing his gold and shining armor"

737
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,010
"while treading on seven-colored cloud."

738
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,770
"I knew how our story would begin,"

739
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,490
"but I didn't know how it would end."

740
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,140
[*The lines from "A Chinese Odyssey"]

741
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,770
Put away your sword.

742
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,640
Where's Xin Xin?

743
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,720
Tian took Xin Xin away

744
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,850
to be her fake boyfriend,

745
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,890
because her parents are coming.

746
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,720
Zhang Hao,

747
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,850
I have heard
your parents will come as well.

748
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,720
Can you take me to meet them?

749
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,200
I can be your girlfriend.

750
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,890
You?

751
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,600
Do you want to dress like this
and carry a sword?

752
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,290
Why?

753
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,080
You want to fight my parents?

754
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,890
Of course not!

755
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,890
Your parents will be happy for you

756
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,290
if you have found a fairy

757
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,680
as your girlfriend.

758
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,240
Besides,

759
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,200
I am very

760
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,080
diversified.

761
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,410
As long as you tell me

762
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,560
your parent's favourite type

763
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,200
of daughter-in-law,

764
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,200
I can dress myself up

765
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,450
according to their preferences.

766
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:26,850
Okay,

767
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:27,450
stop.

768
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,010
No way.

769
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,890
Zhang Hao,

770
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,010
how can you say no

771
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,490
- if you don't even try?
- No way.

772
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,490
You have to give more chances

773
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,680
to our relationship.

774
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:36,970
No way.

775
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,010
No! I can't!

776
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,850
Don't forget our deal!

777
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,560
We have ten days!

778
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,160
No way!

779
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,080
Absolutely no!

780
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,890
Zhang Hao, please!

781
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,600
Please!

782
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,810
Zhang Hao, please! I beg you.

783
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,810
Where on earth is Xin Xin?

784
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,010
He's gonna be late!

785
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,810
Why are you standing here?

786
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,410
My baby!

787
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,810
Come on, give me a hug!

788
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,810
Wow!

789
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,560
Dad, Mom.

790
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,520
Your clothes are

791
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,010
so fancy!

792
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:25,890
Fancy?

793
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:26,890
Really?

794
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,450
These are new!

795
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,410
Your dad said

796
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,370
we had to look fancier
than Hao's family.

797
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,120
Understand?

798
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,600
Seriously?

799
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,520
If others saw you,

800
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,490
they might think you would

801
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,290
go on a blind date.

802
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,560
You dummy girl.

803
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,850
But anyway, dad,

804
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,970
why do you want Zhang Hao and I

805
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,330
to be a couple

806
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,330
even you dislike Uncle Zhang so much?

807
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,810
If we actually get married,

808
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
you two will be related as well.

809
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,890
If you two become families,

810
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,970
your relationship
will become more troublesome.
