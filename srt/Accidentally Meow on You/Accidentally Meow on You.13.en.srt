As Qiao Yi's executive agent,

Mr. Ji wants you

the information trifles myself.

49
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,010
As the assistant of the president,

50
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,690
you must have more important jobs to do.

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,320
Since when did you

52
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,320
become this nice to me?

53
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,570

(That's my question.)

55

I, of course,

have no ulterior motive.

57
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,570
I'm just trying to work independently

58
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,640
to steel myself.

59
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,320
Since you want to steel yourself
so badly,

60
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
I'll make you fully in charge
of this matter.

Kevin,

62

I need you to go to the branch office

to do something for me.

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,370

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,250

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,690
meeting clients is always my...

68
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Don't come back if you don't arrive

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
at the branch office before 5 pm.

70
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,080
OK, I see, Mr. Ji.

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm on my way.

72
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:47,840
Get ready.

73
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,930
Let's start at 5 pm.

74
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,880
My dear Tian.

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,520
I heard it all.

76
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,320
Since you moved to this cubicle,

77
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,280
Mr. Ji

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,490
has valued you more and more.

79
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
He's now taking you
to meet a major client.

80
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,320
Tell me.

81
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,730
Did you use any magic on him?

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,250
If I really could

83
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,130
use magic,

84
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,440
I would make him forget me.

85
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,610
Meeting clients

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,010
sounds so knotty.

87
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,520
Maybe I'll have to drink.

88
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,520
You're right.

89
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,320
Our real estate clients

90
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,640
are all knotty.

91
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,010
I think it'll be a tough war

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
to handle them.

93
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,690
I see.

94
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,730
That's why he chose you over Kevin.

95
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,200
You're the gift.

96
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,880
Don't scare me.

97
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,320
I know

98
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,840
Mr. Ji is mean,

99
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,170
double-minded,

100
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,170
and a yandere.

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,370
But I don't think

102
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,690
he will sell out his female subordinates

103
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,440
for the sake of his purpose, right?

104
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,520
Won't he?

105
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,760
Will he?

106
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,810
He won't?

107
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,370
He will?

108
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,930
Just joking.

109
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,760
Maybe he won't.

110
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,760
Don't take my joke seriously.

111
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,520
Just go with Mr. Ji.

112
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,810
I believe you will come back

113
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,050
safe and sound.

114
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,640
Why do I feel that is a curse?

115
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,170
Xin Xin,

116
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,400
I have to go out.

117
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,640
Tian will go meet a client

118
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,280
with her boss.

119
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,930
She doesn't have time to pick up Qiuqiu.

120
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,010
So I need to help her.

121
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,250
Look after the shop.

122
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:32,960
Rest assured.

123
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,810
I think

124
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,810
Hao looks much better today.

125
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,960
He should be fine.

126
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,610
Guess what I said

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,520
is working now.

128
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,570
OK. I gotta go.

129
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,610
Bye.

130
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
It's not what you said worked.

131
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,610

you're finally here.

142
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,370
Let me introduce.

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,050
Mr. Wu from Tiansha Real Estate.

144
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,080
Mr. Wu,

145
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,640
this is the CEO

146

147
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,930
Ji Chen, Mr. Ji.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Ji.

149
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,320
You too, Mr. Wu.

150
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,520
This one

151
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,370
is Qiao Yi's executive agent, Zhou Tian.

152

Mr. Ji,

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
this is the first time we have met,

154
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,050
but I can tell you're a genius.

155
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,570
And Ms. Zhou,

156
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,960
you look so pretty and smart.

157
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,280
I can see

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,280
you must be a good helper.

159
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,080
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

160

So you're Zhou Tian.

I heard

Mr. Ji values you a lot.

166

Even Kevin is falling out of favor.

167
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,050
So promising.

168
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,050
I have faith in you.

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,640
Mr. Ji cultivated me well.

173
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,400
Come on.

174
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,080
It's our first meeting today.

175
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,280
We have to clink glasses.

176
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,010
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

177
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,640
Mr. Ji,

178
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,690
your body condition...

179
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,170
I cannot hold the liquor,

180
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,930
but Mr. Wu is very enthusiastic.

181
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,130
I have to drink one glass at least

182
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,170
to show my respect.

183
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,200
Cheers.

184
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,200
Nice.

185
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,130
I like you, Mr. Ji.

186
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,920
I'll just cut to the chase.

187
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,800
We studied the fiction competition plan.

188
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,730
Its fame and influence

189
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,450
are what matters most

190
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,610
to our Tiansha Real Estate.

191
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,970
I won't waste our time.

192
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,560
About the sponsorship,

193
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,490
I don't think

194
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,250
there will be a problem.

195
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,370
Mr. Wu is straight as I expected.

196
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,760
I hope we'll have a good time

197
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,680
working together.

198
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,330
Not just a good time.

199
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,280
Tiansha Real Estate

200
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:06,970
and Xing Yi,

201
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,850
this will be an alliance between giants.

202
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,250
This is a most welcome opportunity.

203
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,400
Yeah, an alliance between giants.

204
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,490
An alliance between giants.

(Kevin)

206
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,610
Sorry for this.

207
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,970
Work comes first.

208
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,450
Then I'll go answer this.

209
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,920
Please, Mr. Ji.

210
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,850
What a pleasant cooperation.

211
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,560
After Mr. Ji comes back,

212
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,490
let's get loaded today.

213
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Right. Come on.

214
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,520
Ms. Zhou,

215
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,680
let's click glasses?

216
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,490
Hello?

I knew it.

(Chen Qiming Invested)

227
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,160
Ms. Zhou, you can't drink this.

228
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,400
- Put it down.
- Don't you take it from me.

229
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,130
Zhou Tian.

230
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,850
- I'll drink this for Mr. Ji.
- Take care.

231
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,130
Don't. Don't drink this. Stop.

232
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,640
- Don't you take it from me.
- Zhou Tian.

233
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,850
Come down, Zhou Tian.

234

I have to drink this for Mr. Ji.

235
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,010
Enough.

236
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,130
Zhou Tian, come here.

237
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,210
What...

238
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:00,970
Mr. Ji,

239
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,450
you're finally back.

240
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,330
What...

241
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,920
What...

242
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,640
What happened?

243
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,330
"What happened?"

244
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,210
Ms. Zhou said you couldn't drink

245
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,970
and would drink for you.

246
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,280
She bottomed this up

247
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,280
in one gulp.

248
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,800
And she was so strong.

249
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,250
We couldn't even stop her.

250
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:13,970
I didn't know what she was...

251
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,250
Ji Chen, why did you bring her

252
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,160
instead of someone

253
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,010
who behaved even when drunk?

254
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,760
Look at her.

255
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
Zhou Tian behaves when drunk.

256
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:20,730
This is...

257
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,160
Come on. Let's drink more.

258
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,680
No. Don't drink more.

259
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,400
You can't drink more.

260
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:25,730
Mr. Chen,

261
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,250
Zhou Tian is mine.

262
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,210
She is diligent

263
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,330
and aspiring.

264
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,520
Also,

265
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,490
she won't abuse power for personal gain

266
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,760
and harm the interests of the company.

267
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:41,970
Ji,

268
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,640
what are you implying?

269
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,920
I have long heard

270
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,010
that Mr. Chen has a close relationship

271
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,010
with Tiansha Real Estate.

272
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,010
So I investigated
the shareholding structure.

273
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,130
If I'm right,

274
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,160
you're also

275
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
(Tiansha, Chen Qiming Invested)
a shareholder of Tiansha.

276
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,460
(Tiansha Chen Qiming Invested)

277
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,760
You investigated me.

278
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,680
If I didn't

279
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,010
and just sighed the contract,

280
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,560
I'm afraid Tiansha Real Estate

281
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,160
would make an issue of Qiao Yi.

282
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,490
Neither Qiao Yi himself

283
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,400
nor Xing Yi

284
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,450
will accept this kind of cooperation

285
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,610
that does not consider

286
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,970
long-term interests.

287
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,610
Chen, what's going on?

288
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,730
Can you handle this or not?

289
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,210
Not!

290
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:33,730
Mr. Ji,

291
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,010
we just need a sponsorship.

292
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,490
Also,

293
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,330
Mr. Wu will offer
tens of millions of money.

294
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,920
You shouldn't see the woods
for the trees.

295
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,920
Mr. Wu,

296
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,800
thanks for your trust.

297
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,970
Sorry for terminating our partnership.

298
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,450
Hey.

299
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,280
Zhou Tian, let's go.

300
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:49,920
Hey.

301
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,400
D-Don't go.

302
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,370
Let's drink more.

303
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:55,800
Wait.

304
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,450
Ji Chen,

305
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,680
you're being stupid.

306
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,210
You don't know what you're turning down.

307
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,520
If you can't finish the goal this year,

308
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,090
I promise you'll be fired!

309
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,520
Mr. Ji,

310
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,640
you really took me to the hotel.

311
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,760
Just like what Xia said.

312
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,560
You're not trying to sleep with me,
are you?

313
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,210
I have to call my mom

314
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,250
and ask for her opinion.

315
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,210
I only took you here

316
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,250
because you hit our ride away.

317
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,520
You shouldn't have drunk so much
if you couldn't drink.

318
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,400
Who told you I couldn't?

319
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,160
Why can't you trust me?

320
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,040
I'm telling you.

321
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,090
I knew

322
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,280
you were using working as an excuse

323
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,610
to abuse me! Am I right?

324
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,370
You can tell me if you don't believe

325
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,560
in my working ability.

326
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,680
You don't believe me.

327
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,160
Fine.

328
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,520
I'll drink more to make you believe it!

329
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,680
OK.

330
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,760
I now believe you.

331
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,680
Let me help you to bed.

332
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:14,970
Let's go.

333
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,850
My clothes are wet.

334
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,640
I need to undress before going to sleep.

335
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,640
Undress me.

336
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,210
Help me.

337
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,330
Hurry.

338
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,040
Take this off me.

339
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,520
Sleep now.

340
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,330
I'll get another room.

You devil!

407
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,280
Why did you slap me?

408
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,450
I did this for Sunday.

409
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,210
1003.

410

You're a pervert!

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,010
What do you mean?

412
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,040
You're Ji Chen's flunky!

413
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,170
You hid your identity

414
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,690
and lied to me for so long.

415
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,170
You tricked me into telling you

416
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,170
so many secrets.

417
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,170
Tell me!

418
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,930
Did you

419
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,760
sell me out to Ji Chen

420
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,970
and tell him everything?

421
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,650
You and that lunatic Ji Chen.

422
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,560
You two are

423
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,210
on the same team!

424
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,970
Flunky? Me?

425
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,730
Do you think 1003...

426
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:35,840
Kevin!

427
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,840
When Kevin went to give Qiuqiu a bath,

428
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,600
she must have seen him.

429
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,040
He's not 1003!

430
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:43,970
I don't believe you!

431
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,730
1003 and Ji Chen,

432
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,040
both of you are devils!

433
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,170
You all lied to me.

434
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,280
Forget it.

435
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,600
I won't reason with a drunk.

436
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,690
Go to sleep.

437
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,120
I'll be on the couch.

438
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:03,600
Call me if you need anything.

439
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,410
Don't go!

440
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,690
Qiuqiu, don't go. Stay with me.

441
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,730
So hot!

442
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,040
I'll get changed.

443
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,930
So hot...

444
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,320
Wait!

445
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,080
Zhou Tian!

446
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,970
Stop!

447
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,690
Qiuqiu, look!

448
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,010
Do you like my dance?

449
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,210
I'm telling you,

450
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,450
when I retired,

451
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,410
someone even asked me

452
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,010
to work as a personal trainer in a gym.

453
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,600
You?

454
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,280
A personal trainer?

455
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,600
How is it? How is my dance?

456
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:56,600
Qiuqiu,

457
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,410
tell me.

458
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,650
Am I cute?

459
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,520
Yes.

460
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,120
Zhou Tian,

461
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:15,890
I...

462
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,010
I always think you're cute.

463
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,450
I think,

464
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,080
I have fallen for you.

465
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
You like me?

466
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,560
Then let's dance together!

467
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,410
Now.

468
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,210
Ladies,

469
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,930
please give a warm welcome

470
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,250
to my boss, Zhang Hao.

471
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:56,840
And,

472
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,320
he's also a trail running athlete.

473
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,600
He usually enjoys

474
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,970
staying home

475
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,970
and barely comes out to have some fun.

476
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,890
Today,

477
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,930
he finally agreed to come over.

478
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,490
Let's have some fun!

479
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,080
Yeah!

480
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,730
Welcome!

481
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,520
Oh, you shouldn't have.

482
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,930
I have been bored recently,

483
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,040
so I wanted to come out to relax.

484
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,840
Enjoy yourselves
and don't worry about me.

485
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,250
Oh! An athlete!

486
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,450
We have something in common.

487
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,760
Here, try this.

488
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,970
No, no. Thanks.

489
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,650
He's shy.

490
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,120
This is Ms. Xiu,

491
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,410
the major shareholder of this bar.

492
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,010
She also has many gyms in her name.

493
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,490
Right?

494
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:22,970
That's true!

495
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,170
Go ahead! Don't mess this up.

496
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,360
Come on. It's just a small business!

497
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,280
Let's drink!

498
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,890
We have a chain now!

499
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,520
You're exactly my type!

500
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,970
Ms. Xiu. You're Ms. Xiu, right?

501
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes!

502
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,360
Calm down.

503
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,080
I...

504
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:40,450
It's okay.

505
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,730
I'll toast you.

506
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,840
I'm sorry!

507
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,840
It doesn't matter.

508
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,010
Darling?

509
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,730
No, darling!

510
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,040
How dare you flirt with my wife!

511
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,360
Darling, you misunderstood!

512
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,040
Nonsense!

513
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,730
He's groping you!

514
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,760
I didn't...

515
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,280
Go away!

516
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,450
You! Come with me!

517
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,120
Buddy! Hey!

518
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,010
We're just friends!

519
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,210
Get lost!

520
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,210
Come with me!

521
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,010
Wait! Darling, we're just...

522
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,730
Stay where you are!

523
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,490
You!

524
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,840
Let Zhang Hao go!

525
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,410
He's mine!

526
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,730
How dare you!

527
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,840
Uh... excuse me.

528
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,320
It's plastic.

529
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,560
Anyway, let him go!

530
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,320
I'm telling you,

531
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,360
since I'm here,

532
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,730
there will be blood.

533
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Either it's yours,

534
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,250
or Xin Xin's.

535
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,800
Why me?

536
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,320
Wait a second. Who are you?

537
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,170
How dare you talk to me like that

538
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,360
in this kind of place?

539
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,410
Come on!

540
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,120
No, darling!

541
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,890
Come at me!

542
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,010
Don't be rude to a girl.

543
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,840
Exactly!

544
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,410
You're just a loser

545
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,730
if you get physical with a girl.

546
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,280
If you're not,

547
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,040
you have to follow my rules.

548
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,410
And if you win my game,

549
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,010
you can do whatever you want to Xin Xin.

550
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,730
Oh, come on!

551
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,210
Why me again?

552
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,970
Shut up!

553
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,450
As you wish!

554
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,560
Come on!

555
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,520
Chug it!

556
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,760
I have never seen someone
so good at drinking.

557
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:39,730
Chug it!

558
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,760
Keep going!

559
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,520
Can't you defeat her?

560
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:42,970
He's gonna lose!

561
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,210
You dared to play my drinking game?

562
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,450
So naive!

563
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,080
Yeah!

564
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,970
Wow!

565
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,210
Impressive!

566
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,320
Nine.

567
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,320
Ten.

568
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:02,930
Eleven.

569
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,210
Twelve.

570
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,730
Don't stop!

571
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:10,930
Go on!

572
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,280
Keep practicing!

573
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,320
A personal training lesson is costly!

574
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,520
All right.

575
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,250
Go to sleep.

576
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm leaving.

577
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,970
Don't go!

578
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,840
You're not going anywhere.

579
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,320
Stay here.

580
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,520
Qiuqiu,

581
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,650
do you know?

582
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,650
I grew up

583
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,450
in a sports team.

584
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,970
I used to live in the dorm,

585
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,600
eating

586
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,410
and training together

587
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
with others.

588
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,040
But later,

589
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,800
I was injured,

590
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,600
so I retired

591
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,560
and left the sports team.

592
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,650
But, luckily,

593
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,120
I met you.

594
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,320
You always keep me company.

595
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,600
Right?

596
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,890
I thought...

597
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,120
I thought

598
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,170
my bad luck had finally disappeared.

599
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,410
I have you,

600
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,600
and I can tell my little secrets

601
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,650
to 1003.

602
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,600
Even that cold-blooded crocodile

603
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,690
has learned to care for me.

604
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,120
He protected me from the rain,

605
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,040
and he also helped me treat my wound.

606
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,320
What am I thinking?

607
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,410
I'm such a fool.

608
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,650
Now,

609
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,360
I have you by my side.

610
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,970
The two of us

611
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,800
can live together

612
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,170
forever,

613
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,840
can't we?

614
00:30:59,490 --> 00:30:59,890
Gigi,

615
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,450
how did you find me?

616
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,450
With a bit of help from Xin Xin,
of course.

617
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,600
He took you to that kind of place

618
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,410
and even posted it on his Moments.

619
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,080
I saw his post,

620
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,170
so I rushed over as soon as possible.

621
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:12,490
Otherwise,

622
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,010
who else would come and save you?

623
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,600
Xin Xin wanted

624
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,760
to take me out to relax,

625
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,890
so I thought it might be a good idea.

626
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,690
I didn't expect so much trouble.

627
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,250
I guess I'm not suitable
for that kind of place.

628
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,930
That's true.

629
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:26,650
It's a nightclub.

630
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,120
What else do you expect?

631
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,560
It might even harm your reputation
as a world champion.

632
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,250
Come on,

633
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,450
don't listen to Xin Xin's nonsense.

634
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,320
He probably advised you

635
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,800
not to give up the whole world
for one woman.

636
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,450
If you're interested

637
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,170
in those various

638
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,450
and complicated women,

639
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,520
I can act like all of them.

640
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,800
Act?

641
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,250
How do you want to act?

642
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,730
Whatever you want!

643
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,120
Anyway,

644
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,490
let's make a deal.

645
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,890
Give me ten days.

646
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,690
I guarantee

647
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,730
to make you get back on your feet.

648
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:56,450
Do you agree?

649
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,170
Please! Zhang Hao!

650
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,320
Please!

651
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:02,840
Please!

652
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,840
Okay! I know you're worried about me.

653
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,970
I can agree,

654
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,560
but you can't be as unreliable
as Xin Xin.

655
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,360
Okay?

656
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,410
No problem!

657
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,450
My tricks

658
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,410
are way better than his.

659
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,650
Let's go!

660
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,650
Last night...

661
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,170
Was I drunk?

662
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,800
Thank goodness.

663
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,450
(Your taxi will arrive
at a quarter past eight.)

664
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,890
(Don't be late.)

665
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,970
Nothing good comes after a hangover.

666
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,210
I can see that now!

667
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,520
Oh, no!

668
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,080
What's wrong?

669
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,770
You smell different.

670
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,450
Did you change your shower gel?

671
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,410
You didn't change your clothes.

672
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,520
Surprisingly,

673
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,330
Mr. Ji

674
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,680
didn't change his either.

675
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,810
And more surprisingly,

676
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,200
you two went out last night.

677
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,200
Did you...

678
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,720
Don't say nonsense.

679
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
I was drunk last night,

680
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,890
so I stayed in the hotel.

681
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,040
Nothing happened between us.

682
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:49,970
What?

683
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,720
A hotel?

684
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,640
You two

685
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,200
stayed in the same room

686
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,080
and did nothing?

687
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,370
Do you think I'll believe it?

688
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,560
Oh, dear!

689
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,160
My good friend stole my Prince Charming!

690
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,330
We were both hard workers,

691
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,720
but now
you're going to be the boss' wife!

692
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,450
You're still at work.

693
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,040
Be careful that Mr. Ji might

694
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,240
ask you to get your compensation
from the HR Department.

695
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:06,640
Xia,

696
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,370
your lips are a mess.

697
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
(You were busy yesterday.)

698
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,290
(Are you free to talk today?)

699
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,890
Okay, let's start working.

700
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,520
S-Sure!

701
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:32,720
Mr. Ji,

702
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,640
please sign this plan

703
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,600
for the award ceremony
of the fiction contest.

704
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,290
Xia, Xia!

705
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,720
Something's wrong.

706
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,560
What is it?

707
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,640
When Kevin was here,

708
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,160
I received a message from 1003.

709
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,120
However,

710
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,770
Kevin wasn't holding a phone.

711
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,810
Could it be that Kevin isn't 1003?

712
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,680
But, yesterday,

713
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,560
I saw Kevin.

714
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
He took Qiuqiu to the pet store.

715
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Well,

716
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,240
it was possible

717
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,490
that 1003 asked Kevin for help.

718
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,330
But Kevin hates cats.

719
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,850
It must be a request

720
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,490
from someone he couldn't resist.

721
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,490
- Mr. Ji!
- Mr. Ji!

722

723
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,970

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,410
(And also very unromantic.)

(A girl will never say yes to that.)

(Never!)

729
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,370
Wait.

730
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,370
Can this company do other designs

731
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,720
except for ceremonies and parties?

732
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,680
I think so.

733
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,370
Mr. Ji, you want...

734
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,240
It's my private matter,

735
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,200
you don't need to ask.

736
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,370
Later,

737
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,240
I'll send you the details.

738
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,200
Get it done within this week.

739
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,410
But...

740
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,410
Get out.

741
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,780
(Okay!)

742
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:30,930
Hey.

743
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,080
You're free now.

744
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,600
Yeah, I was busy.

745
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,720
I'm free at the moment.

746
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,410
How are you? Are you busy?

747
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,160
For now, no.

748
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,450
A few days ago,

749
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,890
you said we had a misunderstanding.

750
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,330
You wanted to explain. Right?

751
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,200
Yes.

752
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,120
Since we both have some spare time,

753
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,680
we can meet today

754
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,560
after work

755
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,930
and talk about it in person.

756
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,040
Don't hesitate.

757
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,120
You didn't come last time,

758
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,120
so you can make it up to me today.

759
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,160
But I have a dinner party tonight.

760
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,970
Tomorrow, then.

761
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:22,770
Tomorrow...

762
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,490
You said you were not busy.

763
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,450
Yes.

764
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
But just for now.

765
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,680
For this moment.

766
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,330
For this minute.

767
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:40,970
Fine.

768
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,450
Here you go.

769
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,330
Choose a date that you're okay with.
