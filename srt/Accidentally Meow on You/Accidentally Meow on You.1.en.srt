00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,500
Now, on behalf of Mr. Ji,

173
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,540
I'll announce
some latest decisions of our company.

174
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,820
Staff in the Cultural and
Creative Department, please stand up.

175
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,620
You are dismissed.

176
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,180
The department is dissolved now.

177
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,100
Why?

178
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,300
Why did he suddenly fire us?

179
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,140
Why?

180
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,580
How could I know the reason?

181
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,580
No one knows.

182
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,900
You can't do this.

183
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,460
It's the traditional business
of our company.

184
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,140
And it's irreplaceable.

185
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,260
Every single of them

186
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,660
means the fortune of our company.

187
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,580
A department that covers one third

188
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,420
of the company's operating costs,

189
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,420
but brings in no revenue,

190
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,740
I see no value of their being.

191
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,760
You are newly inaugurated.

192
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,820
You know nothing about our department

193
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,980
before you made the decision.

194
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
You affected the normal operation
of our company.

195
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,660
Can you take the responsibility?

196
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,980
Xing Yi is a group
that offers full service

197
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,220
to cultural and sports industry.

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,420
It's not irreplaceable.

199
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,340
This is the last year's revenue
of all the departments

200
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,260
(Employee Performance Appraisal)
and the performance of employees.

201
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,980
Based on the profit,

202
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,420
I set a passing line.

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,020
Whoever is above the line could stay.

204
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,260
On the contrary, one would be fired.

205
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,140
(Main Financial Situation
of Business Department)

206
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,620
Li Luxi,

207
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,180
you're also dismissed.

208
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,400
(The Notice of the Expulsion of Li Luxi,
Performance Dept)

209
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,740
I devoted myself to Xing Yi

210
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,900
all these years.

211
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,260
How could you expel me

212
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,140
on the basis
of a single year's performance?

213
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,500
How could you
build your prestige among staff?

214
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,180
If I hadn't considered

215
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,420
your contribution to our company,

216
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:36,820
(Business Contract)

217
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,860
the company
wouldn't have let you off so easily

218
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,260
after you offered private jobs

219
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,220
to Qiao Yi,

220
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,220
and feathered your nest.

221
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,180
Well, I'm afraid

222
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,940
the position of Xing Yi's CEO

223
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,780
will not necessarily be yours.

224
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,660
You'd better learn

225
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,860
how many actors in Xing Yi

226
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,220
were groomed by me.

227
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,140
If I leave,

228
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,780
do you think they'll stay here?

229
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,300
It's my problem if they refuse to stay.

230
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
But anyhow,

231
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,260
you cannot stay.

232
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,020
Just wait for the day
when you beg me to come back!

233
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,620
Let's continue.

234
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,940
Next,

235
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
staff of the Sports Division Department,

236
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,180
please stand up.

237
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,140
First,

238
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,140
as a long-distance athlete,

239
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,020
I think I have a better understanding
on the sports industry

240
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,980
and the athletes

241
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,580
than most of people.

242
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,020
Besides,

243
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,420
I love the sports industry.

244
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,780
The sports agent

245
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,780
is more than

246
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,460
a job to me,

247
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,020
but the continuation

248
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,220
of the sports industry.

249
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,860
At work,

250
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,420
I'm more active

251
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
than anyone else.

252
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,220
And my willpower
has reached a new height

253
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,780
over the years as an athlete.

254
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,340
Since the first day
I entered the sports school,

255
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,940
I was told that

256
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,540
the key point of the long-distance race
is not the speed,

257
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,380
nor endurance,

258
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,620
but the spirit
of insistence and challenge.

259
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,140
It doesn't just work on running,

260
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,940
but each industry,

261
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,060
and even the life.

262
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,140
(The comprehension from the experiences)

263
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,020
(is more important
than the superficial scores.)

(and to expand the market

(that few people care about.)

274

(I know my resume has little advantage)

(only wants)

(to hire someone)

(I'm not your perfect choice indeed.)

(Personal Resume)
(I'm not your perfect choice indeed.)

283
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,940
But if you want an employee

284
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,860
who has a strong sense of belonging,

285
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,580
and who treats the work as a career

286
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,860
and strives for the accomplishment,

287
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,420
I promise I'll be your best choice.

288
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,180
Ms. Zhou Tian?

289
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,820
Hello.

290
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,660
Our new CEO

291
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,860
made the latest decision

292
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,500
in the meeting just now

293
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,540
that the Sports Division Department
is dismissed.

294
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,620
So your interview

295
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,620
is canceled.

296
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,260
Cancel?

297
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,140
Does your CEO make decisions

298
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,700
that casually?

299
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,500
Then, why it was cancelled?

300
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,660
How about I have a word with him?

301
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Don't bother.

302
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,380
I still have something else to do.

303
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,260
Please excuse me.

304
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,620
Xia.

305

Hi, Zhou Tian.

306
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,540
Where are you?

307
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,260
(Outside the elevator.)

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,700
(I'm about to leave.)

309
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,580
(I know
you're in the middle of a meeting,)

(so I'm not gonna bother you.)

311
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,500
I was just informed that

312
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,300
due to the policy adjustment,

313
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,460
my interview was canceled.

314
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,820
I know. Wait.

315
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,220
I have a way to make you stay.

316
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,900
You want me to take the interview

317
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,340
in the Performance Department?

318
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,020
Get the offer,

319
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
and then apply

320
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,340
for internal position transfer.

321
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,580
Will it work?

322
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,740
Performance Department

323
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,300
is the best department in Xing Yi.

324
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,540
As long as you perform well enough,

325
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,660
once the company
offers the chance of position transfer,

326
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,500
you'll get a 100% possibility

327
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,500
to make it.

328
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,300
A kind reminder,

329
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,500
this is the only way out

330
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,300
for you now.

331
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,620
You do make a point.

332
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,940
But will it be troublesome

333
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,300
to deal with those actors?

334
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,620
Wake up.

335
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,420
You've left the athlete team.

336
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,940
That's how the society goes.

337
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,060
You could consider
to have your own corporation.

338
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,460
Otherwise, no job in the world

339
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,460

I give you a warm welcome

he dismissed the leader

As soon as he took office,

he dismissed the leader

Mr. Ji is asking for your resume.

Why don't you hand it over?

525
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,380
Give it to me.

Okay.

We haven't even had an interview yet.

Why have you decided not to hire me?

537
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,580
Mr. Ji is the biggest boss of Xing Yi.

538
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,650
Since that he said you can't be hired.

539
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,380
Then you can't be hired.

540

But that is just between us.

Xing Yi is a big company.

I don't think it's good

As for work experience,

I know
the people who have work experience

have an advantage.

it doesn't mean

I can't do it without experience.

A broker

just needs to associate with others

and can take care of others, right?

I can do all that.

Associate with others?
Take care of others?

Is that how you

define this job?

570

I may have been a little indiscreet

in my choice of words.

572

Let me reorganize my words.

573
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,820
I think

if they are the shining stars
in the crowd.

575
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,260
Then the broker

576

It seems that
you're really good at socializing.

Okay.

Well, let me tell you

of the cultural agency business.

Strain their nerves.

They are constantly confronted
with emergencies.

to solve the problem.

without paying any effort.

593
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,980
But we're the trainers

594
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,260
who train and push them

595
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,980
to the front.

596
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,300

598
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,500
Aren't they just

599
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,580
different interpretations

600
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,060
of the same thing?

601
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,780
Do you have to

602
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,220
be so elaborate?

603
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,180
If you're not 100 percent passionate,

don't go into this field.

happen to me?

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,700
However, why couldn't I win the lottery?

00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,860
I know.

646
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,100
It was my bad.

I scared him.

648
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,100
He's a CEO.

649
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,420
However,
he made it personal and revenged on me.

650
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,940
That was too inappropriate.

651
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,740
There are all kinds of people
in such a big world.

You don't need to be angry.

653

It's not worth

if you get ill because of anger.

655
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,620
It's better not to follow

such a boss.

657
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,020
You just stay

in Kitties' Fairyland.

659
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,060
You always want

to run a cat cafe, don't you?

661

I'll hand over the store to you.

forever.

667
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,980
I also want to try something

668

more challenging.

669
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,820
Why not?

670
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,300
I'll always have your back.

671
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,460

672
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,900
I want to do something

I know.

675
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,860
But you don't need to rush
to find a job.

676

Before you get a job,

677
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,460
you can always stay here.

678
