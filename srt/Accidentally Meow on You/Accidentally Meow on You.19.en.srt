you did something, actually.

Do you remember

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,330
that I logged

into your Weibo account

A few days ago,

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,810
I received a message.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,050
It's from a little girl, named Song.

29
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,650
She is ill in hospital.

30
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,930
She needs to receive
plenty of treatments every day.

31
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,160
Most of the time,

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,770
she is confined to bed.

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,750
She said

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,980
that she repeatedly read your book,

35
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,220
feeling that the treatments

36
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,470
were less tormenting.

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,910
Read this.

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,470
It's her message.

I think

you can go to the hospital

50
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,150
to visit this girl.

51
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,350
Yeah.

52
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,380
I'll go visit her now.

Now it's not a good time.

We have to work later.

Maybe after we finish the interview?

56
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,980
I'll accompany you.

do you have anything to say?

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,070
Sorry.

I can't face my fans on the stage

So,

68
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,380
I'll cancel the book launch

69
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,100

After so many things have happened,

Mr. Ji has to arrange future work.

The announcement has been released.

149
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,380
The lawyer has gone
to the police station

150

to meet with the relevant officers.

151
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,460
Qiao Yi left the launch on the spot.

152
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,900
He didn't even tell me.

153
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,070
Li Ang told me

154
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,260
that he was with Qiao Yi.

155
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,790
And I didn't have to worry.

156
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,870
He said he would talk to Qiao Yi

157
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,190
about the concert thing.

158
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,340
So I came back.

159
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,700
Do you want to go home to rest?

160
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,580
I can tell them

161
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,260
you haven't come back.

162
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,140
No need.

163
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,230
I'll join you at the meeting.

Let's go.

165

(Xing Yi Media)
You're working really hard. Very good.

167
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,260
But the biggest problem

168
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,430
is how we should tell the truth

169
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,750
to the public.

170
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,070
We have released

171
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,190
an official announcement,

172
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,110
yet the situation is not getting better.

173
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,820
That's how public opinion

174
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,630
flows now.

175
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,140
We have to take out solid evidence.

176
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,500
Yeah.

177
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,550
We need enough evidence

178
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,190
to prove that

179
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,070
we took the initiative to cut off
from Extreme Impala

180
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,140
before the incident happened.

181
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,750
Like

182
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,110
a lawyer's letter to them or whatnot.

183
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,260
A lawyer's letter?

184
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,630
Tian, what's wrong?

185
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,310
When I checked the gifts and letters

186
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,990
to Qiao Yi from his fans,

187
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,380
I saw Extreme Impala

188
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,110
using Yi's photos

189
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,380
as their publicity picture.

190
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,820
So I forwarded it to our attorney.

191
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,900
Did you seriously read

192
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,940
those letters from fans?

193
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,020
Yeah.

194
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,870
As his executive agent,

195
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,820
checking his fan letters,

196
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,750
choosing some to reply,

197
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,700
and collecting opinions,

198
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,220
these are what I should do, right?

199
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,430
You have done a good job!

200
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,790
Kevin,

201
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,220
call our attorney

202
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,030
to see if we have sent any letters

203
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,820
or released any announcements

204
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,700
about that picture.

205
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,070
OK. I'll call him right away.

206
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:53,980
OK.

207
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,430
Mr. Ji,

208
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,150
the attorney said
we released an announcement,

209
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,910
but he suggested

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,430
we find out the original letter.

211
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,310
Original letter.

212
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,030
Original.

213
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,340
I'll go find it.
You continue this meeting.

214
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,550
Zhou Tian.

215
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,580
What are you waiting for?

216
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,820
There are over ten thousand

217
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,740
fan letters.

218
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,030
Join her to find it.

219
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,310
You're not leaving until it's found.

220
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,740
This is so difficult.

221
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,220
I don't think I can do this
in my whole life.

222
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
Yi,

223
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,430
how can you write
such excellent stories?

224
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,190
Because I like it.

225
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,220
You can only achieve

226
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,820
when you like what you're doing.

227
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,070
That's also what my mom said.

228
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,790
Yi,

229
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,270
since you like writing so much,

230
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,740
why do you refuse
to launch the new book?

231
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,340
It's too complicated.

232
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,940
I don't think I can explain this

233
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,190
to you in a few words.

234
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,980
If you like my book,

235
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
I'll bring my new book

236
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,620
to you later.

237
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,980
But

238
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,910
I am not the only one

239
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,820
who's expecting your new book.

240
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,030
Every time

241
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,030
when you launch a new book,

242
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,030
your stories warm me

243
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,700
and so many others up.

244
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,670
Your stories

245
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,580
even moved my mom.

246
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,940
Am I right, Ang?

247
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,390
Totally.

248
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,790
Qiao Yi's story

249
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,910
can always bring light

250
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,070
to people

251
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,150
at their saddest

252
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,150
or worst moments.

253
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,790
The sunshine on a winter night?

254
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,740
Am I?

255
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,150
I didn't tell you

256
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,790
for fear that you might get too cocky.

257
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,150
When am I even cocky?

258
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,150
Totally nonsense.

259
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,310
I get it now.

260
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,270
I was being so self-willed

261
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,820
that I easily canceled the book launch.

262
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,190
Song,

263
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,740
you're right.

264
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,460
I will write

265
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,430
as long as there is one person

266
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,550
who can feel the warmth and sunshine

267
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,860
from the joys and sorrows of my books.

268
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,310
Which means you still will

269
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,700
launch the new book?

270
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,820
Of course.

271
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,860
And I'm turning the royalties

272
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,580
for copyright into a charity fund.

273
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,460
Thank you, Yi.

274
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,700
Thank you.

275
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,420

(Wait. His lips are too thin.)

291
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,940
What were you doing?

292
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,790
I was not doing anything.

293
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,030
Were you trying to steal a kiss?

294
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,670
Who would try to kiss you?

295
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,670
Nonsense.

296
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,820
We were so close.

297
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,430
You would have kissed me

298
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,910
if I opened my eyes one second later.

299
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,460
Y-You are not very clear

300
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,070
since you just woke up.

301
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,430
Go back to sleep.

302
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,190
♪Baby sleep, gently sleep♪

303
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,270
Stop.

304
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,910
I now know

305
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,270
why Qiuqiu can't sleep

306
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,580
at night.

307
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,070
Stop.

308
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,910
I have found it.

309
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,340
Then...

310
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,070
Where are the others?

311
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,310
It's basically settled.

312
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
They all went home.

313
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,220
So why are you here?

314
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,430
You were sleeping.

315
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,270
Where is Ms. Jiang?

316
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,940
Did she leave?

317
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,860
You seem

318
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,460
to care about her a lot.

319
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,390
What? Why?

320
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,070
It's just that

321
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,860
you two are really close.

322
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,100
You always come

323
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,790
and leave together.

324
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,620
It's just a question

325
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,940
out of curiosity.

326
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,340
Are you

327
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,700
jealous of her?

328
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,270
I said you are not clear.

329
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,580
Wait.

330
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,030
Jiang Hanyi and I
have known each other since childhood.

331
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,150
After my parents died,

332
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,980
half of my life

333
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,980
was spent at her home.

334
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,510
She

335
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,550
and her parents

336
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,820
treat Nian and me

337
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,390
like family.

338
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,580
So to me,

339
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,750
she is also a family.

340
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,860
She's like my other sister

341
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,100
besides Nian.

342
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,750
W-Why did you say these to me?

343
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,660
It has nothing to do with me.

344
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,470

I don't have to be good at everything.

515
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,380
All the professional matters

516
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,180
will be handled
by more professional employees.

517
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,230
Mr. Chen,

518
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,620
are you professional enough

519
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,030
to deal with everything?

520
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,180
Ji Chen.

521
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Any objection?

522
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,470
Since this is the group's decision,

523
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,510
I won't have any objection.

524
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,820
It is a group's decision, of course.

525
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,380
Okay. That's settled, then.

526
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,380
The meeting is over.

527
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,180
Please continue your work.

528
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,380
Thank you.

529
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,310
Are you serious?

530
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,030
It's better for me to become the CEO

531
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,790
than the others.

532
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,470
You're acting as if this company
is yours.

533
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,100
I...

534
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,030
You...

535
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,790
I help with your relationship,

536
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,180
and now I even have to worry

537
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,420
about your career.

538
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,070
How can you even say that?

539
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,140
You're so ungrateful.

540
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,340
I'm sad.

541
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,790
But, seriously,

542
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,180
how should we deal with this?

543
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,380
We should talk about it.

544
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,030
I do have

545
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,860
a plan.

546
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,420
But I need to borrow your authority.

547
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,660
I love it when you have a plan.

548
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,420
Please tell us, Mr. Ji.

549
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,990
Well, this incident

550
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,310
is not that complicated.

551
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,550
We can...

552
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,380
Mr. Ji is suspended!

553

I'm the CEO of Xing Yi.

I have to bear the consequence.

we have to find out the truth!

when Qiao Yi was in trouble?

Didn't you say during the meeting

that Mr. Ji still needs to assist

are you joking?

Do I look joking?

670

I have just been suspended.

672

You don't need to call me Mr. Ji.

673

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,750
Are you looking for Ji Chen?

686
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,030
But now,

687
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,340
I am the CEO.

688
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,620
It's not a joke.

689
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,340
Ji Chen has indeed been replaced.

690
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,270
I don't know you.

691
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,310
Bye.

692
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,990
Zhou Tian,

693
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,140
I read the announcement.

694
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,340
Ji Chen

695
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,470
has indeed been suspended.

696
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,580
You...

697
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,470
You...

698
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,390
You...

699
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,740
W-Why are you sitting here?

700
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,700
What's wrong?

701
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,870
What do you want?

702
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,300
I do want something.

703
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,700
I want to add a program
about my new book

704
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,430
to Li Ang's concert.

705
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,870
We decided to do charity together.

706
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,510
No problem.

707
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:28,580
But...

708
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,950
but you're not

709
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,740
the CEO anymore.

710
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,300
You're still my agent, though.

711
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,390
I can count on you, right?

712
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,180
Li Ang also works in our company.

713
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,950
It will benefit both of you

714
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,070
if you can attend his concert.

715
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,580
The company won't reject your request

716
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,740
even though I'm not the CEO.

717
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,580
Okay. That's settled, then.

718
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,430
Zhou Tian,

719
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,510
keep an eye on him.

720
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,950
Ji Chen

721
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,350
had a rather successful career.

722
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,470
He has never suffered

723
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,780
so much.

724
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,510
He might seem

725
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
very calm right now,

726
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,300
but his heart

727
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,580
is badly injured.

728
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,660
I know this kind of man

729
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,390
the best.

730
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,870
He does seem weird.

731
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,390
Bye.

732
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,180
Ji...

733
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,830
Ji Chen.

734
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,220
Do you want to go home and rest?

735
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,510
Remember what you said?

736
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,620
I need to stay here

737
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,660
before the truth comes out.

738
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,350
I can't leave.

739
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,350
Then go to investigate.

740
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,580
Don't just sit here

741
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,830
and throw paper airplanes.

742
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm not

743
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,740
the CEO anymore.

744
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,220
How can I find out the truth?

745
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,470
Besides,

746
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,550
I have never been this free

747
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,550
ever since I lied for a few months

748
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,070
as a baby after I was born.

749
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,140
Since you don't want to see me,

750
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,620
I'll leave right away.

751
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,550
I...

752
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,100
I didn't mean that.

753
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,140
What?

754
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,740
Chen is suspended?

755
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,180
Jiang Hanyi did this to him?

756
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,580
Huh! Jiang Hanyi!

757
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,620
I treated her as my family!

758
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,180
How could she do this to Chen?

759
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:42,990
I thought

760
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,300
she could be my sister-in-law!

761
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,180
I mean... in the past.

762
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,180
That's not important.

763
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,300
The point is,

764
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,390
Chen is so proud.

765
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,510
And this is so huge a blow.

766
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,870
Where is he?

767
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,510
This morning, I asked him

768
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,030
whether he wanted to go home and rest,

769
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,780
and I said he had nothing to do.

770
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,700
Then, he went home.

771
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,430
He must feel depressed

772
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,830
after you talked to him.

773
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,430
Chen is always a busy guy,

774
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,390
and he never allows himself to be free.

775
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,430
Yet you said he had nothing to do.

776
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,470
Will he commit suicide?

777
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,220
I don't think so.

778
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,220
He tries so hard to live a healthy life,

779
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,620
so he must be afraid of death.

780
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,660
But,

781
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,100
I think he's quite weird.

782
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,950
He seems

783
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,260
very normal,

784
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,550
but in fact,

785
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,620
he's deeply injured.

786
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,430
Nian called me just now.

787
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,070
She asked me

788
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,220
why I suspended you.

789
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,700
Zhou Tian must have told her.

790
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,660
That's exactly what I expected.

791
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,990
You're a professional in toying

792
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,220
with women's hearts.

793
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,510
You are the wise one.

794
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,780
You used me to suspend you,

795
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,830
so the mastermind behind it

796
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,620
will be off guard.

797
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,950
Then, you can clear them all.

798
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,700
As for me,

799
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,620
I can help improve your relationship

800
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,140
with Zhou Tian.

801
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,830
