ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,440
Madam.

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,120
You cannot hold your drink.

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,120
Do not drink any more.

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,440
Yet he said

6
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
she was the finest blessing
he ever gained.

7
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
So this is it.

8
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,280
I was never anything at all.

9
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,640
Madam, you are truly drunk.

10
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,440
Let me take you back to rest.

11
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,280
Madam.

12
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,800
When I was a child,

13
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,000
there were days so bitter
I could hardly breathe,

14
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,080
moments when I thought I could not go on.

15
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,080
So I found a place

16
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,040
and hid myself away.

17
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,520
I hid for a long time,

18
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,400
until

19
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
he appeared.

20
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,640
He took my hand

21
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,880
and told me not to fear.

22
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,760
You have been the light of my life.

23
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,480
I have lived my whole life for you.

24
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,920
Once, I wished to ask you:

25
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,480
back then, did you truly mean to save me,

26
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,880
or was I merely a piece on your board?

27
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,040
Did you want me to believe

28
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,000
that I owed you my life?

29
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
But tell me,

30
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,000
do I truly owe you anything?

31
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Do I truly owe you anything?

32
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
Xiao Huan, do I truly owe you anything?

33
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,360
Madam. Madam,

34
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,280
you are truly drunk.

35
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,320
Madam.

36
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,040
I no longer care.

37
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,880
Because the man who defiled my mother

38
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
held an identity so exalted
she could never speak it aloud.

39
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,040
They all said my mother was wanton,

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,000
that she betrayed
the late Emperor's trust.

41
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,000
They tied her to a stake

42
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
and burned her alive.

43
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,000
But whom did she truly betray?

44
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,000
LET ME BEAR THE HEIR OF HIS MAJESTY

45
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,760
My mother wrote a letter in her own blood.

46
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,640
By then, the late Emperor was gone.

47
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,520
Everyone wanted her dead.

48
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,920
So she wrote this blood letter

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,640
to prove who I was,

50
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,920
hoping I might live to grow up safely.

51
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,040
But she never knew

52
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
that my identity would be concealed.

53
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,240
It was you all

54
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,640
who ruined my mother,

55
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
ruined me,

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
and left us unable to speak a word.

57
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,840
What a fine imperial family.

58
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,680
Such overwhelming majesty you wield.

59
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
Madam,

60
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,160
you must not say another word.

61
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
Then tell me,

62
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,560
what right do you have to pretend
to be the righteous one?

63
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,920
Why did you deceive me
for more than ten years,

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,080
and make me give everything,
pouring my whole life into repaying you?

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,680
I am a princess as well.

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
What you are entitled to,

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
I am entitled to as well.

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Speak. Xiao Huan,

69
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,560
say something.

70
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,720
Can you not rise
and say at least one word?

71
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,200
Madam,

72
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
what is it you want me to say?

73
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,320
You are right.

74
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,960
No matter what you say,

75
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,200
there is no path back for us.

76
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,560
Aside from hating you,

77
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,800
I have no other road left to walk.

78
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
Xiao Huan,

79
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,520
for my mother's death,

80
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,040
I will have your Xiao clan repay it.

81
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,360
YAOQING HALL

82
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
Your Majesty, Your Majesty the Empress,

83
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,320
Vice Commander Lu has safely escorted
the Imperial Father-in-law to Fayun Temple

84
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,640
and settled him at Deer Courtyard.

85
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
Good.

86
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,440
See to his daily needs with utmost care,

87
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,600
and let no one else disturb him.

88
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,600
Yes.

89
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,760
My thanks, Your Majesty.

90
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,960
I only hope my father,

91
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
while living in seclusion,

92
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
may come to understand things clearly.

93
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,720
In due time, when all has settled,

94
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
you may still visit him.

95
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,680
Deer Courtyard is not far.

96
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,760
What do you mean?

97
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,880
Yesterday I overheard something
I should not have heard.

98
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
But rest assured, Madam.

99
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,840
I have already checked the area.

100
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,600
There were
no other palace servants present.

101
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,040
You are to keep my secret forever,

102
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,600
and yet why

103
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
did you not kill yourself?

104
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
Wait!

105
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,560
Though there may be
some measure of performance to it,

106
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,600
I am quite fond of this way

107
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
of showing loyalty.

108
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
Death will not be needed.

109
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,320
I called you here,

110
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,600
and drank myself senseless before you,

111
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,040
because I had already decided.

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
You are someone I can trust.

113
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,920
I have studied the art of reading hearts
with His Majesty for years.

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
A person's eyes

115
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,080
never lie.

116
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,600
Your eyes tell me

117
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,000
you would live for me, and die for me.

118
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,360
But what of it?

119
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,840
In the end, you will never obtain

120
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,320
my heart.

121
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,040
To die for the Imperial Preceptor

122
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
would be my greatest honor.

123
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,600
I do not want you dead.

124
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,680
I want you

125
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,240
to live well for my sake.

126
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,080
Your Majesty,

127
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,440
Your Majesty the Empress,

128
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
the Imperial Preceptor seeks audience.

129
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,640
See to your duties first.

130
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
I shall take my leave.

131
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
Your Majesty, blessings upon you.

132
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,680
WUYING HALL

133
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,680
Are you bringing medicine for His Majesty?

134
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,720
Indeed.

135
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,520
His Majesty's foundation
was gravely injured before,

136
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,840
and requires careful nurturing.

137
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,680
It has been some time.

138
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,280
You have grown much thinner.

139
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,200
Your Highness is radiant,

140
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,560
your elegance outshining pearls and jade.

141
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
I can only feel ashamed in your presence.

142
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,960
His Majesty awaits inside the hall.

143
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,080
Please proceed.

144
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,160
I respectfully see Your Highness off.

145
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,840
PURE AND SPOTLESS

146
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,520
Imperial Preceptor Du,
it has been quite some time.

147
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,160
Indeed.

148
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,720
I have not stepped into Wuying Hall
for one hundred and seventeen days.

149
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,080
Why do you come personally today
to deliver the medicine?

150
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,800
I have come first to deliver the medicine,

151
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,120
and second to report to Your Majesty

152
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,240
that I have thought things through.

153
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,280
Thought through what?

154
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
I acknowledge my faults.

155
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,120
What fault do you speak of?

156
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,080
My fault lies in overstepping,

157
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,360
in lacking restraint,
and knowing no limits.

158
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
Matters between
Your Majesty and Her Majesty

159
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,720
are, in the end, your household affairs.

160
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
Your Majesty is the Son of Heaven.

161
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
Though Your Majesty bears the world
in your heart,

162
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
you are still flesh and blood.

163
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,520
As for the Jiangzhou matter,

164
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,120
it was my narrow-mindedness.

165
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,480
You overstate it.

166
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,360
I should not have failed
Your Majesty's earnest expectations,

167
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,480
nor betrayed Your Majesty's trust.

168
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,200
Henceforth,

169
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
I shall abide strictly by my station,

170
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
and never again presume to judge
Your Majesty's family affairs.

171
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,200
In my eyes,

172
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,240
your sincerity matters
more than your remorse.

173
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,920
If it is sincerity His Majesty desires,
I have brought it.

174
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
Attend me. Present it.

175
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,200
GREAT QI WATERWORKS MAP

176
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,360
A waterworks map.

177
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,480
You are indeed talented.

178
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,400
Late summer and early autumn
in our dynasty often bring heavy floods.

179
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,440
Even this year's locust plague is tied
to the flooding.

180
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,800
I specially drafted this waterworks map

181
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
for the Ministry of Works to examine.

182
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,560
You even recorded
the tides of each passing year.

183
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,560
You have been most diligent.

184
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,560
Such matters should be addressed sooner
rather than later.

185
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,960
Tell me, what do this
year's celestial signs reveal?

186
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
Can we begin the works?

187
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,000
I thank Your Majesty
for granting me another chance.

188
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
I shall not disappoint Your Majesty.

189
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,120
In my heart,

190
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Du Tingxin will always be Du Tingxin,

191
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,960
meticulous in all you do.

192
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,200
Your Majesty speaks truly.

193
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,480
Whatever I set my mind to

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,720
is always done with utmost precision.

195
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,560
GREAT QI WATERWORKS MAP

196
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,080
SHUTONG HALL

197
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,080
Ying, look.

198
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,480
I have prepared something for you.

199
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,680
Your favorite dish.

200
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,600
Come.

201
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,080
Do not just stand there.
Eat while it is warm.

202
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,840
Qianqing,

203
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,760
tell me, are women with child
often without appetite,

204
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,880
unable to stomach food or tea,

205
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
and sleepless night after night?

206
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,400
It is possible.

207
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,560
Ying, why do you ask such a thing?

208
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,520
Qianqing, I am with child.

209
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,200
What… What did you say?

210
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,160
Whose is it?

211
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,640
Your Highness, you must not enter.

212
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,560
Your Highness!

213
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,839
Your Highness.

214
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
You beast!

215
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
- I will kill you!
- Stop!

216
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,560
You storm Wuying Hall without cause.

217
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,760
Xiao Qianqing.

218
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,920
You had best give me one reason
not to punish you.

219
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,960
Feng Wufu,

220
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,800
step out first. Close the doors.

221
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,440
- Go on.
- Yes.

222
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
Ying is innocent of the world.

223
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,800
This scoundrel dares bully her,

224
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,800
making her…

225
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Making her with child.

226
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,120
Impossible!

227
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,960
I have remained pure with the Princess.

228
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,880
How could she be with child?

229
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,840
You dare deny it?

230
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,120
She told me herself.

231
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,560
If not you, then who else?

232
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,920
- You must have taken advantage while…
- Enough.

233
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,800
Li Hongqing is not such a man.

234
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
Ying spoke it herself.

235
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,680
She is simple and honest by nature.

236
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,800
She would not lie.

237
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
If such a thing is true,

238
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
I am willing to offer my head.

239
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
SHUTONG HALL

240
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,400
Ying.

241
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,840
Ying. How is it?

242
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,640
The Imperial Physician said

243
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,600
I am not with child.

244
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,920
But Her Majesty said

245
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,240
that I have love-sickness.

246
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,080
Love-sickness?

247
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Ying,

248
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,280
go on.

249
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,920
Li Hongqing,

250
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,800
I have not seen you
for seven days and ten hours.

251
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,240
You have been on my mind ever since.

252
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,160
I cannot eat or drink at all.

253
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,960
Li Hongqing,

254
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,000
I like you.

255
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,960
I want to know,

256
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,200
do you like me?

257
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
What a pity.

258
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,560
My straightforward and adorable sister

259
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,680
ended up falling for
that blockhead Li Hongqing.

260
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,280
I am terrified.

261
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,000
I am unworthy of the Princess's regard.

262
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,280
Terrified,

263
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,640
and you still dare say you are terrified?

264
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,120
Qianqing,

265
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,320
he is the one I like.

266
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,880
I forbid you to bully him.

267
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
It came too suddenly.

268
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,160
Hongqing, go back and think it over first.

269
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,720
- There is no need to answer in haste.
- Yes.

270
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
It is all right if you do not like me now.

271
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
After all,

272
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,800
you will like me sooner or later.

273
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,360
If there is nothing else, Princess,

274
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,320
please allow me to withdraw.

275
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,440
Today, Ying did very well.

276
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,160
You were very brave.

277
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,680
Ying,

278
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,320
come. Let us go in and eat something.

279
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,600
He actually dared refuse my sister.

280
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,920
Your Majesty, will you not intervene?

281
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,880
So the Prince of Yuzhang means

282
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,080
you wish me
to grant a marriage on the spot?

283
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,680
Why not?

284
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,000
Is my sister unworthy of that fool?

285
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,760
A marriage must be of mutual affection.

286
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,240
You and I cannot force
others simply by status.

287
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
A forced match yields no joy.

288
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,080
Take care of yourself.

289
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,680
Yet what was once a forced match
between you and the Empress

290
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
now seems quite sweet.

291
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,440
Zhong Lin?

292
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Zhong Lin.

293
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,960
Zhong Lin.

294
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
Zhong Lin, it really is you.

295
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,280
I could not find you for days.

296
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,520
So you were hiding here.

297
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,480
Why did you come?

298
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,640
You still dare ask?

299
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,600
You shared my bed,
and now you start avoiding me.

300
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
If I hadn't come looking for you,

301
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
would you really never
have come to me, even till death?

302
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,320
What nonsense is that?
Who shared a bed with you?

303
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,720
I was drunk.

304
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,760
I remember nothing.

305
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,520
Fine.
So now you pretend ignorance, do you?

306
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,720
Stand still.

307
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,040
This is abandoning me
after leading me astray.

308
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
There was never a beginning.
How could I abandon anything?

309
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,760
Never a beginning?

310
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,920
Then all that happened between us…

311
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
none of it counts?

312
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,840
Zhong Lin. Zhong Lin,

313
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,160
help me. It hurts.

314
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,000
Stop acting.

315
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,680
I will not fall for it.

316
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,880
It truly hurts.

317
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,080
What is it?

318
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,840
What is it?

319
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,880
It bit me.

320
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
This is bad. You have been bitten
by a venomous scorpion.

321
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,720
It is the Nanyi venom-scorpion.

322
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,680
Fortunately, its venom is not fatal.

323
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
But its venom will cause hallucinations.

324
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,600
- Hallucinations?
- Enough.

325
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
I will take you to sit up ahead.

326
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,600
Come.

327
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,640
Zhong Lin…

328
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,760
Zhong Lin.

329
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,720
Zhong Lin,

330
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,760
I like you.

331
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,760
I… I want to marry you.

332
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,840
So fast.

333
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,240
This venom truly works well.

334
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Tell me,

335
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,520
do you like me too? Do you?

336
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,000
- Do you?
- Yes.

337
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,320
- Do you?
- Yes.

338
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,240
Yes.

339
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,880
I knew you liked me too.

340
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,640
You would never abandon me.

341
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,080
Right. I will not abandon you.

342
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,560
- And then?
- That is all.

343
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,960
You are unharmed.

344
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,040
I… I was never bitten at all.

345
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,880
You…

346
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,720
But everything I said just now was true.

347
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,640
Are you mad?

348
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,120
Zhong Lin, I am not mad.

349
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
I like you. I wish to marry you.

350
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,920
You admitted it just now.

351
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
You like me too.

352
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
You cannot deny it.

353
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,360
Do you know what kind of person I am?

354
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,600
Of course I know.

355
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,640
You saw it.

356
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I have survived
only by these crooked tricks.

357
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,600
Because I am of the Lingbi Sect.

358
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
So, Your Highness,

359
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,440
please do not make
such senseless jokes again.

360
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,520
I do not like it.

361
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,760
I was not jesting.

362
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,440
I was sincere.

363
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,560
You have already feigned death

364
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,120
and escaped the Lingbi Sect.

365
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,680
You are now under my protection.

366
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
It is useless.

367
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,920
From the day I joined the Lingbi Sect,

368
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,400
I was afflicted with Heartbane.

369
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,080
This poison has fused with my blood.

370
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,080
As long as the Heartbane Bell rings,

371
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,520
the poison will erupt.

372
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,280
I have tried hundreds of antidotes.

373
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,440
But this poison has no cure at all.

374
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,520
So, Xiao Qianqing,

375
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,800
I will live my entire life in fear.

376
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,120
Startled at the slightest sound,

377
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
haunted by shadows,

378
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
even the sound
of a copper bell terrifies me,

379
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,640
for fear the Heartbane may erupt.

380
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,160
This is the kind of person I am.

381
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,280
Someone like me,

382
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,920
would you still marry?

383
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,600
Do you truly feel nothing
for Princess Ying?

384
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,040
I am terrified.
I would never be presumptuous.

385
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,920
Set aside your terror.

386
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,360
Set aside her rank as Princess.

387
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,600
You, Li Hongqing,

388
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,680
toward Xiao Ying, do you truly feel
not even the slightest affection?

389
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,560
It seems even
you are not entirely certain.

390
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,160
My sister has a willful temper.

391
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,280
She loves and hates with extremity.

392
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,240
If you are uncertain,

393
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,480
you must not provoke her.

394
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
But if you are certain,

395
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,440
I have no objection.

396
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,520
I understand.

397
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,480
For now, I will not see Princess Ying.

398
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Not until I am certain of myself.

399
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,080
Good.

400
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,120
Mother, I wish to marry Zhong Lin.

401
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,400
I hope Mother will grant her blessing.

402
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,440
On ordinary days
you may fool around all you like,

403
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
but you must never marry Zhong Lin.

404
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
What if I insist?

405
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,040
Release me.

406
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,960
The Empress Dowager has heard
that Miss Zhong excels in calligraphy.

407
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
She has summoned you into the palace

408
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,000
to witness your skill.

409
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
<i>Summoning me into the palace?</i>

410
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
<i>It is clearly a scheme.</i>

411
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,920
My thanks for Her Majesty's favor.

412
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,960
However,

413
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,240
I was brought here too hastily.

414
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,320
I did not bring
my beloved Sanhua Purple-Haired Brush.

415
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,600
I shall return to retrieve it.

416
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,680
Sanhua Purple-Haired?

417
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,360
There is one here as well.

418
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
I have another quirk.

419
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
Before I put brush to paper,

420
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,560
I must drink two cups of
the Sangluo Wine I brew myself.

421
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,240
Unless Miss Zhong finishes
copying these scriptures,

422
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,360
this servant cannot allow you to leave.

423
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,840
Good aunt,

424
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,480
if the Prince of Yuzhang learns
that I have gone missing,

425
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,640
he will certainly come seeking me.

426
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,440
Can you bear the consequence?

427
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,320
The Prince of Yuzhang
is taking supper with the Empress Dowager.

428
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,040
He may remain in the palace tonight.

429
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,920
I fear

430
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,520
he will not be thinking of you.

431
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,520
Please proceed.

432
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,720
WRITING

433
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,400
Such petty tricks,

434
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,800
and you think you can deal with me?

435
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,080
Your Majesty.

436
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,400
Your Majesty, please spare me.

437
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,520
It was this woman.

438
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,640
She seduced me!

439
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,880
She is mine. You dare touch her?

440
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,480
Qing,

441
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,160
this vile woman

442
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,400
conducted indecent acts

443
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,000
in my own chambers,

444
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,400
yet you defend her?

445
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,360
Mother,

446
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,320
these palace ploys…

447
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,840
Are you certain you wish to use them
on your own son?

448
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,640
WUYING HALL

449
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,440
I seek to marry Zhong Lin

450
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,360
and beg Your Majesty
to grant the marriage.

451
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,600
PURE AND SPOTLESS

452
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,639
Xiao Qianqing, have you gone mad?

453
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,040
A woman of unknown origin,

454
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,000
with her virtue in doubt.

455
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,520
You would make her your princess?

456
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,280
Mother speaks ill of Zhong Lin,

457
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,920
yet do you know
that in the many times I was trapped,

458
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,120
my life hanging by a thread,

459
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,120
it was she who risked everything
again and again to save me.

460
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,360
There are countless fine women
in this world,

461
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,239
but in my heart,

462
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,920
none compare
to Zhong Lin's courage and loyalty.

463
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,239
Her devotion runs true.

464
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,400
In this lifetime,

465
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,800
I will marry no one but her.

466
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,280
I will never allow you to wed

467
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,920
a lowborn girl of the martial world.

468
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,880
Especially one

469
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,200
versed in crooked and unorthodox ways.
She is not a maiden of proper lineage.

470
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,000
Put this thought out of your mind.

471
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,800
The Empress Dowager speaks truly.

472
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,480
According to the rites of Great Qi,

473
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,920
Zhong Lin's status indeed forbids her
from becoming Princess of Yuzhang.

474
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,400
But Zhong Lin's heart is upright,

475
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,240
and she journeyed a thousand li
to resolve Xuzhou's plight.

476
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,640
She also retrieved Frost Blossom
with the Prince of Yuzhang,

477
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,440
which counts as service
in protecting the throne.

478
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,760
She deserves a reward.

479
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,840
Therefore,

480
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,720
today I decree

481
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,080
that Zhong Lin be granted the title
Princess of Ding'an,

482
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,520
and this shall be proclaimed to all.

483
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,600
Zhong Lin,

484
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,320
from this day on,

485
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,160
His Majesty and I are your family.

486
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,160
If anyone dares wrong you again,
causing you grievance,

487
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,120
we shall uphold justice for you.

488
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,480
I, Zhong Lin, thank Your Majesty

489
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,880
and Her Majesty the Empress.

490
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,080
Rise.

491
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,520
Zhong Lin,

492
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,360
as for you and the Prince of Yuzhang,

493
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,320
you need only follow your true heart.

494
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,200
I ask you,

495
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,760
are you willing to marry
the Prince of Yuzhang?

496
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,200
Your Majesty, I am willing.

497
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,080
Thank
Your Majesty for this marriage decree.

498
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,680
What is it?

499
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,680
Zhong Lin.

500
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,360
The marriage bestowed by
His Majesty and Her Majesty,

501
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,840
you agreed to it yourself.

502
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,400
You are not allowed to go back on it.

503
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,520
Xiao Qianqing.

504
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,840
- Are you serious about me?
- Of course.

505
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,400
You are not teasing you?

506
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,680
Then is it because you pity me?

507
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,920
Otherwise I truly cannot understand.

508
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,760
You are the Prince of Yuzhang,

509
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,600
noble in status, lacking in nothing.

510
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,720
How could you
possibly like someone like me?

511
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,720
What's wrong with liking you?

512
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,520
Zhong Lin.

513
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,280
I know.

514
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,200
You and I have both wandered without rest.

515
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,960
But now that we have each other,

516
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,600
our hearts can finally find peace
for the future.

517
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,320
<i>I do not care who you are.</i>

518
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,880
<i>I only want you to know</i>

519
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,440
<i>that to me, Xiao Qianqing,</i>
<i>you are the woman I love most.</i>

520
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,600
<i>I like you.</i>

521
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,720
<i>And I never once thought</i>
<i>I would be able to marry you.</i>

522
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,560
<i>I am truly very happy.</i>

523
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,800
Zhong Lin.

524
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,080
There is something
I have long wanted to ask you.

525
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,640
Why do you treat Ling Cangcang
differently from others?

526
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,040
Perhaps because

527
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,000
from childhood until now,

528
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,400
she was the only one
who ever wished to protect me.

529
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,320
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

530
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,880
<i>Today is your birthday.</i>

531
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,760
<i>I prepared a surprise for you.</i>

532
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,520
<i>Is it beautiful?</i>

533
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,400
They say a mountain spirit dwells
within this wishing tree.

534
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,400
As long as you make a wish,
it will come true.

535
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,040
Zhong Lin, hurry and make a wish.

536
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,360
I know I was wrong.

537
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,400
Do not hit me.

538
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,560
Do not hit me.

539
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,240
Zhong Lin.
I only wanted to give you a surprise.

540
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,280
Forgive me, Zhong Lin.

541
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,360
No, Cangcang.
I should be the one thanking you.

542
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,120
Cangcang. I want to make a wish.

543
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,480
All right. What is it?

544
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,600
I want to be your friend for life,

545
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,520
to treat each other sincerely,
never to part.

546
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,040
It is a promise.

547
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,920
Then today let us swear sisterhood.

548
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,880
Let this tree bear witness.

549
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,800
Very well.

550
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,560
Let the wishing tree bear witness.

551
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,520
Today,

552
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,200
- Ling Cangcang,
- Zhong Lin,

553
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,640
form a bond of sisterhood.

554
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,440
From this day on,

555
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,480
we shall share
blessings and hardships alike,

556
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,280
travel the ends of the earth together,

557
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,720
and never betray each other.

558
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,560
From then on,

559
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,400
we became sworn sisters,
inseparable ever since.

560
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,080
So she cut down all those bells for you,

561
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,200
without question.

562
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,240
Touched, aren't you?

563
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,600
I understand.

564
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,280
Commander Li.

565
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,400
Commander Li.

566
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,720
I saw the dark circles
under your eyes lately

567
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,160
and worried you were not sleeping well.

568
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,640
So I made this calming sachet for you.

569
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,560
It is a small token of my regard.

570
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,040
Commander Li, please accept it.

571
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,800
Do not accept it!

572
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,760
Your Highness.

573
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,960
Your Highness!

574
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,560
Is it because of her
that you do not like me?
