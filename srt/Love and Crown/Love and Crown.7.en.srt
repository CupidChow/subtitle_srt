ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,600
You scared me half to death!

3
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,039
I've been waiting for you forever.

4
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,080
Sneaking out of Linghe Hall
isn't that easy.

5
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,200
What are you drawing?

6
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,680
This is you?

7
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,960
Back in that fire, you got hit?

8
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,880
Want to see my scar?

9
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
It's on the back of my neck.

10
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,920
How did you get hurt?

11
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
I used to go play with him.

12
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,360
Him? Who is he?

13
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
- The Emperor?
- At his place,

14
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,880
there were all sorts of strange,
fun books.

15
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,920
He said they'd been left
by his late mother.

16
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Back then,
I actually liked being around him.

17
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,160
So later,

18
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,519
it was his place that caught fire?

19
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,440
Hurry!

20
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,400
- Quick!
- Coming!

21
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
- Hurry up!
- The water's here!

22
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,120
LULING HALL

23
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,760
Faster!

24
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,280
Huan!

25
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,400
- Your Highness, move now!
- Huan, don't go!

26
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,520
Huan, help me!

27
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,600
The fire was so huge.

28
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
They even saved all the crickets he kept.

29
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
But no one saved me.

30
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,160
He once told me

31
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,400
he'd take good care of me.

32
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,720
All liars deserve to die.

33
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Tell me,

34
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
am I right?

35
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,360
LULING HALL

36
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,960
<i>You were planted by Mother herself.</i>

37
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,280
<i>Now you've finally withered away</i>

38
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,640
<i>and left me too.</i>

39
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,760
SPIRIT TABLET OF EMPRESS HE OF GREAT QI

40
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,600
Mother,

41
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,640
I'm here to see you.

42
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,520
Your Majesty, something's wrong.

43
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,760
The Empress has fainted!

44
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,200
Why would the Empress
go to the cold palace?

45
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,760
Tonight, Her Majesty went out
for an appointment with someone.

46
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,200
She wouldn't allow us to follow.

47
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,560
I truly don't know
she went to the cold palace.

48
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,840
Please spare my life!

49
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,840
When did I ever say
I was going to kill you?

50
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,240
All of you, get up.

51
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,080
Your Majesty,

52
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,240
did the Empress

53
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,400
- run into Princess Ying?
- Yes.

54
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,600
She not only ran into her
but also fell right into her trap.

55
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Your Majesty,

56
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,000
your cold sickness
has been flaring up a lot lately.

57
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,000
Your health must come first.

58
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,919
Why don't you return
to the palace to rest?

59
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Here, I'll have the imperial physicians
and maids watch over Her Majesty.

60
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,280
It's fine. You may all withdraw.

61
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,360
- Understood.
- Understood.

62
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,600
<i>You've got that treasure</i>
<i>that drives out every poison,</i>

63
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
<i>so I can't poison you.</i>

64
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,520
<i>But you never saw this coming.</i>

65
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,200
<i>I can still use Puppet Incense on you.</i>

66
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,560
This is the famous Puppet Incense.

67
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,240
It's not easy to make.

68
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
This is the famous Puppet Incense.

69
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,240
It's not easy to make.

70
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,880
How interesting.

71
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,480
How interesting.

72
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,440
I must forget

73
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
that I came to the cold palace today.

74
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,720
I must forget
that I came to the cold palace today.

75
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,560
I hate Xiao Huan

76
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,720
to my very core.

77
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,680
I hate Xiao Huan

78
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,280
to my very core.

79
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,360
I will kill him with my own sword.

80
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,280
I will kill him

81
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,800
with my own sword.

82
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,480
Those who break their word

83
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,880
all deserve to die.

84
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,400
Those who break their word

85
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,640
all deserve to die.

86
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,720
I will kill him with my own sword.

87
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,480
Cangcang!

88
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,120
Those who break their word
all deserve to die.

89
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,400
<i>I will kill him with my own sword.</i>

90
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,600
<i>I hate Xiao Huan</i>

91
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,160
<i>to my very core.</i>

92
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
No!

93
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
<i>I will kill him with my own sword.</i>

94
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,320
Cangcang,

95
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,560
your heart has been struggling,

96
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,680
because deep down
you don't really want to kill me,

97
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,600
isn't that right?

98
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
I may hate him,

99
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,680
but I refuse to be anyone's puppet.

100
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,840
All of you, remember this.

101
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,280
Nothing happened at Linghe Hall
last night.

102
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,040
Understood.

103
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,520
Your Majesty,
Preceptor Du requests an audience.

104
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
She says it's an urgent matter.

105
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,080
Your Majesty?

106
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,360
When the Empress wakes up,
be careful with her right arm.

107
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,920
Understood.

108
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,960
So this time no needles, no medicine?

109
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,000
You're really that angry?

110
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,760
I will begin fasting from today

111
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,120
to pray for Your Majesty.

112
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,280
Your stomach is already weak.

113
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
Why put yourself through this?

114
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,240
If even Your Majesty
won't take care of yourself,

115
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,640
then,

116
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
I won't bother with myself either.

117
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,280
I've ordered Imperial Physician Li back.

118
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,720
So, I'll pull through this trial.

119
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,800
Your Majesty.

120
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,840
When Prince of Yuzhang was escorting
the officials into the Capital,

121
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,960
they were attacked by assassins.

122
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,240
But Prince of Yuzhang wrote
that he was prepared,

123
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,600
and not a single official was injured.

124
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,200
- Not a single one?
- Yes.

125
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,640
I'm afraid
that even if there were casualties,

126
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,840
he wouldn't dare let me know.

127
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,040
Besides,

128
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,080
the one accompanying him into the Capital
wasn't Shi Yan, but Zhong Lin.

129
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,560
She must be coming to see Cangcang, right?

130
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,640
It's fine.

131
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,960
It's about time
Cangcang saw an old friend.

132
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,800
WUYING HALL

133
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Preceptor Du.

134
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,560
Eunuch Feng.

135
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,960
May I ask

136
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,920
where His Majesty has just come back from?

137
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,560
Linghe Hall.

138
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,600
I can manage on my own. I'm fine.

139
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,960
His Majesty specifically instructed us
to be extra careful with your right arm.

140
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,880
So, please let me serve you.

141
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,000
Is His Majesty

142
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
all right?

143
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,560
His Majesty missed his medicine,

144
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,800
then spent his inner strength
purging the poison from you,

145
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
and even took a sword strike from you.

146
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,600
His condition is very serious.

147
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,880
Your Majesty, Preceptor Du barged in…

148
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,160
Du Tingxin of Nanrong Palace
pays respects to Your Majesty.

149
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
Rise, Preceptor Du.

150
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,720
Leave it to me.

151
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,680
Xiaoshan, you all may go.

152
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,520
- Got it.
- Got it.

153
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,480
You came in person.

154
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,320
Something major happened the day
before yesterday?

155
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,320
You were controlled
by Princess Ying's Puppet Incense

156
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,920
and tried to stab His Majesty.

157
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,600
But you dislocated your own arm

158
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,200
to keep His Majesty safe.

159
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,079
You came in person just to tell me this?

160
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,000
Your Majesty is perceptive.

161
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Then I won't hide anything.

162
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,560
Are you aware

163
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,319
of my background?

164
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,280
Please enlighten me.

165
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,360
I'm the former Preceptor's daughter,
not her disciple.

166
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
An Imperial Preceptor
was supposed to live a spotless life.

167
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,920
But she had an affair with another man
and secretly gave birth to me.

168
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,280
She raised me as her "disciple".

169
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,880
Later, when the truth came out,

170
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,560
my mother was forced
to burn herself alive to atone.

171
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,160
Her only wish was to keep me safe.

172
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,000
But the ministers

173
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,160
still wouldn't let it go.

174
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,920
<i>I was hiding in the shrine that day.</i>

175
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,240
<i>This girl</i>

176
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,880
<i>is an affront to Heaven and our ancestors.</i>

177
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,560
<i>She has no right to live.</i>

178
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,440
<i>She should be sacrificed to Heaven!</i>

179
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,760
Don't be afraid.

180
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,880
Today, I exercised my right to pardon.

181
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,400
From this day on,

182
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,720
you are the new Imperial Preceptor.

183
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,640
Why did my master

184
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,800
name the shrine "Nanrong Palace"?

185
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,400
Did she think

186
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,680
I was unwelcome to the world?

187
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,000
Even if the world rejects you,

188
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,040
you must fight to live.

189
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,520
The former Preceptor burned herself alive.

190
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Isn't this the very result she sought?

191
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,800
<i>That day, when His Majesty took my hand</i>

192
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,840
and led me out of Nanrong Palace,

193
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,480
I made up my mind

194
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,920
that my whole life
would belong to him alone.

195
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,200
If His Majesty can be
with the one he loves,

196
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,320
that is the greatest joy I could ask for.

197
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,680
You don't actually think

198
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,840
the one His Majesty loves is me, do you?

199
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,600
Why are you so certain it isn't?

200
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,040
Emperors are heartless.

201
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
In the end,

202
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
power is all he's ever valued.

203
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,040
I came here today

204
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,040
because the night before last,

205
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,640
you were under someone else's control,

206
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,600
yet you chose to injure yourself
rather than harm His Majesty.

207
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,680
I believe

208
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,400
Your Majesty

209
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,760
might truly care for him after all.

210
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,120
I beg Your Majesty
to give His Majesty a little trust.

211
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,720
If affection can grow between you,

212
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,080
then Nanrong Palace

213
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,000
will be Linghe Hall's most loyal ally.

214
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
And if I can't?

215
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,360
I should say no more.

216
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,360
Such words would be overstepping.

217
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,560
Your Majesty is still recovering,

218
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
so I will take my leave.

219
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,040
WUYING HALL

220
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,560
No…

221
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,520
Wufu,

222
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,240
where is Imperial Physician Li?

223
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,600
They say he'll arrive in the Capital
in about a day.

224
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,040
For the next seven days,

225
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
I will not hold morning court.

226
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,760
Announce to the outside world
that I'm recovering from illness.

227
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,920
No one is allowed to visit me.
Not even the Empress.

228
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

229
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,480
LING MANOR

230
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Are you sure everyone is dead,

231
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,960
including that Song Lanxi?

232
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,800
They should be.

233
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,840
What is that supposed to mean?

234
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,720
You knew Prince of Yuzhang
would keep them heavily guarded,

235
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,600
so besides ambushing the posthouse,

236
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
we also used Li Chengtian's name

237
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,920
to lure Song Lanxi out to kill him.

238
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,280
But in the end,
Prince of Yuzhang's men showed up.

239
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,560
Still, he was gravely wounded
and surely can't survive.

240
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,400
But Xiao Qianqing
has tightened security this time

241
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,960
and even bought so many injury salves.

242
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,480
What if Song Lanxi

243
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,720
didn't actually die?

244
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,920
Father,

245
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,400
I drove my sword through his chest myself.

246
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,760
I imagine Prince of Yuzhang
is just putting up a smokescreen.

247
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,040
This time His Majesty's illness
was severe,

248
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,480
yet he won't let anyone visit him.

249
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,800
All right.

250
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,720
I'll find another way
to find out the truth.

251
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,880
Go make arrangements right away.

252
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,800
Have Xu Feng and his men come see me
before the final exam.

253
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,840
Got it.

254
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
Your Majesty is still injured.

255
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,440
The night is getting colder and damper.

256
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,960
You should rest early.

257
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,560
If you're worried about His Majesty,
why not go visit him?

258
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,040
Who said I'm worried about him?

259
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,520
I just slept too much yesterday,

260
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,280
so now I can't fall asleep.

261
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,480
I heard from Wuying Hall

262
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,000
that Imperial Physician Li is back.

263
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,400
Imperial Physician Li?

264
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,880
He's a miracle physician the late Emperor
found out in the martial world.

265
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,800
He was brought in specifically
to treat His Majesty's cold poison.

266
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
Preceptor Du takes care of him
in the palace.

267
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,640
Imperial Physician Li

268
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,120
searches the martial world
for medicine for him.

269
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,360
This time they've brought Li back,

270
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
so it seems His Majesty's condition
is truly dangerous.

271
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,920
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

272
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
Your Majesty really won't go see him?

273
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,920
Physician Li, you still have
those miraculous healing hands.

274
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,320
Your medicine cures me in no time.

275
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,080
Cure you, my foot!

276
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,280
You brat, if you're so eager to die,

277
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,720
why drag me back in such a hurry?

278
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,560
- Physician Li!
- Keep quiet!

279
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm trying to think of a way!

280
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,600
Inside the palace,
is there a woman this brat actually likes,

281
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,200
one who also has inner strength?

282
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,400
To suppress your cold poison,

283
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,800
the medicine I'm using is blazing hot.

284
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,920
We need a woman of extreme yin
and softness to help.

285
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,360
Your Majesty, the Empress is here.

286
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,200
Send her back.

287
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,080
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

288
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,120
Let the Empress in!

289
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,280
Her Majesty arrives!

290
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,840
Your Majesty.

291
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,920
You're the right person!

292
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,640
That brat's already sick like that,

293
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,040
yet he straightens right up
the moment you walk in.

294
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,800
That means he likes you.

295
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,040
Let me just ask you one thing:

296
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,520
Are you going to save
that brat's life or not?

297
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
Physician Li was exaggerating.

298
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
It's not a life-or-death matter.

299
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
Either way,

300
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,320
I hurt you.

301
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,520
Xiao Ying dosed you with Puppet Incense.
It's not your fault.

302
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,960
I do hate you.

303
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,280
However,

304
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,640
I also don't want you
to just die without even knowing why.

305
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I don't like dragging things out.

306
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,240
Let's get through this first.

307
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,440
<i>I'm here with you. I'll protect you!</i>

308
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
Why did you kill my master?

309
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,440
I promised him

310
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,240
I wouldn't tell you.

311
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,400
What did you just say?

312
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,800
You can't tell me what?

313
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,360
You're awake.

314
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,320
Why am I sleeping here?

315
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,480
You're all right now?

316
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,360
Physician Li pulled me through.

317
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,640
My health
should be stable for a while now.

318
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,840
That's great!

319
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,880
If there's nothing else,

320
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,000
I'll be going now.

321
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,440
What's wrong?

322
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,240
You had your reasons?

323
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,920
What reasons?

324
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,120
You had your reasons

325
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,560
for killing my master?

326
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Why do you ask about that?

327
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,440
It's nothing.

328
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,000
I just think

329
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,080
even if the Bai Chifan I once knew
wore a thousand faces,

330
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,680
he couldn't possibly have

331
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,840
every single one of them be a lie.

332
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Right now,

333
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
come with me to the cold palace.

334
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,160
What?

335
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,480
Do you all know

336
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,760
what "cold palace" really means?

337
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Anyone not from Xuanguang Hall,
step forward.

338
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,120
If there's a single lie,
your whole clan will die!

339
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,840
Well then.

340
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,720
So you're all from Xuanguang Hall!

341
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,560
Bullying servants?

342
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,080
That's nothing to be proud of.

343
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,080
Xiao Huan!

344
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,880
These are all my favorite things.

345
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,560
How dare you destroy them!

346
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,400
If you dare lay a hand on my empress,
there's nothing I won't dare do.

347
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,400
- Li Hongqing!
- Here.

348
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,880
Throw all these bottles and jars

349
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,880
and the herbs and old books

350
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
into the courtyard to be burned!

351
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,640
Xiao Huan, don't you dare…

352
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,600
The Empress Dowager arrives!

353
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,560
Well, she's here at just the right time.

354
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Your Majesty, why are you here personally?

355
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,400
And, why are you rushing here
in such haste?

356
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,840
Governing the inner palace is my duty.

357
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,480
Your Majesty should not interfere
in the affairs of the inner palace.

358
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,480
I truly shouldn't have.

359
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,440
But the Princess used forbidden arts
on my empress.

360
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,840
That leaves me no choice.

361
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,440
As I see it,
the Empress is perfectly fine,

362
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,320
yet the Princess has been frightened.

363
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Such a great incident happened
in Linghe Hall,

364
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,920
and you knew nothing of it?

365
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,360
The Empress

366
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,159
was put under Puppet Incense.

367
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,239
Had she really killed me,
that would've pleased you, wouldn't it?

368
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,000
Please, quell your anger.

369
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,960
It was indeed my oversight in this matter.

370
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,320
I will certainly get to the bottom of it

371
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,400
and give the Empress an explanation.

372
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,719
If it truly was the Princess's doing,

373
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,120
I will by no means be lenient.

374
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,719
Aren't you tired?

375
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,480
You are already advanced in years,

376
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,600
yet still labor over the inner palace.

377
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,520
It's forgivable to overlook small matters,

378
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,679
but to blunder over major ones?

379
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,239
In my view,

380
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,679
the Phoenix Seal
might as well be handed to the Empress.

381
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,160
You're absolutely right.

382
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,440
Since the Princess used forbidden arts,
she indeed should be severely punished.

383
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,040
I ask you to make the final judgment.

384
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,240
All guards here are to be replaced.

385
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,560
The Princess
is not to leave the cold palace!

386
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,720
For the next ten days,
no lamps are to be lit!

387
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,920
I don't want this!

388
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,920
Qianqing! Qianqing, save me!

389
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Qianqing!

390
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,880
- The Princess isn't herself.
- Qianqing.

391
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,320
- Your Majesty…
- Qianqing, save me!

392
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,280
- Isn't this too cruel?
- Qianqing!

393
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,880
Qianqing, save me!

394
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,120
- I'm cruel?
- Qianqing!

395
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,320
Qianqing, save me…

396
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,960
- As for cruelty…
- Qianqing, save me.

397
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,920
I'm no match for you.

398
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,680
Don't forget

399
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,880
who really set the fire

400
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,080
that turned Xiao Ying into this.

401
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,160
Your Majesty,

402
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,840
please punish the Princess severely.

403
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,000
Since it's your request,

404
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,400
I'll do exactly as I just said.

405
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,200
You say you're afraid of the dark,

406
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,640
but Xiao Ying,

407
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,000
you've never truly seen real darkness.

408
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,600
You know what?
I have never owed you anything.

409
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,680
<i>Li Hongqing,</i>
<i>take charge of the cold palace.</i>

410
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,480
<i>From today on,</i>

411
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,600
<i>the Princess is to be guarded</i>
<i>by the Imperial Guards.</i>

412
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,320
My dear, have you gone soft?

413
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,840
So in this deep palace,

414
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,680
the bond between siblings
and the love between mother and daughter

415
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,480
all end up like this.

416
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,000
Today I've seen

417
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,920
your ruthless side.

418
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,000
Your Majesty,

419
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,520
I dare not ask for much.

420
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,960
I only ask

421
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,400
that for the sake of saving you yesterday,

422
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,920
you allow me to leave the palace once.

423
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,720
Very well, I grant it.

424
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,800
As for what happened at Wuying Hall
last night,

425
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,920
I hope you won't mention it to anyone.

426
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,520
All you need to know

427
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,960
is that my illness is severe,
and hard to recover from.

428
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,120
All right.

429
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,400
WUYING HALL

430
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,680
Say whatever you want to say.

431
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,960
Don't hold anything back.

432
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,600
Then I'll be blunt.

433
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,080
This cold sickness of yours

434
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,960
has only been temporarily suppressed.

435
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,760
I knew it! You missed the key point.

436
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,800
It's only temporary!

437
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,760
If you keep wearing yourself out
like this,

438
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,440
even a great immortal
wouldn't be able to save your little life!

439
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,280
Physician Li,
surely you won't abandon me, right?

440
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,440
You brat, always clinging to me!

441
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,360
You're that certain
I can actually cure your cold sickness?

442
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,400
Physician Li,

443
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,520
you've found a new prescription,
haven't you?

444
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,240
In an ancient text,
I found a herb called Frost Reed.

445
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,280
It grows in the southwest.

446
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,080
When it blooms,
its roots fall into a false death.

447
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,080
They need thirty-six years
to revive and bloom again.

448
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,520
It takes thirty-six years
for a single flower to bloom!

449
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,520
A bizarre flower like that
must be hard to get, right?

450
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,960
That's none of your concern.

451
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,840
All these years, I've been roaming
the martial world searching for it.

452
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Recently,

453
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,280
my people sent back good news.

454
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,920
It seems they've found the flower.

455
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,280
If we can actually get our hands on it,

456
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,520
my prescription will finally be complete.

457
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,640
Then I'd have about
a seventy percent chance

458
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,920
of curing your cold sickness.

459
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,800
Good.

460
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,080
Then, I'll leave it to you.

461
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,360
I might just scrape by

462
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,840
for a few more years.

463
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,720
If you keep acting like this,

464
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,960
my life will get shortened instead!

465
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,960
With your skill and kindness,
you'll live long for sure.

466
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,520
If I make it over a hundred days,

467
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,920
that'll already be a miracle
from my ancestors.

468
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,040
You little brat!
Sometimes I really want to…

469
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,160
Hongqing.

470
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,960
Tomorrow, escort the Empress
to the Summer Palace to escape the heat.

471
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,800
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'll make the arrangements at once.

472
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,600
After you've seen her out of the Capital,
come straight back to the palace.

473
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,520
You don't need to worry about her.

474
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,360
A lot happened today. I forgot to ask:

475
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,280
Has Prince of Yuzhang arrived
in the Capital?

476
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,040
Your Majesty,

477
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,960
Prince of Yuzhang requests an audience.
He's waiting outside.

478
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,200
Speak of him, and here he comes.

479
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,560
I won't see him. Send him back.

480
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,280
<i>I heard that this time,</i>

482
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,240
Princess Ying drugged the Empress
and even forced her

483
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,000
to wound His Majesty.

484
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,800
Only then did His Majesty get angry
and punish Princess Ying.

485
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Ying may be at fault,

486
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,160
but he knows she's terrified of the dark.

487
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,680
Why sentence her to ten days
without a single lamp?

488
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,360
WUYING HALL

489
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,000
Your Highness,

490
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,200
His Majesty is unwell today

491
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,560
and has already retired.

492
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,040
Please come pay your respects another day.

493
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Got it. Thank you, Eunuch Feng.

494
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,280
<i>After so long apart,</i>

495
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,400
<i>he really has prepared</i>
<i>quite the homecoming gift.</i>

496
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,440
LINGHE HALL
