00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,240
LOVE & CROWN

2
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 4

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We have an invitation.

5
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,800
Please, go upstairs
to the Green Haitang Chamber.

6
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,480
This young lady is a distinguished guest.

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,600
Let her in.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
Please come with me.

9
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,200
Let's go.

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,440
Master, why did you let her in?

11
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,880
Willow and haitang blossoms.

12
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,720
She's one of us.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Look.

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,200
Sorry for the long wait.

15
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,200
The highlight of our show today
will begin soon.

16
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,640
You who come to this pleasure boat
must have already known the rules here.

17
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
A blind auction.

18
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,040
You each have three
haitang flowers on your table,

19
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
representing three bidding chances.

20
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,080
But let me put out a disclaimer now.

21
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,360
If you bid but fail to pay,

22
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,160
you'll be fed to the fish.

23
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,720
- What are we bidding for today?
- I wonder.

24
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Allow me to start the bid.

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,560
My starting price is 100 liang.

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,720
200 liang.

27
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,400
How can we bid when we don't know
what it is?

28
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
400 liang.

29
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,640
400 liang already? This soon?

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,520
Mr. Niu offers 400 liang.

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Do I hear a higher bid?

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,640
3,000 liang.

33
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,040
- 3,000?
- 3,000?

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
Are you out of your mind?

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,120
How generous of this gentleman.

36
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,360
3,000 liang.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,720
Any higher bids?

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,880
5,000 liang.

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,560
5,000 liang?

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,760
5,000 liang?

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
That's not fair.
He didn't throw the flower.

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,920
Patience, my esteemed guest.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,120
Guests on the second floor,
in the Golden Haitang Chamber

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
have special privileges,

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,280
but they all have only three chances
as well.

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
6,000 liang.

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,600
- 8,000 liang.
- 8,000 liang?

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,120
Enough is enough. Stop it.

49
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
What if they feed you to the fish?

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
Did you hear me?

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,960
Two fluorite night pearls.

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,000
Two fluorite night pearls.

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Fluorite night pearls.

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,240
What an elucidating experience.

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,320
<i>That spoiled brat.</i>

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,880
What exquisite fluorite night pearls.
Fine tributes from the Western Sea.

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,840
May I know where you hail from, Mr. Bai?

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,360
This is just a transaction.

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,680
Outside of this pleasure boat,
we're both strangers.

60
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
Right. I agree.

61
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,320
I wonder what it is
that my husband spent a fortune

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,280
to purchase.

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
When can we get it?

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,120
You're so impatient, Miss. Come with me.

65
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,000
After you.

66
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Wait for me here.

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,320
I'd like to see a friend.

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,120
A friend? Who?

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,040
You're alone.

70
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,240
Oh, my dear brother. Are you worried

71
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,160
that I might feel lonely,

72
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,360
so you came to have
a heart-to-heart talk with me?

73
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,920
Someone tried to kill me when you learned

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,880
that I joined Fenglai Pavilion.

75
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,800
As my only brother,

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,240
you sure want me dead.

77
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,720
You think I tried to kill you?

78
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,720
Are you implying

79
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
that it was
your mother who wanted me dead,

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
and you had no idea at all?

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,560
Just like all the times before,

82
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,480
it's always your mother who wants me dead,

83
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,520
not you.

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Will you believe me if
I say I have nothing to do with it?

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Whether it's your or your mother's doing,

86
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,240
it makes no difference.

87
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,360
Right.

88
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,480
You lured me to Botang Pleasure Boat.

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,640
What if I kill you right now?

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,520
Can you kill me though?

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
I can try.

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
I don't have time for a spar right now.

93
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,480
Many kids on this boat are waiting
to be rescued.

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,880
Drop your act.

95
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,080
You forsook moral
principles for the throne.

96
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,320
A human life is nothing in your eyes,

97
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,360
let alone the lives of those kids.

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,600
You only care about ruling Great Qi.

99
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,680
Yes.

100
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,120
I do care about our empire

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,240
but I care more about
the lives of my subjects.

102
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,400
Even if it's just one person,

103
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
that person is still
a citizen of Great Qi.

104
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,320
You're still
the sanctimonious Xiao Huan I know.

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,360
You again?

106
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,240
Why do you two always
fight when you see each other?

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,520
I told you to wait for me there.

108
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
I…

109
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
We have to pick the goods.

110
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
They are here. Help yourself.

111
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Are these murder thralls?

112
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,200
Keen eyes, Mister.

113
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,600
They are stone men.

114
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,880
They are invincible and feel no pain,

115
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,200
perfect for a killing machine.

116
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,320
It's hard to make one,

117
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,360
and that's why it's expensive.

118
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,320
We only have 10 minutes to save them.

119
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,640
After 10 minutes,

120
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,360
Prince of Yuzhang will surround the boat.

121
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,400
None of the passengers
will be able to escape.

122
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,600
We want this one.

123
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Wise choice.

124
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,920
There are small boats behind the boat.

125
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,040
Someone will pick you up there.

126
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,120
Protect yourself and take the kids away.

127
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,200
Run!

128
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,200
- Here.
- Mother!

129
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,120
Careful.

130
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Careful.

131
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,520
Here.

132
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
Come.

133
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Take the kids away first.

134
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll save Bai.

135
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,200
Why did you return?

136
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,360
We fight together.

137
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
Who are you?

138
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,280
It doesn't matter.

139
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,600
What you need to know

140
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,040
is that he is not for you to kill.

141
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,240
It's too late.

142
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,320
Surrender yourself now.

143
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,680
You came nonetheless.

144
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,880
It is my feudal land.

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,360
If someone wants to commit
an atrocious crime on my land,

146
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,400
they'll have to get through me,
Prince of Yuzhang.

147
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Enemy vessels are
three zhang away from our boat.

148
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,360
The boat must be destroyed.

149
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,560
Long live Lingbi.

150
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,720
We give our lives to you.

151
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Long live Lingbi.

152
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,000
We give our lives to you.

153
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,200
Long live Lingbi.

154
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,600
We give our lives to you.

155
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,920
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,680
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

157
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,720
Long live Lingbi.

158
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,760
- We give our lives to you.
- Run!

159
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,560
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

160
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,160
Long live Lingbi.
We give our lives to you.

161
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,200
FENGLAI PAVILION

162
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,880
<i>Miss Ling,</i>
<i>you merely suffered from the shock,</i>

163
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,200
<i>so you're fine.</i>

164
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,040
<i>He, however,</i>
<i>got the short end of the stick.</i>

165
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,920
<i>His back is seriously wounded,</i>
<i>and he is suffering from nightmares.</i>

166
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>We don't know when he'll wake up.</i>

167
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,840
Bai. I'm sorry.

168
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
Please be all right.

169
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>What a joke.</i>

170
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,840
<i>What a joke.</i>

171
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,880
<i>You want to regain your power?</i>

172
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,360
<i>Have you forgotten</i>

173
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,920
<i>that you gave it to</i>
<i>us willingly in the past?</i>

174
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,840
Your Highness.

175
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
It is cold out here,

176
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,720
and you have a weak constitution.

177
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,560
Why are you standing here alone?

178
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,960
Don't do this, Your Highness.

179
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,880
Come.

180
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,520
If one day,

181
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,200
I become the emperor,

182
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,960
I shall make you the Grand Chancellor,

183
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,720
and Cangcang the empress.

184
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,520
The Empress Dowager
never takes His Highness seriously.

185
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,520
His Highness is isolated politically.

186
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,240
It is shrewd of him to form
an alliance with the Grand Tutor.

187
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
But should he become
the emperor in the future,

188
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
this promise might be
the one thing that binds him.

189
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,080
Indeed.

190
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,800
Grand Tutor Ling,

191
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,240
when will you let me rule in my own right?

192
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,240
The day Cangcang weds you

193
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,560
will be the day you take real power.

194
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Unfortunately,
you might not live to see that day.

195
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,840
Isn't it great to be the Bai Chifan

196
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,120
who roams freely in the martial world?

197
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,120
<i>If I lose my power,</i>

198
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,040
<i>I'll lose my life too.</i>

199
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
I will treat Cangcang with sincerity.

200
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,080
Your sincerity is a joke.

201
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,600
What a lovestruck ruler!

202
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,960
Not only did
you fail to regain your power,

203
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,000
but you will live like you used to before,

204
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,600
wondering every day

205
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,280
if you can live to
see the sunrise tomorrow.

206
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,040
You lay low for ten years,

207
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
but you messed up
your plan in one crucial moment.

208
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,560
You brought this upon yourself.

209
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
<i>No.</i>

210
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,280
<i>No. What should I do? This can't be it.</i>

211
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Bai.

212
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,560
Bai. You're finally awake.

213
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,520
Cangcang.

214
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,640
Marry me.

215
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
What?

216
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,040
Cangcang. I love you.

217
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,480
Marry me. All right?

218
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,280
Luo.

219
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
Cangcang.

220
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
Father wants me
to bring you back to the Capital.

221
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
Come with me.

222
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Let Cangcang go already.

223
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,880
I'm going to marry Cangcang.

224
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,560
Luo, don't hurt Bai.

225
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,000
Cangcang.

226
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,840
Since the beginning,
he approached you to fulfill his plan.

227
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,160
He has an agenda.

228
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
I know very well if
he has an agenda or not.

229
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,720
Someone with a secret agenda

230
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
will not risk their lives to
save me again and again.

231
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,560
Cangcang.

232
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,240
He did that to earn your sympathy.

233
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,480
Can't you tell?

234
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,680
Luo.

235
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,680
I can tell if it's a ruse
to earn my sympathy,

236
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,680
or if he truly cares about me.

237
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,240
You'd rather believe
a stranger you just met than me?

238
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
I…

239
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
I didn't mean it that way.

240
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,480
Do you…

241
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,080
Do you fancy him as well?

242
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
Father wants me to bring you back.

243
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,080
Don't make my job difficult for me.

244
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,880
Luo.

245
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,760
Headstrong as I may be,
I dare not defy my father.

246
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,840
Give me three days.

247
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,800
Once I settle everything,

248
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
I'll see my father
and ask for a punishment.

249
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,599
But today,

250
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
you're not hurting Bai.

251
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,800
FENGLAI PAVILION

252
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,280
I'm coming.

253
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,160
Bai?

254
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,520
What is this?

255
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
- A gift.
- A gift?

256
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,920
Frostflame Iron?

257
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,480
Give this to your master.

258
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,560
Cangcang,

259
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,120
if I want your hand in marriage,

260
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,120
I'll have to earn
your father's and master's recognition.

261
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,600
I don't want to see any tension
between you and them because of me.

262
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,280
So let's pay your master a visit.

263
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,120
I'm sure he'll be over the moon.

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,240
Among all things, he loves
making swords the most.

265
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,400
Doesn't this belong to Prince of Yuzhang?
Why do you have it?

266
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,600
HEROIC COMPOSURE

267
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,200
Frostflame Iron?

268
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,360
It's mine.

269
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,680
Why must I give it to you?

270
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
Botang Pleasure Boat was destroyed.

271
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,080
The Lingbi Sect
suffers another great loss.

272
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,400
You also solved
the case of the missing boys.

273
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm sure the imperial court
will reward you handsomely.

274
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
You don't need the Frostflame Iron.

275
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,320
I can give it to you for free.

276
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,960
But only if you…

277
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,760
If I?

278
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,840
I'm afraid you can't give me what I want.

279
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
Don't covet what isn't yours.

280
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Give me the Frostflame Iron.

281
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
Are you ordering me as the emperor

282
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,280
or are you pleading as my brother?

283
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,200
What do you think?

284
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,120
Whatever.

285
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,640
I saved you twice in the quarry

286
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,560
and on the boat.

287
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,680
I will ask you to pay me back

288
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
for those favors eventually.

289
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
Consider this iron ore

290
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,800
my gift to you for your upcoming wedding.

291
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,280
Thank you.

292
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,760
Bai, wait for me.

293
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,280
Cangcang.

294
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,440
Didn't you say your master is a swordsman?

295
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,040
I thought a swordsman would
go on an adventure to uphold justice.

296
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,160
Why is your master

297
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,200
residing in this remote area?

298
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,960
He was a swordsman,
and now, he's a recluse.

299
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,520
Because
he doesn't like the hustle and bustle.

300
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,360
How did you meet your master then?

301
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,720
Did I tell you
why I wanted to rescue those kids?

302
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,720
When I was little…

303
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,080
Father!

304
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,800
I miss Mother. Can we visit her grave?

305
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,000
Cangcang.

306
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm busy.

307
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,640
Quit making a fuss. Go back now.

308
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,000
No. I don't want to stay home alone.

309
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
Cangcang.

310
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,640
Be a good girl.

311
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,400
We will visit her grave in the future.

312
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,800
Bring her back.

313
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
Find some playmates for her.

314
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,120
Go back now.

315
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,160
Slow down, Young Lady!

316
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,560
Don't trip yourself.

317
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,640
If you won't bring me there,

318
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,600
I'll go there myself.

319
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,760
Try running now. Run!

320
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,000
I'll spank you.

321
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,920
Father will save me!

322
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
Run! Try running.

323
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,880
- He'll save me.
- Come out!

324
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,720
My father is the best father in the world!

325
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,880
You had similar experiences,

326
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,320
so you hate those who traffic children.

327
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
What does this have
to do with your master?

328
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,560
Mercy, sir.
I've not seen this girl before.

329
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm serious, sir.

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Just take that girl away.

331
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,320
For free.

332
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,200
Don't be scared. Let me help you.

333
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,680
Easy now. I'll take you home, all right?

334
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,280
I'm not a bad guy.

335
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
Tell me.

336
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
What is your name?

337
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,640
- And then?
- And then,

338
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
Master brought me to my father.

339
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,440
My father hugged me and cried.

340
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,360
Master also told Father

341
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,880
that his daughter
had suffered the same fate,

342
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,200
and that he had been looking for her.

343
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,520
Did he manage to find her?

344
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,480
It's over there.

345
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,320
Master told me
that she loved haitang blossoms the most.

346
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
Even though I have never met her,

347
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,920
I'm sure

348
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,440
she missed her father

349
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,920
and this wonderful world a lot.

350
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,720
TOMBSTONE OF BELOVED DAUGHTER,
LI XIAOTANG

351
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,760
So later,

352
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,760
I made the decision

353
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,160
that even though
Master had lost her daughter,

354
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,760
I would treat him as if he were my father.

355
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,400
Bai.

356
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
You will treat Master with kindness,
won't you?

357
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,880
TOMBSTONE OF BELOVED DAUGHTER,
LI XIAOTANG

358
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Master, I'm here.</i>

359
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,200
Master.

360
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm here to visit you.

361
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,560
Master.

362
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,840
I'm here to visit you.

363
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Where did he go?

364
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,120
What are you doing here?

365
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm here to see Cangcang's master.

366
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,040
You're not welcome here.

367
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,920
Are you saying that as Cangcang's master,

368
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,200
or as the Ghost King?

369
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,160
As expected of
a student of Grand Tutor Ling.

370
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,760
Do you know
what your teacher thinks of you?

371
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,720
He said you were like a wolf pup

372
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,040
prowling in the snow.

373
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,040
People assume you're alone and powerless.

374
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,840
But they seem to forget

375
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,720
that you are still a wolf.

376
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,960
Master!

377
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,040
You're here.

378
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,200
I was looking for you.

379
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Greetings, sir.

380
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
I see you have talked to him.

381
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,800
- Allow me to introduce…
- No need.

382
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,320
We met just now.

383
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,560
Then, about our marriage…

384
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
I am just a farmer now.

385
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,360
Your father should have the final say.

386
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,480
What do you mean?

387
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,480
You're as important to me as my father.

388
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
I trust your judgment.

389
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,760
Cangcang,

390
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,640
Bai Chifan told me
that you came to have a sword made.

391
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,080
Quick. Give me the Frostflame Iron.

392
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,560
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

393
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,160
<i>I found something</i>
<i>important whilst investigating</i>

394
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,680
<i>Grand Tutor Ling.</i>

395
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,120
Ling Cangcang's master is likely

396
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,760
to be the Ghost King.

397
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,800
Likely, you said?

398
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,320
Don't you know how important he is
to Cangcang?

399
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
I can capture Li Lu

400
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
and interrogate him before we decide.

401
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,000
No need for that.

402
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,520
If I want Cangcang to marry me,
I must pay him a visit.

403
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,920
<i>If he turns out to be the Ghost King,</i>

404
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,840
<i>we can only act on a full moon's night.</i>

405
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,200
Bai.

406
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,680
What are you doing out here?

407
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm here to get some fresh air.

408
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,560
Did you know?

409
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
Master never lets
anyone into his sword cottage.

410
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,840
But he lets you in.
That means you've earned his recognition.

411
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,480
What's wrong?

412
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,520
The full moon's night is near.

413
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,400
Indeed.

414
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,120
It feels like the moon here
is prettier than anywhere else.

415
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
In the past,

416
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,600
Master would never
allow me to admire the moon

417
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,800
on a full moon's night.

418
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,280
But tomorrow is a full moon's night

419
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,600
and the day we'll get our swords.

420
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,920
I hope he won't chase me away this time.

421
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,440
<i>Cangcang.</i>

422
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,520
<i>I pray that you won't resent me.</i>

423
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,800
Is it done?

424
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,480
Yes.

425
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,440
Cangcang. Take a look.

426
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,120
What an amazing blade.

427
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,160
Master,

428
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,920
it is a good sword.

429
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,680
If that is your choice,
you should now name it.

430
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,240
Master, I have already thought it through.

431
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,680
Can we call it Willow?

432
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,080
Of course.

433
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,440
Thanks, Master.

434
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,480
Bai Chifan,

435
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,960
you can have this sword.

436
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Master, you should give it a name.

437
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,480
The dragon hasn't soared high,

438
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,680
but his reign can already be felt.

439
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,160
This blade shall be called Rex.

440
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Rex and Willow.

441
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,080
Those are good names.

442
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,400
Consider these two blades

443
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,240
my gifts to your wedding.

444
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,920
Bai, thank my master already.

445
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
Thank you for the sword, sir.

446
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,000
Thank you, Master.

447
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,960
You're here.

448
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,360
Is Cangcang asleep already?

449
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,520
Without her chattering, it feels quiet.

450
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,320
You shouldn't have stayed here tonight.

451
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,120
I'm sure your men

452
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,000
are all around this sword grave.

453
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,000
You have already noticed my plan,

454
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,040
yet you decided to stay.

455
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,440
Are you surrendering yourself?

456
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Do you know why

457
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Cangcang named the blade Willow?

458
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,280
My daughter

459
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,720
was playing house with
the kids from the same village.

460
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,480
She loved to pretend to be a heroine.

461
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,880
She went out to play all the time,

462
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,040
and pestered me
to make her a wooden sword.

463
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,760
<i>Your sword is the best</i>
<i>sword in the world, Father.</i>

464
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,800
<i>Thank you, Father.</i>

465
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,200
<i>Should we give the sword a name?</i>

466
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,360
<i>Sure!</i>

467
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,120
That day when I found my daughter,
I saw a mountain full of cadavers.

468
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,680
All I could find of her

469
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,360
was a mangled hand.

470
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,760
That hand

471
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,480
was clinging to the wooden sword tightly

472
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,640
but she…

473
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,640
She was gone.

474
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,200
I held her hands

475
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,800
and carved the name, Willow, on it

476
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,320
by guiding her step by step.

477
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,480
Breeze passes
through the willow tree softly.

478
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,880
The moon shines on the haitang blossoms.

479
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,880
So you know

480
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,080
the complete codes.

481
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,160
On Botang Pleasure Boat,

482
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,680
when Jin Haitang

483
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,160
<i>saw the haitang blossom</i>
<i>pendant on Cangcang's waist,</i>

484
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,640
<i>she let us into the auction.</i>

485
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,000
I suppose the pendant
was left behind by your daughter.

486
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,200
You are indeed using Cangcang.

487
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,880
She's such a sweet girl.

488
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,720
How could you…

489
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,320
So the Ghost King has empathy?

490
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,200
Why did you lead the Lingbi Sect

491
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,960
and commit inhumane crimes then?

492
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,640
Factors out of our control often bind us.

493
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,760
The Ghost King is but a puppet.

494
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,080
I don't think myself morally perfect.

495
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,720
I seek vengeance and repay gratitude.

496
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,200
But why give your life away now?

497
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,120
Come to the palace with me and repent.

498
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,280
You will bring solace to everyone.

499
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,480
Heed my warning.

500
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,719
Stop pestering the Lingbi Sect.

501
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,000
If I don't die, there will be no peace.

502
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,120
So make it quick.

503
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,440
Alas, what a cruel joke from life.

504
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,320
Keep the truth from Cangcang.

505
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,400
A promise from the emperor

506
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,800
shall never be broken.

507
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,800
Do it.

508
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,160
Master!

509
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,840
Master!

510
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,480
Master!

511
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,120
Master!

512
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,920
Master!

513
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,680
Wake up, Master!

514
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,120
Tell me why.

515
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,000
Why?

516
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,880
My intervention was tardy.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

517
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,600
What did he just call you?

518
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,960
<i>You killed my master.</i>

519
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,360
<i>Why would I marry you?</i>

520
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,600
I want you to marry me willingly.

521
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,080
I, Ling Cangcang, am willing to marry you.

522
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,200
<i>Who are you?</i>

523
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,640
Ling Cangcang or the Empress of Great Qi?

524
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,560
Do you love the Emperor of Great Qi?

525
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,720
Bai Chifan never existed.

526
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,360
Bai Chifan…

527
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,800
Bai Chifan never existed.

528
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
My dear. You're awake.

529
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,520
Your Majesty.

530
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,240
How come you're here, Your Majesty?

531
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,120
I came in
and heard you talking in your dream.

532
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,360
Are you all right?

533
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
I…

534
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,040
I had a dream.

535
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,360
What is it about?

536
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,560
I dreamed that…

537
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,760
I dreamed that…

538
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,240
I dreamed that you were kind,

539
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,160
and that my master was still alive.

540
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
And I was still the carefree soul.

541
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,560
- My dear…
- Alas, a dream is the opposite of reality.

542
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,200
My master is dead.

543
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,400
Your Majesty, it's time to wake up.

544
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,520
Today is the day you return home.

545
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,440
Come in.

546
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,760
Your Majesty.

547
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,840
Since you have to return home today,

548
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,960
I understand it might be tiring.

549
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,800
So I will go back to
the Grand Chancellor's Manor with you.

550
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,880
What do you think?

551
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,600
You are a busy man, Your Majesty.

552
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,200
I shouldn't burden you
with such a trivial matter.

553
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,320
Your matter is not a trivial matter to me.

554
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,600
I wouldn't want to impose.

555
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
Relax, my dear.

556
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,640
This is a wedding gift
from the young general,

557
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,640
Ling Jueding.

558
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,720
It took me a while to locate it.

559
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,040
My dear, you may take a look.

560
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,200
How thoughtful of General Ling.

561
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,440
He couldn't attend
our wedding in the Capital,

562
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,840
yet he gave us such a meaningful gift.

563
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,320
He is stationed in Jiangzhou.

564
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,000
I can only imagine the pain
he feels from being away from his family.

565
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,600
Maybe it'll be less miserable

566
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,520
if he
can secure a position in the Capital.

567
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,960
My dear.

568
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
You must think about
the ones who are still alive.

569
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,560
Jueding is brave, strong,

570
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,640
and straightforward.

571
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,440
He should be a soldier.

572
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
If…

573
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,760
If we find him a desk job in the Capital,

574
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,920
I'm sure he'd hate

575
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,560
that kind of lifestyle.

576
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,560
You're right, my dear.

577
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,800
I didn't think of that.

578
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,280
In that case…

579
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
I turned your offer down,

580
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,480
thinking that you'd be
too busy to come with me.

581
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,880
But if

582
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,360
you are willing to come home with me,

583
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,640
I'll be extremely delighted.

584
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,400
Good.

585
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,920
Then I shall wait for you outside.

586
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,840
Do you think
His Majesty loves Her Majesty?

587
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
What are you on about?

588
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,880
After they got married,

589
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,120
His Majesty hasn't
consummated with Her Majesty.

590
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,360
Everyone in the palace

591
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,360
is saying that His Majesty
only married Her Majesty

592
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,240
for political reasons.

593
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,840
But seeing

594
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,160
His Majesty go back
home with Her Majesty today,

595
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,280
I feel that he does love her.

596
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,160
LING MANOR

597
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,840
Let's go.
