EPISODE 5

4
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,200
Long live Your Majesty!

5
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,120
Blessings upon Your Majesty!

6
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Father.

7
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,760
The imperial dignity must be upheld.

8
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,080
Rituals cannot be neglected.

9
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
Sir, there's no need for such formality.

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
Father,

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
when you bow to me like that,
I'm not used to it.

12
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,639
So let's not.

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,120
In time, you will get used to it.

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,480
Sir,

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,360
is Luo Xianxue in the residence?

16
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,720
He is. You wish to see him?

17
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,280
The Empress has been
worried about his injuries.

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,160
My dear, isn't that so?

19
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,960
And if it is?

20
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
Would you even allow me to visit him?

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
As you wish.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Your Majesty,

23
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,320
she's been spoiled from childhood.

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,160
I beg Your Majesty's pardon.

25
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,840
I've heard you excel at tea.

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
I wonder
if I might have the honor of a taste.

27
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Luo.

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
Are you blaming me?

30
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Of course not.

31
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
Now, you're the Empress.

32
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,040
It's only right I bow to you.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,920
Rise.

34
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
Your Majesty,

35
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,520
it's just a scratch, not worth your worry.

36
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,360
If you still see me as your little sister,

37
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
stop calling me "Your Majesty".

38
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,120
If anyone's to blame,

39
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,120
it's me.

40
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,920
Your Majesty, don't blame yourself.

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,120
Your betrothal was set long ago.
You could never overrule him.

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
He's the one at fault!

43
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,400
He killed my master.

44
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,920
But whatever the case,

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
you're the Empress now.

46
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,200
What exactly did he do to you?

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,920
Before,

48
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,040
I didn't know my place.

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,880
But now,

50
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
I've thought it through.

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,360
I know what I must do for everyone's good.

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,840
Our father grows older by the day.
He can't take upheaval.

53
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Since you're Empress,

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,760
you should consider
how to ease his burdens.

55
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,360
Ease Father's burdens?

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Yes. Empress Dowager Liu and Father
have long been at odds.

57
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,160
Only by fulfilling your duty as Empress

58
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,640
can you truly ease his burdens.

59
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,160
How am I supposed to do that?

60
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
Every day I see him,

61
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,960
I think of my master,
I think of your hand,

62
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,120
and I could kill him with one stroke.

63
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,560
Even if you won't think of Father,
think of yourself.

64
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,280
Empress Dowager Liu
holds the Phoenix Seal.

65
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,320
She rules the inner palace.

66
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,040
Without His Majesty's favor,
without his support,

67
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,520
how will you survive the inner palace?

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,880
I'm speaking from the heart!

69
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,520
Don't worry.

70
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,960
I'll look after myself in the palace.

71
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,560
Your Majesty…

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
Rumors that the
Emperor and Empress are at odds

73
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
are everywhere.

74
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,440
The Empress Dowager
will surely use it and bully you.

75
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,920
You must rely on His Majesty
and secure the Phoenix Seal.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,240
Then our father can be at ease.

77
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

78
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,160
Luo,

79
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,040
may I ask you a favor?

80
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,280
Your Majesty, just say the word.

81
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
I want to set up

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
a spirit tablet for my master.

83
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,920
I knew Your Majesty would wish this.

84
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,240
I've already sought a proper mausoleum.

85
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,360
All right.

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,800
Thank you for seeing to it.

87
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,400
<i>Cangcang, take care.</i>

88
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Two days ago, I obtained
some Wuyi Queshe Tea.

89
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Here. Please taste it, Your Majesty.

90
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
A delicate fragrance
with a sweet, lingering finish.

91
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,080
Fine tea.

92
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Today, Your Majesty
escorted the Empress home

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,720
and now shares tea with me.

94
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,040
This old minister is truly gratified.

95
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
Sir, do you know

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,040
about the heretical sect
in the martial world,

97
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
the Lingbi Sect?

98
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,640
Backed by someone at court,

99
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,720
they assassinate the powerful
and eliminate rivals.

100
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,040
I am ill-informed
and have never heard of it.

101
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,440
I have proof
that Li Lu is its secret leader,

102
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,320
which makes

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,400
your ties to the Lingbi Sect
hard to explain.

104
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,799
I truly didn't know Li Lu's identity,

105
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,799
only that he was a martial master

106
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,560
who saved Cangcang
and taught her the sword.

107
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Nothing more.

108
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Nothing more…

109
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
Then tell me,

110
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,960
why did I cut off Luo Xianxue's finger?

111
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,920
You don't think
it was just out of jealousy, do you?

112
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,320
Your Majesty's care for the Empress

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,800
is painstaking indeed.

114
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm deeply grateful.

115
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
We're all family. No need for thanks.

116
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,320
By the way, in a few days,

117
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,360
the Ministry of Personnel will
propose a talent recommendation system.

118
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,400
I consider it workable
and intend to implement it.

119
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
What say you, sir?

120
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
If it benefits Great Qi,

121
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,600
I will, of course,

122
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
fully support it.

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,440
Cangcang grew up away from strife

124
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,960
pure and kind at heart.

125
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,880
So she loves and hates with all her being,

126
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,600
and despises evil as her enemy.

127
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,080
She's been willful for a dozen years,

128
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,920
but now she's the Empress.

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's time she grew up.

130
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,040
Have you said what must be said?

131
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes.

132
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,680
As you instructed,
I told Young Lady everything.

133
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,000
But Father,

134
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,160
you know full well

135
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,240
she still resents His Majesty
over Li Lu's death.

136
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,440
Asking her to seek his favor
at a time like this, won't that…

137
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,000
Xianxue,

138
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,560
do you still think
I shouldn't have done this?

139
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
I am Cangcang's father,

140
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,600
and what I do
is certainly for her own good.

141
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,800
His Majesty was born with cold poison.

142
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,800
Even the imperial
physicians can't treat it.

143
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,000
What if he were to…

144
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,640
If Cangcang bears a prince soon,

145
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,400
then she'll truly have real backing

146
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,320
in the inner palace.

147
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,280
Xianxue,

148
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,960
this is the path she must take.

149
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
All we can do

150
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,520
is to pave the way for her,

151
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,280
so she walks steadier

152
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
and goes farther.

153
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,520
Understood.

154
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,080
My lady asked me to find
a mausoleum to honor Li Lu.

155
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,440
Promise her.

156
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
But

157
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,960
don't let her know

158
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,360
that Li Lu was the Ghost King.

159
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
But I don't think

160
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,920
she will let it go easily.

161
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,240
Try to talk her down.

162
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,040
Cangcang is soft-hearted.

163
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,720
She'll always put the Ling family first.

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,720
After all,

165
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,160
we need to move on.

166
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,320
YONGKANG MAUSOLEUM,
3 LI NORTH OF THE CAPITAL

167
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,720
WUYING HALL

168
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,480
Your Majesty.

169
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,400
The Empress got a note by pigeon

170
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,360
and slipped out of the palace.
You truly won't stop her?

171
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
She'll come back.

172
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,240
Keep me informed of her every move.

173
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,200
Also,

174
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,080
do not alert her.

175
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,920
Understood.

176
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,600
Master.

177
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm unfilial.

178
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,720
I cannot pay respects
at your grave in person.

179
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,800
I can only

180
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
set up a spirit tablet for you here.

181
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,920
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE LI LU

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
May it comfort your spirit in heaven.

183
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,440
I brought you wine too.

184
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,000
Though

185
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,360
the Capital's wine is a bit light,

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,760
and I'm not sure if you like it.

187
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,680
Still,

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,400
it's smooth and lingering.

189
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
Please try it.

SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE LI LU

191
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
Let it go, Cangcang.

192
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,920
Maybe His Majesty has his reasons.

193
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,520
Reasons?

194
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,240
What reason justifies
killing a man who kept to himself

195
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,760
and did nothing but good?

196
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
<i>I roamed the martial world</i>
<i>with Master since I was little.</i>

197
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,720
<i>He was unmatched in skill,</i>

198
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,080
<i>almost without rival.</i>

199
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,560
<i>Yet he was humble to all</i>
<i>and ever doing good.</i>

200
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
<i>His only wish</i>

201
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,800
<i>was that I grow up safe and happy.</i>

202
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,480
Master, I want those blossoms!

203
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,120
All right. I'll pick them for you.

204
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,000
What are you doing?

205
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,600
What do you think you're doing?

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,080
Thank you. Thank you.

207
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,000
Sorry to trouble you.

208
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,360
Master, you're amazing!

209
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,360
<i>I can't make sense of it.</i>

210
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
What reason could justify

211
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,840
killing a man so good,

212
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,320
one he never spoke of?

213
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,360
Cangcang, the dead can't return.

214
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,080
- Look past it.
- Stop.

215
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,720
Show me your hand.

216
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,160
Luo,

217
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
you and Father

218
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
are my closest family in this world.

219
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,320
You're right.

220
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,360
Since I'm the Empress now,

221
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
I should use that position

222
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
to live well in the palace.

223
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,680
So I can keep
everyone in the Ling family safe.

224
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,280
Cangcang, you've finally figured it out.

225
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,200
Yes.

226
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,599
I have.

227
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,280
Until I learn the truth,

228
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll do my duty as Empress.

229
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
Cangcang,

230
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,640
- you still must find the truth?
- Right.

231
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,480
Master's kindness to me runs deep.

232
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
How could I let his death be in vain?

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
But even if you uncover the truth,
what then?

234
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,800
Then I'll repay every grudge

235
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
and every grievance.

236
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,560
I'll put an end to it all.

237
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
The world will still be wide open.

238
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,240
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE LI LU

239
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,960
- Your Majesty.
- Has the Empress returned?

240
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,320
She has.

241
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,480
She and Luo Xianxue visited a mausoleum

242
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,720
and set up a spirit tablet for Li Lu.

243
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,640
She just returned to Linghe Hall.

244
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,960
She's in good spirits.

245
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,800
Is that so? Good.

246
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,520
Your Majesty,
why not tell Her Majesty the truth?

247
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,160
Let her hate me

248
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
is better than letting her learn it

249
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,560
and suffer and grieve.

250
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,480
Besides, the matter isn't over.

251
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,160
- I don't want her dragged into it.
- Understood.

252
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,720
How's the affair in Southern Chu
being handled?

253
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,600
Rest easy.

254
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,120
Song Lanxi has agreed.

255
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
He can depart for the Capital at any time.

256
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,920
Good.

257
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,320
We're rolling out the
talent recommendation system.

258
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,000
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

259
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,440
Ensure this pilot batch of candidates,

260
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,000
especially Song Lanxi,

261
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,600
arrives safely in the Capital.

262
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,080
Understood.

263
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,240
LINGHE HALL

264
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,600
Blessings upon Your Majesty.

265
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,200
Why is it so cold in here?

266
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,360
The steward eunuch says
our hall is short on attendants

267
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,480
and His Majesty doesn't come,
so we don't get much charcoal.

268
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
Is that so?

269
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
How long have I been in the palace now?

270
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,160
Today makes seven days.

271
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,800
Keep combing.

272
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,440
With a touch of
grooming, Your Majesty is peerless.

273
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
His Majesty will be
smitten when he sees you!

274
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,600
We're not going to see His Majesty.

275
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,680
Then who are we visiting?

276
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,640
We're going to see the Empress Dowager
and reclaim what is ours.

277
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Do you mean the Phoenix Seal?

278
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,400
If you go like this, it may be risky…

279
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,920
We'll go anyway.

280
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,040
Come on.

281
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,800
Your Majesty.

282
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,880
Aunt Chan.

283
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,400
The Empress Dowager is napping.

284
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,720
No one may enter and disturb her.

285
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,480
Aunt Chan, I've heard Mother loves cheese.

286
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,640
So I asked my brother

287
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,280
to bring fine cheese back from Xijiang
for her to enjoy.

288
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,680
It was sent on an
eight-hundred-li rush to the Capital.

289
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,640
The flavor will change with time.

290
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
Please announce me.

291
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,080
Your Majesty is thoughtful.

292
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,560
However, the Empress Dowager

293
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
feels she's put on weight lately,

294
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,160
and is on a fasting regimen.

295
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,120
So I'm afraid
she won't partake of this cheese.

296
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,760
I see.

297
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,280
What a pity.

298
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,160
Then perhaps
I'll present it to you instead?

299
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,040
Xiaoshan, take it in to Aunt Chan.

300
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,040
Understood.

301
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,640
The Empress Dowager is napping.

302
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,280
No one may enter and disturb her.

303
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,920
It's fine. We'll wait a bit longer.

304
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,160
When the Empress Dowager wakes,
we'll go in then.

305
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,640
Then please wait, Your Majesty.

306
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
I'll go in and attend her.

307
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,160
Hold.

308
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,440
Since you're going in to serve,

309
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,240
as her daughter-in-law,
I should go in to serve Mother as well

310
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,200
to show my filial respect.

311
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,600
The Empress's deportment is improper.

312
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,720
How are you people attending her?

313
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,800
Take them away.
Give them the forced-bend punishment

314
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,840
for four hours!

315
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,800
You dare strike me?

316
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
I spoke kindly

317
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,560
yet you threw your weight around
and ran roughshod.

318
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,760
Am I not allowed to discipline you?

319
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,480
Guards! Take her away.

320
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,600
Understood!

321
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,880
Your Majesty, at this rate…

322
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,800
No hurry.

323
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,680
Your Majesty.

324
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,600
The Empress Dowager invites you.

325
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,320
Then, I'll spare you for now.

326
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,840
Greetings, Mother.

327
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,920
You even struck my attendant.

328
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,040
Quite the display of power.

329
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,240
Mother, I am wronged!

330
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,520
I came today to bring you cheese.

331
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,280
But to my surprise,

332
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,080
Aunt Chan said you'd grown fat

333
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,280
and must fast a few
days before seeing anyone.

334
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Your Majesty, don't heed this liar!

335
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,720
When did I ever say that?

336
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,120
Mother, you hear that?

337
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,760
Aunt Chan calls me a liar.

338
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,240
Aunt Chan,

339
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
you've served Mother for years.

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,520
I do respect you.

341
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,200
But after all,
I am the Empress of Great Qi.

342
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Young as I am,
you shouldn't call me a liar.

343
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,360
Your Majesty, I've been wronged!

344
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,120
Please judge clearly!

345
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,200
Since Aunt Chan misspoke,

346
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,800
she should be slapped.

347
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,160
Attend! Drag her out.

348
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,720
Thank you for your
just judgment, Your Majesty.

349
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,880
Are you satisfied now?

350
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,320
You're fair in reward and punishment.
I take the lesson.

351
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,560
Thank you, Mother.

352
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,080
I've ruled the inner palace for decades.

353
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,520
You mustn't be soft-hearted,

354
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,400
or the wretches will walk over you.

355
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,040
Don't you agree?

356
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,760
You're absolutely right.

357
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,880
Mother,
it's hard work to manage the harem,

358
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,440
so I'd like to share the burden.

359
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,520
Managing the inner
palace is the Empress's duty,

360
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,160
mine to fulfill.

361
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,360
- Why not grant me the Phoenix Seal…
- You've

362
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,680
been in the palace seven days?

363
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,800
Yes.

364
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,720
By rights,
I should pass you the Phoenix Seal.

365
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,320
But your conduct falls short,

366
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,720
how can you rule the inner palace?

367
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,720
What do you mean by that, Mother?

368
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,120
Where have I failed my duties?

369
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
I hear

370
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
His Majesty has yet
to stay at Linghe Hall.

371
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,520
As the Emperor's wife,

372
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,960
you've not fulfilled a wife's duty.

373
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,640
That is the gravest failing.

374
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,280
An Empress's chief duty

375
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,080
is to extend the royal line
and carry on the heirs.

376
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,400
To be the mother of the realm,

377
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
be a mother first.

378
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,160
If you have no legitimate son or daughter,

379
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,160
your throne

380
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,920
will be hard to hold.

381
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,520
I fear your mind is elsewhere.

382
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,800
So for now,

383
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
I'll shoulder these burdens.

384
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,360
As for the Phoenix Seal,

385
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,480
I'll keep it for you.

386
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,360
When you've fulfilled an Empress's duties,

387
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,040
I'll hand it over.

388
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm a bit tired.

389
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,560
You may withdraw.

390
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Understood.

391
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
I'll take my leave.

392
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
I also hear

393
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
the Emperor was just outside

394
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,240
yet didn't speak up for you.

395
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,520
As one who's been through it,
let me advise you:

396
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Reflect on yourself
and win back his favor.

397
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,880
I still can't get around him.

398
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,560
Mind your words, Your Majesty.

399
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,320
- Your Majesty.
- How is the Empress?

400
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,360
Since returning, all is normal.

401
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,240
She showed no other strong reaction,

402
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,720
only that
she took out a pear blossom hairpin.

403
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,400
We're going to visit Master tomorrow.

404
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,120
Why are you still up so late?

405
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,520
Cangcang,

406
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,840
I have a gift for you.

407
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,800
What is it?

408
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,080
What a beautiful hairpin!

409
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
My home has a pear orchard,

410
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
planted by my parents.

411
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,320
When the blossoms are in full bloom,

412
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,200
I'll take you there, all right?

413
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,480
That depends on my master's permission.

414
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,240
And if he says no?

415
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
Then we won't go.

416
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,880
Anyway, just put it on.

417
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,320
Does it look good?

418
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,200
It does.

419
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Have the pear blossoms
in Qinyuan Garden bloomed?

420
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,200
They've budded but not opened yet.

421
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,600
I want to see a sea of
white blossoms like snow.

422
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,840
Hongqing, see to it.

423
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Understood.

424
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,840
- Put that over there.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
Set this one here.

426
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
Leave this here.

427
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,560
Stoke the fire higher.

428
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,680
You two, bring a few more braziers.

429
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Yes, sir!

430
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,200
Commander Li.

431
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,120
Eunuch Feng.

432
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,240
Why so many braziers
throughout the garden?

433
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,160
Are you

434
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,760
building a warm frame
to force an early bloom?

435
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,120
White as snow.

436
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,320
Your Majesty, look!

437
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,640
The pear blossoms are all open.

438
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,160
I didn't lie to you.

439
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,080
They are.

440
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,120
Not one was open days ago,

441
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,040
and today the whole garden's in bloom.

442
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,000
Do you like it?

443
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,520
Shall I cut two sprays for a vase?

444
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,840
Here comes His Majesty!

445
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,320
<i>If I can't secure the Phoenix Seal,</i>

446
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,080
<i>never mind uncovering Master's death,</i>

447
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,040
<i>I won't survive a day in the harem.</i>

448
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

449
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,360
Do you like this garden of pear blossoms?

450
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,320
I do.

451
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,280
At first sight of them,
I thought of Your Majesty.

452
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,320
I meant to send for you,

453
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,120
but you came at once.

454
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,880
Are you here to admire them too?

455
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,360
So, have you made up your mind?

456
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
I have. Right now,

457
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,120
I have made up my mind.

458
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,800
We are husband and wife.

459
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,680
I shouldn't hold resentment toward you.

460
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,640
Your Majesty,

461
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,920
at Linghe Hall,

462
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
the nights are bitterly cold.

463
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,160
Will you come keep me company tonight?

464
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,400
Since when

465
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,280
did I become a tool for you to toy with?

466
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,520
Your Majesty,

467
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,400
this is a new medicine
from the Imperial Preceptor

468
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,440
to treat your cold sickness.

469
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,640
What is it you painted, Your Majesty?

470
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,040
Nothing, just a few casual strokes.

471
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,800
I hear you viewed pear blossoms all day.

472
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,240
This spring is chill.

473
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,560
Their scent can affect the body.

474
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,360
Beware a bout of wheezing.

475
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,320
Hereafter,

476
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,400
best avoid Qinyuan.

477
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,160
I was born with the cold sickness.

478
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,880
What has it to do with pear blossoms?

479
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,360
I'm not that delicate.

480
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,360
Fair point.

481
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,040
The reform you seek

482
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,200
will shake the nobles' interests.

483
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,840
I fear

484
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,480
Grand Tutor Ling won't support it.

485
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,320
In court, only Minister Xing

486
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,680
can counter him.

487
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,000
Though he's of the Empress Dowager's line,

488
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,720
there's room to win him over.

489
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,360
I hear

490
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,560
Minister Xing has a beloved daughter.

491
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
If Your Majesty

492
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,840
takes her as a consort,

493
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
- he'll surely serve you.
- Madam…

494
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,199
Your Majesty, remember:

495
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,280
you married the Empress

496
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,560
to counter Grand Tutor Ling.

497
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,199
Now, to keep the balance,

498
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,320
taking Minister Xing's daughter

499
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,440
is just as necessary.

500
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,360
My harem requires no concern from you.

501
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,520
I overstepped.

502
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,400
As Imperial Preceptor,
you should not dabble in such affairs.

503
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,600
Your Majesty,
the Empress may not be your foe,

504
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,840
but she cannot be your soft spot.

505
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,320
Your Majesty, it's late.

506
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Let's give up waiting.

507
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,560
What do you think
His Majesty is doing now?

508
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,600
I asked around.

509
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,800
His Majesty
has been reading memorials at Wuying Hall

510
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,560
and went nowhere else.

511
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,960
Enough. Let's go rest.

512
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,000
Understood.

513
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,760
Let's wait a bit longer.

514
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,320
<i>Right now,</i>

515
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,720
I have made up my mind.

516
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,200
We are husband and wife.

517
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,400
I shouldn't hold resentment toward you.

518
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,680
At Linghe Hall,

519
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,360
nights are bitterly cold.

520
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,920
Will you come keep me company tonight?

521
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,960
Your Majesty, your health comes first.

522
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,840
Shall we retire?

523
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,760
No need.

524
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,960
Your Majesty,

525
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,000
you're holding the memorial upside down.

526
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,160
None of you
supports the talent recommendation system?

527
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,480
If you have thoughts, speak freely.

528
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,320
The new system makes sense,

529
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
but it will be hard to carry out.

530
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,800
With the Grand Tutor silent,

531
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,400
we dare not say much.

532
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,640
- Yes.
- Exactly.

533
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,880
Reasonable.

534
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,160
Your Majesty,

535
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,840
the system selects
talent beyond old rules.

536
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,360
But scholars vary by region.

537
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,680
Bringing them to court rashly
may be unwise.

538
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,600
The Grand Tutor never proposed it before.

539
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,560
Best to see where he stands now.

540
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,760
That's sensible.

541
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,400
Not so. A matter this big

542
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,520
can't be decided in a moment.

543
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,400
By the way, in a few days,

544
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,920
the Ministry of Personnel will
propose a talent recommendation system.

545
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,480
I consider it workable
and intend to implement it.

546
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,840
What say you, Sir?

547
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
If it benefits Great Qi,

548
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,760
I will, of course,

549
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,320
fully support it.

550
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,160
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

551
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,240
<i>no one in court supports the system.</i>

552
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,640
What now?

553
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,040
I expected today's pushback

554
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,440
and have a plan.

555
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
- Hold for now.
- Understood.

556
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,400
Time to go to Nanrong Palace now.

557
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
Get my medicine.

558
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,240
Understood.

559
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,840
Your Majesty,

560
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,680
the Empress waited all night

561
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,960
and just fell asleep.

562
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,360
- Wufu.
- Here.

563
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,600
Find a way

564
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,320
to move the spies from her side.

565
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,640
Understood.

566
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,360
Madam,

567
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,480
are the elixirs ready?

568
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,160
Commander Li,
why are you here alone today?

569
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,760
Doesn't His Majesty
always stop by after court?

570
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
He went to Linghe Hall today.

571
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,840
This batch has new herbs added.

572
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
When His Majesty takes it,

573
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,520
I must be present
to take his pulse and observe.

574
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,280
This time,

575
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,440
let me deliver it.

576
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,840
Please don't put me in a bind.

577
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,920
Xiaoyue! Xiaoyue!

578
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,440
Quiet down.

579
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,600
Her Majesty was up all night
and just fell asleep.

580
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,400
Xiaoyue, Eunuch Yang from the
Household asks for you.

581
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Me?

582
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,480
Yes, go on. They're waiting.

583
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,960
- Xiaoshan, I'll be right back.
- All right.

584
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,480
His Majesty said he wouldn't come.

585
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,080
Why lose sleep waiting?

586
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,680
What's the point?

587
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,000
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

588
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,800
<i>Cangcang,</i>

589
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
<i>I'm truly sorry.</i>

590
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,000
<i>But if you knew the truth,</i>

591
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
<i>how would you face your master?</i>

592
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,520
<i>And how could you bear it?</i>

593
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,360
Your Majesty!

594
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,000
You finally came.

595
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,440
I was just passing by and looking in.

596
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,920
I didn't expect
you'd be sleeping in broad daylight.

597
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,160
What conduct is that?

598
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,040
Since you're here,
stay and keep me company.

599
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,720
I still have matters to attend to.

600
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,960
If you wish to sleep, then sleep.

601
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,160
Do you dislike me so much?

602
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,200
You won't spare me a glance?

603
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,320
Why do you want me to stay?

604
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,160
Do you remember this pear blossom hairpin?

605
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,760
If you don't like it, throw it away.

606
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,120
I like it! Put it on me.

607
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,520
If not,

608
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,120
share a drink with me. Just one cup.

609
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,240
After this cup, we're back to how we were.

610
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,000
All right?
