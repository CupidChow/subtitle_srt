ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Zhong Lin…

3
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Right now,

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,560
you're all I have left.

5
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,560
Silly guy,

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,160
you still have His Majesty besides me.

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
He treats you like his own sibling.

8
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,720
- Of course he…
- Enough.

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,840
My mother and Ying
were killed by his own hands.

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,120
You're saying the Empress Dowager and
the Princess died by His Majesty's hand?

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,760
That's impossible.
He's not that kind of man.

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,680
There must be some mistake.

13
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,320
I saw it with my own eyes.
How could there be any mistake?

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,840
What I hate is,

15
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
I treated Xiao Huan like a brother,

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,280
but he was never truly sincere with me.

17
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,240
No, that can't be.

18
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
His Majesty may be deep and hard to read,

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,600
but he's someone
who values love and loyalty.

20
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
I can see he's sincere toward you.

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,120
Besides, there's still Cangcang.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,720
- She would never allow that…
- Are you speaking up for them now?

23
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,400
You said you'd always stay by my side.

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,360
It was all a lie!

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Just go.

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,560
No, that's not what I meant…

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,600
What's wrong with you?

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,160
Are you hiding something from me?

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,280
I told you to leave! Can't you understand?

30
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,040
I don't want to see you right now.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
Fine…

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
I'll go.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,720
Then take good care of yourself.

34
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,840
Your Highness, what a temper.

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
You just chased
Princess Zhong Lin away like that.

36
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
Aren't you afraid you'll hurt her?

37
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,240
What,

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,840
even my private affairs

39
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
need you to meddle in them?

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,840
I wouldn't dare.

41
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,840
But Princess Zhong Lin
is the Empress's most trusted friend.

42
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,480
If you let me have
someone keep an eye on her,

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
maybe

44
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,280
we'll learn where Her Majesty is.

45
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Preceptor Du,

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
I'll remind you once more:
you're overstepping.

47
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,360
I've thought it through.

48
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,960
I want the throne,

49
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,600
and I want to take
everything from Xiao Huan.

50
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,840
Until I achieve that,

51
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,960
Preceptor Du,
you are not to interfere with me.

52
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,440
You don't trust me?

53
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,040
And do you trust me?

54
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,760
You and I are merely using each other.

55
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,280
But do me a favor, don't anger me,

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
or I might turn on you.

57
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Your Highness's temper
is still as reckless and rash as ever.

58
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,480
I only wanted to remind you

59
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,720
that Princess Zhong Lin is the key.

60
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll give you one last warning.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,880
She's mine.

62
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,320
I don't need your help with her.

63
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,240
Good.

64
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,920
Otherwise,
if Princess Zhong Lin acts rashly,

65
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,560
even you won't be able to protect her.

66
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
<i>Are you speaking up for them now?</i>

67
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,480
<i>You said you'd always stay by my side.</i>

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
It was all a lie!

69
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Are you hiding something from me?

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,720
I told you to leave! Can't you understand?

71
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,480
<i>What on earth are you hiding from me?</i>

72
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,520
<i>Did something happen to</i>
<i>His Majesty and Cangcang?</i>

73
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,480
<i>Xiao Qianqing,</i>

74
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
<i>don't stray from the right path</i>

75
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,240
<i>and do something you'll regret.</i>

76
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,840
Talk. Who sent you?

77
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,920
Are you with the Prince of Yuzhang?

78
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,520
QINGLIN COURT

79
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
Your Highness.

80
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,560
You were sent by Prince of Yuzhang too?

81
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,520
His Highness is worried about your safety.

82
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,840
<i>He even sent more</i>
<i>men to keep an eye on me.</i>

83
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,880
<i>Xiao Qianqing,</i>
<i>what exactly are you trying to do?</i>

84
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
QINGLIN COURT

85
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,919
The Prince ordered you to watch me.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,559
Did he also tell you to watch me sleep?
I'm tired now, so hurry up and get lost!

87
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
Cangcang!

88
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
Keep your voice down.

89
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
<i>Cangcang, promise me.</i>

90
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,320
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

91
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
<i>as soon as you see the warning arrow fly,</i>

92
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,160
<i>you must put your own safety first.</i>

93
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,120
This is bad.
Something's happened in the palace.

94
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,120
Xiaolan.

95
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,440
Your Highness, I'm here.

96
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
Get some hot water ready.
I need a medicinal bath!

97
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,440
Cangcang.

98
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,240
Go ahead.

99
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Hang in there.

100
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
Does it hurt?

101
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,840
Xiaolan. Why is this water so cold?

102
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,800
Yes, Your Highness.

103
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,560
I'll go get you hot water right away!

104
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,520
Xiaolan is from Fenglai Pavilion.

105
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
Don't worry.

106
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,480
What on earth is happening in the palace?

107
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,160
Why is he here?

108
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,640
Prince of Yuzhang?

109
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,000
What…

110
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,520
what is going on?

111
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
Where is His Majesty?

112
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,880
What is this supposed to mean?

113
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,880
His Majesty was
suddenly taken ill with a cold.

114
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
He is now bedridden.

115
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
The imperial
physicians have been summoned,

116
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,920
and he has been
moved to the retreat to recover.

117
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
During this time,

118
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
all state affairs

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,080
will be handled by me.

120
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,360
Your Highness,

121
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,680
do you have an imperial edict or
at least His Majesty's word on this?

122
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,400
His Majesty fell ill so suddenly.

123
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,040
We wish to see Her Majesty

124
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,360
to show our concern.

125
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,880
Seeing how suddenly His Majesty fell ill,

126
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,440
Her Majesty panicked,
worried herself too much,

127
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,720
and fell ill herself.

128
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,920
She has gone with
His Majesty to the retreat.

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
How can you officials
just see her whenever you like?

130
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,080
Mr. Lin, do you not trust me?

131
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm only worried
about His Majesty's health.

132
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,400
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

133
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,800
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

134
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

135
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,280
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

136
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,320
Sharing His Majesty's burdens

137
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,840
is only what I ought to do.

138
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,360
By His Majesty's decree:

139
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,320
His Majesty is unwell

140
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,200
and has gone with
Her Majesty to recover at the retreat.

141
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,280
Linghe Hall is sealed.

142
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
No one is allowed to
leave the hall without cause.

143
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,000
Await further orders.

144
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Madam?

146
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,720
- Madam?
- What's going on…

147
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,760
with His Majesty?

148
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,680
Aside from letting
Eunuch Feng serve him up close,

149
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,080
he won't say a word

150
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,080
about the Empress's whereabouts
and where the Imperial Seal is.

151
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,120
Nothing at all.

152
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,960
He's already my prisoner,

153
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
so why does he still
act so high and mighty?

154
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
He won't even beg for mercy once.

155
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,440
Does he really think
that stubborn backbone of his

156
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,000
leaves me helpless?

157
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,560
Madam…

158
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,720
ordinary methods

159
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,720
probably won't work on him anymore.

160
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,440
Trouble grows with time.

161
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
We might as well

162
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,920
let the Lingbi Sect make a move.

163
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
They have plenty of ways
to make people wish they were dead.

164
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,800
They can definitely force
him to hand over the Imperial Seal

165
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,280
and write an edict to pass on the throne.

166
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
All right…

167
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
You left me no choice.

168
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,400
Today, Xiao Qianqing
took the throne to act as regent.

169
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,040
His Majesty still hasn't appeared.

170
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,280
Cangcang, what are we going to do?

171
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,800
Princess Ying and
the Empress Dowager's deaths

172
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,160
shattered Xiao Qianqing.

173
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,520
He wouldn't really
team up with Du Tingxin…

174
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,000
I have to see Xiao Huan.

175
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,160
Don't panic, Cangcang.

176
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,800
You're badly hurt. Heal up first.

177
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
I'll make inquiries for you.

178
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,240
So you're the one behind Du Tingxin.

179
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,720
<i>Saintess?</i>

180
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,680
I thought you took
orders from the Ghost King.

181
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,840
The Ghost King?

182
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
<i>Trying to pry words out of me?</i>

183
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,520
DRAGON-PHOENIX BLESSINGS

184
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,600
Cangcang,

185
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,120
you're still wounded.
You must take care of yourself.

186
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,080
Only once you've
recovered can you save His Majesty.

187
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,240
Zhong Lin,

188
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,880
I'm lucky to have you. Thank you.

189
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,160
Come on, what are friends for?

190
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,400
If you're in trouble,
I would never just stand by.

191
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,200
But with how things are now,

192
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,200
even I don't see any chance of winning.

193
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,880
You've already helped me enough.
Let it stop here.

194
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,040
What if…

195
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,520
I can get you in to see His Majesty?

196
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,600
You know where he is?

197
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
The Hot Spring Retreat.

198
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,760
The Hot Spring Retreat?

199
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm afraid Du Tingxin

200
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,280
has already laid a trap there.

201
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,200
I'll help you.

202
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,680
Then you must remember:

203
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,200
when you're dealing with Du Tingxin,
you must not be reckless.

204
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,800
- Be careful with everything!
- You too.

205
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,400
If you really see His Majesty,
don't lose your head.

206
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,280
Wait until
reinforcements arrive before you act.

207
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,440
His safety is still in their hands.

208
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,800
I won't take any reckless risks.

209
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,880
I can't stay out for too long.

210
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
Someone will come for you soon.

211
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,960
- Be careful in all things.
- All right. You too.

212
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
<i>Bai,</i>

213
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,280
<i>are you all right?</i>

214
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,800
Saintess, the stone man lost.

215
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,760
I underestimated him.

216
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
Your Majesty… what happened?

217
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,280
- Someone tried to assassinate you?
- I'm fine.

218
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,040
Du Tingxin might've joined forces
with the Saintess of the Lingbi Sect.

219
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,640
Their tricks truly are strange,
and their methods vicious.

220
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,920
Your Majesty, then…

221
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,640
you should leave this
dangerous place at once.

222
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,840
<i>Hear me out first.</i>

223
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I suspect the one behind all this
is Du Tingxin herself.

224
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,560
If I'm right,

225
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,920
she's already preparing a palace coup.

226
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,600
When that happens, she'll try every way
she can to win you over

227
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
and make you her puppet emperor.

228
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
If I turn out to be right,

229
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
remember this:

230
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,320
you must not refuse her.
You have to pretend to work with her.

231
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,960
On her own,
she could never pull off a coup.

232
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,680
Only by stalling for time
can we discover who's really behind her.

233
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,520
<i>Only by ripping them out root and branch</i>
<i>can Great Qi know lasting peace.</i>

234
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,320
This aroma is…

235
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,520
Naiguo tea.

236
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,120
Perfect timing.

237
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,840
Have a taste.

238
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,040
Delicious!

239
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
Add two more dates.

240
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,160
You haven't slept in days, have you?

241
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,280
Get some sleep.

242
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,640
Zhong Lin…

243
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
I… I'm afraid to sleep.

244
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,920
Whenever I close my eyes,

245
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,680
I see Ying.

246
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,000
She tugs at my sleeve,

247
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,040
this tiny little thing

248
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,080
following me everywhere.

249
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,400
In the blink of an eye,

250
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,000
she's grown into a graceful young lady.

251
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,720
But suddenly she's lying in a coffin.

252
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
No matter how I shout,

253
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,040
how I call her name,

254
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,640
she never answers me.

255
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,560
Just a few days ago,

256
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,440
she said once we left the palace,

257
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,560
we'd go see the sea of flowers.

258
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
She said

259
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,040
she'd grow up sensible and well-read,

260
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,000
learn to be dutiful and considerate.

261
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
She even said

262
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,280
she'd see me off at the end of my days.

263
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Zhong Lin,

264
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,440
do you think one day

265
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,440
you'll leave me too?

266
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,560
I won't.

267
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,120
All right, stop thinking about it.

268
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,240
Close your eyes

269
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,480
and get some sleep.

270
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,160
Xiao Qianqing?

271
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,840
Xiao Qianqing?

272
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,320
XIAO QIANQING

273
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,840
<i>If you want to be mad at me,</i>

274
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
<i>then be mad.</i>

275
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,520
<i>But being angry for a while</i>

276
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,360
<i>is better than regretting it later.</i>

277
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
<i>Don't you think?</i>

278
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,240
<i>At noon today,</i>

279
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,200
<i>Du Tingxin is to visit</i>
<i>Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.</i>

280
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,040
<i>You can check</i>
<i>the East Hall of the Hot Spring Retreat.</i>

281
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,240
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

282
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,800
Is His Highness in?

283
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,800
His Highness is not in,
but Princess Zhong Lin is.

284
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,720
Madam, please.

285
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
Preceptor Du.

286
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,440
His Highness suddenly
had urgent business at the palace

287
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,320
and ordered me to wait here for you.

288
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,200
Please sit and wait a while.

289
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I've long heard
that you're unrivaled in tea and incense.

290
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,840
I wonder

291
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
if this Yunwuqing tea today

292
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,720
suits your taste.

293
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,120
Since His Highness is busy,
I'll see him another time then.

294
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,640
His Highness does have
matters to discuss with you.

295
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,240
Then I'll go into
the palace to see him myself.

296
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
No need for that.

297
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,480
What?

298
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm actually the one
who wanted to see you.

299
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,240
Why would we need to meet?

300
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,600
His Highness and I are already engaged.

301
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,520
I wanted to see you
of course because of him.

302
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,640
Then why go around him to come to me,

303
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,080
even going so far as to steal
his seal and stamp it in secret?

304
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,960
His Highness is keeping secrets with you,

305
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,120
yet won't tell me.

306
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,760
It worries me.

307
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,280
You're a woman too.

308
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,080
You should understand

309
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,840
there are some things
you have to see with your own eyes

310
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,800
before you can be at ease.

311
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,200
Our Princess Zhong Lin

312
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,520
really is wholeheartedly
devoted to His Highness.

313
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,880
Hearing you say that,

314
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm almost a little envious of him.

315
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,520
If you had to choose
between His Highness and Ling Cangcang,

316
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,440
Your Highness,

317
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,320
who would you choose?

318
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,920
Do you know

319
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,840
what kind of lonely, desperate situation
His Highness is in right now?

320
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,440
If he's deceived again,

321
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,280
how much more would he suffer?

322
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,320
My feelings for His Highness are love,
and Cangcang and I are like sisters.

323
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,000
Mind your words, Preceptor Du.

324
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,400
That's not something
I have to choose between.

325
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,400
I see.

326
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,960
Since you won't say anything,
then forget it.

327
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,160
You may go, Preceptor Du.

328
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,080
Don't think that with a few tricks,

329
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,960
Ling Cangcang will get to see him.

330
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,200
What do you mean by that, Preceptor Du?

331
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,600
You search over there.

332
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,560
- Everyone else, come with me!
- Yes, sir!

333
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,160
Zhong Lin,

334
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,920
do you know what you're doing?

335
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,080
Looks like

336
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
this letter

337
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,160
wasn't really Your Highness's intention.

338
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,680
You swear up and down you won't leave me,

339
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,240
yet you steal my seal
and scheme behind my back!

340
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,040
- We'll talk later.
- Save it!

341
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,440
So you were lying to me, coaxing me,

342
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,000
and betraying me all the same.

343
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,960
I've had enough of that.

344
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,920
You've misunderstood me.
That's not what I meant.

345
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
Then what did you mean?

346
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,880
Isn't this fake letter proof enough
that you betrayed me?

347
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,120
I didn't betray you! I…

348
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,440
Fine.

349
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,720
So you believe her, not me?

350
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,840
Guards!

351
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,040
Your Highness.

352
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,760
Take her back to her room.

353
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,080
Without my permission,
she's not to take a single step outside.

354
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes, Your Highness.

355
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,000
Now that Your Highness has returned,

356
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,880
you must know
this was just a ploy to lure you away.

357
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,720
I'll go with you to the retreat right now.

358
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,560
What, for something this minor,
Your Highness still doesn't trust me?

359
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,000
Today I've tasted betrayal to the fullest.

360
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,720
I owe all of this
entirely to my imperial brother.

361
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,240
I will make sure he pays me back double.

362
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,080
LINGQUAN PALACE

363
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,720
It's been days, and I finally get to
see you, Prince of Yuzhang.

364
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,160
Why did you put that thing on him?

365
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,120
Are you asking me?

366
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
Yes!

367
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,440
I'm asking you. Why did you put
something like that on him?

368
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,800
So what if I did?

369
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,120
I even want to kill him.

370
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,520
Didn't Your Highness promise me

371
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,320
that how to deal with him
would be entirely up to me?

372
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,160
However you want to
torment him to vent your anger,

373
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,120
I won't interfere.

374
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,520
But this thing… no.

375
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,880
Take it off him.

376
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,520
If not for this iron chain

377
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,080
that even blades can't cut,

378
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,920
our emperor would've escaped already.

379
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,320
Your Highness, have you gone soft?

380
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,640
So you've forgiven His Majesty so soon?

381
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,520
I only want him to
taste betrayal to the fullest.

382
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
But no matter what he's done,

383
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,800
he's still of the imperial bloodline.

384
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,000
The dignity of the imperial house

385
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,920
is not yours to trample.

386
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,040
This is where I draw the line.

387
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,040
It seems Your Highness
only acts on emotion

388
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,960
and has no real
ambition or resolve for great deeds.

389
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,200
I misjudged you.

390
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,800
Xiao Qianqing,

391
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,280
my throne can be yours.

392
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,000
What did you say?

393
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
If I swore

394
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,680
that I absolutely did not kill Xiao Ying,
would you believe me?

395
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,120
No.

396
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
You can have my throne,

397
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,120
but I have one condition.

398
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,840
Your Highness must not listen to him!

399
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,280
What condition?

400
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,360
I want to die with dignity.

401
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,280
Your Highness…

402
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,240
Silence!

403
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,920
If you still remember
I was once your elder brother,

404
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,560
then on the Empress Dowager's funeral day,

405
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,920
let me die with dignity

406
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,360
on Phoenix Terrace.

407
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,200
<i>His Majesty has already been moved</i>

408
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,520
<i>from the Hot Spring Retreat</i>
<i>back to the palace.</i>

409
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,000
<i>They say he'll attend</i>
<i>the Empress Dowager's grand funeral rites.</i>

410
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,920
DRAGON-PHOENIX BLESSINGS

411
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,680
Miss Zhong.

412
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,040
- Miss Zhong.
- Miss Zhong.

413
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,360
Zhong Lin, are you all right?

414
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,520
I'm late, Miss Ling. It took me some time
to shake the people tailing me.

415
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,160
As long as you're safe. Sit.

416
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,400
Everyone, sit.

417
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,920
Now that I've gathered you all here,

418
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm sure you know why.

419
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,680
The Capital is in turmoil.

420
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,720
Fenglai Pavilion
must share His Majesty's burdens

421
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,320
and stand with
Great Qi through this crisis.

422
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,640
Yes!

423
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,120
In my letter I've instructed Shi Yan
that within five days,

424
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,240
he is to lead our followers from
all branches in a coordinated strike.

425
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,400
When the time comes,

426
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,760
I'll need you all waiting outside the city
to help him slip into the Capital.

427
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,920
Yes!

428
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,200
Thank you.

429
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,120
<i>You left the Imperial Seal with me</i>

430
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,120
<i>because you already foresaw all this?</i>

431
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,240
SPIRIT TABLET OF
EMPRESS DOWAGER LIU OF GREAT QI

432
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,040
Seal the coffin!

433
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,480
Kneel!

434
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,240
Bow!

435
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,680
Rise!

436
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,720
Bow again!

437
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,760
Rise!

438
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,280
You may stand!
