ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Do you think

3
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,640
I won't kill you?

4
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,640
That's for Your Highness

5
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,880
to decide.

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
I only remember

7
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,800
that Her Highness loved
the world beyond the palace.

8
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,120
She wanted to leave
and see the flower fields.

9
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,240
I didn't want her to have any regrets.

10
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,360
Bring her back

11
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,080
in two hours.

12
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,760
I've returned.

13
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,360
I've brought you to see the flower fields.

14
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,920
QING

15
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,680
YING

16
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,400
<i>Li Hongqing,</i>

17
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm glad I found you.

18
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,880
<i>It's been seven days and</i>
<i>ten hours since I last saw you.</i>

19
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,520
<i>I've been thinking of you constantly.</i>

20
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
<i>Unable to eat or sleep.</i>

21
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,480
- Your Highness.
<i>- I'm fond of you.</i>

22
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,080
Do you feel the same?

23
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
Can you really take me out of the palace?

24
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,480
Can we travel the rivers and mountains,

25
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,120
see the fields of flowers?

26
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,480
Look, Your Highness.

27
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
Why didn't you wait for me?

28
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,520
Why couldn't you have
waited just a bit longer…

29
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
BLESSINGS AND FORTUNE

30
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,240
Ying,

31
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,040
when you were little,

32
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,920
you were born round and chubby.

33
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,440
I loved holding you close to me

34
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
in my arms.

35
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,920
Your big eyes

36
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,320
would sparkle at me, smiling.

37
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,680
Your Majesty,
Preceptor Du requests an audience.

38
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,440
I've heard about Princess Ying.

39
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,960
Please accept my condolences.

40
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,240
I've copied scriptures for Princess Ying.

41
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,480
I pray she ascends to bliss swiftly.

42
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
I didn't expect you

43
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,040
to come to my
Xuanguang Hall of your own accord.

44
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm merely grieving

45
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,920
for Her Highness.

46
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,160
I heard

47
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,760
Her Highness was regaining her senses.

48
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,000
But after Your Majesty's visit,

49
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
she passed away.

50
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,160
My Ying

51
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,400
was always improving and relapsing.

52
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,160
I never thought
His Majesty would cause her death.

53
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,320
I understand.

54
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Your Majesty had no choice.

55
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,680
You didn't want Ying to
suffer longer in this world.

56
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,520
I don't understand

57
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,600
what

58
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,760
you mean.

59
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
The late Emperor died suddenly,

60
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,560
followed by the fire at Luling Palace,

61
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,560
leaving Princess Ying deranged.

62
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,840
Her life

63
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
has been full of hardship.

64
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,840
What exactly brings you

65
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,120
here today?

66
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Since my youth,

67
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,040
I've served at His Majesty's side.

68
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,680
I wanted to serve

69
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,320
a wise ruler who could bring hope
to Great Qi.

70
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,040
Indeed.

71
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
You've always been loyal to him.

72
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,320
But now I no longer wish to be.

73
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,400
I want to help you

74
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,600
eliminate your real threat.

75
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,840
I intend to aid the Prince of Yuzhang
in seizing the throne.

76
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Why?

77
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
Why?

78
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,160
Perhaps it's because

79
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,280
I've been betrayed.

80
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,840
You give everything to someone,

81
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,560
yet he drifts further away

82
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
for an unworthy cause.

83
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,840
Disappointment turns to hatred over time.

84
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,880
Then, hatred festers

85
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,200
until you want him gone.

86
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,280
Surely, you must know

87
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
that feeling.

88
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,880
I don't understand your intentions.

89
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,120
<i>Do you know what you're saying?</i>

90
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
Unless you do this,

91
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,560
the Prince of Yuzhang's heart
will always be with his brother.

92
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,440
You'll never win it back.

93
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,960
You must fan the flames of
his resentment toward His Majesty.

94
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
Turn the brothers against each other

95
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
unto death.

96
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,280
Only then will he fight for the throne.

97
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
Princess Ying's death

98
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,040
has lit the first fire.

99
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,920
But it's not enough.

100
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
What do you mean?

101
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,920
Does Your Majesty dare to stake your life?

102
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,480
I have a poison here.

103
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Upon taking it,
one's breath and pulse quickly cease,

104
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,840
plunging you into a deathlike trance

105
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,360
while you remain fully conscious.

106
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,520
The antidote

107
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,840
will revive you in
moments from that sham death.

108
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
This slice of ginseng
has been pre-soaked in the antidote.

109
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
You can have a trusted aide

110
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,240
brew it into tea afterward,

111
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,320
or hold it under your tongue

112
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
before you take the poison.

113
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,720
The toxin

114
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,720
will clear

115
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,400
after 48 hours.

116
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,920
Do you think me

117
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,920
so easily deceived?

118
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
Please choose one, Your Majesty.

119
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,840
Fortune favors the bold.

120
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,640
No victory comes without risk.

121
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,880
Coming here to pledge allegiance

122
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,840
means I've burned my bridges.

123
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
The antidote is right here.

124
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Only you and I are present.

125
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,960
If you doubt me,

126
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,840
don't save me.

127
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,040
<i>Fortune favors the bold.</i>

128
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,160
<i>No victory comes without risk.</i>

129
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,840
<i>It's time to take the gamble.</i>

130
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,160
Father!

131
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,440
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

132
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
Physician Li,

133
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,920
didn't you send word to the palace

134
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,800
that my father showed signs of waking?

135
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,720
Me? I…

136
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,680
I don't recall…

137
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,080
Oh, no.

138
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
It's Xiao Huan.

139
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,640
Something has happened in the palace.

140
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,840
The Imperial Father-in-law has awakened!

141
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,760
Father.

142
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,480
Father.

143
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,960
You're awake.

144
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,240
Father!

145
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,440
- Cangcang…
- Yes? What is it?

146
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,360
Preceptor Du…

147
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
Preceptor Du?

148
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,319
He knew Preceptor Du was the mastermind,

149
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,040
so he arranged to draw
me away from the palace.

150
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,080
Cangcang…

151
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,840
Entrusting the jade seal to you

152
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,520
was his way

153
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
of ensuring your survival

154
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
and leaving

155
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,640
his last spark of hope.

156
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
He won't succeed.

157
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,480
I vowed I'd stand or fall with him.

158
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>I can make it. Xiao Huan,</i>

159
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
<i>wait for me.</i>

160
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm sorry.

161
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,200
For some reason,

162
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,440
I felt I had to say that to you.

163
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Qianqing.

164
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
Why are you here?

165
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,600
Ying's cause of death is unclear.

166
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,960
Regardless of what happened,

167
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,520
I can't let her die without answers.

168
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,440
I must investigate.

169
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,000
Her cause of death is unclear?

170
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,160
Weren't you the one who killed her?

171
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,040
If she truly died because of me,

172
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,960
I won't deny it.

173
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,840
Don't bother.

174
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,320
I hate myself

175
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,400
for ever agreeing to let you
remove the poison from Ying.

176
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,440
I should have taken her from this palace,

177
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,480
from this wretched place.

178
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Ying's death is on our hands,

179
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,560
you and I.

180
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,720
Xiao Qianqing,

181
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,240
calm yourself and think this through.

182
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,640
Doesn't Ying's death seem suspicious?

183
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,920
Do you want even her death exploited?

184
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,720
Suspicious?

185
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,400
Elaborate.

186
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,040
She was nearly cured,

187
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,200
then this happened out of the blue.

188
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,400
Think harder.

189
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,960
Maybe someone
didn't want her to regain her wits.

190
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,960
Lies!

191
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,080
My Ying passed without finding peace.

192
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,840
Qianqing, look at your sister.

193
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,920
How can you be shaken by a few words
from him?

194
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
Mother,

195
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,560
he has no reason to kill Ying at all.

196
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,200
You forgot.

197
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,720
Ying caused him to lose his child.

198
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,800
The Empress's first child.

199
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,520
Do you really believe

200
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
he had no reason to harm Ying?

201
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,240
I've said I won't pursue it.

202
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,120
One can bide one's time for
the right opportunity to seek vengeance.

203
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,400
Your schemes run deeper than the sea.

204
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,480
Qianqing, will you never understand?

205
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
No.

206
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,680
We grew up together.

207
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,960
Though he's cunning,

208
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
he is not that sort of man.

209
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,320
My foolish son.

210
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,600
How can you be so innocent as to believe

211
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,080
in brotherhood and sincerity

212
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,640
within these palace walls?

213
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,800
There's nothing to gain
from him killing Ying.

214
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,120
Gain?

215
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,240
Ling Xuefeng already made him wary.

216
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,120
He fears more palace unrest,
another upheaval.

217
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
He only wants to eliminate opponents.

218
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,840
He claims Ying's death
was meant to incriminate someone.

219
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,960
Surely it's aimed at implicating me.

220
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,760
He already took out Ling Xuefeng.

221
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
Now, it's my turn. You'll be next.

222
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,360
We will all become sacrifices
to his consolidation of power.

223
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,000
Empress Dowager Liu,

224
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,880
stop weaving tales.

225
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,160
- Trust me.
- He only wants to find the mastermind.

226
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,680
The mastermind? Who?

227
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,680
He is the mastermind! He killed Ying!

228
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Qianqing…

229
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,800
Qianqing,

230
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,280
would you rather trust him

231
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,800
than me?

232
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,000
Ying.

233
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Your brother

234
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,720
distrusts and defies me

235
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,280
utterly.

236
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,120
I might as well
join you among the departed.

237
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,360
Mother!

238
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,120
Mother, what did you take?

239
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,040
Mother!

240
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Qianqing,

241
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,000
you've grown distant

242
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,560
as you matured.

243
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,040
But everything I do is for you.

244
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,200
You may not believe me,

245
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,760
but remember,

246
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,400
here in this palace,

247
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,800
all seek power and gain.

248
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,640
Even if you refuse to contend,

249
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,760
your foes will never spare you.

250
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,400
Do not…

251
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,720
Do not

252
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,200
be deceived

253
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,160
by him again…

254
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,800
Mother…

255
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Mother…

256
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,120
Mother!

257
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,520
Mother…

258
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
Are you satisfied now?

259
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
Is this what you wanted?

260
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,880
From now on,

261
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,440
my mother will no longer vex your eyes.

262
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,560
My sister will no longer
scheme to assassinate you.

263
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,040
- Are you happy now?
- Qianqing.

264
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,800
So all this,

265
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,680
including the mastermind,

266
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,280
was you all along! It was all you!

267
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,960
Xiao Qianqing, have you lost your mind?

268
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,880
HEAVEN AND EARTH

269
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,880
YAOQING HALL

270
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,480
Madam,

271
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,480
the Prince of Yuzhang has
made a move against His Majesty.

272
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This day has finally come.

273
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,120
Ms. Yan.

274
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,520
Yes, Madam.

275
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,080
You've always called my
mother's life fragile as paper.

276
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,760
You're afraid love will destroy me

277
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,040
as it did her.

278
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
See here.

279
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,240
My lifespan is long enough now, isn't it?

280
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,960
Madam…

281
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Rest assured.

282
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,440
I will no longer let
affections dictate my life.

283
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,800
I will sever

284
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,680
all these ties.

285
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,160
My destiny rests with me, not the heavens.

286
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
My only love

287
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,240
is for myself.

288
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,520
If heaven refuses me,

289
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,080
I will defy it!

290
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,640
NANRONG PALACE

291
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,600
Is this a rebellion?

292
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,160
Your Majesty is correct.

293
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,520
Today,

294
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,040
we rebel.

295
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,840
Du Tingxin.

296
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,760
It's you indeed.

297
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
You betray me?

298
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,080
I once served Your Majesty

299
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
with loyalty.

300
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,040
Yet,

301
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,760
you have deeply disappointed me.

302
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,480
You're the one behind Ling Xuefeng.

303
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,160
What are you saying?

304
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,280
I fail to understand.

305
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,640
Report!

306
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,040
Preceptor Du,
we've searched the entire palace.

307
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,200
The Empress is not here.

308
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,200
You let Ling Cangcang escape!

309
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,640
Relay my orders.

310
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,600
Should the Empress return,
kill her on sight.

311
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,640
Understood.

312
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Du Tingxin,

313
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,040
you dare!

314
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,720
I have already rebelled.

315
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Why should I balk at one more death?

316
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,320
- Kill him!
- Stop!

317
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,200
He is the Emperor of Great Qi.

318
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,600
You cannot kill him on a whim.

319
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,600
Prince of Yuzhang,

320
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,520
he has betrayed you so.

321
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,480
Don't you want his life?

322
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,880
My sister died.

323
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
My mother died to prove her cause.

324
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,280
Killing him outright
would be too easy on him.

325
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,120
Take His Majesty away to rest.

326
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
Prince of Yuzhang,

327
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,360
- I'm helping you.
- Helping me?

328
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,640
All these years,
your fealty was to Xiao Huan.

329
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,160
Yet now you turn to aid me instead?

330
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,080
I am the Imperial Preceptor.

331
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,480
I serve Great Qi.

332
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,560
My loyalty is not to one man,

333
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
nor just to Xiao Huan.

334
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,840
But to the world, to Great Qi.

335
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,960
I choose

336
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,840
to support Your Highness's ascension.

337
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,880
Do you think

338
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,320
I would trust a madwoman?

339
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,880
I have never sought the throne.

340
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
You will want it.

341
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,080
Your brother, the current Emperor,

342
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,920
slaughtered Princess Ying
and drove the Empress Dowager to despair,

343
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,400
all to secure his throne.

344
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,680
If he desires the throne so,

345
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,400
why not take it from him?

346
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,360
When you become Emperor,

347
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,160
watch how remorseful

348
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,200
your brother will be.

349
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,000
That will be justice served.

350
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,800
Why?

351
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,560
Why do you revolt then?

352
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,000
If you wish to ally with me,

353
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,920
I must know why.

354
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,360
Or how can I trust you?

355
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,760
Why do I rebel?

356
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,440
He gave Ling Cangcang
the remedy meant to save himself.

357
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,560
His very life
I wrested from death's grasp,

358
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,040
tending cauldrons through endless nights,

359
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,280
testing remedies,
needling meridians without respite!

360
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,320
If he won't cherish his life,

361
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,320
then I must be the one to destroy it.

362
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,840
You truly are a pitiful lunatic.

363
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,800
Indeed.

364
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,680
Thus, I can no longer
indulge in such affections.

365
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,560
Either way,

366
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
I no longer deserve to.

367
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,000
On the day my mother
and Ying are laid to rest,

368
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,000
I want Xiao Huan to die as penance.

369
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,360
But until then,

370
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,360
I want him alive.

371
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,000
Very well. It shall be as you wish.

372
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,920
LINGQUAN PALACE

373
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Leave us.

374
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,000
Your Majesty.

375
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,520
I know you can hear me.

376
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,320
That's why I'm here

377
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,200
to speak with you.

378
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,480
You've always known who I truly am.

379
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,400
You've never
received the late Emperor's love,

380
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,080
so you refuse
to let any woman he favored live.

381
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,520
My mother had to be sacrificed.

382
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,520
Isn't that right?

383
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,680
The truth is, the poison I gave you

384
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
won't truly take effect

385
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,240
for three days.

386
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,440
By then,

387
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,720
you'll already be
sealed in your lavish coffin.

388
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,320
Mother,

389
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,120
rest easy.

390
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,640
I'll reclaim
everything this world owes me,

391
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,560
piece by piece.

392
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,080
If heaven and earth reject me,

393
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,400
so be it.

394
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,600
XUANGUANG HALL

395
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
SPIRIT TABLET OF
EMPRESS DOWAGER LIU OF GREAT QI

396
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,440
Kneel.

397
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,280
Prince of Yuzhang, pardon my impertinence.

398
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,080
But where lies Princess Ying's remains?

399
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Why is Her Highness not given a funeral
and interment in the Imperial Mausoleum?

400
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,120
This defies all custom.

401
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,920
I despise
your prattle of rites and tradition

402
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,520
while meddling where you don't belong,

403
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,800
cloaked in false virtue.

404
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,680
Ying spent her life
confined in the cold palace.

405
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
When did you ever treat her

406
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,880
as a princess?

407
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,440
Now that she's freed at last,

408
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,200
you all suddenly remember her title.

409
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,560
When she was alive,
she languished in the cold palace.

410
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
In death,

411
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,160
must she be trapped in
the Imperial Mausoleum too?

412
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,720
His Majesty has been in indisposition.

413
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,480
As Your Highness
handles state affairs in his stead,

414
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,560
you should tread
carefully and uphold rites above all.

415
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,240
Rites?

416
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,040
What rites

417
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,840
do you speak of?

418
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,600
Please grant Her Highness
the proper rites befitting her title,

419
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,960
and bury her swiftly.

420
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,440
To heck with them!

421
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,080
Your Highness…

422
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,120
Minister Ding, how fortunate
you must be that your family boasts

423
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,120
four generations under one roof.

424
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,200
If you've never
known the grief of losing kin,

425
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,240
I can arrange for
you to experience it now,

426
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,280
so you shall never spout

427
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,680
such utter nonsense again!

428
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
I…

429
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,560
You all enjoy fatherly piety,

430
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,840
filial children,

431
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,120
and family bliss.

432
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,360
So why can't
you allow one departed princess

433
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,760
her ascent to heaven?

434
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,600
Must you deny her peace in life
and death alike?

435
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,320
I know you're grieving too deeply
to hear anything now.

436
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,480
So I'll say just this.

437
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,960
I'll always be by your side.
