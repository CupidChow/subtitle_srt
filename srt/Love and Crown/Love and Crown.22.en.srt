ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN" BY
XIE LOUNAN

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,720
I love your baked pears the most.

3
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,240
Your mother made them better.

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,880
I can never get them to taste like hers.

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
That's not true.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,920
I like your pears

7
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,040
better than anyone's.

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,680
Oh, yes.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,160
Jueding sent a letter.

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,360
He mentioned your trip to Jiangzhou.

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
That journey

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
must've been hard on you.

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
Not at all.

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,680
I promised you and Mother

15
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,000
I'd look after Jueding
and make sure nothing happens to him.

16
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,760
Good. Very good.

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
By the way,

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,880
the day after tomorrow
is your mother's death anniversary.

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,160
Come home and pay your respects.

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,800
All right.

21
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,920
Since Your Majesty plans to return home,

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
there will be many things to prepare.

23
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,600
This old minister will take his leave now.

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,000
Father…

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
the pears aren't done yet.

26
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
I'll bake some for you next time.

27
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,680
Father…

My Lord.

31
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,279
- Young Master Xianxue has returned.
- Where is he?

32
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,320
He found out
that we poisoned the Young Lady.

33
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,120
I love your baked pears the most.

34
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
Father…

35
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,440
the pears aren't done yet.

36
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,520
It seems…

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
they already know the truth.

38
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
My Lord,

39
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,280
then won't he be a danger to us?

40
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,040
He knows too much.

41
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,680
Kill him!

42
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,840
Your Majesty!

43
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,120
Who's there?

44
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
My own empress can't even recognize me?

45
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,240
If I really hadn't recognized you,

46
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,600
I would've started
swinging at you already.

47
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,520
Why are you practicing
swordplay blindfolded?

48
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,720
With my eyes covered, I can sense
the shifts in the air around me,

49
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,160
and my sword work can improve.

50
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,680
You're working this hard
because you're afraid I can't protect you?

51
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,560
Don't say that.
I'm the proud leader of Fenglai Pavilion.

52
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,560
When it really counts,
I can protect you too!

53
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,040
You're right, Leader Ling.

54
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,080
My apologies.

55
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,680
Since… you're easy on the eyes,

56
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,120
I'll let you off.

57
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,200
Is my empress flirting with me?

58
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,760
Can't I?

59
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
You can.

60
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,080
The day after tomorrow
is your mother's death anniversary.

61
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,520
I can go back with you.

62
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
I think…

63
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,600
I'd better go alone.

64
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,440
There are things I have to face on my own.

65
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,640
I can't keep running away.

66
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,520
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of myself.

67
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,280
All right then.

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,160
LING MANOR

69
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
Cangcang, you're back.

70
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
Father.

71
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't see you just now,
so I came to look for you in your study.

72
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,640
The crack on this
inkstone reminds me of the past.

73
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,960
When I was little,
I knocked it over by accident.

74
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,600
I was scared to death,
since it was your favorite inkstone.

75
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Back then,

76
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,320
your mother risked her life to shield you

77
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,760
and spared you a beating.

78
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,480
I never thought

79
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,880
you still remembered that.

80
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Of course I do.

81
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
Your mother said,

82
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,440
"It's just a crack. It still works fine."

83
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,160
I never thought

84
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,680
I'd keep using it all these years

85
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,160
and still not throw it away.

86
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,360
Father, let's go visit Mother.

87
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,760
All right.

88
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,760
Every year,

89
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,160
you set out her favorite green plum wine
for Mother.

90
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,160
That's right.

91
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,840
Your mother loved her wine.

92
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,760
Whenever she got tipsy,
she'd dance with her sword.

93
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,760
I can never forget…

94
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
SPIRIT TABLET OF
THE LATE LADY SHEN OF THE LING CLAN

95
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,120
how she danced
with her sword beneath the plum tree.

96
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
Every little thing about her,

97
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,040
every memory,

98
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,160
I still remember.

99
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,920
Enough of that.

100
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,160
Look what I've prepared for you.

101
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,960
I knew you were coming today,

102
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,400
so I went to the kitchen early

103
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,960
to bake you some pears.

104
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
See? They're still warm.

105
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,400
Hurry, eat them.

106
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,560
I just don't know

107
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
if this batch tastes

108
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,240
anything like your mother's.

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Father,

110
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,160
on our way back to the Capital,

111
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,760
we were ambushed.

112
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,880
The assassin…

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,480
was Luo.

114
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,920
These days, I've been thinking,

115
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
thinking for a long time.

116
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,680
When I saw you again,

117
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,120
what should I say,

118
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,440
how should I begin,

119
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,280
what should I ask?

120
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,480
Go ahead and ask.

121
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,040
If I do, will you answer me?

122
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Will you tell me the truth?

123
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,920
I will.

124
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,920
You know, in front of your mother,

125
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,040
I never lie.

126
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,320
Father,

127
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,480
did you

128
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,560
put Lovesickness Powder
into my pear blossom honey?

129
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,520
I did.

130
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
And did you…

131
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
also poison it?

132
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I did.

133
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,480
So…

134
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,120
when you kept calling me Cangcang,

135
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,880
calling me your precious daughter,

136
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,120
- was any of that real?
- Cangcang!

137
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,880
I was absolutely certain
His Majesty would save you!

138
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,320
But you say an emperor is heartless.

139
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,800
If you really believed he'd save me,

140
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
is he heartless or not in your eyes?

141
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,000
To you, Father,

142
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,640
whether he's heartless or not
depends on which answer helps you.

143
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
And whether
you love your precious daughter

144
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,040
depends on whether she hinders
your grand plans. Isn't that right?

145
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,520
Cangcang, you… you have to believe me.

146
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,000
Sometimes,

147
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,400
I have no choice but to weigh and choose.

148
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,840
And everything I've done…

149
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,440
was for our Ling clan!

150
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,640
You've already made your choice!

151
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,560
You chose

152
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,880
to be a ruthless Grand Tutor,

153
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,000
even at the cost of your daughter's life.

154
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,080
Didn't you?

155
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,920
Cangcang…

156
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,520
I have my own reasons!

157
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,080
The hunger for power is endless.

158
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,480
Stop saying it's for me,

159
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,560
for the Ling clan, for Jueding.

160
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,200
If you stop now,
it's still not too late to turn back!

161
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,240
Your Majesty,

162
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,080
you want to teach me how to live?

163
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
I can never repay all you've done for me.

164
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,360
I only beg you:

165
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
if you don't stop now,

166
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,960
there'll be no turning back.

167
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
Very well.

168
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,120
So when Your Majesty went to my study,

169
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,920
you were looking for evidence?

170
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
Did you really think no
one else would expose you?

171
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,120
You mean Luo Xianxue?

172
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,040
He treasures you like his own life.

173
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,000
For your sake,

174
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,920
he can tell you certain things.

175
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
But do you really think

176
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,000
he could come back alive?

177
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,600
What did you do to him?

178
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,280
Luo is the foster son

179
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,960
you raised from childhood.

180
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,200
And you still wouldn't spare him.

181
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,320
So tell me, Father…

182
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,320
what will you do with
your precious daughter?

183
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,040
Kill me?

184
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
How could I bear to?

185
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
"Her Majesty

186
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,800
has returned home
to mourn her late mother.

187
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,720
Overcome with grief,
she has fallen gravely ill

188
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,000
and will remain here

189
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
for a time". That is all.

190
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,040
Do you really think
His Majesty will let you live?

191
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
With Your Majesty in my hands,

192
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,480
he won't dare act rashly.

193
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,800
You chose him

194
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,640
because in your heart

195
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,400
he's a man of feeling and honor, isn't he?

196
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,560
Yet he hurt you and lied to you!

197
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,280
He even killed the master you loved most.
And now he wants to kill your father!

198
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,480
And yet

199
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,080
you still choose to stand with him?

200
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,680
From beginning to end,
I never meant to kill you.

201
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Did you think
that by getting rid of Luo Xianxue,

202
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,120
you could erase
your ties to the Lingbi Sect

203
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,760
and the proof of
your treason and regicide?

204
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,080
I have far too much evidence
of your crimes in my hands.

205
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,280
Sir,

206
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,760
do you recall a move
you taught me at chess?

207
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,240
"Drive in a wedge
and shatter the formation."

208
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,680
So, you used Luo Xianxue as that wedge

209
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,880
to lull my pieces
into dropping their guard?

210
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
That's right.

211
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,400
If Luo learned you once poisoned Cangcang,

212
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,640
he'd dig out the truth.

213
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,080
But you would never leave
a piece you couldn't control.

214
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,040
So,

215
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,040
I let him go on purpose.

216
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,640
While you were busy
purging your own ranks,

217
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,560
I could tighten the net I'd cast.

218
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
<i>Secretly forging weapons,</i>

219
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,840
<i>skimming off grain,</i>
<i>rigging prices, controlling intelligence…</i>

220
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,040
<i>As an elder of two reigns,</i>

221
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,720
<i>you've spent years weaving your power.</i>

222
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,840
To wipe it out in one stroke
is no easy task.

223
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
Sir, for this day,

224
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
I've been planning for many years.

225
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,960
Since it's come to this,

226
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,600
kill me or punish me as you please.

227
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,960
I told you,

228
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,480
I've never once thought of killing you.

229
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,560
I'll spare your life
and spare the entire Ling clan.

230
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,240
I will not allow my empress

231
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,600
to have a traitorous father

232
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,200
and a rebel family.

233
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,840
What did I always teach you?

234
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,960
Remove the threat completely.
You never soften your heart.

235
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Letting me go today might just be…

236
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,680
your greatest mistake.

237
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,120
Sir, take care of yourself.

238
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,560
Let's go, Cangcang.

239
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,080
Cangcang!

240
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,800
My Lord,
we failed to kill Young Master Xianxue.

241
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,760
We await your punishment.

242
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,800
He's no longer

243
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,040
the Luo Xianxue he once was.

244
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,840
He asked me to bring you a message.

245
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Speak.

246
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,000
He said…

247
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,240
Go back and tell my foster father

248
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,240
he saved my life and raised me.

249
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,240
More importantly,

250
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,680
he's Cangcang's father.

251
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,480
Hurting him is hurting Cangcang.

252
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,440
That's something

253
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,080
I would never do!

254
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,760
After a lifetime of reading hearts,

255
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,640
in the end,

256
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,920
it was he who taught me a lesson.

257
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,920
True.

258
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
No one in this world

259
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,760
can escape love.

260
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,520
Once you care,

261
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,240
you grow a weak spot.

262
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,560
NANRONG PALACE

263
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,800
Wash it carefully. There's a smell.

264
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,600
You're the purest soul in Great Qi.
How could there be any smell?

265
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,800
Madam.

266
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,240
I never imagined

267
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,320
that one day

268
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,080
I'd drink tea personally brewed by you.

269
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,760
Nor did I imagine

270
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,680
that one day

271
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
you'd dare come see me.

272
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,200
I haven't forgotten

273
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,960
who forced my mother to her death.

274
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,960
The situation left us no choice.

275
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,320
The late Preceptor died for the sect.

276
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,640
It was not one man's doing.

277
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,880
We're both smart enough.

278
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,120
Spit out

279
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,520
what you came to say.

280
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,560
All right.

281
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,000
Tell me, to this day,

282
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,320
do you still believe

283
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,560
you'll serve
His Majesty alone all your life?

284
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,760
What are you getting at?

285
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,480
Here's a letter.

286
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,200
It holds a secret I've kept

287
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,120
for the imperial
family for over ten years.

288
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,880
You can read it.

289
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,480
Read it on your own.

290
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,440
When you've finished, think carefully

291
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,720
about what I just said.

292
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,400
It smells wonderful.

293
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,640
This top-quality jasmine tea

294
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,800
really does have a pure, lofty aroma.

295
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,520
But once you taste it,
it's fierce and overpowering,

296
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,320
nothing like its calm, desireless scent.

297
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,640
<i>Madam, you know what?</i>

298
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,000
<i>You are the late Emperor's daughter.</i>

299
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,880
<i>"All living beings are</i>
<i>trapped in love and hate.</i>

300
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,920
<i>Though I serve as Imperial Preceptor,</i>

301
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
<i>I cannot escape it either.</i>

302
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,240
<i>I only pray my child</i>
<i>can escape this crisis</i>

303
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,120
<i>and grow up safe.</i>

304
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,760
<i>My child truly carries imperial blood.</i>

305
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,680
<i>I swear on my life!"</i>

306
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,640
Is this blood-letter telling the truth?

307
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,240
Nanrong…

308
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,480
Nanrong…

309
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,280
No wonder I'm so unwelcome in the world!

310
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,240
CHANGHE GATE

311
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,720
What great matter is this?

312
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,680
I've served
through two reigns as Grand Chancellor,

313
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,880
blessed with wise rulers.

314
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,600
I rode to war with the late Emperor,

315
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,360
and helped Your Majesty
open this golden age.

316
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,880
That is enough for one lifetime.

317
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,800
Now that I am old,

318
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,320
I wish to retire to the hills
and lay down my burdens.

319
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,400
I humbly ask Your Majesty
to grant this request.

320
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,440
Granted!

321
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,160
May Your Majesty
set your heart for Heaven and Earth,

322
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,480
give the people a sure foundation,

323
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,360
carry on the teachings of the sages,

324
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,800
and open an age of peace for all time!

325
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,920
May Great Qi

326
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,760
endure for generations,

327
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,320
its realm forever secure!

328
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,120
I kiss the ground in thanks

329
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,360
for Your Majesty's grace!

330
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,480
A power in his own age,
pillar of two reigns,

331
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,840
he retires just like that.

332
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,200
Strike now, or he'll be a threat later.

333
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,160
QI

334
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,120
FUGUANG HALL

335
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,520
I still remember

336
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,480
it was right here

337
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,400
you waited for me in the snow.

338
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,760
You said you'd make me Grand Chancellor

339
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,280
and make Cangcang your empress.

340
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,360
I've done everything I promised.

341
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,000
Your Majesty is true to your word.

342
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,160
You'll always do exactly as you say.

343
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,240
I promised to spare your life
and protect the Ling clan.

344
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,360
I'll keep my word.
No need to remind me again.

345
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Then I have worried too much.

346
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,960
I wish Your Majesty
and Her Majesty good health.

347
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,840
From this day on,

348
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,280
I only wish to find

349
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,840
some quiet place of retreat.

350
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,679
I will not return

351
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,600
to this palace again.

352
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,080
LING MANOR

353
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,719
By His Majesty's command,
I am here to escort you to Deer Courtyard.

354
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,080
Thank you, General.

355
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,880
REFUGE IN THE DHARMA REALM

356
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,560
Sir, what did you pray for?

357
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,880
To retire in peace.

358
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
Nothing more.

359
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,360
And what do you wish for, General Lu?

360
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,120
Only that the one in my heart

361
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
stays safe and well.

362
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,000
So, you're a man of feeling too.

363
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,040
WUYING HALL

364
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,080
Madam, you don't look well lately.

365
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,240
You seem very pale.

366
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,720
I have an urgent matter
and must see His Majesty.

367
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,000
Is His Majesty really not here?

368
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,720
I know…

369
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,000
he hasn't wanted to see me lately,

370
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,320
but this time it's truly important.

371
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,480
Please, I beg you.

372
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,920
Madam,

373
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,600
His Majesty truly isn't here.

374
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
Eunuch Feng,

375
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,640
where is he?

376
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,760
Where is he?

377
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,280
Madam,

378
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,280
forgive this old servant.

379
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,400
His Majesty truly isn't here.

380
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,040
WUYING HALL

381
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,800
Your Majesty…

382
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,880
Madam,

383
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,440
shall I summon the imperial
physician to take a look at you?

384
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,040
Physician Li is in the palace.

385
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,040
No need…

386
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,120
No need…

387
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,920
No need…

388
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,840
Madam,

389
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,560
the wintersweet
in the imperial garden is in full bloom.

390
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,520
Why not go and have a look?

391
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,680
Cangcang, it's all over now.

392
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,800
I often wonder

393
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,280
if we had never begun,

394
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,480
would things be different?

395
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,760
Don't.

396
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,520
There are no what-ifs.
Everything has already begun.

397
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,560
Sky so vast, wild plains so wide…

398
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,040
My mother named me Cangcang

399
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,640
hoping that in this vast world

400
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,400
I could live free and easy.

401
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,320
If she could see me like this now,

402
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,240
what would she think?

403
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,320
Father said

404
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,600
when you were fourteen,

405
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,000
you waited for him
all night at Xishi Gate.

406
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,240
It wasn't quite all night.

407
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
I knew he would enter by Xishi Gate,

408
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,840
so I went there at
the Yin Hour to wait for him.

409
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,320
That day, snow was falling thick,
and it was bitterly cold.

410
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,840
Your Highness, you've always been frail.

411
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,760
Why suffer the cold here to wait for me?

412
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,480
Sir, is your daughter named Cangcang?

413
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,360
Your Highness,
I do have a girl named Cangcang.

414
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,800
She's eight this year,
and terribly mischievous.

415
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,120
Sir, are you willing

416
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,360
to betroth her to me as my future empress?

417
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,040
Your Highness,
do you know what you're saying?

418
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,840
Today, I stand here in snow,
waiting for you.

419
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,880
I know exactly what I'm saying.

420
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,960
Your Highness, rise!

421
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,040
Teacher, please accept my bow!

422
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,360
If one day, I ascend the throne,
I will make you the Grand Chancellor,

423
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,280
and make Cangcang my empress.

424
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,480
Get up!

425
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,800
You must be cold…

426
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,440
So,

427
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,200
how did your father see that day?

428
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,400
Father said our engagement
was a deal struck ten years ago.

429
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,320
He was being kind.

430
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,640
Ten years ago…

431
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,840
what right did I have
to bargain with Grand Tutor?

432
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,680
I was only clinging to a last lifeline.

433
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Father also said

434
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,640
that you from ten years ago
were no different from the man he is now.

435
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,080
No.

436
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,640
Back then, I only wanted to live.

437
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,200
Cangcang, I am indeed a chess player.

438
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,600
All my life, I've been playing the game,

439
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,560
weighing gain and loss with every move.

440
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,040
But taking you as my wife

441
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,720
is the best thing
all my plotting ever won me.

442
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,760
<i>And hiding my true origins</i>

443
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,040
<i>was just another move in your game?</i>

444
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,920
<i>He's weighed gains and losses…</i>
