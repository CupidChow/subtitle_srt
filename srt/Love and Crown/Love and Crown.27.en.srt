00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM
THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i> BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,880
Since you've already seen everything,

3
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,600
then allow me

4
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,120
to send His Majesty off
on his final journey.

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
Do it.

6
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,480
Ling Jueding, Governor of Jiangzhou,

7
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,200
is here by order to safeguard His Majesty!

8
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
The traitors have been eradicated.

9
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Ling Xuefeng, time to come to your senses.

10
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,200
Jueding…

11
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,280
So your business in Xijiang was
just a ruse,

12
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
and you slipped back into the Capital

13
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,480
all so you could strike
your own father down!

14
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Father!

15
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
You don't have to do this.

16
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,240
I… I don't need your lecture!

17
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Xiao Huan…

18
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,440
You truly are
the finest student I've ever taught.

19
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,760
Today, I am

20
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,920
defeated fair and square.

21
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,840
You ordered Lu Qi to use Ying
to assassinate His Majesty.

22
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,440
When that failed,

23
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,760
you tried one last desperate gamble.

24
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,840
At the Imperial Assembly,

25
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,520
you meant to seize the throne.

26
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,520
Ling Xuefeng, how dare you!

27
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,200
The saying is true.
Victors are kings, losers are nothing.

28
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,040
You want to saddle me
with every crime, old and new.

29
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,680
General Lu.

30
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,120
Should I answer

31
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,120
for these crimes?

32
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Ling Xuefeng!

33
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,960
You ordered me to use Princess Ying

34
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,920
to strike at His Majesty
and commit treason.

35
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,040
You dragged me down with you.
Pay with your life!

36
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,680
Teacher, you've lost in the end.

37
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,000
<i>Considering Father's old age</i>

38
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,880
<i>and the guidance he once gave him,</i>

39
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,880
<i>His Majesty has granted Father leave</i>
<i>to cultivate peace at Fayun Temple</i>

40
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,440
<i>to pray for the Empress's well-being,</i>

41
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
<i>and to repent your sins.</i>

42
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,000
Father…

43
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
At this point,

44
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,720
there's no turning back.

45
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Tingxin…

46
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,840
The Lu clan has stood loyal
for generations.

47
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Now that you've gone this far,

48
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,200
do you regret it?

49
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
Tingxin…

50
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
I, Lu Qi,

51
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
will never break my word.

52
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,920
For you, I'd gladly give my life.

53
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,680
No regret.

54
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,680
No resentment.

55
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm fine.

56
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,920
He'll never get the chance to expose me.

57
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,800
<i>Xiao Huan,</i>

58
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,920
<i>you cost me the best pawn I had.</i>

59
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,320
HEAVEN AND EARTH

60
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,320
Ling Xuefeng knows far too many secrets.

61
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
He must…

62
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,640
He must die.

63
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
Yes.

64
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,760
Father.

65
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,880
Spring is still bitter and cold.

66
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,400
Your Majesty should be recovering
in the palace.

67
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,240
Why would you come
to see a condemned sinner?

68
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,320
I can't make sense of it.

69
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,480
I truly can't.

70
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Why, Father…

71
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
Why did you still choose this path?

72
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,080
His Majesty already allowed you
to retire in peace.

73
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,000
So why?

74
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,520
I, Ling Xuefeng,

75
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,880
spent decades pouring my life
into Great Qi, rising through the court,

76
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,560
clawing my way forward.

77
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,760
Everything I did was for Great Qi.

78
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
It was either forward or fall behind.

79
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,040
If I couldn't take a step ahead,

80
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
I'd face the same fate

81
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,120
all powerful ministers do.

82
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,080
Homes seized.

83
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,960
Families executed.

84
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,720
Father.

85
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,760
You shouldn't have fought for

86
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,200
what was never yours.

87
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,280
To you, this is ambition.

88
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,000
To me,

89
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,920
it's what my whole life has been.

90
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,320
And now,

91
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,400
what angers me most is

92
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that I was one move away from winning.

93
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,440
But I have no regrets.

94
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,480
Jueding has already asked His Majesty

95
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,760
to lead the entire Ling clan

96
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
away from the Capital,

97
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,200
to the cold northern frontiers,

98
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,080
to guard the borders for Great Qi
and never return.

99
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,920
Father.

100
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,080
I've failed you.

101
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,600
From now on…

102
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,280
I can't come to see you again.

103
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
I…

104
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,080
thank you

105
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,520
for raising me.

106
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,920
Cangcang!

107
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,520
In my entire life,

108
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,320
the deepest regret

109
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,080
was dragging you into all this.

110
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,760
Back then,

111
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,440
when you didn't want to marry Xiao Huan,

112
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,000
when you wanted to flee the marriage,

113
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,840
I'd wanted to let you go.

114
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,280
Now…

115
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,800
If you still wish to leave,

116
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,960
go with Jueding.

117
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,840
Leave the Capital behind.

118
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,880
All I wish for you

119
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,520
is peace and happiness.

120
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,400
May the Buddha

121
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,880
keep you safe for me.

122
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,800
Father…

123
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
My Lady. I will stay here
to watch over your father.

124
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
You need not worry.

125
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,920
Father!

126
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Father!

127
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,720
Luo! Luo!

128
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,160
Luo!

129
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
How's the injury?

130
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Are you all right?

131
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,760
Cangcang…

132
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,400
I managed to save you

133
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,240
at the last moment.
I have no regrets in this life.

134
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,720
Don't say that. Don't say that!

135
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,520
Stay with me. I'll get you out.

136
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,160
Hold on. Come on. Come on.

137
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,160
Cangcang…

138
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,760
I fear that in the days ahead,

139
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

140
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,160
Luo Xianxue,

141
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
I won't let you die.

142
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,000
You told me you'd stay strong
and keep living for my sake.

143
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,520
You can't break your word.

144
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,720
Do you hear me?

145
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,880
Luo!

146
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,080
Luo! Luo!

147
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
- Luo!
- Cangcang,

148
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,120
don't be sad.

149
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,520
Don't cry.

150
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,040
Luo.

151
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,400
Luo.

152
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,840
I, Luo Xianxue, swear to the heavens.

153
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,760
I, Luo Xianxue, swear to the heavens.

154
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,560
<i>From this day on,</i>
<i>I belong to Ling Cangcang.</i>

155
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,520
<i>No matter how hard the road,</i>

156
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,480
<i>for Ling Cangcang's sake,</i>

157
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,360

REFUGE IN THE DHARMA REALM

160
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,840
Father. Slowly.

161
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,440
Father!

162
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,120
Father!

163
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,920
Pre…

164
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,920
Father!

Pre…

166
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,800
Father!

167
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,320
Father!

168
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,080
Father!

169
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,360

<i>Those who truly</i>

<i>cared for me in this world</i>

173
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,800
<i>are all gone.</i>

174
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
<i>It's time you tasted</i>

175
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,160
<i>this grief of losing one's own.</i>

176
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,320
Well?

177
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,080
Your Majesty,

178
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,000
the Empress should prepare
for her father's final rites.

179
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,320
Father.

180
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,120
REFUGE IN THE DHARMA REALM

181
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,040
Physician Li is here. Let him try.

182
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,000
Who would dare

183
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,440
strike Father with such cruelty?

184
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
<i>Victors are kings.</i>

185
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,720
You want to saddle me
with every crime, old and new.

186
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,120
General Lu.

187
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,440
Should I answer

188
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,960
for these crimes?

189
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,800
During the coup at court,

190
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
Ling Xuefeng never fully admitted

191
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,800
that Xiao Ying was sent to kill me.

192
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,560
So I believe

193
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,240
there must be someone
pulling the strings behind him.

194
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
When Father was struck by the arrow,

195
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,040
he managed one last word.

196
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,440
But I don't know what he meant to say.

197
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,160
It must be connected
to whoever is behind all this.

198
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,560
To keep Ling Xuefeng safe,

199
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,520
we're keeping him
hidden at Fayun Temple to recover.

200
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,280
But we'll announce

201
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,400
that he succumbed to his injuries.

202
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,000
We'll decide the rest once he wakes.

203
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,840
But Physician Li said

204
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
he doesn't know when Father will wake.

205
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,960
And if this person is someone close to us,

206
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,560
wouldn't that spell endless danger?

207
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,240
I have a way

208
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,800
that might reveal the mastermind.

209
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,920
Whatever you plan to do,

210
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,200
I'll be there for you.

211
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,360
Cangcang.

212
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,640
This time, our enemy is hiding
while I'm wide open.

213
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,840
You must promise me

214
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,640
that no matter what happens,

215
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,760
the moment you see the warning arrow,

216
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,240
you must put your own safety first.

217
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,520
- No.
- You must promise me.

218
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,760
Only then can I take the risk.

219
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,760
Fine.

220
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,040
I promise you.

221
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,760
Your Highness!

222
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,640
Your Highness! Slow down, please.

223
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,600
Please, Your Highness.

224
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,040
Put your shoes back on.

225
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,080
If the Prince of Yuzhang sees this,

226
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,120
we'll be…

227
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,680
Your Majesty.

228
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,440
Give me the shoes.

229
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,240
I've heard
that spring is when flowers bloom best

230
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,960
for the beauties.

231
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,160
If you're not dressed nicely,

232
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,520
the flowers might refuse to bloom.

233
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
Who are you?

234
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,480
I am…

235
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,760
sent by Li Hongqing

236
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,800
to tell you stories.

237
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,320
Li…

238
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,800
Hong…

239
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,000
Qing…

240
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,280
What we call divination
is really just deduction.

241
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,560
Based on this winter's weather patterns
along the Yellow River,

242
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
there won't be major floods this year.

243
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,280
It's a good time to build embankments.

244
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,520
Good.

245
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,320
Well done, Preceptor Du.

246
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,560
It is merely my duty.

247
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,600
Your Majesty has faced one crisis
after another lately.

248
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,600
Your health is already weakened.

249
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,240
Remember,

250
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,400
don't overexert yourself.

251
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,000
The Prince of Yuzhang has arrived.

252
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,080
I shall take my leave.

253
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,160
- Eunuch Feng.
- Madam.

254
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,080
His Majesty's qi and blood
are weak of late.

255
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,760
Regarding the pills,
there are things I need you to remember.

256
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,640
Yes, Madam.

257
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,760
What sort of act are you putting on now?

258
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,560
- I'm here to tell you a secret.
- A secret?

259
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,800
When we were little,

260
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,320
I'd watch you obey Father in everything.

261
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,360
You were up before dawn
to practice and study.

262
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,800
And I'd think to myself,

263
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,040
"This one must be a fool."

264
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,880
But my mother said

265
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,760
the fool was me.

266
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,080
You had ambition.

267
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,560
So later, I asked you.

268
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,960
Do you still remember them?

269
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,840
Of course I remember.

270
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,080
Back then, you really were pretty foolish.

271
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,800
That day,
the pear blossoms were in full bloom.

272
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,760
Where did you steal this wine from now?

273
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,920
You'd better not
let your mother catch you.

274
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,560
Flowers this lovely, wine this fine,

275
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,160
we should be drinking.

276
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,120
And yet, you are practicing like a fool.

277
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,880
Grand Tutor Ling will check our progress.

278
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,000
Have you memorized yours?

279
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,800
Huan,

280
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,080
tell me something.

281
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,600
Are you dead set on becoming Emperor?

282
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,160
So who's the real fool, me or you?

283
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,480
The truth is,

284
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,720
what I've always wanted most

285
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,200
is to live freely,

286
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,720
roaming the martial world with my sword.

287
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,040
But I know

288
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,960
it's only a dream.

289
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,280
And that is a dream

290
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,640
no one cares about.

291
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,520
I care.

292
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,120
I opposed you,

293
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,680
wanting to pull you off the throne.

294
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,600
But in truth,

295
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,560
I thought you were too frail.

296
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,680
You're not suited to rule.

297
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,920
So why not grant your wish?

298
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,160
You can roam the world

299
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,040
and have your freedom.

300
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,240
I care about

301
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,280
your childhood dream.

302
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,000
Well?

303
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,960
Aren't you moved?

304
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,240
Don't you think your younger brother

305
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,840
has a bit of loyalty in him?

306
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,600
A little, I suppose.

307
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,040
Then Your Majesty,
show me your generosity.

308
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,240
Grant me the request I'm about to make.

309
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,880
Speak. What do you want?

310
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,880
If it's something I can give,
you shall have it.

311
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,679
I want to retreat from court
and roam the martial world.

312
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,239
To leave with Ying and Zhong Lin,

313
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,480
and seek out Li Hongqing.

314
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,000
If I find him,

315
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,600
I'll steal away your beloved commander.

316
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,560
If I don't…

317
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,400
If I don't find him,

318
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,520
I'll still do everything
I can to give Ying a happy life.

319
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,639
Well?

320
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,239
Will you allow it or not?

321
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,120
I still need you.

322
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,480
Not anymore.
Your greatest enemy has already fallen.

323
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,719
It's about time
this prince made his grand exit.

324
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,600
This is my royal seal

325
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,880
and the military token
of my Southern Chu fief.

326
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,760
Please keep them safe.

327
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,560
I've thought it all through.

328
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,600
Between the two of us,

329
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,520
one brother should at least
fulfill our shared dream of roaming free.

330
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,080
Isn't that right?

331
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,920
You intend to walk away
with Xiao Ying just like that?

332
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,000
After what was done to her,

333
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,160
don't you want to know the truth?

334
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,240
Wasn't the one who hurt her

335
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,360
Ling Xuefeng?

336
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,720
It's never that simple.

337
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,280
Ling Xuefeng was attacked.

338
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,720
Someone wanted to silence him.

339
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,560
And that someone

340
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,520
is very likely tied
to Xiao Ying's attempt to assassinate me.

341
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,160
Think it over one more time.

342
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,720
Eunuch Feng,
I'll trouble you with this, then.

343
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,600
I hope His Majesty takes care of himself.

344
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,800
We bid you farewell.

345
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
You were a gift from Li Hongqing.

346
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,720
So you must bloom soon.

347
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,760
Ying.

348
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,680
You remembered?

349
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,720
Remembered what?

350
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,640
Li Hongqing.

351
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,000
Her Majesty told me.

352
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,240
She told me so many things
about Li Hongqing.

353
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,280
It made me happy,

354
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,800
but somehow, I feel this sadness

355
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,480
in my heart.

356
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,160
<i>You intend to walk away with Xiao Ying?</i>

357
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,160
<i>After what was done to her,</i>

358
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,720
<i>don't you want to know the truth?</i>

359
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,280
Qianqing, who is Li Hongqing?

360
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,960
Why do I feel such a longing to see him?

361
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,600
Can you take me to him?

362
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,480
All right.

363
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,520
I will take you to him.

364
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,520
But you must behave, all right?

365
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,360
This is the Soul-Severing Grass.

366
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,360
It grows inside volcanic craters.

367
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,160
Its fiery nature is extremely potent.

368
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,600
Its heat can force venomous insects
out through the skin and flesh.

369
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,440
Perhaps this Soul-Severing Grass

370
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,160
can drive out the Dual-Pupil parasite
inside Princess Ying

371
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
and restore her clarity.

372
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,840
Let me do it. Tell me how.

373
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,560
Your Highness mustn't.

374
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,520
Once the Soul-Severing Flame
touches your skin,

375
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,040
it'll scorch the flesh in an instant.

376
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,600
Ordinary people can't control it.

377
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,360
But…

378
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,720
His Majesty is an exception.

379
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,800
My body runs colder than most.

380
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,080
So this is a task only I can undertake.

381
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,480
The Soul-Severing Flame
must drive the medicinal heat

382
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
into the princess's meridians

383
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,240
for the duration of
one joss stick each day.

384
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,480
After three days,
the parasite will leave her body.

385
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,680
However…

386
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,120
His Majesty will deplete
a great deal of inner force.

387
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,680
He may even suffer burns.

388
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,400
It's fine.

389
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,280
Ying.

390
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,360
Ying. Ying!

391
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,320
- Ying! Ying!
- Qianqing…

392
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,000
Your Majesty. Stop.

393
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,400
This is enough. Let's stop here.

394
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,640
The parasite is reacting.
That means the method is working.

395
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,800
Qianqing…

396
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,000
Ying!

397
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,840
- Ying!
- It hurts…

398
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,200
All I see is her pain.
It's sharp and searing,

399
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,040
a torment she can barely endure.

400
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,440
Don't worry.

401
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,200
I won't put her in danger.

402
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,120
However…

403
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,160
Ying is the only one who knows the clues.

404
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,720
You want to walk away halfway.

405
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,720
But I need to know the truth.

406
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,960
Is the truth you're after

407
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,640
worth the pain Ying goes through?

408
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,680
She's not your sister.

409
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,640
Of course you can harden your heart
and look away.

410
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,560
But I can't.

411
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,600
Ying, come with me.

412
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,800
We're leaving.

413
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,640
Move.

414
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,280
You think you're the only one
who sees her as family,

415
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,160
the only one who cares for her?

416
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,280
No one in this world

417
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,240
but Xiao Huan
truly knows what her pain feels like.

418
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
He grew up enduring pain
no ordinary man could bear,

419
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,280
all for that gleam of hope
after the storm.

420
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,960
Ying has held on for so long,

421
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,560
and now you want her to give up halfway?

422
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,720
What about everything she endured?

423
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,480
I won't let her suffer another moment.

424
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,200
- I'll care for her all my life.
- Xiao Qianqing!

425
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,040
Wake up.

426
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,880
Ying doesn't remember anything now.

427
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,360
She doesn't remember me.

428
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,640
She doesn't remember us.

429
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,720
She doesn't remember anything.

430
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,640
She doesn't remember Li Hongqing.

431
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,880
Do you really think

432
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,920
she could ever be happy
for the rest of her life?
