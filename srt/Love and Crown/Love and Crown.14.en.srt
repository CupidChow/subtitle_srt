ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,800
<i>The realm's foundation</i>
<i>lies with a worthy heir.</i>

3
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,760
<i>The peace of the four corners rests</i>
<i>on his rightful line.</i>

4
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>I rule all under heaven,</i>

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
<i>bearing the enduring mandate</i>
<i>of the divinities,</i>

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,520
<i>and the weight of all my people.</i>

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,360
<i>Yet I am laid low by illness</i>

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,040
<i>and my health has not returned.</i>

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,920
<i>Remnant rebels still lurk,</i>

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,720
<i>the Central Plains are racked by war,</i>

11
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,040
<i>and the great affairs of war and state</i>

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,720
<i>demand careful counsel and decision.</i>

13
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
<i>Thus I appoint Prince</i>
<i>of Yuzhang, Xiao Qianqing,</i>

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,039
<i>granting him power</i>
<i>over rewards and punishments,</i>

15
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,920
<i>and entrusting him</i>
<i>with all military and state affairs.</i>

16
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
<i>By this decree, he shall act as Regent.</i>

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,440
We'll do all we can
to assist Your Highness.

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,320
I second that.

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,560
His Majesty has spoken.

20
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
I will serve as Regent for now.

21
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Ministers, do
you have any matters to report?

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,560
Your Highness,

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,560
some time ago,

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,040
the Empress fell ill

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,880
and went to
the imperial retreat to recover.

26
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,520
But now,

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,640
His Majesty is unwell as well.

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,320
Ever since Her Majesty was enthroned,

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,240
misfortunes have plagued the palace.

30
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,040
I worry that when
their birth dates were matched,

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,280
something may have gone wrong.

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
You mean

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,840
their birth charts don't match?

34
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
Utter nonsense!

35
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,160
His Majesty only fell ill

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,680
from all these recent
disasters and troubles.

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,360
It has nothing to do with the Empress.

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,080
Minister Xing is deliberately
finding fault with Her Majesty.

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,480
Such behavior is disrespectful!

40
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,960
Please judge fairly, Your Highness.

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,600
In matters this serious,
it's not my place to decide.

42
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,520
Grand Tutor Ling, why
don't you ask His Majesty

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,760
and look in on the Empress as well?

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,640
Enough.

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,960
This kind of talk ends here.

46
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,800
I ask you all not to gossip idly
about the Emperor and Empress.

47
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,360
Let us focus our minds on state affairs.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,840
Kumor's siege of Jiangzhou
has yet to be broken.

49
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,880
Grand Tutor Ling,

50
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,920
what do you think?

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,279
I agree.

52
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,000
Your Highness is absolutely right.

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,840
The crisis in Jiangzhou
concerns the very foundation of our state.

54
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,480
As for the second
batch of grain for Jiangzhou,

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,200
I urge Your Highness to
send it out as soon as possible.

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,720
- Yes.
- Indeed.

57
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,560
How is the disaster situation in Xuzhou?

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,320
I have received word

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,360
that the locust plague
in Xuzhou is growing ever worse,

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,120
and the relief grain is
but a drop in the bucket.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,320
The supplies we sent
earlier are nearly gone.

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,200
Both Jiangzhou and Xuzhou

63
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
are crying out for grain.

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,080
What are we to do?

65
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
They are all subjects of Great Qi.

66
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,000
I am truly troubled by this.

67
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,560
Eunuch Feng,

68
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
my head aches terribly.

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,160
Let us adjourn court for today.

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,040
- We will discuss this another day.
- Yes, of course.

71
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,280
We respectfully see Your Highness out.

72
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,880
LING MANOR

73
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
BRUSH AND INK

74
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,320
It's one thing

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,440
for Prince of Yuzhang
to throw his weight around,

76
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,160
but what was he playing at in court today?

77
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,640
He wouldn't even
release the grain for Jiangzhou,

78
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,280
yet he deliberately steered
things to the locust plague in Xuzhou.

79
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,520
The grain in the state granary

80
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,760
was clearly raised

81
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,280
by the Grand Tutor himself
from the grain merchants!

82
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,200
Exactly.

83
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,440
The military situation
in Jiangzhou is urgent.

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,320
The border war concerns
the very foundation of the realm.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,520
The locust plague
in Xuzhou is an internal trouble at best.

86
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,680
What matters most now

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,920
is to secure
supplies for the border troops.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,120
Given how things stand,

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,360
we might as well go
straight to His Majesty

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,880
and lodge a complaint
against Prince of Yuzhang!

91
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,160
- Yes!
- Exactly!

92
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,320
Enough.

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,800
As for the grain, I know what to do.

94
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
It's getting late.

95
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,680
Sirs, you may all retire.

96
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,240
My Lord.

97
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,640
You will depart for Xuzhou at once.

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Tell the Governor of Xuzhou

99
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
that I've backed him every
step of the way to where he is now,

100
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,000
and it's about time he repaid the favor.

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Yes, My Lord.

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,560
I don't care what
the disaster in Xuzhou is really like.

103
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
The report
that comes back to the Capital must say…

104
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
the locust plague has passed.

105
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,840
Send this to
the Governor of Xuzhou as well.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
At once, My Lord.

107
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,280
A child playing at power?

108
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,920
Xiao Qianqing,

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,480
since you insist on
hearing about Xuzhou's disaster,

110
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll make sure you get an answer

111
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,880
that you'll be pleased with.

112
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,200
When you presided
over court as Regent today,

113
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,640
did Ling Xuefeng give you a hard time?

114
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,800
He wouldn't dare.

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm not as mild-tempered as my brother.

116
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,840
If that old man ever tries to push me,

117
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,760
I'll…

118
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,400
I'll drive him mad.

119
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,440
I never expected Xiao Huan

120
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,919
to make a move like this.

121
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,880
Making you Regent

122
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,960
might be to pit you against Ling Xuefeng.

123
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,040
Don't let yourself
be used as someone else's blade.

124
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,920
He…

125
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,480
really is seriously ill?

126
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,720
When I saw him last night,

127
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,680
he looked in terrible shape,

128
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
like he might not make it.

129
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
His retreat is sealed up tight.

130
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,040
I can't get any of my people in at all.

131
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,440
I truly don't know what game he's playing.

132
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,480
Now he's dumped this mess on you.

133
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,680
Is he hoping you'll stumble

134
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
so he can send you back to Southern Chu?

135
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
Then we'll see if
he really has that ability.

136
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,800
My brother

137
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,640
has always been deeply scheming.

138
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,640
Every step he takes,

139
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,800
he's already planned three moves ahead.

140
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
It even exhausts me just watching him.

141
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,800
But this time, I won't let
him lead me by the nose.

142
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,960
All right, Mother,
let's not talk about him.

143
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,680
How has Ying been lately?

144
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,480
Get out!

145
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,680
I told you I'm not eating!
Stop bothering me!

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
Li Hongqing!

147
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,840
You're here.

148
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,280
Your Highness.

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,760
What took you so long?

150
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,920
Come with me.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look what I've prepared for you.

152
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,000
I studied all kinds of
venomous snakes myself

153
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,160
to make this jar of
powder that wards off every snake.

154
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,560
Here, take it.

155
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,160
Impressive, right?

156
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,760
So Guard Wang Xiong

157
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,920
almost lost his life

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,560
because of this "research" of yours?

159
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,240
He really was bitten by a venomous snake.

160
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,640
How long will
you keep making trouble like this?

161
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,120
Being a princess doesn't
mean you can do whatever you want

162
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
and ignore other people's lives!

163
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,840
I didn't.

164
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,160
Have you forgotten?

165
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,360
You ordered people
to lock him in with those snakes.

166
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,760
He nearly died!

167
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
But… he told me

168
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,080
he grew up in the south
and wasn't afraid of snakes.

169
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
And besides,

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,440
I even gave him protection.

171
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
I never meant to harm him.

172
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,640
I didn't…

173
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,760
I never wanted to hurt him.

174
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,520
I never wanted to hurt him.

175
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,720
It's you,

176
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,920
all of you…

177
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,000
You're the ones trying to hurt me,

178
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
every last one of you!

179
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,440
Only when you stand firm at court

180
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,440
will Ying and I really have support.

181
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,320
If we can get rid of
Ling Xuefeng while you're still Regent,

182
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,280
even better.

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,040
We have to seize this chance.

184
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,480
The more serious the disaster becomes,

185
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,320
the more it works in our favor.

186
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,560
However,
we have to know where to draw the line.

187
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,720
Your Majesty,
Eunuch Feng is waiting outside,

188
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,400
urging His Highness to
review today's memorials.

189
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,040
Understood.

190
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,880
Mother,

191
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll take my leave.

192
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,280
XUANGUANG GATE

193
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

194
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,480
Your Highness,

195
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,240
it's getting late.

196
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,520
Should we move to Wuying Hall now?

197
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,160
What's the rush?

198
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,080
These memorials will never run out.

199
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
Let's just wait a little longer.

200
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,480
Your Highness,

201
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,400
how about this?

202
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,280
If there's anything you need done,
I can handle it for you.

203
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,080
Oh?

204
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm going to visit my sister.

205
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,200
Can you do that in my place as well?

206
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,120
I wouldn't dare. But…

207
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,640
Just give me a moment.

208
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,080
Once I've checked on my sister,

209
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,600
I'll dutifully go through the memorials.
All right?

210
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
Why not find someone to haul me back?

211
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
Your Highness. Listen, Your Highness…

212
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,280
Qianqing!

213
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,080
These are all new
poisons I cooked up in secret.

214
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,840
When you have time,

215
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,800
try them out on Xiao Huan!

216
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,640
Ying,

217
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,880
you need to behave.

218
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Promise me,

219
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,000
don't hurt people with poison anymore,

220
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,920
all right?

221
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,920
Why?

222
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,160
Do you all think

223
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,880
I'll end up killing someone?

224
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,040
I never meant to hurt anyone.

225
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,920
Except Xiao Huan,

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I've never wanted to hurt anyone else.

227
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,480
You have to believe me.

228
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,640
I do. Of course I believe you.

229
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,600
You're so kind. How could
you possibly want to hurt anyone?

230
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,960
Guard Wang was poisoned by that snake.
It clearly wasn't my fault,

231
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,640
yet Li Hongqing is still angry.

232
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,600
He blames me, and I'm not happy about it.

233
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,240
Then,

234
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,800
let's drag Li Hongqing over here

235
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,920
and teach him a lesson.

236
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,840
Better not.
I won't lower myself to his level.

237
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,200
You like him?

238
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
Then if we drag Li Hongqing over
and make him my brother-in-law,

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,920
that wouldn't be so bad.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,360
I don't like him at all.

241
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,720
How about this?

242
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,400
I'll bring him here
and make him apologize to you.

243
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,520
What do you think?

244
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
Really?

245
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,800
When have I ever lied to you?

246
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,080
<i>If you could stay this simple and happy</i>

247
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,720
<i>and keep living in your own little world,</i>

248
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,720
<i>it might be a blessing in its own way.</i>

249
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
<i>Without facing people's tangled schemes,</i>

250
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,880
<i>you wouldn't be hurt even more.</i>

251
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,640
Your Highness, time's up.

252
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,560
You need to go back
and review the memorials.

253
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Ying,

254
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,240
time's almost up.

255
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,680
I have to go.

256
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll come see you next time.

257
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
Qianqing.

258
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,000
Could you give me some silver?

259
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,240
What do you need silver for?

260
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,160
I need it.

261
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,280
For something very important!

262
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,480
Your Majesty,

263
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,160
did you sleep well?

264
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,040
I prepared this especially for you.

265
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,720
Have a taste.

266
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,079
I stole your grain,

267
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,000
yet now you are letting bygones be bygones

268
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,839
and treating me like an honored guest?

269
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,000
That's a separate matter.

270
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,359
You robbed my grain,

271
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
and I almost used you as
an offering to rally my troops.

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,720
The supplies are already on their way.

273
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,359
You won't so much as shake me.

274
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,200
Your Majesty,

275
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,560
please.

276
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,600
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

277
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,920
Please enjoy, Your Majesty.

278
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,120
I told you, I'm not the Empress.

279
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,040
You're not the Empress?

280
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,160
Then who are you?

281
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,640
My surname is Lin, L-i-n.
I'm Lin Cangcang.

282
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Then how do you explain…

283
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,480
this Phoenix Seal?

284
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,440
- I stole it.
- You stole it?

285
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
The Phoenix Seal belongs to the Empress.

286
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,320
It's kept safe deep in the palace.

287
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,880
How did you steal it?

288
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
With my skills,

289
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,800
stealing it was child's play.

290
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,160
What's so strange about that?

291
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
But, of all the things you could steal,

292
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,840
why steal the Phoenix Seal?

293
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
Well,

294
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
that's a long story.

295
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,000
No rush.

296
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,960
I've got

297
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,360
plenty of time.

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,640
Have you heard of the Lingbi Sect?

299
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Heard of it.

300
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,760
It's pretty famous.

301
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,080
They say the Lingbi Sect leader's token
ended up in the Emperor's hands.

302
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,880
That's actually what I went in to steal.

303
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,800
But somehow,

304
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,160
I ended up with this thing instead.

305
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,720
Then why did you join the army?

306
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,400
Pure coincidence.

307
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,920
I left the palace in armor,
ran into the reinforcements heading west,

308
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,280
and they brought me out of the city.

309
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,760
You really took the long way around.

310
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
And you just slipped into

311
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,800
- the reinforcements like that?
- Is it impossible?

312
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,120
Sure, it's possible.

313
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,800
But from the Capital to
Jiangzhou is a long road.

314
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,120
Why didn't you run off on the way?

315
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,360
Why would I run?

316
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,560
There's food in the army,
and the marching isn't hard.

317
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,880
Besides,

318
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
once I got here, I even earned merit.

319
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,560
So why not wait till I get my pay?

320
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,400
Sure,

321
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,400
keep spinning your story.

322
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
You really think I would believe

323
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,440
that pack of nonsense?

324
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Suit yourself,

325
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,160
believe it or don't.

326
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,400
Kuminjia,

327
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,640
for a dignified princess to
use such dirty tricks to catch me

328
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,000
is hardly an honorable win.

329
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,720
You robbed my grain first.

330
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,240
If we're talking dirty tricks,

331
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,600
I can't hold a candle to you.

332
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,680
And now you're trying to goad me?

333
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,880
I'm not falling for it.

334
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,600
Fine by me,

335
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,000
saves me the trouble.

336
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,840
I've lived rough as a wandering thief.

337
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,960
Being kept here with good food

338
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,160
isn't such a bad deal.

339
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,760
Your Majesty,
you really do know how to joke.

340
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,600
I told you, I'm not the Empress.

341
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,000
What, does the great commander of Xijiang

342
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,920
really have to use
the Empress to threaten Great Qi?

343
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,920
You've been besieging Jiangzhou City

344
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,880
for over a month already

345
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,920
and still haven't taken it.

346
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,320
No wonder you're turning to shady tricks.

347
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,240
Your Majesty,

348
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,360
provoking me like that won't work at all.

349
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,240
I'm just stating the facts.

350
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,440
You stay calm even in danger,

351
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,840
truly impressive.

352
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,040
Ling Jueding just sent word:

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,080
in five days,

354
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Great Qi's envoys will
come to make peace with me.

355
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,600
Who you really are
will be clear soon enough.

356
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,760
All right then.

357
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,080
You really are quite something.

358
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,480
What a pity.

359
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
A pity about what?

360
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Pity you're a woman.

361
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,000
Otherwise,
I might have taken pity on your looks,

362
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,560
begged my brother to spare your life,
and kept you for my own amusement.

363
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,040
You should come to Great Qi instead.

364
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,120
Great Qi is vast and rich.

365
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
If there's one thing we never lack,

366
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,240
it's fine men everywhere.

367
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,960
You'd love it there.

368
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,520
Quit trying to fool me.
Just sit tight and behave!

369
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,920
Everyone,

370
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,440
let's rest up while we can

371
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,240
and be ready to move at any time.

372
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,160
Yes, Sir!

373
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
Greetings, Madam.

374
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
May I ask why you summoned me, Madam?

375
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
General Lu Qi,

376
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
at the Qingyu Guard's marching speed,

377
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,360
how long until we reach Jiangzhou?

378
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,680
Madam,

379
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,400
this time our escort is
under a hundred riders,

380
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,440
mostly light cavalry.

381
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,040
If we push day and night,
we can be in Jiangzhou in three days.

382
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,920
Then please pass the order:

383
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,720
rest tomorrow and depart the day
after tomorrow at midmorning.

384
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,520
Madam, why is that?

385
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,640
The enemy's
momentum hits hardest the first time,

386
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,400
weaker the second, gone the third.

387
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,360
The more we rush,

388
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,720
the more we play right into Kumor's hands.

389
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,560
Let him wait.

390
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
Wear down his edge.

391
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,040
He'll calm down
and make peace with Great Qi.

392
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,560
But… I've heard one of our men
has been taken hostage by Kumor.

393
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,200
That man is vital to us.

394
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,880
Precisely because of that,

395
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,200
this is what we must do.

396
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,760
Trust me, General Lu.

397
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
His Majesty personally
chose the Qingyu Guard to escort you.

398
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,640
We'll naturally follow your lead.

399
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,120
<i>Ling Cangcang,</i>

400
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,040
<i>don't blame me for being ruthless.</i>

401
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,520
<i>Everything I do is for Great Qi.</i>

402
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,200
<i>Since Kumor is betting</i>
<i>that you're the Empress of Great Qi,</i>

403
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,240
<i>if I arrive a few days late,</i>
<i>he still won't dare lay a finger on you.</i>

404
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,640
Your Highness.

405
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,640
Your Highness,

406
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,840
it's time for you
to review the memorials now.

407
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,520
Aren't I reading them right now?
Why in such a hurry?

408
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,800
Still, Your Highness,
you're holding that memorial upside down.

409
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,400
What are you laughing at, Your Highness?

410
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,640
At how unlikeable my
imperial brother's face is.

411
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,400
The ministers are
all hoping he'll die soon.

412
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,320
Your Highness,

413
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,240
you can't say such treasonous things
so carelessly.

414
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,440
Look at this one:

415
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,600
the prefect specially
memorializes the throne,

416
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,240
saying it's been warm with little rain,

417
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,560
so this year's
lychees will be a bumper crop

418
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,840
and delicious, too.

419
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,200
And this one:

420
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,560
"I am asking after Your Majesty's health."

421
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,840
All these pointless memorials

422
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,840
are enough to work
my poor brother to death.

423
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,000
Your Highness,
that's their way of showing loyalty.

424
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,840
Being emperor
really isn't a job for any normal person.

425
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,960
I see that now.

426
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,240
My imperial brother
dumped the burden on me

427
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,480
just to make me do
all the hard labor for him.

428
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,120
Your Highness,

429
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,760
please watch your tongue!

430
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,840
All right, drop the act.

431
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,920
When my brother comes back,

432
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,960
your old bones will
be worn out from kneeling.

433
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,880
LOCAL LOCUST CONTROL
IS ALREADY SHOWING RESULTS.

434
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,800
NO GRAIN SHORTAGES OR UNREST ARE REPORTED.

435
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,800
THE LOCUST PLAGUE
IS EXPECTED TO BE RESOLVED SOON.

436
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,520
Your Highness, why are you laughing again?

437
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440
The Governor of Xuzhou reports

438
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,360
that the authorities acted in time,

439
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,920
the locust plague is
no longer a real threat,

440
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
and the people are not short of grain.

441
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,800
Looks like our Grand Tutor Ling

442
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,360
is quite efficient.

443
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,720
All right. I'm tired.

444
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,280
I'm going to the hot
spring retreat to relax.

445
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
Tell Li Hongqing:

446
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,200
If you want me to
keep reviewing memorials,

447
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,920
he'll have to come invite me himself.

448
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,920
Your Highness, oh…

449
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,480
Your Highness…

450
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,520
Carry on with your patrol.

451
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,720
Commander Li!

452
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,000
Commander Li!

453
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,760
Please wait, Commander Li.

454
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,320
- What can I do for you, Eunuch Feng?
- Commander Li,

455
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,600
I'd like to ask you a favor.

456
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,000
- I'm not going to the cold palace again.
- No…

457
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,600
Commander Li, this time,
it's not to see Princess Ying.

458
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,280
This time we need
you to fetch Prince of Yuzhang.

459
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,280
- Prince of Yuzhang?
- Yes.

460
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,600
Prince of Yuzhang
is off soaking in hot springs,

461
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,120
with a pile of memorials
still waiting for his review.

462
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
Then get someone to drag him back.

463
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,640
Why come to me?

464
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,320
Commander Li,

465
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,040
who is Prince of Yuzhang?

466
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,920
He's not someone just anyone can summon.

467
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,720
He already said
that if we want him back at the palace,

468
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Commander Li

469
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,200
must go in person.

470
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,960
Please, do a good deed today
and save this old servant.

471
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,320
Those siblings really are troublesome.

472
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,280
Tell me about it.
Commander Li, thank you for this!

473
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,920
Who… who's there?

474
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,040
You're here.

475
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,320
In the middle of the night,

476
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,960
you called me here
just to watch you bathe?

477
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,720
Naturally, I have serious business.

478
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,560
Right now, for me, only Cangcang's
whereabouts count as serious business.

479
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,400
If it's not about her,

480
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,760
we're done talking.

481
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,440
Zhong Lin, you're breaking our deal.

482
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,800
Your Highness, that's not fair!

483
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,320
I've been pretending to
be Song Lanxi for so long.

484
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I've done plenty for you!

485
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,200
Now, on the surface,
Cangcang is said to be at the retreat,

486
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,160
but in truth,

487
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,120
no one knows where she is!

488
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
There has to be more to it.

489
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,080
Miss Zhong,

490
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,120
help me one more time,

491
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,280
and I promise…

492
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,400
Your promises are worthless.

493
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,600
Your Highness.

494
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,880
Down…

495
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Get down! Down!

496
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,960
Quick!

497
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,960
Your Highness,

498
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,760
I was sent by Eunuch Feng
to bring you back to the palace.

499
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,360
What's the rush? Wait outside.

500
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,120
Once I've had my fill of soaking,

501
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
I'll go out on my own.

502
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,920
Then I'll stand right here
until you do, Your Highness.

503
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
Insolent!

504
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,760
How am I supposed to get out

505
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,000
with you standing there?

506
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,960
Just… turn around.

507
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Commander Li,

509
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,200
are you really going
to stand there and watch?

510
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,600
You…

511
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,400
- you actually slapped me in the face!
- And I meant every slap.

512
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,800
Shameless!

513
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,000
- Miss Zhong.
- Let go!

514
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,520
- Miss Zhong.
- Let go of me!

515
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,160
I'm leaving.

516
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,000
Wait!

517
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,920
Miss…

518
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Miss Zhong…

519
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,480
Vice Sect Leader Zhong…

520
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,040
Sect Leader Zhong!

521
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,280
I'm begging you.

522
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,719
- Please go to Xuzhou in my place.
- Not going!

523
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,120
The locust plague in Xuzhou

524
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,920
is getting worse by the day.

525
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,199
Grand Tutor Ling
and the Governor of Xuzhou

526
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,840
have joined hands to hide the truth there.

527
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,800
They are forcing me to
send grain to Jiangzhou.

528
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,480
What does that have to do with me?

529
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,120
I came to
the Capital to look for Cangcang.

530
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,560
Now she's vanished without a trace.

531
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,719
Why would I run off to Xuzhou?

532
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,880
What's happening in Xuzhou
affects Ling Cangcang's safety.

533
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,679
What do you mean?

534
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,880
Fine, I'll be honest with you.

535
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,800
Ling Cangcang is in Jiangzhou,

536
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,280
and Xiao Huan has already gone after her.

537
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,159
So Ling Cangcang's safety

538
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,800
isn't yours to worry about.

539
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,360
But the disaster in Xuzhou
is tied to Jiangzhou's crisis.

540
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,560
Only by easing Xuzhou's troubles

541
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,440
can we save Jiangzhou.

542
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,800
What kind of nonsense is that?

543
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,800
Are you telling
bedtime stories to kids now?

544
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,240
I… what do I gain by lying to you?

545
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,840
Who knows.

546
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,960
Miss Zhong…

547
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,280
Zhong Lin!

548
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,400
You really don't care
about the people of Xuzhou?

549
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,960
Why did you found the Fenglai Pavilion?

550
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
All that talk about justice
and punishing evil,

551
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,760
just empty talk?

552
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
Say it. What do you want me to do?

553
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,640
Go to Xuzhou and get a written
confession from the Governor there.

554
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,760
It's a deal.

555
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,000
Wait!

556
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,120
Now what?

557
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,440
Put this on.

558
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,360
Do it quickly.

559
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,920
My life and everything I have
are in your hands now.

560
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,440
Your Highness,

561
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,120
will you return to the palace with me now?

562
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,680
No rush.

563
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,400
Lately, I've had an annoying matter,
and I'm in no mood at all.

564
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,920
When I'm in a mood like this,
I simply can't review memorials.

565
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,560
I wonder if you can help ease my mind.

566
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,200
Please speak.

567
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,400
I went to see Ying.

568
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,920
She was heartbroken.

569
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,560
After asking around,

570
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,320
I learned
that it had something to do with you.

571
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,840
What would you have me do?

572
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,520
Ying may not be in her right mind

573
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,960
and sometimes seems unhinged,

574
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,800
but deep down

575
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,440
she's kinder and more innocent

576
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,240
than anyone else in the harem.

577
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,560
So whatever happens,

578
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,600
I will always
believe her without question.

579
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,560
She would never harm the innocent.

580
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,640
Then I misjudged the Princess.

581
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,760
Ying approaches feelings differently
from most people.

582
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,880
The purer she is,

583
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,080
the more easily she's
hurt by those she cares about.

584
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,840
As her brother,

585
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,760
I don't want to see her in pain.

586
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,120
You started this.

587
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,600
There's a way
for you to make it up to her.

588
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,240
Go find her

589
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,360
and do whatever it takes to cheer her up.

590
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,760
If you succeed, I might just
force myself to finish the memorials.

591
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,520
What do you say?

592
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,160
It was my fault
for misunderstanding the Princess.

593
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,720
I should apologize.

594
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,960
When will you go?

595
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,720
I'll go right now.

596
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,200
Li Hongqing!

597
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,280
You're here.

598
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,880
Your Highness, I'm sorry.
I misunderstood you before.

599
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,040
This is for you.

600
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,920
Your Highness,

601
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,320
what do you mean by this?

602
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,200
Please give it to Guard Wang for me.

603
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,720
He may have lied to me first,

604
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,560
but he was poisoned because of me.

605
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,080
So, I ought to make it up to him.

606
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,400
This silver is from my brother.

607
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,120
He didn't bring much that day.

608
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,560
And this,

609
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,680
also this…

610
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,240
These are all my favorite things.

611
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,760
On Guard Wang's behalf,

612
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,320
thank you, Your Highness.

613
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,360
Think nothing of it.

614
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,600
Then can you stop
being mad at me from now on?

615
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,960
If you want me to do something

616
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,280
or not do something,

617
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,120
you can just tell me directly.

618
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,320
I'll listen to you.

619
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,160
You don't have to listen to anyone.

620
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
Just follow your own heart.

621
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,560
There are rights and wrongs

622
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,000
I can't always tell apart.

623
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,720
But I trust you.

624
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,320
You'll know the difference.

625
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,280
Your Highness,

626
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,920
why do you trust me so much?

627
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,400
You think I don't remember?

628
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,440
Back when the Crown Prince's Hall
caught fire, you saved me.

629
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,360
You used this arm
to shield me from a falling burning beam.

630
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,160
I thought
Your Highness had long forgotten.

631
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,640
Of course I remember!

632
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,680
Before that imperial
physician took me away,

633
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,560
I bit you hard on the arm,

634
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,960
so I could find you again one day.

635
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,960
Then when did you realize
I was the guard who saved you?

636
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,360
I'm not telling you.

637
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,480
But since I've found you,

638
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,720
I'll definitely treat you well.

639
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,440
It's simply our duty
as the Imperial Guard.

640
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,480
Don't trouble yourself over it.

641
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,120
I don't care.

642
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,480
If I say I'll treat you well,

643
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,480
then I'll treat you well.

644
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,040
Since the disaster
in Xuzhou is under control,

645
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,800
I ask Your Highness

646
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,600
to release the grain
for Jiangzhou as soon as possible.

647
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,920
Once the Ministry of
Revenue finishes counting the grain

648
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,720
and I've checked it,

649
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,480
I'll naturally issue it.

650
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,760
The war is pressing.

651
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,280
We must not deliberately delay.

652
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,040
I hope Your Highness
will give the order today.

653
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,960
Deliberately?

654
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,800
That's quite the crime
you're pinning on me.

655
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,240
Why don't you go ask His Majesty himself

656
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,680
how he plans to punish me?

657
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,280
Your Highness…

658
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,000
Then may I ask,

659
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,280
how many more days do you expect

660
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,400
this grain counting to take?

661
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,360
Seven or eight days at least.

662
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,240
Rest easy, Grand Tutor Ling.

663
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,600
When Preceptor Du left the Capital,
she took plenty of grain with her.

664
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,560
That will ease
Jiangzhou's immediate crisis.

665
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,760
That only buys us time!

666
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,600
I sincerely beg Your Highness

667
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,600
to release the second
batch as soon as possible.

668
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,640
Jiangzhou is a key fortress,

669
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,840
and the war allows no delay.

670
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,800
Three days from now,

671
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,800
I will await Your Highness's grain order.
