EPISODE 25

4
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
You may go.

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
I don't like you.

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,520
It's fine if
Your Highness doesn't care for me.

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,200
But before Commander Li left,

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
he asked me to bring you a message.

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,280
Would you like to hear it?

10
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,040
What is it?

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,760
Commander Li told me to remind you that

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
as long as you keep calm,
don't hit anyone,

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,040
and behave yourself,

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,640
the flower will soon be in bloom.

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,800
- That's not right.
- Your Highness.

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,480
That is indeed Commander Li's message.
What's wrong with it?

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
You didn't say it

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
as nicely as he did.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,320
Then, Your Highness,

20
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
about this meal…

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,960
I'll behave.

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,520
I'll eat it.

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
Her Majesty arrives!

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
What brings you here?

26
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,240
I came out for some air,

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,360
and thought I'd stop by to check on you.

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm here now. Dismissed.

29
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,280
Yes.

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,720
I know why you've come.

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
You were afraid I'd be angry.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't worry.
I was a little angry just now,

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
but I've already forgiven you.

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,960
Forgiven us?

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,160
Why?

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a secret. I'm not telling you.

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,000
It seems our Princess Ying has

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,720
grown more poised and gracious,
and far more considerate.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,600
When will Hongqing be able to return?

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
Well, I don't know either.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
However,

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,280
I believe that as long as you behave,

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,920
and wait for Commander Li's return,

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,240
His Majesty will
surely have a surprise for you.

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,360
All right. I'll trust you.

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,400
Of course you should trust me.

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,120
Oh, Your Majesty,

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,920
if I receive a gift from Hongqing,

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
shouldn't I send one in return?

50
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,040
Naturally.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,520
What gift in this world is the best?

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,000
In this world,
there is no such thing as the "best" gift.

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,920
As long as your heart is in it,
that makes it the best.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,000
My heart…

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,440
Does it mean

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,560
a gift made with my
own hands would be better?

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes.

58
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,800
I know what I want to give him.

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
So,

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,960
Princess Ying summoned

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,560
the palace maid who
sent Li Hongqing that sachet,

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,760
and she could learn
how to make one herself.

63
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,880
Yes.

64
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,839
My younger sister has always held grudges.

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,000
It is no small feat for her
to come this far.

66
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
Indeed.

67
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,400
I wonder if things are going
smoothly on Li Hongqing's side.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,360
Hongqing has always been meticulous.

69
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
Put your mind at ease.

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
I just hope they all return safely.

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,880
But truth be told,

72
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,000
this sachet is quite ugly.

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,480
Actually, Princess Ying hasn't finished

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,240
making the sachet
she intends for Li Hongqing.

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,520
This is the one I made for Your Majesty.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,360
I came to ask what kind of fragrance
you'd prefer.

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,120
But since Your Majesty dislikes it,
then I'll take it back.

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,280
Why would I dislike it?

79
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
I only glanced at it
and missed the details.

80
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,400
With a closer look,

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,560
your hands are as skilled as ever.

82
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,720
Your stitching could
rival the palace embroiderers.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
I… I like it a great deal.

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,520
Glad to hear that.

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,760
Our little princess has given her heart

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,080
to Li Hongqing,

88
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,800
and is still waiting
for the flower to bloom.

89
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,560
And yet,

90
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,360
will she be met with joy or grief?

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,400
What are you getting at?

92
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
Working with that man

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,840
is like playing with fire.

94
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,520
To him, you are nothing
but a piece on the board.

95
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
So,

96
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
does that trouble you?

97
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,920
A piece can be played or tossed aside.

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
Madam, all I want is for you

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,240
to live freely, without chains,

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,920
not bound to anyone's will.

101
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
I know what you're saying.

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,080
But there's something important

103
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
I need to tell you.

104
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
What is it?

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
The important thing

106
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,520
is that you're still calling me "Madam."

107
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,640
I…

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm simply used to it.

109
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,040
It's hard to change this habit.

110
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,760
Very well. Suit yourself.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,760
Some incense

112
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,200
can quiet the mind, soothe the spirit.

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,760
Others can steal a life without a sound.

114
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,400
Do you think the Lingbi Sect
is capable of taking Li Hongqing's life?

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
- Help him.
- Yes.

116
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
It's a trap.

117
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
Go!

118
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,600
Go on ahead.

119
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,640
Quit talking.

120
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,480
You're Li Hongqing.

121
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,320
And what of it?

122
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,520
I've been expecting you!

123
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
- It's you!
- Save it, just move!

124
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,200
There are too many pursuers.

125
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
We need a distraction.

126
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Luo Xianxue,

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm entrusting Shi Yan to you.

128
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,120
Why trust me?

129
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,360
You chose to save us.

130
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,640
You'd already made your decision.

131
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,160
Get him out of here. Head for the Capital.

132
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,480
Tell His Majesty and the Empress
about the Lingbi Sect.

133
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,840
Don't worry. I won't die.

134
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
Someone is waiting for my return.

135
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,280
Be careful.

136
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,760
<i>When it blooms,</i>

137
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,480
<i>we'll wander through mountains and rivers</i>

138
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,520
<i>to see the sea of blossoms.</i>

139
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,720
Your Highness.

140
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,920
Is there news of Hongqing?

141
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
Your Highness,

142
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
your dinner from the Imperial Kitchens.

143
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
Hongqing said I mustn't bully the weak.

144
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,480
Otherwise, he wouldn't like me anymore.

145
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,320
Then, allow me to help Your Highness dine.

146
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm not eating.

147
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm going to His Majesty.

148
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,160
You are not to follow me.

149
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,880
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

150
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
Your Majesty!

151
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,920
What now?

152
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,920
This is…

153
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
Li Hongqing's sword.

154
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,560
To save General Shi Yan,

155
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,840
Commander Li lured
the Lingbi Sect's elites away

156
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,880
and fell off the cliff to his death.

157
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
What?

158
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,600
Did they recover his body?

159
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,920
They searched for
two full days and nights.

160
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,080
All they found was his sword.

161
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
How could this be…

162
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,000
General Shi Yan said

163
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,520
the Lingbi Sect
seemed prepared from the start.

164
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,440
They set up an ambush.

165
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,520
If not for Luo Xianxue,

166
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,360
they would've all died there.

167
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,600
Luo Xianxue…

168
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,240
Shi Yan must not give up.

169
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,040
He must keep searching for Li Hongqing.

170
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,520
As long as there is no body,

171
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,760
Li Hongqing isn't dead yet.

172
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,400
- Yes.
- Wait.

173
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Princess Ying must never find out.

174
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
- Yes.
- What can't I know?

175
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,120
I heard everything.

176
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,280
Is Hongqing dead?

177
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Xiao Ying…

178
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,680
- Listen to me.
- Did you send Hongqing out there?

179
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,280
You never liked him,
so you sent him away on purpose.

180
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
You just wanted him gone!

181
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,560
- That's not true.
- Don't touch me!

182
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,480
You're the one who killed him.

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,680
I will never

184
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,400
forgive you!

185
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,360
Your Highness!

186
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,840
Your Majesty, what should we do?

187
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,560
When she loses her temper,
there's no telling what she'll do.

188
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,920
Summon the Prince of Yuzhang here.

189
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,800
As you wish.

190
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,960
- Princess Ying!
- Princess Ying!

191
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,880
- Your Highness.
- Princess Ying!

192
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
- Where is the princess?
- Princess Ying!

193
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,400
- Your Highness,
- Princess Ying!

194
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,080
Princess Ying returned an hour ago.
She looked terribly upset.

195
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,400
And then she vanished.

196
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,640
- A bunch of fools.
- Princess Ying!

197
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,840
- Search over there with me!
- Yes!

198
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,120
- Princess Ying!
- This way!

199
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,240
You, search there!

200
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,200
Princess Ying!

201
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,400
Princess Ying, where are you?

202
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,640
Ying.

203
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
Ying.

204
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,319
Ying.

205
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,400
What kind of flower is this?

206
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,319
Let me see it, will you?

207
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,680
Qianqing.

208
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,440
Come.

209
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
Ying. It's all right.

210
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,160
I will plant it for you.
I promise it'll be just the same.

211
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,320
It will bloom, I swear.

212
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
I can't get angry.

213
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,080
I can't hit or scold anyone.

214
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,120
Or else Hongqing won't like me anymore.

215
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,760
- Ying, stop it.
- I can't get angry.

216
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,040
I can't hit or scold anyone.

217
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,240
Or else Hongqing won't like me anymore.

218
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,520
But I can't hold it in. What do I do?

219
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,440
Get out!

220
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,280
I want you to leave!

221
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,720
I can't get angry.

222
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
I mustn't get angry.

223
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
If I get angry,

224
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,480
the flower won't bloom.

225
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,440
I can't get angry.

226
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
I mustn't get angry.

227
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,120
If I get angry,

228
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,520
the flower won't bloom.

229
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,560
I can't get angry…

230
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,960
Li Hongqing isn't coming back.

231
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,040
You and Li Hongqing
bought tanghulu in the market.

232
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,760
He bought this pot of flowers for you.

233
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
It's actually a Blaze Blossom.

234
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,040
When it blooms, it's brilliant.
A symbol of freedom.

235
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,880
He hoped you'd
always live happy and unbound.

236
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
He put his heart into
everything he did for you.

237
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,320
Stop talking.

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm not angry.

239
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,640
I can't get angry.

240
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,480
I mustn't get angry.

241
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,360
You've tended to this flower so carefully,

242
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,360
waiting for it to bloom,

243
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,920
hoping he'd see it when he came back.

244
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,960
Isn't that right?

245
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,440
If I get angry,
Hongqing won't like me anymore.

246
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,000
- I can't be angry.
- Li Hongqing is dead.

247
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
Even if the flower blooms,

248
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
there's no one left to cherish you.

249
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,360
You're lying!

250
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,320
Hongqing won't die.

251
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,240
He won't.

252
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,280
He's dead.
And it was His Majesty who killed him.

253
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,280
- I didn't think anything of the sort…
- You want to kill him.

254
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,400
Stop talking.

255
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,080
- Be quiet.
- You want to kill him.

256
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,080
- I wasn't thinking that!
- Kill him.

257
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,080
Kill him!

258
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,400
Kill His Majesty!

259
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,600
Avenge your dear Hongqing!

260
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Kill His Majesty!

261
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Avenge your dear Hongqing!

262
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm going to kill him.

263
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
He must die.

264
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,160
I must avenge Hongqing.

265
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,360
I must kill him.

266
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,680
I thought Your Majesty
was about to remove the cloak

267
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,680
and drape it over me.

268
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,560
Why haven't you returned home?

269
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,400
Worried about Ying?

270
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,160
Lately, my right eyelid keeps twitching.

271
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,280
Something isn't sitting right in my heart.

272
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,040
This is the only jug of wine I have left.

273
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,360
I was hoping it'd last me till morning.

274
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,160
Don't be late
for tomorrow's court session.

275
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,040
Minister Xing will be presenting
the waterworks funding proposal.

276
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,800
I'll need your support.

277
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,800
Do you intend to work me to the bone,

278
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
and have me serve till death?

279
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,920
It's for the sake of Great Qi.

280
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
Here, Prince of Yuzhang.

281
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,480
You've done well.

282
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,680
I only have one younger sister.

283
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
She may be a little wild,

284
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,960
but she's the apple of my eye.

285
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,200
I understand.

286
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,600
I haven't given up on Li Hongqing.

287
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,760
I believe

288
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
he won't meet his demise so easily.

289
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,200
- Wufu.
- Yes.

290
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
Prepare a brazier for
the Prince of Yuzhang.

291
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,080
At once.

292
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
Ying.

293
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,680
Why won't you come in?

294
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,840
I wouldn't dare.

295
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,440
You said no one was allowed inside.

296
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,160
I couldn't bear the consequences

297
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,640
of invoking your anger.

298
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm fine now.

299
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,600
Truly?

300
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,760
Ying.

301
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
I promise you

302
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,840
that Li Hongqing will be all right.

303
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,320
And the flower will bloom.

304
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
Ying, you'll have happiness in life.

305
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,280
Yes.

306
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,480
The Blaze Blossom

307
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,280
will bloom.

308
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,960
You…

309
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,080
You know what flower it is now?

310
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,960
Princess Ying is preparing
to awaken the Dual-Pupil Art?

311
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,840
Yes.

312
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,080
I've heard
that art exists only in legends.

313
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,080
Everything is progressing as planned.

314
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,600
The Dual-Pupil Art
is terrifyingly powerful,

315
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,760
and Princess Ying is now
slowly losing her sanity.

316
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,760
She's ready to drag him
down with her if she must.

317
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,440
These past days, I've tampered

318
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,360
<i>with His Majesty's pills.</i>

319
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,280
<i>Just enough to leave him drowsy,</i>

320
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,280
<i>and none the wiser.</i>

321
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,480
But tell me,

322
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
has Princess Ying
ever seen your true face?

323
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,480
She shouldn't recognize me.

324
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,600
These next few days,

325
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,440
I'll keep a close watch on her.

326
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,280
POISON TOAD

327
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,800
DEVOID OF DELUSION

328
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,560
Sir.

329
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,160
Everything is prepared.

330
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,640
Are you certain this will cure me?

331
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,920
Madam has said

332
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,800
she'd rid you of your
suffering once and for all.

333
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,360
Very well. Let's begin.

334
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,160
Yes, sir.

335
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,160
You're awake.

336
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,160
How long was I asleep?

337
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,600
An hour.

338
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
Your Majesty has been overworked lately.

339
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,520
It's normal to be drowsy now and then.

340
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,240
You summoned Mr. Li Chengtian.

341
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,720
He'll be here shortly.

342
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,400
I'll fetch some Zixue Pills
to help you stay alert.

343
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
All right.

344
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
You don't know where
Princess Ying has gone?

345
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,320
Her Majesty had
chicken soup prepared for her.

346
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,520
It won't taste good once it's cold.

347
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,000
I really don't know.

348
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,920
Lately, the princess
has stayed in her chamber.

349
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,520
No one is allowed in.

350
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,280
But today, for some
reason, she's not there.

351
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,120
We're searching as well.

352
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,640
It's fine.
We'll wait for her in her chamber, then.

353
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,680
She'll return eventually.

354
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,720
Your Majesty,

355
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,600
the princess
forbids lighting a fire inside.

356
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,320
It's a bit cold within.

357
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
It's all right.

358
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,280
Your Majesty.

359
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
Ying.

360
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,920
Ying. Why are you here?

361
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,360
Did you find Hongqing?

362
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,600
Not yet.

363
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,280
But I haven't given up.

364
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,960
The fact that we haven't found his body

365
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,040
also proves
that Li Hongqing is still alive.

366
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
You're lying to me.

367
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,080
I'm not.

368
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,760
Is it because
you hate seeing me in love with Hongqing?

369
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,200
Did you send him to his death?
Did you want him dead?

370
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,920
I did not.

371
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,040
Why would I do such a thing?

372
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,760
You've never liked
me since we were children.

373
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,840
You wanted me dead.

374
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,760
You wanted the fire to burn me alive.

375
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,880
- Ying, calm down.
- Do not call me that!

376
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,080
Only Hongqing can call me that.

377
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,480
Shall I summon the Prince of Yuzhang?

378
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,160
Believe me or not,
I am your brother as well.

379
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,160
I want you to be happy too.

380
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,280
And I hope that one day

381
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,440
you'll let me care for you.

382
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,920
If Your Majesty truly cares for me…

383
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,200
Promise me one thing, will you?

384
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,360
Certainly. Tell me.

385
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,560
Look at this table. It's so
messy, and no one cleaned it.

386
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,520
These servants all deserve a beating.

387
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,040
Judging by this sight,

388
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,160
the princess hasn't slept in her bed
for quite some time.

389
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,640
The eunuchs said
she'd barely eaten these days.

390
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,080
She stopped eating and
sleeping over Li Hongqing.

391
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,560
If this goes on,

392
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,880
it will take a toll on her body.

393
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
And who knows what she does

394
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,600
when shut up in here all day.

395
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,120
Something here has been moved.

396
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,560
Why would she shift the carpet?

397
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,280
Your Majesty!

398
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,600
The figure wearing the crown

399
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,560
is His Majesty?

400
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,840
Guards!

401
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,240
- Your Majesty.
- Where is His Majesty now?

402
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,440
Likely in Wuying Hall.

403
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,320
Notify General Lu.

404
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
Deliver my decree.
Summon the Prince of Yuzhang.

405
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
The rest of you,
come with me to Wuying Hall.

406
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,320
Yes.

407
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,760
Your Majesty!

408
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,160
It's alright.

409
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,960
Just die,

410
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,880
all right?

411
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,960
Die!

412
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,320
Your Majesty! Princess Ying!

413
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,680
Stop at once!

414
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,840
- General Lu!
- General Lu!

415
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,200
- Are you injured?
- General Lu!

416
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,720
Don't come any closer!

417
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
The Empress?

418
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,400
I think I might like you a little.

419
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,880
Forgive me.

420
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,960
He's the one
Li Hongqing loved and respected most!

421
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,680
No.

422
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,720
The one he loved most was me.

423
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,360
He's followed
His Majesty since he was nine.

424
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,880
If you kill him,
Li Hongqing will never forgive you!

425
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,080
Xiao Ying.

426
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,440
Do you still remember
what Li Hongqing promised you?

427
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,239
If you wish,

428
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,840
I'll take you out of the palace
to see the sea of blossoms.

429
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,760
If I wish,

430
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,520
he'll take me to see the flowers.

431
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,239
That's right.

432
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,760
He promised you

433
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,080
you'd see the flowers.

434
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,880
But if you kill His Majesty now,

435
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,440
that wish will never come true.

436
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,679
Liar.

437
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,199
I'm not lying.

438
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,120
If Li Hongqing stood here today,

439
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,320
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

440
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,960
If you kill the one he respects most,

441
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,400
then you will never see him again.

442
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,120
Shut up!

443
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,560
Your Majesty. Are you all right?

444
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,840
Cangcang…

445
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,280
Cangcang!

446
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,720
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

447
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
WUYING HALL

448
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,760
Your Highness.

449
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,960
Ying. Ying!

450
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,200
Ying!

451
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,560
Ying, are you hurt?

452
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,280
Ying?

453
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,760
Ying.

454
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,600
Why would you do this?

455
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,960
Tell me.

456
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,120
Why did you do this?

457
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,800
And His Majesty? How is he?

458
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,880
Your Highness, His Majesty is safe.

459
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
However, Her Majesty…

460
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,960
I deserve punishment.

461
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,120
Nothing would atone for this.

462
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,240
Where are they?

463
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,160
Sent to Linghe Hall.

464
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,640
Imperial Physician Li is there.

465
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,960
Eunuch Feng and the others

466
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,440
were likely struck by
Ying's Enfeebling Dust.

467
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,160
The cold palace should have the antidote.
One more thing.

468
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
If the Empress Dowager arrives,
you must stop her.

469
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,760
Do not let her near Linghe Hall.

470
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,760
Yes.

471
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,680
You brat.

472
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,240
Get some rest.

473
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,040
When will the Empress be out of danger?

474
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,920
Her Majesty
miscarried and lost too much blood.

475
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,240
But her constitution is strong.

476
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,360
If she wakes, she should recover.

477
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,760
And if she doesn't wake?

478
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,720
You brat.

479
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,360
You must keep a clear head.

480
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,160
A clear head?

481
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
My child is gone.
My empress remains unconscious.

482
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,400
How do you expect me to be calm?

483
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,760
Now, my child is gone.

484
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,480
The Empress is
bleeding out, clinging to life.

485
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,800
All thanks to your dear little sister.

486
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,520
I deserve a thousand deaths.

487
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,640
You need not die.

488
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,200
But Xiao Ying must pay the price.

489
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,640
It's my fault for failing to guide her.
Punish me instead.

490
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,160
Will you die in her place too?

491
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,000
Your Majesty, I beg you.
Please spare her life.

492
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,040
In return, you will have
my unconditional loyalty.

493
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,840
Get out.

494
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't want to see you again.

495
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,320
You brat.

496
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,040
Get some rest.

497
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,360
If Her Majesty wakes up,

498
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,200
you shouldn't be the one who falls sick.

499
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,280
Why isn't the Empress awake yet?

500
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,560
I checked her pulse just now.

501
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,320
It's still steady and strong.

502
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,040
Give her a little more time.

503
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,280
Your Majesty,

504
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,080
Prince of Yuzhang
is still kneeling outside.

505
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,640
Let him kneel all he wants.

506
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,680
LINGHE HALL

507
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,280
Cangcang.

508
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,720
You're awake.

509
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
Your Majesty.

510
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Your Majesty.

511
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,240
Were you hurt?

512
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,360
I am all right.

513
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,160
I am safe and sound.

514
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,080
I'm glad to hear that.
