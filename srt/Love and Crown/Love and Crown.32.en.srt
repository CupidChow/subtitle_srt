00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,530
Your Highness,

379
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,530
in my view,

380
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,420
Mr. Li is already advanced in age,

381
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,380
yet still toiling in court day after day.

382
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,660
It is far too hard on him.

383
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,730
Mr. Li, why not follow the others,

384
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,420
resign and return to your family?

385
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,580
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

386
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,820
Approved.

387
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,860
Approved.

388
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,820
No ambition,

389
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,490
unfit for great responsibility!

390
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,860
Who are you putting on this act for?

391
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,530
What are you talking about?

392
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,620
I don't understand a word.

393
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,820
I hear

394
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,380
you're still searching the Qining River for Xiao Huan.

395
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,380
Do you think

396
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,770
he's really dead?

397
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,940
Whether he's alive or dead,

398
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,900
there's no turning back for us now.

399
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:03,180
[Changhe Gate]

400
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,940
Sir.

401
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,940
Sir,

402
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,770
how did the Prince of Yuzhang handle

403
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,970
those resignation memorials?

404
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,420
He approved them all.

405
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,770
What is he trying to do?

406
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,250
He's going to ruin the realm.

407
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,050
- What are we to do? - Go back and tell the Old Madam

408
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,940
to gather all the family

409
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,660
and leave the Capital at once.

410
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,900
Sir, what about you?

411
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,050
There's one last thing I must do.

412
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,770
Once it's done,

413
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,450
I'll catch up with you.

414
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,210
Understood.

415
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,140
With His Majesty's fate uncertain,

416
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,340
the court has fallen into chaos.

417
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,620
The Prince of Yuzhang serves as Regent,

418
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,250
yet ignores state affairs.

419
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,210
[Changhe Gate]
The Imperial Preceptor beside him

420
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,420
harbors wolfish ambition.

421
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,690
Now in this court,

422
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,940
those above

423
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,600
cannot reach the imperial ear,

424
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,490
and those below

425
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,340
cannot aid the common folk.

426
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,380
Villains hold sway,

427
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:20,210
a disgrace to Great Qi!

428
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,580
If this goes on,

429
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,580
the officials' hearts will scatter,

430
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,770
and Heaven itself

431
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,900
will show ill omen!

432
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,140
Why don't we

433
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,100
just throw Li Chengtian into the prison?

434
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,100
Let's see how tough this old bone really is.

435
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,180
If I do that now,

436
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,820
I'd only grant him the name of a loyal minister.

437
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,490
By now, every courtier who can be threatened or bought

438
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,940
is already under my command.

439
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,250
Those who still refuse to yield

440
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,420
also serve my purposes

441
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,970
thanks to Lingbi Sect's Heartbane.

442
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,100
Only a few stubborn old bones are left.

443
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,860
They are a deadly hidden threat.

444
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,690
Why not ask the Saintess to use the Heartbane on him as well?

445
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,940
That pack of vermin is foul and stubborn,

446
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,380
utterly unafraid of death!

447
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,730
Even if I poison him,

448
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,490
he'll most likely kill himself to prove his loyalty.

449
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,530
As for Li Chengtian,

450
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,380
if he must die,

451
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,580
I'll see that his death serves my ends.

452
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,860
[Merciful Salvation]

453
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,260
On guard!

454
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,740
- Mr. Li! - Mr. Li!

455
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,380
- Mr. Li! - Mr. Li!

456
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,700
Mr. Li!

457
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,530
Mr. Li!

458
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:06,900
[One with Heaven and Earth]

459
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,700
We respectfully greet the Saintess!

460
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,220
Reporting to the Saintess,

461
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,050
several of our branches have been destroyed recently.

462
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,530
They say...

463
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,260
They say...

464
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,380
Say what?

465
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,260
They say the Ghost King has appeared,

466
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,420
and heaven and earth are as one.

467
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,010
And the Ghost King even beat us to it,

468
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,490
completing the Nanrong Palace mission

469
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,050
and killing Li Chengtian.

470
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,490
How could a new Ghost King appear?

471
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,450
Does he have the Moon-Eclipse on him?

472
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,940
Yes.

473
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,650
All those slain by him

474
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,380
bear ghost markings.

475
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,650
Only one who holds the Moon-Eclipse

476
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,700
can do this.

477
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,570
The Ghost King's return

478
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,420
is the glory of Lingbi Sect!

479
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,100
[Seven days earlier]

480
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,860
Now the Saintess is using Du Tingxin's hand

481
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,290
to endanger the whole court,

482
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,650
even all of Great Qi.

483
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,700
I've thought it through carefully.

484
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,050
I stand in the light,

485
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,410
and the Saintess hides in the dark.

486
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,300
If we are to save everyone's lives,

487
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,840
we must stage my death.

488
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,080
Your Majesty,

489
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,800
your body is already spent.

490
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,400
You can't take much more.

491
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,400
How can you possibly stand against them?

492
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,330
The Moon-Eclipse is the Ghost King's token

493
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,970
because it is both medicine and poison.

494
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,250
It can heal wounds and save lives,

495
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,410
and even strengthen one's inner power.

496
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,630
But once it's used, there is no turning back.

497
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,580
It'll consume your essence and shorten your life.

498
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,260
When the poison seeps into your bones,

499
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,390
it will destroy you.

500
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,260
He is inside.

501
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,530
Your Majesty has suffered.

502
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,970
I'm fine.

503
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,050
You truly have not betrayed my trust.

504
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,050
I've followed Your Majesty for so many years.

505
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,010
I never believed you would harm Princess Ying,

506
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,860
nor that you would seek your own death.

507
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,570
So your leap from Phoenix Terrace

508
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,300
must have been your plan to escape.

509
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,130
As soon as Eunuch Feng sent word,

510
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,170
I immediately activated the Xiaoxing secret guards

511
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,530
and learned you were here.

512
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,050
Commander Li,

513
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,130
head to the meeting spot outside the Capital now,

514
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,970
activate the Xiaoxing secret guards,

515
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,900
locate His Majesty,

516
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,970
and await his command.

517
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,570
Take care.

518
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,700
How are things at court?

519
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,970
Everything is just as you predicted.

520
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,650
Although everyone believes

521
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,820
you couldn't have survived in the Qining River,

522
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,420
the upright elder ministers

523
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,570
still invoked the ancestral rules

524
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,010
to block the Prince of Yuzhang from taking the throne.

525
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,570
Even the Imperial Preceptor can do nothing about it.

526
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,010
So,

527
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,820
they're focusing all their efforts

528
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,420
on searching for my body.

529
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,780
Good.

530
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,490
Next,

531
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,900
I'll use my identity as the Ghost King to lure the Saintess out.

532
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:38,570
Your Majesty...

533
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,810
Becoming the Ghost King with the Moon-Eclipse

534
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,940
is a choice I made long ago.

535
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,860
You've given too much for Great Qi.

536
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,340
I am answerable to the world,

537
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,170
and to every subject of Great Qi.

538
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,450
It's only Cangcang I've failed.

539
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,610
How is Cangcang?

540
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,610
The Empress is safe and sound.

541
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,570
I never imagined

542
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,410
that meeting Cangcang,

543
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,930
killing Li Lu,

544
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,490
and obtaining the Moon-Eclipse

545
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,940
were all fated from the start.

546
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,780
Whatever you plan to do,

547
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,900
I'll surely advance and retreat with you.

548
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,050
Cangcang,

549
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,340
her roots run deep in the palace.

550
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,120
If I move against her,

551
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,120
it'll surely trigger a mad backlash.

552
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,170
Only by getting you safely away

553
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,520
can I stake everything on one last move.

554
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,280
I'm sorry.

555
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,490
Bai!

556
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,490
Are you there?

557
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,700
Don't worry.

558
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,610
I believe in you.

559
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,170
I'll wait for you to come back.

560
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,420
Thanks for looking after me, sir.

561
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,490
I'll repay your kindness someday.

562
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,860
Let's go.

563
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,220
Are those wearing ghost masks from Lingbi Sect?

564
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,050
They are.

565
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,170
I hear Lingbi Sect is no small thing these days.

566
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,530
They're recruiting men,

567
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,940
growing stronger and stronger.

568
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,300
But hasn't Lingbi Sect

569
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,300
been suppressed by the court for over a year?

570
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,420
And they still dare to swagger around like this?

571
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,940
Word is the Lingbi Saintess

572
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,340
has returned from the far south,

573
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,490
and even latched onto the court.

574
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,170
Truly chaotic times.

575
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,490
The court itself is a mess.

576
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,300
The Emperor and Empress are both ill.

577
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,530
A prince is acting as Regent.

578
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,650
Could she be the Lingbi Saintess?

579
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:58,940
Hush.

580
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,050
Come on, have some tea.

581
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,340
My father planted spies in the palace.

582
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,220
How many are left?

583
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,530
I don't know the exact number.

584
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,740
Grand Tutor Ling laid many hidden pieces,

585
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,090
and even I don't know them all.

586
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,050
Then how am I supposed to find them?

587
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,340
Me?

588
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,970
Right.

589
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,010
The key lies with you.

590
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,450
What do you mean?

591
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,570
Before Grand Tutor Ling was killed at Fayun Temple,

592
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,860
he secretly summoned us.

593
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,860
If anything happened to him,

594
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,820
Fayun Temple would sound the bell as a warning,

595
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,010
and we were all to follow your lead.

596
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,860
All right.

597
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,170
How do we meet them?

598
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,340
Three days after the mourning period,

599
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,340
at Guisi Mausoleum.
