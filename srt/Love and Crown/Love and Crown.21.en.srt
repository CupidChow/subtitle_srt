LOVE & CROWN

ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 21

4
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,400
I didn't expect Xiao Huan
to be such a romantic.

5
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,920
Don't move.

6
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
How could this happen?

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,480
Sorry to disappoint you.

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,720
I've woken up.

9
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,480
This can't be!

10
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,680
How could my
Illusion-Butterfly Powder fail?

11
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,360
How is it that you're both standing here?

12
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,520
The Frost Reed can cure any poison.

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
It seems
your investigation wasn't thorough enough.

14
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Cangcang!

15
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,720
Zhong Lin!

16
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,160
- Are you all right?
- We're fine.

17
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,040
Thanks to the Puppet Incense
that Xiao Qianqing brought,

18
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,040
we managed to control one of the servants.

19
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
Good.

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,440
The antidote. Quickly.

21
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Let's go.

22
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,720
Release the branch leader. And we'll
leave you both with intact bodies!

23
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
Clear the way.

24
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,680
Make way.

25
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Hurry!

26
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,920
Xiao Huan,
do you really think you can escape?

27
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,800
I'll give you one more chance.

28
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,440
Hand over the Moon-Eclipse,

29
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,760
or I'll make sure all
of you lose your senses

30
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,440
and perish with your meridians severed.

31
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,279
Zhong Lin.

32
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
Insolent.

33
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,320
Protector, have mercy!

34
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,240
I only sought to present

35
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,520
the Moon-Eclipse to you.

36
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,880
Is that so?

37
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,040
My sources tell me you intend

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
to become the Ghost King yourself.

39
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
Die!

40
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Luo Xianxue?

41
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,760
Luo.

42
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,240
I'm glad you're safe.

43
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,080
That day,

44
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,320
I watched you be
engulfed in flames with my own eyes.

45
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Father sent someone to retrieve your body,

46
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,920
and they found
a severed finger on it as well.

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
I thought I'd never see you again.

48
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,800
How did you escape?

49
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
There was a cellar in the liquor storage.

50
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,520
I hid there and barely survived.

51
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,640
You never came looking for me.

52
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,960
I knew

53
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,680
His Majesty saw me as a thorn in his side.

54
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,280
If I appeared recklessly,

55
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,760
I'd only bring you trouble.

56
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
So,

57
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,800
I planned to wander the world.

58
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,360
And now you've appeared out of nowhere.

59
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,040
Do you intend to assassinate him?

60
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Why?

61
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,440
I don't want

62
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
to see you hurt,

63
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,880
suffering,

64
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,000
or endangered because of him.

65
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Cangcang, he's your tribulation.

66
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,680
Don't let yourself get
entangled with him anymore.

67
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,440
If you can't make up your mind,
I can help.

68
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,480
Luo,

69
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
so much has happened

70
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,520
between him and me since you left.

71
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,600
It's not as simple as you think.

72
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,840
Even I didn't expect some things.

73
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
He and I…

74
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,960
Nobody can decide our matters for me.

75
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,160
I overstepped.

76
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,480
That's not what I meant.

77
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,240
- Luo, I…
- Cangcang.

78
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,880
Have you forgotten?

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
You saved my life.

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,880
Protecting you is my lifelong duty.

81
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,880
I don't want to see you harmed in any way.

82
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,680
I heard they raided
an evildoer's base around here.

83
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,080
Many missing children were found.

84
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
Many of them were silenced.

85
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,840
He moved!

86
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,800
They say you're dying.

87
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
I won't allow it.

88
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,520
Luo Xianxue, you are not to die
without my permission.

89
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,560
I, Luo Xianxue, swear to the heavens.

90
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,600
I, Luo Xianxue, swear to the heavens.

91
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
From now on, I belong to Ling Cangcang.

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,640
From now on, I belong to Ling Cangcang.

93
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,760
No matter how hard it gets,

94
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,360
I will stay strong for Ling Cangcang.

95
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,000
No matter how hard it gets,

96
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,320
I will stay strong for Ling Cangcang.

97
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,640
Cangcang,

98
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,200
it's for you

99
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,120
that I crawled my way out of that fire.

100
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,240
Luo,

101
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,240
ever since you joined the Ling family,

102
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,480
you've always been a brother to me.

103
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,160
Do you remember

104
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,880
the vow I made when I entered the palace?

105
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,040
I will protect
everyone in the Ling family.

106
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,960
I've never changed.

107
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
It's just…

108
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,600
With Xiao Huan,

109
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,560
I now…

110
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,120
So, no matter how much he hurts you,

111
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
you won't hurt him back.

112
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
Is that right?

113
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,240
Luo,

114
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,840
I think there are many misunderstandings
between you two.

115
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
It will take time to clear them up.

116
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,760
All right.

117
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,560
If that's the case,

118
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,640
we'll talk next time.

119
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,920
Good.

120
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
Cangcang,

121
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,720
I remember you've always loved

122
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,360
pear blossom honey since you were little.

123
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,400
I brought some especially for you.

124
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,760
I didn't expect
you still remember after all this time.

125
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
Of course.

126
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,760
Try it while it's warm.

127
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,440
It's the taste I remember.

128
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,040
It's been…

129
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,520
It's been…

130
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,560
Cangcang!

131
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Luo Xianxue.

132
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,280
I know why you came.

133
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,520
If you really wanted to be dead,

134
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,000
you wouldn't show up.

135
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
Let's cut the chatter.

136
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,680
Hand over the Moon-Eclipse

137
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,400
and face your fate.

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
Do you know what you're saying?

139
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,480
There will be a battle between us.

140
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,520
Have you thought about
what will happen to Cangcang?

141
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
I will never hurt her.

142
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,240
You already have.

143
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,760
You know Ling Xuefeng is using you
to rebuild the Lingbi Sect,

144
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
yet you willingly serve as his dog.

145
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,520
You know how Cangcang feels about me,

146
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
yet you help Ling Xuefeng to kill me.

147
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,400
What do you expect
Cangcang to think or do?

148
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,440
Enough talk. Fight me!

149
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,520
Stop!

150
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,920
- Cangcang…
- You lied to me.

151
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,880
You weren't supposed to be…

152
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,920
I've used inner force to remove
the sedative in the pear blossom honey.

153
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,160
Your "death" was flawless.

154
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,040
You couldn't have done it alone.

155
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,160
What's really going on?

156
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Cangcang,

157
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,360
you and Father saved my life.

158
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,280
I must obey

159
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,120
his command.

160
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,720
My father?

161
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,360
What order did my father give you?

162
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,200
He must die

163
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
today.

164
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,960
- You won't succeed!
- Cangcang, move aside!

165
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,720
The Xiaoxing Guards
are already lying in wait.

166
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,040
You can't do anything to me.

167
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,520
Luo Xianxue,

168
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,640
you loyally serve Grand Tutor Ling.

169
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,200
But sadly,

170
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,000
you're a fool.

171
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,800
Do you know what
Grand Tutor Ling has done?

172
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,000
Whatever he does,

173
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,360
it's all for the Ling clan

174
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,760
and Cangcang.

175
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,720
Is it?

176
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
Do you know Grand Tutor Ling

177
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,000
poisoned Ling Cangcang
to force His Majesty

178
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,160
to give her the cure?

179
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
Were his actions really
for Ling Cangcang's sake?

180
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,280
What?

181
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,720
My father…

182
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,600
Was it

183
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,360
the pear blossom honey?

184
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,240
<i>Grand Tutor Ling brought</i>
<i>this pear blossom honey today.</i>

185
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,160
<i>I added four spoonfuls as instructed.</i>

186
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,400
Luo Xianxue,

187
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,480
surrender yourself.

188
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
- Never!
- Wait.

189
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,200
Your Majesty.

190
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,360
Let him go.

191
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,280
- Let him go?
- Cangcang!

192
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,240
Go!

193
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,720
I never want to see you again.

194
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,480
Leave!

195
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,760
Very well.

196
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Leave.

197
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,400
So it was all

198
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,120
my father's doing…

199
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,840
You should go back.

200
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
I need some time to myself.

201
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,920
I wish to resign of my own accord.

202
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,520
I only ask that Your Majesty

203
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,880
will be merciful and spare

204
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,040
my only daughter.

205
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,760
QI

206
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,520
They've returned at last.

207
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,840
We welcome the return of
His Majesty and Her Majesty.

208
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,840
It's been a while, everyone.

209
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,560
I hope all has been well.

210
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,960
I dare to ask,

211
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,800
Your Highness, how much longer

212
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,640
will you govern on behalf of His Majesty?

213
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,800
Well…

214
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,760
His Majesty's health has greatly improved

215
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,160
but still requires rest.

216
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,640
You'll have to deal
with me for a while longer,

217
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,000
Grand Tutor Ling.

218
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,080
His Majesty and Her Majesty
share a deep and enduring love.

219
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,920
It is a blessing for Great Qi.

220
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,880
Enough of these words.

221
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,880
Save them

222
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,320
for when His Majesty
returns from the outer palace

223
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,640
to hear it himself.

224
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,480
Now, let us discuss
the situation in Xuzhou.

225
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,520
The disaster in Xuzhou

226
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
has been temporarily contained.

227
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Sadly, Song Lanxi

228
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,880
was killed.

229
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,680
Mr. Song was killed?

230
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,640
Mr. Li,

231
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,960
I have failed you.

232
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,640
Lanxi sacrificed himself for the country.

233
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,880
I pray Your Highness will investigate
the culprits behind the unrest.

234
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,760
Rest assured.

235
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,720
It is my duty.

236
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,160
That said,

237
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,160
the position of Governor
of Xuzhou remains vacant.

238
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,880
There is no suitable candidate in Xuzhou.

239
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,520
From what I know,

240
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,280
the former Governor

241
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,760
was once under
Grand Tutor Ling's tutelage.

242
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,960
Might you have any suggestions

243
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,320
for the new Governor,

244
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,040
Grand Tutor Ling?

245
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,800
I never expected

246
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,360
the Governor of Xuzhou

247
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,400
to commit such unforgivable acts!

248
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,840
He ignored my warnings.

249
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,480
It brings shame upon me.

250
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,320
Indeed.

251
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,680
I was also taken aback.

252
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,240
Mr. Li, you've returned to court.

253
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,680
I entrust you to recommend
a governor for Xuzhou.

254
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,160
Yes, Your Highness.

255
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,880
My Lord, His Majesty and Her Majesty
have arrived at the outer palace.

256
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,200
Still no word from Xianxue?

257
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,120
No.

258
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,680
We grew up together.

259
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,760
My mission is to protect Cangcang.

260
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,760
But now,
she no longer needs your protection.

261
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,080
- Who said that?
- His Majesty.

262
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,160
Then what am I to do?

263
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,960
Do whatever you wish.

264
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,760
Be carefree and at ease.

265
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,000
Isn't that a good thing?

266
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,800
Can I?

267
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,320
You can.

268
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,320
I think so too.

269
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
How is it?

270
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
How is what?

271
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,880
The taste when
you kissed my forehead just now.

272
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,200
I…

273
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,560
There's a lingering
aroma of liquor on my lips.

274
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,160
Would you like to taste it?

275
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,880
Sweet,

276
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
but slightly astringent.

277
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,840
Young Master, what are you…

278
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,040
Answer me.

279
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,400
Did you really poison
Young Lady's pear blossom honey?

280
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Did you?

281
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,640
I can't believe it's true.

282
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
Father actually meant to harm Cangcang.

283
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,120
No.

284
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,440
He had his reasons.

285
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,440
Everything he does is for her

286
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
and the Ling clan.

287
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,120
He never meant her harm.

288
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Then, answer this.

289
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,240
If that person hadn't
given her the antidote,

290
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,560
what would have happened?

291
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,640
You're gambling with her life!

292
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,760
<i>Luo Xianxue!</i>

293
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,960
I pulled you back from the brink of death
and took you in.

294
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,920
Is this how you repay me?

295
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,960
I am Cangcang's father.

296
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,760
Everything I do

297
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,000
is for her good.

298
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,120
<i>Xianxue,</i>

299
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,800
<i>this is the path she must walk.</i>

300
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,320
<i>All we can do</i>

301
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
<i>is pave the way for her</i>

302
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,720
<i>to travel steadily</i>

303
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
<i>and far.</i>

304
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,520
I know your heart aches.

305
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
As a father, so does mine.

306
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,120
<i>But this is the truth she longs for</i>

307
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,760
<i>and the reality she must face.</i>

308
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,240
I beg Your Majesty

309
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,040
to spare the Ling clan

310
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,160
and Luo Xianxue.

311
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
<i>I offer myself</i>

312
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,120
<i>as Your Majesty's consort.</i>

313
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,880
<i>May Your Majesty grant my request.</i>

314
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,960
Xiao Huan,

315
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,680
let him go!

316
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,800
Let him go.

317
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,560
I'm sorry.

318
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,280
I was the one who was wrong.

319
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,360
I thought I was protecting you,

320
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,000
yet I brought you nothing but harm.

321
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,520
Cangcang,

322
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,840
I swear to the heavens.

323
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,320
From this day forth,

324
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,000
I will never let you suffer

325
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,200
even the slightest harm.

326
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,160
<i>How did I end up here?</i>

327
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,840
Your Majesty,
I'll announce your arrival right away.

328
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,880
Don't bother.

329
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,600
The Emperor returned to court today.

330
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,600
Yet, my son still has the nerve
to sleep soundly in his residence.

331
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,280
Your Majesty, please mind your health.

332
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,120
What…

333
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

334
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,160
Where did you come from?

335
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,880
Dishevelled and sneaking about.

336
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,200
What are you doing at
the Prince of Yuzhang's manor?

337
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,440
The night was young,

338
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,320
and we made merry together.

339
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,360
What else did you think we did?

340
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,400
You…

341
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,200
Your Majesty.

342
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,040
Your Majesty.

343
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,200
LINGHE HALL

344
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,880
We welcome Her Majesty's return.

345
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,680
FATE'S RISE AND FALL HEED NO ONE'S WILL

346
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,600
WHERE FATE IS SOWN,
THE HEART MAKES ITS OWN CHOICE

347
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,960
WHERE FATE IS SOWN,
THE HEART MAKES ITS OWN CHOICE

348
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,080
Look at mine.

349
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,240
See how high it is.

350
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,120
Mine's higher.

351
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,840
Zhong Lin,

352
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,760
you brought me out of the palace.

353
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,240
Is there something you want to tell me?

354
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,520
I…

355
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,880
Cangcang.

356
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,640
You…

357
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,560
What do you want to say?

358
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,000
Nothing.

359
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,960
You seemed to be in low spirits,

360
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
so I thought a kite flying
outing might cheer you up.

361
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,360
Cangcang,

362
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,800
you've seemed unhappy lately.

363
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,920
What's troubling you?

364
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,159
I was thinking about my father.

365
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,040
Grand Tutor Ling?

366
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
Since our return from Jiangzhou

367
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,840
and after meeting Luo Xianxue,

368
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,719
you've been acting strangely.

369
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,080
What happened?

370
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,120
It wasn't until today

371
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,000
that I pieced everything together.

372
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,440
It turns out

373
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,000
the mastermind behind all this

374
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,920
was him.

375
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,080
Xiao Huan never told me
about everything my father did.

376
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,880
I think he wanted to protect me

377
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,600
and feared I wouldn't be able to bear it.

378
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,400
These past few days, I've been thinking.

379
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,160
When did Father

380
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,880
who cared for

381
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,560
and protected me so much change?

382
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,640
How could he do such things?

383
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,720
Cangcang,

384
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,200
you're his only daughter.

385
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,400
He must love you.

386
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
But how much

387
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,640
of that love is genuine

388
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,440
and how much is self-serving,

389
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,040
I can no longer tell.

390
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,160
He was certain

391
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,360
Xiao Huan would use
the Frost Reed to save me.

392
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,240
If I could successfully carry a child,

393
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,680
he could support my child

394
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,040
to ascend the throne.

395
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,840
So what do we do now?

396
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,840
The Grand Tutor has set his mind to this…

397
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
What does His Majesty plan to do with him?

398
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,480
Caught between the two,

399
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,600
what should you do?

400
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,160
Xiao Huan is a wise ruler of Great Qi.

401
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,560
He is a good emperor for the people.

402
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
To protect Great Qi,

403
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
the stability of the nation,

404
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,960
and the well-being of the people,

405
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,000
I must stand alongside Xiao Huan

406
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,880
as his equal.

407
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,400
As for my father…

408
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,840
I only hope

409
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,160
he can still change his ways.

410
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,640
But I haven't figured
out how to face him yet.

411
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,560
Cangcang, he will.

412
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
The Grand Tutor surely will.

413
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,840
Shall we go fly kites? Don't dwell on it.

414
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,840
Let all these worries and sorrows

415
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
fly away like kites. All right?

416
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,920
Come on. Come on!

417
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,080
That boy runs fast.

418
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,440
Yes.

419
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,040
- Be careful.
- Wait for me!

420
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,560
It flies so high!

421
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,400
TAIJI HALL

422
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,280
Today, I wish to discuss

423
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,840
the abolition of the status
verification system in Jiangzhou.

424
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,720
In addition,

425
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,360
to implement temporary
centralized status verification nationwide

426
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,160
and gradually abolish the system.

427
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,120
Does anyone have objections?

428
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,280
Your Majesty,

429
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,320
while the temporary system might solve

430
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,840
immediate concerns,

431
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,960
it risks encouraging negative practices.

432
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Please consider carefully, Your Majesty.

433
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,880
What negative practices?

434
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,360
Well…

435
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,320
Your Majesty,

436
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,720
Minister Xing believes the root
of the vagrants' issues

437
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,600
lies in registration and taxation.

438
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,120
Centralizing the registration

439
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,480
might cause taxation problems.

440
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,520
Therefore, this can't continue.

441
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,560
Since you brought up taxation,

442
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,680
I've also given the matter some thought.

443
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,840
This tax system was set during
the reign of the previous emperor.

444
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,040
Shouldn't it be
improved to suit the times?

445
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,200
Your Majesty, this tax system has
been in place for many decades.

446
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
It has its reasons to exist.

447
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
It won't do to change it

448
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,720
on a whim.

449
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,840
I believe
what Your Majesty has said is reasonable.

450
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,640
Mr. Li is right.

451
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,520
I also support Your Majesty's proposal.

452
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,240
Prince of Yuzhang, what are your views?

453
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,720
As His Majesty and Grand Tutor Ling said,

454
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,240
the tax system hasn't changed for decades.

455
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,720
But Great Qi's development never stops.

456
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,560
I believe
this is the time to break the old ways

457
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
and reform taxation.

458
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,680
Prince of Yuzhang and
I are of the same opinion.

459
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,600
The current tax system
has many types of levies

460
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,880
which prompt
frequent corruption by officials.

461
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,000
I have also considered
simplifying the collections

462
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,160
and taxing by acreage instead.

463
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,200
Of course,
all this is still under discussion.

464
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,800
If any minister has ideas,

465
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,200
please present them to me.

466
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,560
Since no one else has anything to say,

467
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,800
we'll end today's session here.

468
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
You're grinning without reason.

469
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,880
What cunning scheme

470
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,960
is your wise self plotting now?

471
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,920
I just think
you were especially impressive today.

472
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,600
As a matter of fact,

473
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,800
it has been a long time
since we had a proper conversation.

474
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,200
Feel free to enjoy this
advantage you have earned.

475
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,320
Well, what do you think of my idea?

476
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,280
If the tax policies are simplified,

477
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,520
officials will find it harder to cheat,

478
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,440
so revenue should increase.

479
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,200
More importantly,

480
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,120
the people's tax burden will lessen.

481
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,000
It is indeed a good proposal.

482
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,960
However…

483
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
However,

484
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,880
the status verification issue
only treats the symptoms, not the cause.

485
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,520
We'll take it slow.

486
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,760
Reform takes time.

487
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,400
I heard you stopped
Her Majesty's birth-control tea.

488
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,000
You know about that?

489
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,960
My mother cares about you having an heir

490
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,920
much more than I do.

491
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,600
I heard

492
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,200
she is eager to find
a princess consort for you.

493
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,800
What do you say?

494
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,320
Would you like me to find you a few?

495
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,320
I do regret

496
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
meddling and saving you.

497
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,960
Look.

498
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,400
Victory is mine.

499
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,800
Your Majesty,
is it true that you can roast pears?

500
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,280
Yes.

501
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,240
This is a recipe my mother invented.

502
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,360
When I was little,

503
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,840
I remember often

504
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,080
roasting pears with my master and father…

505
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,800
The Grand Tutor roasts pears too?

506
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,080
I haven't roasted them in a while as well.

507
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,320
- Father.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

508
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,960
Please be seated.

509
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,000
You as well, Your Majesty.

510
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,240
Let me tell you something.

511
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,000
Only the Jinye pears

512
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,040
from Shuiquan Village
are best for roasting.

513
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,520
They are full of juice.

514
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,080
Once they're grilled,

515
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,840
spread some of your favourite pear
blossom honey on them.

516
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,320
You used to love it as a child.
