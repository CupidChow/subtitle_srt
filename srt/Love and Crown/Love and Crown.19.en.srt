ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
It's hot.

3
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm fine.

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,520
You're still smiling after all this?

5
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,080
You care about me. That makes me happy.

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
Where's your medicine?

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
I've stopped using it.

8
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
Stopped using it?

9
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,440
I mean,

10
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I don't need it anymore. I took it.

11
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
You took it,
and you're still not getting better.

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm really fine. I just need some sleep.

13
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,080
You have reached Jiangzhou.

14
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,960
Why did you come back?

15
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Why did you trick me into leaving?

16
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,440
To keep you safe.

17
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
You're the Emperor.

18
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
Your life is more important
than my safety.

19
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,440
Yes, I'm the Emperor,

20
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,640
but I'm also your husband.

21
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,040
Even if I can become
the Empress of the Great Qi again,

22
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,840
I can never be
the Ling Cangcang that Bai Chifan likes.

23
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,760
You haven't answered me

24
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
why you came back.

25
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,200
I didn't want to bear the blame
for causing your death.

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But I think

27
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
you came back
because you worried about me.

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,040
I didn't.

29
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

30
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm cold.

31
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,560
Let me warm up a little.

32
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,600
We humbly welcome Your Majesties' arrival.

33
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
I failed in my duties,

34
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,880
putting both
Your Majesty and Her Majesty in danger.

35
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,000
Please punish me.

36
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
Xiao Huan.

37
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
Xiao Huan?

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,040
Xiao Huan!

39
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,640
Xiao Huan! Xiao Huan!

40
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,240
Guards! Summon the Imperial Preceptor.

41
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,200
Cangcang.

42
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,920
Cangcang.

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
I'm here. I'm here.

44
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,440
Don't leave me.

45
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,840
I won't.

46
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll always be with you.

47
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,800
- Your Majesty.
- Please rise. Examine His Majesty.

48
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
It's worse than I expected.

49
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,080
What is this?

50
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,480
You didn't listen to me.

51
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,600
To save Your Majesty as fast as possible,

52
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,560
His Majesty took the Yushu Pill

53
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,760
to force back the cold poison in his body.

54
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,240
But the Yushu Pill is a poison itself.

55
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,520
One cannot cure poison with poison.

56
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,040
Now that the cold poison has recurred,

57
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,920
his qi is obstructed throughout all organs

58
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,640
and both his heart and lungs
have been harmed.

59
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
Xiao Huan.

60
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,040
What happened? Are you all right?

61
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,680
- Your Majesty.
- Xiao Huan.

62
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,240
- Xiao Huan. What's wrong?
- Your Majesty.

63
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,280
Are you all right?

64
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,520
Your Majesty.

65
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Don't scare me.

66
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,480
Are you all right?
What's happening to him?

67
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
What's wrong with him?

68
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,000
His condition

69
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,920
is extremely grave.

70
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,840
No. Think of something. Quick!

71
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,040
I told you before.

72
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
Frost Reed is the only antidote for him.
He gave it to you.

73
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
No. No.

74
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,520
No, I don't want it.

75
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,160
I don't want it.
I don't know any antidote.

76
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,200
Xiao Huan.

77
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,760
Xiao Huan!

78
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,960
- Xiao Huan!
- Cangcang.

79
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,520
- Cangcang.
- Wake up!

80
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,440
Look at this.

81
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
What is this?

82
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,880
I went to an old shaman and begged
for this medicinal bath prescription.

83
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,200
He once used this

84
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,720
to save soldiers afflicted
with cold poison.

85
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Take a look. Will this work?

86
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
Preceptor Du.

87
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,200
This prescription

88
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,280
does have its uses.

89
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,480
But His Majesty's poison
has reached his lungs.

90
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm not sure if…

91
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,600
There's no time. Hurry.

92
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,760
- Try it.
- Guards!

93
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,120
- Yes.
- Prepare a bath barrel.

94
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
Boil the medicine
according to the prescription.

95
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
Yes!

96
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Xiao Huan.

97
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
<i>Cangcang,</i>

98
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,800
<i>I know you've misunderstood me</i>
<i>many times before.</i>

99
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
Will you give me a chance to start over?

100
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,280
<i>I'll stay by your side</i>

101
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,960
<i>until the day you're willing</i>
<i>to walk toward me.</i>

102
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,720
POST STATION

103
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,800
It's hot.

104
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,800
The fever finally broke.

105
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,880
Xiao Huan.

106
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,760
Xiao Huan.

107
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
Xiao Huan.

108
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,880
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

109
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,240
His heartbeat is fast.

110
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,600
Did the poison reach his lungs?

111
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Xiao Huan.

112
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,520
Don't scare me.

113
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
Xiao Huan. Xiao Huan!

114
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,360
Wake up, Xiao Huan!

115
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,880
You can't die.

116
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,480
Xiao Huan. I won't blame you anymore.

117
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,320
I won't scold you anymore.
I won't resent you anymore.

118
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
Wake up. You can't die. Xiao Huan!

119
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,120
I'm not dead.

120
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,400
You're awake.

121
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,720
I'm fine.

122
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Really?

123
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't lie to me.

124
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,880
Even if I had died,

125
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,600
keeping you safe

126
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,520
would've been worth it.

127
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
POST STATION

128
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
You've just started to recover.

129
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,880
Make sure you don't catch a chill again.

130
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,440
All right.

131
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,360
Your Majesty, you're finally awake.

132
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,320
I suddenly feel like
eating pear blossom honey.

133
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,720
Great. Preceptor Du can check my pulse.

134
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
Go get it for me.

135
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,360
Sure.

136
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,880
His Majesty's poisoned veins have eased
these past few days.

137
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Please examine him again, Preceptor Du.

138
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,680
Do you know

139
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,400
why I asked you to stay?

140
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,240
I don't know, Your Majesty.

141
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,160
Let me ask you.

142
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,880
When Kumor forced you

143
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,920
to choose between
the Phoenix Seal and the Empress,

144
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,360
why did you take the Phoenix Seal
and leave the Empress behind?

145
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
It was a lapse in judgment.

146
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,120
Please punish me.

147
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,200
We grew up together.

148
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,480
Don't lie to me.

149
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,480
Do you really want the truth?

150
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,840
Of course.

151
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,960
Because I think

152
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,080
the Empress

153
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,640
is a threat to you.

154
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
- Du Tingxin!
- You're the Emperor.

155
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,520
The entire Great Qi rests on you.

156
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
But Ling Cangcang

157
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,600
has dragged you into danger
again and again.

158
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,240
I'd rather

159
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,600
she never return to your side.

160
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,600
Do you hear yourself?

161
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,960
Everything I've done is for Great Qi

162
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,119
and for Your Majesty.

163
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,440
I

164
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
- have no regrets.
- Du Tingxin!

165
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,119
Your Majesty.

166
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,560
Your Majesty.

167
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,599
Preceptor Du,

168
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,599
you've completed the peace negotiation.

169
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,720
Leave the Phoenix Seal here
and return to the Capital at once.

170
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm worried about your health.

171
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
I can't return to the Capital.

172
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,160
The Empress is with me.

173
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,760
That's enough.

174
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,040
Your pulse is weak.

175
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,320
You'll fall into longer sleeps

176
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,680
from now on.

177
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,840
Please consider your health

178
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,240
and allow me to stay by your side.

179
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
There are others in this world

180
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
who can treat me,

181
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,440
not just you.

182
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,360
But my empress

183
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,040
can only be Ling Cangcang.

184
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,800
Your Majesty,

185
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
you'd even throw your life away

186
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,440
for Ling Cangcang?

187
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,880
Is it worth it?

188
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,400
Preceptor Du, this is not your concern.

189
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,440
You may leave.

190
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,800
Your Majesty.

191
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,920
The grievances between
you and Her Majesty have lasted for years.

192
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,880
Even if you've reconciled,

193
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,760
how long can it really last?

194
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,880
Do you truly believe

195
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,200
that Ling Cangcang

196
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
will stay by your side

197
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,680
without resentment at all?

198
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,200
Xiao Huan, look.

199
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,680
Look what I brought you.

200
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,640
You're sleeping?

201
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,280
I'm just a little tired.

202
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
You're tired now?

203
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,000
It's late. Aren't you tired?

204
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,640
I'm not.

205
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,640
Look.

206
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,560
The weather in Jiangzhou is so cold
that we can make ice lanterns now.

207
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,880
I got a crystal lantern for you.

208
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,840
Is it beautiful?

209
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
It is.

210
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm thinking, once you get better,

211
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,360
I'll take you to see ice lanterns.
How does that sound?

212
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,800
Great.

213
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,880
What's wrong?

214
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,600
Nothing.

215
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,760
I was just thinking,

216
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,680
life here is harsher than in the palace.

217
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,080
Maybe
we should return to the Capital soon.

218
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,080
We?

219
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,760
You mean you and I return together?

220
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,360
Physician Li said

221
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,120
a good mood helps my condition.

222
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,240
What will make you happy?

223
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,320
I'll tell you tomorrow.

224
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,840
For now…

225
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,800
For now,

226
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,800
let's have a good rest.

227
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,360
<i>Your pulse is weak.</i>

228
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,840
<i>You'll fall into longer sleeps</i>

229
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,200
<i>from now on.</i>

230
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,120
Your Highness, we've reached Mount Xiandu.

231
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,520
Your Highness,

232
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,760
Physician Li is at the post station ahead.
Shall I go with you?

233
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,760
No need.

234
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,440
The incident in Xuzhou

235
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,720
must be related to Ling Xuefeng.

236
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,600
These guards may not all be trustworthy.

237
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,920
Watch them closely.
No one is allowed to leave.

238
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,480
Anyone who disobeys

239
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,400
- will be punished under military law.
- Yes, Your Highness.

240
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,280
Your Majesty, I'm leaving.

241
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,680
Won't you see me off?

242
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,560
From now on,

243
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,480
you'll be the lord governing
your own land.

244
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,720
Stop acting recklessly.

245
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Before I leave,

246
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,080
I beg you

247
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,200
to give me the map of Great Qi

248
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,400
painted by Father.

249
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,720
That's something he left behind.

250
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,920
I want to keep it as a remembrance.

251
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,360
That map

252
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,960
records the lands, mountains, and rivers

253
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,600
of Great Qi.

254
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,920
Are you asking for it

255
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,520
to tell me

256
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,520
you still haven't given up the throne?

257
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,960
Bear this in mind.

258
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,240
As long as I'm alive,

259
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,960
that map will never go to you.

260
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,560
You may open this pouch

261
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,480
when the time is right.

262
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,160
All right. Stop trying.

263
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,680
It's a dead knot.

264
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,520
How dare you kidnap me?
Why are you tying me up?

265
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,000
Don't think you can act outrageously

266
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,640
just because His Majesty named you Regent.

267
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,040
Li, be honest with me.

268
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,480
Can His Majesty

269
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,040
be cured?

270
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
If he didn't know his days were numbered,

271
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,480
why would he give me the map?

272
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,160
The Frost Reed

273
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,720
that could save his life has been used,

274
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,520
but I have found a way
to replace it with Frost Blossom.

275
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,240
With Frost Blossom, I can keep His Majesty
safe for at least ten more years.

276
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,440
Really?

277
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,320
<i>If I find the Frost Blossom,</i>

278
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,440
<i>Huan,</i>

279
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,920
<i>your life will be in my hands.</i>

280
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,000
<i>Frost Reed and Frost Blossom</i>
<i>come from the same origin,</i>

281
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,240
<i>but they grow in different places,</i>

282
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,720
<i>so their medicinal natures differ.</i>

283
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
<i>Still, I've found a way</i>

284
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,160
<i>to cure the cold poison</i>
<i>with Frost Blossom.</i>

285
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,080
It favors shade and cold,

286
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,760
and mostly grows on cliffs.

287
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,080
It withers within half a day.

288
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,760
Bee-eaters nest in cliffside rocks.

289
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,200
The males often carry
Frost Blossom while courting,

290
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,200
<i>dropping seeds</i>
<i>in their nests on the cliffs.</i>

291
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,800
<i>Someone once saw bee-eaters on</i>
<i>the cliffs of Mount Xiandu.</i>

292
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,880
<i>Follow the birds,</i>

293
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,200
<i>and you may find Frost Blossom.</i>

294
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,480
Was Physician Li trying to fool me?

295
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,760
Who's that?

296
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,400
Well, well, Xiao Huan.

297
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,560
Your life is in my hands now.

298
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,920
Xiao Huan.

299
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,040
If I die here,

300
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll haunt you even as a ghost.

301
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,680
Why is it you?

302
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,400
Didn't I set you free?

303
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,280
Why did you come back?

304
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,520
You spared me once,

305
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,080
and I'm saving you now.

306
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
We're even.

307
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,280
I told you to leave, and you didn't.

308
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,960
I've changed my mind now.

309
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,080
I'm not letting you go.

310
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
What do you mean?

311
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,560
What do I mean?

312
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,760
I can't just leave you on this mountain

313
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,960
as wolves' food.

314
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,080
Why did you save me?

315
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,400
I didn't mean to save you.

316
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,320
I just happened to run into you.

317
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
Why are you still denying it now?

318
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,280
Eat this.

319
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,160
This is the Blood-Replenishing Pill.

320
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,320
It'll help your wounds.

321
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,520
Where are you heading to?
I'll give you a ride.

322
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,520
Could it be you can't bear to leave me,

323
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,560
and plan to cling to me for life?

324
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,120
Wait.

325
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,520
What… What's wrong?

326
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,400
Why are you crying? No.

327
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,320
I… I didn't mean that.
I'm not saying you can't follow me.

328
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,760
I know you're injured,

329
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
so I was worried…

330
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,040
No. That's not what I meant.

331
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,720
Master Zhong.

332
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,040
Miss Zhong. Vice Sect Leader Zhong.

333
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,440
It's my fault.

334
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,200
I shouldn't have stabbed you.
I shouldn't have driven you away.

335
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,520
It's all my fault. How about this?

336
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,000
Here.

337
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,360
You stab me too. Just not the face.

338
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,680
Don't ruin my beautiful face.

339
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,360
I don't want to!

340
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
Uh. How about this?

341
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,320
Hit me.

342
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,960
Hit my face.

343
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,960
Come on. Hit me.

344
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,080
You see,

345
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,720
no one has ever hit my face.

346
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,240
You'll be the first and only. Hit me.

347
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,720
Come on. Hit me.

348
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,200
Go on. Hit me. Hit me.

349
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm crying

350
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
because the world is so big,

351
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,880
but I have nowhere to go.

352
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,440
Didn't you always talk about
wanting to see Ling Cangcang?

353
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,680
How would I face Cangcang?

354
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,400
How would I explain to her?

355
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,440
If you have something you can't tell her,

356
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,080
you can tell me.

357
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,720
Who are you really?

358
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,800
I don't want to die
without knowing the truth.

359
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,400
I was rescued by Master Li Lu

360
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,000
from the Saintess of Lingbi Sect.

361
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,120
After I left with him,

362
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,400
he only gave me one task.

363
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,200
No matter what happens,

364
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,040
protect Cangcang.

365
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
Even if it costs your life.

366
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,360
- Master!
- Cangcang.

367
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,480
Zhong Lin was an orphan
I picked up somewhere.

368
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,440
I kept her with us.

369
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,720
From now on, she'll stay by your side,

370
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,320
- all right?
- All right.

371
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,600
Don't be afraid.
I'll protect you from now on.

372
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,320
<i>I never harmed Cangcang,</i>

373
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
nor did I disobey my master.

374
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,920
Before Master Li Lu died,

375
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,199
he told me that from then on,

376
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
I only had to obey Cangcang.

377
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,159
I'm afraid…

378
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,480
You failed me.

379
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,520
What does this have to do
with Ling Cangcang?

380
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,400
I didn't even blame you.

381
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,880
Xiao Qianqing,

382
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,360
I'm sorry.

383
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,520
I killed you because it was
the order of Lingbi Sect's guardian.

384
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,080
He came after you.

385
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,440
If he still fails to kill you,
he won't stop.

386
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,760
Lingbi Sect may be divided,

387
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,560
but when it comes to killing,
they never leave a loose end.

388
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,199
So,

389
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,719
could you maybe shelter me for a while?

390
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,280
I can protect you, after all.

391
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
Forget it. You protect me?

392
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,480
I think it's the other way around.

393
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,080
Right. You protect me.

394
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Stop pulling the long face. It's ugly.

395
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,600
Come on. Smile for me.

396
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,680
Get off. I'm being serious.

397
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm going to Jiangzhou to find Xiao Huan.

398
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,560
I'll take you to Ling Cangcang.

399
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,520
If anything happens,

400
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,280
I'll take the blame for you.

401
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,440
NANRONG PALACE

402
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,440
<i>Preceptor Du,</i>

403
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>you've completed the peace negotiation.</i>

404
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,000
<i>Leave the Phoenix Seal here</i>
<i>and return to the Capital at once.</i>

405
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,680
The Empress is with me.

406
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,480
That's enough.

407
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
There are others in this world

408
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,600
who can treat me,

409
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,720
not just you.

410
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,200
<i>But my empress</i>

411
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,240
<i>can only be Ling Cangcang.</i>

412
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,360
Madam, General Lu requests an audience.

413
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,120
Bring him in.

414
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,720
Yes, Madam.

415
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,520
Preceptor Du.

416
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,240
General Lu,

417
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
have a seat.

418
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,400
What brings you here?

419
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,240
Preceptor Du,

420
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,600
after I return to the Capital,

421
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,440
I must report to Commander Li

422
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,440
on my mission to Jiangzhou.

423
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,680
I came to ask for your guidance.

424
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,880
You should speak honestly in the report.

425
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
There's no need to come here
to ask about it.

426
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,360
Along the journey,

427
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,200
I had the honor

428
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,880
to accompany you.

429
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,480
I will remember what I saw and heard
for the rest of my life.

430
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,560
I know

431
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
you bear heavy duties

432
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,800
and great burdens.

433
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,040
It will be my honor to serve you
in any small way.

434
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,000
General Lu.

435
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
Yes, Madam.

436
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,840
Do you mean the meaning of "Nanrong"?

437
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
I do not, Madam.

438
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,840
"Loyal to the Divine.

439
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,480
If tainted by mortal desire,

440
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,280
Heaven and Earth will not tolerate it."

441
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,880
I understand now.

442
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,960
Then I won't disturb
your peace any further, Madam.

443
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,760
I'll take my leave.

444
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,280
Hold on.

445
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,320
I see by your complexion

446
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,120
that you're sleeping lightly
and dreaming much.

447
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,040
I'll have a palace maid

448
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,560
fetch some incense
and tonic pills for you.

449
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,120
You may come here

450
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,360
to collect them every month.

451
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,840
Thank you, Madam.

452
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,480
Madam,

453
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,320
restrain yourself.
Don't indulge wild thoughts.

454
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,280
KUMOR ARMY HAS WITHDRAWN.
JIANGZHOU WON.

455
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,640
I SPECIALLY SENT YOU THIS NOTE,
FATHER. CANGCANG IS SAFE AND WELL.

456
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,920
SHE'LL SOON RETURN WITH THE EMPEROR.
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, FATHER

457
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,240
FROM JUEDING

458
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,840
- Butler.
- Yes, My Lord.

459
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,480
Give Chongming Temple
one thousand liang for merit lamps.

460
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,200
Also,
give one liang of silver to every servant.

461
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,960
If they wish to go home,
grant them permission.

462
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,480
My Lord,

463
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,800
what has you in such high spirits?

464
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,160
Jiangzhou won the battle.

465
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,360
Jueding and Cangcang are safe.
Shouldn't we celebrate?

466
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,760
- Yes.
- Also,

467
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,000
contact the people of Jiangzhou.

468
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,720
Watch the two siblings closely

469
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,480
and report all of their movements
and every word

470
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,920
- they speak to the Emperor.
- Yes, My Lord.

471
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,880
You may leave.

472
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,160
Very well. Excellent.

473
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,560
BRUSH AND INK

474
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,600
My Lord,

475
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
I've failed your trust.

476
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,120
I couldn't kill
the Prince of Yuzhang in Xuzhou.

477
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,960
Please punish me,

478
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,320
My Lord.

479
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,400
Xiao Qianqing is a hard nut.

480
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,360
There aren't many opportunities
to kill him.

481
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,360
There's somewhere I need to be.
You don't have to follow me.

482
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,760
Stay here and think carefully

483
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,120
about how you fall short

484
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,000
of Xianxue.
