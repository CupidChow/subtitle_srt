EPISODE 17

4
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,560
General, we have been
stationed here for far too long,

5
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
only guarding and never striking back.

6
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,680
I fear the men may soon lose their spirit.

7
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
It should be soon.

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
Report!

9
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,480
General, I sent our men to
search the entire hunting ground,

10
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,880
and we found nothing unusual.

11
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,400
General, you still
suspect that Bai Chifan?

12
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
In my view,

13
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,160
he has eyes only for Miss Lin,

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,320
and aside from that,

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,520
he seems to have no other purpose.

16
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
But I have always felt

17
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,720
that this man is not so simple.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,880
Mr. Bai.

19
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
Your Highness.

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Bai, you look quite worn and weary.

21
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Is it…

22
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,520
because a certain lady
keeps you tossing till dawn,

23
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,840
unable to sleep?

24
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Your Highness,
please do not make sport of me.

25
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,680
Did you not say last time

26
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,240
that as long as I won the contest,

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,520
you would help
bring Cangcang and me together?

28
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,680
You are too impatient,

29
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,240
and I have yet to think of a way.

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,080
Miss Lin has a stubborn temper,

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,400
and she is not easily coaxed.

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,080
Even acting as
your matchmaker is no easy task.

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,480
Your Highness is clever and quick-witted.

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,680
If even Your Highness is at a loss,

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,800
then I truly do not
know what else I can do.

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
As for a solution,

37
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,800
it is not that there is none.

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,080
There is no lady who does not like

39
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,960
a handsome and dashing young man.

40
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,800
If I dress you up a little,

41
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,200
and have you stand before Miss Lin,
she is sure to take a liking to you.

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,520
I already used this little trick

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,520
when I first met Cangcang.

44
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
Then just cling to her and never give up,

45
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,400
for even the finest lady
cannot resist a persistent suitor.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Am I not pestering her every day already?

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Then,

48
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
what do you say I should do?

49
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,560
I have heard

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,800
that there is a frozen
lake outside the camp,

51
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,400
and perhaps Cangcang will like that place.

52
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,400
The ice is slick,

53
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
and you and Cangcang will no doubt

54
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,840
have to lean on each other for support.
I understand.

55
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,600
If you happen upon a thin patch of ice,

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,840
and Cangcang happens to slip,

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,320
Mr. Bai, you can leap in to
save her, sharing danger and fate,

58
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,440
and once she is moved,
her heart will surely soften.

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,640
That is indeed a fine idea.

60
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,280
But will it not put Cangcang in danger?

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
Of course it will not. Come.

62
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
<i>- Once we leave the camp,</i>
- Go.

63
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>I can find a way to send Cangcang away.</i>

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,160
It is snowing.

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,480
- Wonderful, it is snowing!
- It is snowing!

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,920
It is snowing.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It is snowing.

68
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,280
It is snowing!

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Good!

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,280
It is snowing!

71
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,040
The snow has finally begun to fall.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,760
Good!

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,960
It is snowing!

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,840
It is snowing!

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Good.

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,560
It is truly heavy.

77
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,960
Such heavy snow!

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,600
Indeed.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,520
It is snowing!

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,480
- It is snowing.
- Wonderful.

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
It is snowing!

82
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,800
This snow is truly heavy!

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,480
Good!

84
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
<i>Xijiang is bitterly cold,</i>

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,840
<i>and snowfall in winter is nothing unusual.</i>

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,400
<i>Why are the soldiers so excited?</i>

87
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,360
Wonderful.

88
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,440
Wonderful!

89
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,040
Look.

90
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,560
Good!

91
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
- Good!
- Wonderful!

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
Kumor,
the snowflakes are thick as feathers.

93
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,480
We have finally been waiting for this.

94
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,920
<i>Could it be that Kumor has been</i>
<i>waiting for heavy snowfall all along,</i>

95
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,520
<i>that he was not remaining still,</i>

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,640
<i>but waiting for the rivers to freeze?</i>

97
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
<i>Once the waters turn to ice,</i>

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,560
<i>he will march across</i>
<i>the river and attack the city.</i>

99
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
General.

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
Deputy General Zhang,

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,160
keep a close watch
on Mr. Bai and Miss Lin.

102
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,760
From this moment on,

103
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,800
they are forbidden from
moving freely in the camp.

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,160
Yes.

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
Kumor, you again?

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,200
They are my guests,

107
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,320
not your prisoners.

108
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,000
Minjia.

109
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
The battle is upon us,

110
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,320
and for safety's sake I must do this.

111
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
As a princess,

112
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,840
you should understand the reason.

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,840
Your Highness.

114
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,320
Didn't you say
you were going to the frozen lake

115
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,920
to play the hero and save my lady?

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
Why now…?

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,040
It is snowing heavily today,
so we cannot go.

118
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,240
Even Your Highness cannot help me now,

119
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,840
so it must be fate,
and nothing can be done.

120
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Who says I cannot help you?

121
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
There are plenty of ways.

122
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
Just not today.

123
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,080
Deputy General Zhang,

124
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
when the time comes, lead two squads,

125
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,800
and ambush at this location.

126
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,480
As for the exact timing of the assault,

127
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,920
wait for my command.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Kumor.

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Minjia,

130
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,000
you came just in time.

131
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,760
We are discussing
the details of the attack.

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Come listen.

133
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
After winter arrives,

134
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
the moat around Jiangzhou freezes,

135
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,200
and we will launch
a surprise attack on the East Gate.

136
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
Was that not already decided?

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
Kumor, you may settle the details.

138
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
I have other matters to attend to.

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,240
What is it you need?

140
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
I am here to fetch a jar of good wine
for Miss Lin and Mr. Bai.

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,520
If you wish to drink,

142
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,080
there is wine in every other tent.

143
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,600
Why must you come
to my command tent for it?

144
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
I lost at chess, that is all.

145
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,320
Chess?

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,240
What kind of chess were you playing?

147
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
Were we not talking about fetching wine?

148
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,400
Why ask about chess?

149
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,159
It was Tiger-Taming Chess.

150
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,679
Kumor,
he won against me in his very first game.

151
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Tiger-Taming Chess tests one's
strategy and command of warfare.

152
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,480
How could
a wandering swordsman defeat you?

153
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,720
And I even used the moves you taught me.

154
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,560
Perhaps if you played,
you might not beat him either.

155
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,880
Minjia,

156
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,200
if you are all going to drink,

157
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
how could you do so without me?

158
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,720
Then Kumor, I will fetch it now.

159
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,520
Wait.

160
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,600
- Deputy General Zhang.
- Yes.

161
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,960
Bring me my Parting Wine.

162
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
Yes, General.

163
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
- Go make the preparations.
- Very well.

164
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,560
Drinking in wind and snow.

165
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,480
Mr. Bai,
I hope you will not mind my sudden visit.

166
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,280
This wine today was meant

167
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,760
as a kind gesture from Her Highness,

168
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,920
but I did not expect
it would alarm the General.

169
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,680
I am merely here to join in the merriment.

170
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
Before we drink today,

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,680
allow me first

172
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,960
to tell you a legend of Xijiang.

173
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,280
Legend holds that in our Xijiang,

174
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,640
there once lived
a beautiful young maiden who,

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,520
against all fate,
gave her heart to a prince

176
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
with whom her family shared a mortal feud.

177
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,000
In that very moment,
war broke out between their families.

178
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,400
The prince himself slew the maiden's kin.

179
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Heartbroken beyond measure,

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
the maiden took
the prince's life in return.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Later,

182
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
she found that after death,
the prince became a spring of clear water.

183
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,280
She used that spring to brew a wine.

184
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,560
And once one drinks it,

185
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,880
all memories of past love fade away.

186
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,520
Miss Lin,

187
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,240
what do you think of this
legend of the Parting Wine?

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,480
It is quite moving.

189
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
I did not expect
the General to be a storyteller.

190
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000
Miss Lin,

191
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,280
this is the Parting Wine of legend.

192
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,520
If you no longer wish
to have any ties to Mr. Bai,

193
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,520
you may feed this wine to him yourself.

194
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,160
Cangcang, are you hesitating?

195
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you afraid
that if you drink this wine,

196
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680
you will truly forget him,

197
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,400
because you still cannot forget him?

198
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,160
If a single cup of this wine
could sever all love,

199
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,000
there would be no
sorrowful lovers in this world.

200
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,680
Miss Lin,

201
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,120
from what you say,

202
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,680
does it mean you do not wish to forget?

203
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,120
Since the General is so kind,

204
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
Bai Chifan,

205
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,680
then drink this cup,

206
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,120
and let us part in peace,

207
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,240
leaving the past behind.

208
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
Everything you say is true?

209
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
You truly wish for
me to forget everything?

210
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,320
- Yes.
- But I do not wish to forget.

211
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,880
Since Mr. Bai refuses to drink,
Miss Lin may drink instead.

212
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
After all, this Parting Wine

213
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
needs only one of you to drink it
for love to be severed.

214
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,800
<i>Life and death parted…</i>

215
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,440
<i>Could this be poisoned wine?</i>

216
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,880
- Very well. Then I shall drink it.
- Wait.

217
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,960
If anyone should
drink it, it ought to be me.

218
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
Did you not already cut all ties with me?

219
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,320
Why bother with this Parting Wine then?

220
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,360
Let me drink it instead.

221
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,120
Once I drink it,
I will never cling to you again.

222
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,760
You want to wipe away all
that you owe me with one cup?

223
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
Would that not be far too easy for you?

224
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,000
What is it?

225
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,080
Could it be you still
have feelings for me?

226
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
I simply believe
that making you remember everything

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,080
is the greatest punishment for you.

228
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
- Bai Chifan!
- Good wine.

229
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,400
You were all fooled by my brother.

230
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,320
This Parting Wine is only a legend.

231
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,960
Cangcang, do not worry.

232
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,040
Mr. Bai could never forget you.

233
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,600
The moment I tested him,

234
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,040
I knew you had not let him go.

235
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,960
Today my brother and I are witnesses.

236
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,560
Neither of you is allowed to deny it.

237
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Bai.

238
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,800
Bai.

239
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,680
Bai.

240
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,400
Kumor, what is happening?

241
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,600
True parting

242
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,920
can only be found in life and death.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,360
This cup of Parting Wine
he drank of his own will.

244
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
How is he?

245
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,640
This young man's pulse is very strange.

246
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,720
There is an overwhelming cold in him,

247
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,160
and it seems restrained by medicine.

248
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,960
Enough talk. Treat him quickly!

249
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,600
I only travel with the army,
and I specialize in external wounds.

250
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,920
A condition like this…

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
I am not confident.

252
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
Whether you are
confident or not, you must treat him.

253
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
If you fail, you will answer to me!

254
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,560
Yes. I will return

255
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,600
and prepare warming
medicines to dispel the cold.

256
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
Cangcang, watch over him first.

257
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
So cold…

258
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,640
So the Empress

259
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,320
is not as heartless as you claim to be.

260
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
You are at death's door,
yet you still say such things.

261
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
I am at death's door,

262
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,720
and you still shake me off.

263
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,200
You knew that wine was poisoned.

264
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Why test it with your own life?

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,240
If not me, should I have let you drink it?

266
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,680
Letting the Empress drink poison?

267
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
Would that not make
me unworthy as a husband?

268
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,560
Besides,

269
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,680
only because I drank the poison

270
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,120
did I see your true feelings for me.

271
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,600
Xiao Huan,

272
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,280
it was you who gave
me hope again and again,

273
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
only to use me again and again,

274
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
and hurt me.

275
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,120
I have finally decided to leave you,
yet here you are again.

276
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
What do you want?

277
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,320
What must I do for you to be satisfied?

278
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
Have you forgotten?

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,360
There is cold poison in me.

280
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,960
Normal poison has no effect on me at all.

281
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,520
I was only pretending for their sake.

282
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,880
Is that true?

283
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,800
Of course it is.

284
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,760
Liar.

285
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,880
Cangcang, wait.

286
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,079
Come sit here first.

287
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,079
There is something I need to tell you.

288
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,240
- Give me the antidote.
- There is no antidote.

289
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,520
Kumor, why would you do this?

290
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,319
Minjia,

291
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,080
did you not notice
anything wrong with him?

292
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,280
He is just a wanderer.

293
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,640
How could he beat
you in Tiger-Taming Chess?

294
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,760
He clearly knows military strategy.

295
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,080
And as soon as the snow fell,

296
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,280
he immediately watched
how you and I reacted.

297
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,000
His eyes are sharp, deep and unreadable.

298
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,320
He is no ordinary wanderer!

299
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,960
You are simply too suspicious!

300
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,840
The battle is right before us!

301
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,720
As commander,
I must eliminate every threat.

302
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
There is definitely
something wrong with Bai Chifan.

303
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,440
I absolutely cannot keep him alive.

304
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,960
He saved my life.

305
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
I will not let you kill him.

306
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
He is barely hanging on anyway.

307
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
He will not last long even without me.

308
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,400
You…

309
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,760
General Ling has obtained the map.

310
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,400
He will make his move soon.

311
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,720
You must see
General Ling as soon as possible.

312
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,280
Tell him,

313
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,560
Kumor is waiting for
the frozen season to arrive.

314
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,120
If I go, what about you?

315
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,520
I will create a chance for you to escape.

316
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,040
I asked how you will escape.

317
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,480
Why are you laughing?

318
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,040
Nothing.

319
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,360
Do not flatter yourself.

320
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,000
You are the ruler of a nation.

321
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,560
If you die inexplicably here,

322
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,480
our entire family will be condemned.

323
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
It is just that I often think of

324
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,360
our days wandering the martial world.

325
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Tell me,

326
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,920
if we truly were a pair of wanderers,

327
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,600
would it have ended differently?

328
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,000
There are no what ifs.

329
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,680
Mr. Bai.

330
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,720
Mr. Bai. How are you feeling?

331
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
Thank you for arranging
everything, Your Highness.

332
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
Cangcang no longer bears hatred for me.

333
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,040
I have no regrets even in death.

334
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,560
It is my fault.

335
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,160
I am the one who harmed you.

336
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,760
This has nothing to do
with you, Your Highness.

337
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
Do not blame yourself.

338
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,960
I am fine now.

339
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,720
That cup held an extreme cold poison.

340
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,080
Its venom is ruthless. Mr. Bai, you…

341
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,520
Mr. Bai…

342
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Bai…

343
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,960
Bai…

344
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,920
It is my fault.

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
All my fault.

346
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,400
I will find the antidote.

347
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,040
It is useless.

348
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
This cold sickness
has plagued me for years.

349
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,680
Now that it has been triggered,

350
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
it may never heal again.

351
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,160
Perhaps this is simply my fate.

352
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,480
I will die here.

353
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
What nonsense is that?

354
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,280
I will not let you die.

355
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
What did you just say?

356
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,240
I said I will never let you die here.

357
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
Mr. Bai, did you hear that?

358
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,680
This is Cangcang's true heart.

359
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,640
For her sake, you must not die.

360
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,480
It is too late.

361
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,160
What could Cangcang possibly do?

362
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,080
In Jiangzhou City,

363
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,480
there might be a divine
physician who can save me.

364
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,880
But Cangcang cannot leave the camp.

365
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,080
And even if she could,

366
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,200
I would not last long
enough for her return.

367
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,040
Jiangzhou City…

368
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,800
To leave the camp,
I need my brother's token.

369
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,400
But with the heavy snow,

370
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,640
he will never allow
any of you to leave now.

371
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,920
Your Highness do not trouble yourself.

372
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,720
Perhaps this is indeed my fate.

373
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,720
This happened because of me.

374
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,840
I cannot just stand by.

375
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,560
Nor can I ignore your life.

376
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,920
Cangcang,
I will steal my brother's token right now

377
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,040
so you can leave and find the physician.

378
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

379
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,240
I know what you are thinking.

380
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
I do need you to save my life.

381
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,640
Before I came to Jiangzhou,

382
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,960
I sent Imperial Physician Li ahead.

383
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,360
Imperial Physician Li…

384
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,800
You only need to tell him my symptoms,

385
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,040
and he will be able
to prescribe the remedy.

386
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,840
Very well.

387
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,080
Imperial Preceptor Du
must also have your tonic pills.

388
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,040
I will bring those back too.

389
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,760
I never expected
that she would not save you.

390
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,400
She was not like this before.

391
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,120
None of that matters.

392
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,840
What matters now is saving your life.

393
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,760
This is my handwritten decree.

394
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,880
Give it to General Ling.

395
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,680
Xiao Huan.

396
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,520
I want you to wait for me,

397
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,840
and to wait for me in safety.

398
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,600
If anything happens to you,

399
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,320
I will never forgive you.

400
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,280
Do you understand?

401
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
I understand.

402
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
I will go.

403
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,000
Cangcang,

404
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,440
be careful.

405
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
Cangcang. You're wearing my armor,

406
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,680
riding my warhorse.

407
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
And once you put on this veil

408
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,080
that I always wear in winter,

409
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,280
they won't recognize you.

410
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,880
This is my brother's token.

411
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,840
Thank you.

412
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,480
You're not planning
to never return, right?

413
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,440
Don't worry.

414
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,440
Since Bai Chifan is here,

415
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,360
as long as I live, I'll return.

416
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,800
I am Princess Minjia.

417
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,680
By order of the Prince, I am going to
the pass to deliver a letter of challenge.

418
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
Make way!

419
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,440
Who dares leave the camp?

420
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
- Prepare the horses!
- Yes!

421
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,840
Quick! Lower the bridge, open the gate!

422
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,120
Loose!

423
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,080
Retreat!

424
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,960
Cangcang.

425
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,360
Why did you come back?

426
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
No time to explain.
Hurry. Take me to Imperial Physician Li.

427
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,800
Imperial Physician Li?
He is not in Jiangzhou City.

428
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,720
Not in Jiangzhou City?

429
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,520
Cangcang, what is going on?

430
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,760
Preceptor Du… Where is the Preceptor Du?

431
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
- I must see her.
- Come.

432
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
Preceptor Du.

433
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,640
Your Majesty's safe return

434
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,600
is truly Heaven's blessing for Great Qi.

435
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,600
No need for courtesy.

436
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,280
Where is Imperial Physician Li?
Where is his medicine?

437
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,320
Yes.

438
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,960
What did Your Majesty say?

439
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,200
He's trapped in Kumor's camp.

440
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,720
His old illness flared up,
and his life is in danger.

441
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,720
I came back for medicine.

442
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,760
What did Your Majesty say?

443
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,680
You don't know?

444
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,160
Imperial Physician Li
truly isn't in the city.

445
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,640
Could it be…

446
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,840
The letter he gave you. See what it says.

447
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,200
KUMOR'S TROOPS AWAIT
THE FREEZING OF THE MOAT

448
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,160
AND MAY AT ANY MOMENT FORCE THEIR WAY
ACROSS TO STRIKE AT THE EAST GATE.

449
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,920
DO NOT ACT RASHLY.
MOVE ONLY UPON COMMAND.

450
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,800
His Majesty instructs,
according to his judgment,

451
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
the Kumor troops are
waiting for the moat to freeze,

452
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
so they may cross at any
time and attack the East Gate.

453
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,800
But His Majesty decrees

454
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,040
that we must not take action on our own.
We are to wait for orders.

455
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,600
Wait for orders?

456
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,280
- Nothing else was said?
- Nothing.

457
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,520
This is bad. I'm going to save him.

458
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,280
His Majesty commands
that the Empress must remain in the city.

459
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,920
I cannot disobey the decree.

460
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,040
Kumor!

461
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,080
Kumor.

462
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,320
Mr. Bai can't hold on anymore.

463
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,280
I was the one who let Cangcang go.

464
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,040
If anyone must be punished, punish me.
Kumor.

465
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,600
Kumor!

466
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,960
General Kumor.
Please step outside the tent.

467
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,920
I can tell you myself

468
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
who I truly am.

469
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,760
The poison that struck
you that day has no cure at all.

470
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,960
It was His Majesty

471
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,320
<i>who gave you the Frost Reed.</i>

472
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,520
<i>He gave you the only Frost Reed</i>
<i>that could save his life!</i>

473
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,280
There is no lifesaving medicine left.

474
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,680
For Your Majesty,

475
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,160
<i>His Majesty risked everything alone,</i>

476
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
<i>sneaking into the Kumor's camp.</i>

477
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,720
<i>All his life,</i>
<i>His Majesty has been cautious,</i>

478
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,760
<i>disciplined and restrained,</i>

479
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,560
<i>but for you,</i>

480
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,080
<i>he has sacrificed himself again and again.</i>

481
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
Have you never thought

482
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,760
that the tenderness he showed you

483
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,680
could not have all been false?

484
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
Do you know His Majesty
has long been nearing his end?

485
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,920
And the one who brought him to this state

486
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,880
is you.

487
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,720
May I ask Your Majesty,

488
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,920
can you bear the weight
of His Majesty's devotion?

489
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,040
Jueding.

490
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,600
Is the Xiaoxing Guards
now inside the city?

491
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,520
Yes.

492
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Assign your elite
troops and archers to me.

493
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,000
His Majesty commands it,
you are not to leave Jiangzhou City.

494
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,360
Then this will not
count as defying the decree.

495
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,480
General. Do you dare face me in battle?

496
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,160
So you finally drop the act.

497
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Is it because Miss Lin is now safe?

498
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,160
I heard you personally gave chase,

499
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,000
and watched with your own eyes
as Cangcang entered Jiangzhou City.

500
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,120
Good.

501
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,240
You truly are devoted.

502
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,560
Very well.

503
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,760
Today, let me see what your blade can do!

504
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,560
Kumor!

505
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,560
Your blade technique is
not much weaker than mine.

506
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,720
You are simply
disadvantaged by your weapon.

507
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,360
I, as a general,
hate being threatened the most.

508
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,840
Do you think
this will let you leave here alive?

509
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Since you dislike coercion,

510
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,000
why did you use Cangcang to coerce me?

511
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,240
- What do you mean by that?
- Have you not been asking who I really am?

512
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,160
I can tell you now.

513
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,440
Speak!

514
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,040
Rumor spreads throughout your camp

515
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,320
that Xiao Huan, Emperor of Great Qi,

516
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,560
cannot even lift his shoulders,

517
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,000
cannot even carry anything by hand,

518
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,760
and does not dare step outside the palace.

519
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,800
Is that what you believe as well?

520
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,280
You are Xiao Huan, Emperor of Great Qi?

521
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,680
I am.

522
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
Then what about Lin Cangcang?

523
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,160
Is she truly the Empress of Great Qi?

524
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,680
Her surname is Ling,
the Ling of lofty aspirations.

525
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,840
Ling Cangcang is my empress.

526
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
I never imagined

527
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,120
that the ruler above all others

528
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,880
would risk death in an enemy camp,

529
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,840
all for a single woman.

530
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,240
How is it risking death?

531
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,880
Do you truly think that you alone
can kill your way out?

532
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,440
You underestimate my
Black Tiger Army far too much.

533
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,199
I never intended
to rely on my own strength to escape.

534
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,000
My plan was to send out

535
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,040
the Military Deployment Map first,

536
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,159
then send the Empress away,

537
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,400
and finally,

538
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,360
let the Western Garrison
launch a surprise attack on your camp.

539
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,760
But the map is still with me.

540
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,560
The map was redrawn by
the Empress and me after we read it.

541
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,080
Of course your copy remains with you.

542
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,199
So your hunting match with Minjia

543
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,679
was to send out the map.

544
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,440
Naturally.

545
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,760
You people of
the Central Plains truly are cunning.

546
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,679
But it is a pity.

547
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,920
You are about to die here.

548
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,960
Is that so?

549
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,360
Go.

550
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,080
You truly are not afraid of death.

551
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,320
The one not afraid of death is you.

552
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
This is my personal Xiaoxing Guards.

553
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,800
Each one possesses exceptional skill.

554
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
Taking the General's head

555
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,560
would be no challenge at all.

556
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,160
Tonight we infiltrate the enemy camp.

557
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,520
Tomorrow we will seize
the chance to rescue His Majesty.

558
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,520
Yes.

559
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,040
My Black Tiger Army stands
here with one hundred thousand troops.

560
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,440
With just these few of you,

561
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,040
you think you can take my head?

562
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,560
You are far too arrogant.

563
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
And what of your hundred thousand troops?

564
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,120
Great Qi commands a million soldiers.

565
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
At a single order,

566
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,200
this place will fall.

567
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
What will you do then, General?

568
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,440
Do you not care at all
for the lives of your soldiers?

569
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Of course
the General cares for their lives.

570
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,320
Otherwise why would he wait for
snow and ice to launch a surprise attack,

571
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,440
instead of acting recklessly?

572
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,640
Ling Cangcang, you dare to return?

573
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,120
I am the Empress of Great Qi.

574
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,240
Where His Majesty stands, so shall I.

575
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,000
The Emperor is cunning,

576
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,440
and the Empress is sly.

577
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,760
You truly make a fine pair.

578
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,000
Kumor.

579
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,200
If we are speaking of cunning,

580
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,880
that cup of Parting Wine
you poisoned is no less so.

581
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,520
We are the same.

582
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,640
General, why not hear me out first

583
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,000
before making your decision?

584
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,240
Speak.

585
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,880
Once both sides go to war,

586
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,080
Xijiang will be trampled flat.

587
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,800
I have had the fortune of
spending a few days with you,

588
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,600
and found you a disciplined commander

589
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,240
who holds the people in your heart.

590
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,880
Thus,

591
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,120
I can give you a chance,

592
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
and give Xijiang a chance.

593
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,040
General,

594
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
would you negotiate peace with me?

595
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,160
Speak then.
You have stayed here for some time.

596
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,280
What do you see?

597
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,080
I know,

598
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
the General claims one
hundred thousand troops,

599
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,760
but in truth your camp
has fewer than sixty thousand.

600
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,920
Sixty thousand, and so what?

601
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Our sixty thousand
troops are all fierce and brave.

602
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,840
It is not certain
we cannot take your Jiangzhou City.

603
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,720
Jiangzhou City is impregnable.

604
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,680
Its moat is both wide and deep.

605
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,640
I know,

606
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,360
you have held your troops still

607
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,800
waiting for the moat to freeze.

608
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,000
But now,
I have already ordered General Ling

609
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,360
to scatter salt into the moat,
slowing the freezing.

610
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,240
Since that is so,

611
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
I see no need for peace talks.

612
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,480
We will meet on the battlefield.

613
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,160
You misunderstand, General.

614
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,840
What I mean is this.

615
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,880
You have always loved
your soldiers as your own children,

616
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
and you cannot let them die in vain.

617
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,080
Once the bow is
drawn, there is no turning back.

618
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,800
If there is war,

619
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
blood will be shed and lives lost.

620
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,040
But when the time comes,
we sons and daughters of Xijiang

621
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,520
will never fear death in battle.

622
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,320
I know.

623
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,600
Winter came early in Xijiang this year,

624
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,720
bringing a once-in-a-century
snow calamity.

625
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,760
The people suffered from cold and hunger,
wandering without shelter.

626
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,080
The granaries of
the prefecture office ran empty,

627
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,000
and the relief was ineffective.

628
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,640
Even after the disaster passed,
the hardships still remained.

629
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,040
The status verification
system only made it worse.

630
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,000
Thus in this peace negotiation,

631
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,760
I offer three promises.

632
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,320
First.

633
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,360
Great Qi will open our granaries and
provide relief to the people of Xijiang,

634
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,160
easing the suffering
caused by the snow disaster.

635
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,320
Second.
We will seek experts in agriculture,

636
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,000
teach the people to farm,
improve the soil,

637
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,200
and answer the needs of Xijiang.

638
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,360
Third.

639
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,320
I vow

640
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,160
that within three years,

641
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,120
the status verification
system will be abolished,

642
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,640
freeing the people from bondage,

643
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,080
and restoring peace to Xijiang.

644
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,880
Kumor,

645
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,040
when Xijiang's fields grow rich,
its harvests are abundant,

646
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,760
and its people live in peace,
storing grain for winter,

647
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,600
is that not what you wish to see?

648
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,240
But I once led troops to attack your city,

649
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,840
and even harmed you many times.

650
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,720
- You are, after all, an emperor…
- As long as you are willing to turn back,

651
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,520
all that is past,

652
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,080
I shall not pursue.

653
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,080
I, Kumor, do not fear life or death.

654
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,440
I only wish to speak
for the people of Xijiang.

655
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,840
If Your Majesty can truly keep your word,

656
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,240
I am willing to give you my life,

657
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,160
and follow you for all generations!

658
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,240
General, please rise.

659
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
I stand by every word I say.

660
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,280
Set your mind at ease.

661
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,160
This Black Feather Token

662
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,760
belonged to my father the commander.

663
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,160
Today, I offer it to Your Majesty.

664
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,120
I, Kumor, swear before heaven and earth

665
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,560
that once this token is sent forth,
I shall follow unto death.

666
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
TOKEN

667
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,320
General,

668
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,600
you are a hero of this age.
I shall protect it.

669
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,960
As for the soldiers and people of Xijiang,
I shall cherish them.

670
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,560
Kumor, King of Xijiang,

671
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,320
leads the Black Tiger Army

672
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,440
to pledge allegiance to Great Qi!

673
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,480
Long live the Emperor!

674
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,520
Long live the Emperor!
