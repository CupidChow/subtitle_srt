ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
Your Majesty,

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,520
after days of investigation,
this is the only location we found.

4
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,760
Kumor chose to set up camp here.

5
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
With mountains on three sides,
it's easy to defend and hard to attack.

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,920
And their defenses are extremely tight.

7
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,920
The Xiaoxing Guards
haven't found a chance to slip inside.

8
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,960
Any news of the Empress?

9
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,720
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,760
Kumor is still waiting
for the peace delegation,

11
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,040
so he is unlikely to harm her rashly.

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,600
But

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,800
the delegation hasn't arrived
at the appointed time.

14
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,200
What's Ling Jueding doing now?

15
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,360
He's in the military camp
and has made no move.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
At least he still has some sense left.

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
If he acts now,

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,200
Cangcang's identity
will be exposed immediately.

19
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
JIANGZHOU

20
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,560
SEEK A SECLUDED
PLACE. AN HONORED GUEST WILL COME.

21
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,760
Kumor.

22
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,160
Kumor,

23
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,840
what is that darn emperor,
Xiao Huan, trying to pull?

24
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,960
Didn't he say someone
would arrive within five days?

25
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,600
It's already the eighth. Where are they?

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,720
Are they coming or not?

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,600
We have his empress in our hands.

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,040
Why panic?

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
He's the one who should be anxious.

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
But is Lin Cangcang really his empress?

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,440
If she weren't,

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,400
would that darn emperor have sent
a delegation at all?

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,360
But if she is,
why are they dragging their feet?

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,840
Naturally, they want to test our patience.

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
That makes sense.

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,520
But what Lin Cangcang said
didn't sound like lies.

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
Minjia,
there's never too much deception in war.

38
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Have you forgotten
how we lost our provisions?

39
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,640
If you're so curious,

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,480
go and test her yourself.

41
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,480
Test her?

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
How?

43
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
Your Majesty?

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,200
Your subject Ling Jueding
greets Your Majesty.

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,800
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
It seems this outfit suits you well.

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,200
It fits perfectly.

48
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,560
Thank you for arranging it, Your Highness.

49
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,080
You're a prisoner here.
Why are you still so cheerful?

50
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,040
Why shouldn't I be?

51
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,000
I eat well and sleep well here.

52
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,600
It's far better than wandering homeless.

53
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,040
Slick talk. Lies upon lies.

54
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480
I truly don't know why
Kumor values you so much.

55
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,480
Indeed.
It is strange that your brother values

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,160
a thief like me so much.

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
The more you insist you're a thief,

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
the more suspicious you seem.

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
Then Your Highness might as well treat me
as the Empress.

60
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
Since you're so easygoing,

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
would you like to go for a ride with me?

62
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,680
A ride?

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Yes.

64
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,400
<i>A perfect chance to get familiar</i>
<i>with the terrain.</i>

65
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,880
All right.

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,600
It just occurred to me.

67
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,960
Your surname is Lin,

68
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
and so is that of the Jiangzhou commander.

69
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,960
Is that really a coincidence?

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
Mine is Lin, as in "forest."

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,960
The Jiangzhou commander's is Ling,
as in "lingxiao flower."

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,640
Different characters.

73
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,800
Different pronunciations.

74
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Why,

75
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
having fought General Ling
for so long, you can't even

76
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
- get his surname right?
- You…!

77
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,440
You're just a prisoner.
What gives you the right to mock me?

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,600
I spoke out of turn.
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,840
That's better.

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,880
Don't forget.

81
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,080
Your life is in my hands.

82
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,120
Indeed.

83
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,680
Wherever Your Highness wishes to go,

84
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,200
I will follow and serve you.

85
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,200
You sure are adaptable.

86
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,640
Now I'm really inclined to believe
you're just a thief.

87
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Let's go.

88
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,400
Yes.

89
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Your Majesty, their force is thin.

90
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,520
Should we seize Her Majesty now?

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,920
Not yet. They may have come out prepared.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
Send word to Ling Jueding.

93
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,840
Tell him to act as circumstances require

94
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,800
and put the big picture first.

95
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Understood.

96
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,240
It's just a small city,

97
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,760
yet Kumor's wasted so much time here.

98
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,680
I want to see for myself
what exactly they're capable of.

99
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,800
Your Highness,
the two armies are in a truce.

100
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,080
This is provocation.

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,560
So what if it is?

102
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,880
You may be scared, but I'm not.

103
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Who goes there?

104
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,440
Leave at once,

105
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,040
and we may spare your lives!

106
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
Come at us if you dare!

107
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
You think I'm scared of you?

108
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,880
<i>Why is Minjia provoking them at the gates?</i>

109
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,720
General,

110
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,760
it's Her Majesty.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,720
- Bring me a bow.
- General,

112
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Her Majesty is down there.

113
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,120
That's precisely

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
why I have to do this.

115
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,160
Weren't you supposed to send
a peace delegation?

116
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,600
Where are they?

117
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,320
The whole of Great Qi

118
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,520
is full of cowards!

119
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,400
Is that all you can do?

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
Loose!

121
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
You?

122
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,120
What are you doing here?

123
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
If you want to live,

124
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,560
leave at once!

125
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,960
Otherwise, whoever you are,
I will show no mercy!

126
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
Take her away.

127
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,720
Wait.

128
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,720
You two saved me today.

129
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,920
I, Minjia, will remember it.

130
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,520
Lin Cangcang, from this day on,

131
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
you are my friend.

132
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,280
We'll face life and death together

133
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
and never betray one another.

134
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,840
Kumor!

135
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,120
Who are you?

136
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,760
- What did you say?
- That's right.

137
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,920
We used to be romantically involved.

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,640
But we've already parted ways.

139
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,080
Yes, we parted ways.

140
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,560
But as you can see, I came after her.

141
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,040
Tell me.

142
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,240
How did you two meet?

143
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,920
I founded Fenglai Pavilion
back in Southern Chu.

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,440
She was recruiting a hall master,

145
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,720
so I went to apply.
But she wouldn't choose me.

146
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,520
He kept pestering me.

147
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
Only later did I realize

148
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,280
he had ulterior motives.

149
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
What did he want?

150
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,040
He…

151
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,600
he wanted me.

152
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,240
Love at first sight?

153
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,120
She wanted to rescue the abducted youths.

154
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,800
Even while gravely poisoned,

155
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,520
she still tried to protect me out of duty

156
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,720
as the Sect Leader.

157
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
He did help me rescue
those children trapped in the mine,

158
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,240
and he risked his life for me

159
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,680
in the process.

160
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,040
So you fell in love with him too?

161
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,360
Then why did she come to Jiangzhou?

162
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,880
- Why did you break up?
- And why did you come?

163
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,800
- We were incompatible.
- That's it?

164
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,120
She thought I couldn't give her
the freedom she wanted,

165
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,320
so she left me.

166
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,200
As for why and how she came here,

167
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,800
I have no idea.

168
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,760
I just wanted to find her.

169
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,680
I heard someone spotted her in Jiangzhou,

170
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,120
so I came.

171
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,040
Kumor,

172
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,440
why aren't you saying anything?

173
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,520
Everything they said matches.

174
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,320
They met in the martial world.

175
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,160
One is the leader of Fenglai Pavilion,

176
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,080
and the other is
a hall master chasing after her.

177
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,680
They fought side by side,
saved people with their swords,

178
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,720
fell in love,

179
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
and later

180
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,760
abroke up because of differences.

181
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,520
Then Bai Chifan,

182
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,160
still in love with Lin Cangcang,

183
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,040
rushed here once he heard
of her whereabouts.

184
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,360
Are you still suspicious of them?

185
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,720
It all seems too much of a coincidence.

186
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
But they clearly
had no time to coordinate a story.

187
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,560
When I provoked
the Jiangzhou garrison earlier today,

188
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,480
Bai Chifan saved the two of us
from the rain of arrows.

189
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,680
<i>When she saw him,</i>
<i>Lin Cangcang was startled</i>

190
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,720
<i>and even a bit repulsed.</i>

191
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,080
Her reaction did not look fake.

192
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,760
I'm sure

193
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,360
she had no idea
Bai Chifan would turn up here.

194
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,640
Yes,

195
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,080
everything they said about Southern Chu

196
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,120
lines up

197
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,720
and sounds like lived experience,

198
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,760
not something made up.

199
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,480
But neither of them would elaborate

200
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
on what happened
after they left Southern Chu.

201
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,600
It's perfectly normal not to speak

202
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,320
of painful things after a breakup.

203
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,680
Besides, Kumor,
didn't you already test them?

204
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,600
He didn't know she stole the Phoenix Seal

205
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,120
or that she secretly joined the army.

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,000
It makes sense that he knew nothing
about all that since they had broken up.

207
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,000
The fact that their stories
line up so perfectly

208
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,200
makes me even more uneasy.

209
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,520
Kumor, you're overthinking it.

210
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,120
The peace delegation will arrive
sooner or later.

211
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,480
You'll know her identity then, won't you?

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
Besides,

213
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,840
from the way Ling Jueding shot at us
without hesitation,

214
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,320
Cangcang is probably not the Empress.

215
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
More importantly,

216
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,080
the two of them saved me today.

217
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,800
We can't repay kindness
with cruelty, can we?

218
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,640
You two saved me today.
I'm truly grateful.

219
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,080
Here's a toast to you both.

220
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
No need for that, Your Highness.

221
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,760
I only meant to save Cangcang.

222
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,480
Saving you was pure coincidence.

223
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,760
Mr. Bai, you traveled
all this way for your beloved.

224
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,320
- How touching.
- General,

225
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,080
I cut ties with this man long ago.
He has nothing to do with me.

226
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,280
Cangcang,

227
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,840
even though we're no longer together,

228
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,440
I can't bear
to watch you treat yourself like this.

229
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,320
Since we've gone our separate ways,

230
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,960
what I do has nothing to do with you.

231
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,560
Knowing you were captured,

232
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,120
of course I was worried.

233
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,040
You know perfectly well what it is

234
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,840
you're truly worried about.

235
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,680
Miss Lin, what do you think
Mr. Bai is worried about?

236
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,680
You should ask him.

237
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,560
Cangcang,

238
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,080
my feelings for you are genuine.

239
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,760
Mr. Bai,

240
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,880
did you come all this way

241
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,120
only to take your beloved with you?

242
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,480
Of course.

243
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,520
She may have left me,

244
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,240
but I still love her.

245
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,000
Today,

246
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,520
Minjia went to the Jiangzhou gates

247
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,200
on a whim.

248
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,960
Bringing Miss Lin along

249
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,440
was even more spur-of-the-moment.

250
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,800
So how is it that you

251
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,040
just happened to be there?

252
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,280
Were you lying in wait near my camp?

253
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Yes.

254
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,520
You are honest indeed, Mr. Bai.

255
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,120
I knew Cangcang had been taken,

256
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,920
so I kept watch here day and night.

257
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
I wasn't about to let go

258
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,720
of even the faintest hope.

259
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
In this bitter cold,
night winds cut like knives.

260
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Your devotion to her truly runs deep.

261
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,760
And I was rewarded.

262
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,040
I found and saved her.

263
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
What if you hadn't saved her?

264
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,839
Then I would've died with her.

265
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,760
Very well.

266
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll grant that wish

267
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,160
and let you share life and death today.

268
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,359
- Guards!
- Yes, General!

269
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,920
Take these two away.

270
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,600
Yes, General!

271
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,360
General.

272
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,520
Miss Lin, step outside.

273
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,920
Weren't you going to keep me locked up?

274
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,120
- What is this about?
- Come and see.

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
What is this, General?

276
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,600
Mr. Bai said earlier

277
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,040
that he kept watch

278
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,480
near my camp day and night
just to rescue you.

279
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,800
Since he's not afraid
of Xijiang's freezing winds,

280
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,600
I'd like to see
how long he can endure them.

281
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,000
I was just worrying about
how to shake him off.

282
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,240
Thank you, General, for helping me.

283
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,480
You two were once in love.

284
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,040
Miss Lin, don't you care at all?

285
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,440
I've already chosen to leave him behind,

286
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,400
so why cling to the past?

287
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,400
Even so,

288
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,240
he risked his life to rescue you.

289
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,040
Can you really bear to watch him suffer?

290
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,040
General,

291
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm your prisoner now.

292
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,160
I can barely protect myself.

293
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
How could I worry about anyone else?

294
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,000
If you beg me,

295
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,080
I might let him go.

296
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
If begging really works,

297
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,160
can I beg you to let me go?

298
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,720
That's unlikely.

299
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,720
He and I have nothing
to do with each other.

300
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
You may deal with him
as you wish, General.

301
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,320
What a pity.

302
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,400
Your old flame

303
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,040
doesn't seem to care for you at all.

304
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,960
It doesn't matter.

305
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,480
I came here of my own will.

306
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,560
I accept whatever punishment comes my way.

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,440
Interesting.

308
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,160
You two…

309
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,720
One is devoted, while the other
is indifferent.

310
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,320
Very well.

311
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,680
Enjoy the cold.

312
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,240
Minjia.

313
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,960
Cangcang, why did you call for me?

314
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,120
I knew you'd still be awake.

315
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,040
Sit.

316
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,360
I saw

317
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,680
Bai Chifan tied to the pillar.

318
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,160
He looked like he was about to die.

319
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,520
I'm telling you your lover is dying.

320
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,360
Do you really not care?

321
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,080
Former lover.

322
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,080
He's just my former lover.

323
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,640
Why should I care?

324
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,160
But he's handsome,

325
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,520
skilled, and absolutely devoted to you.

326
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,960
Don't tell me you feel nothing at all.

327
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,720
In my opinion, life is short.

328
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Outcomes don't matter.

329
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
Living each day well
is what truly matters.

330
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,520
Princess Minjia,

331
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,840
are you feeling sorry for him?

332
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,360
This isn't pity.

333
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,040
I think he's a good man.

334
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,680
I like him.

335
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
If you don't want him, give him to me.

336
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,480
I don't care about outcomes anyway.

337
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,880
Sure.

338
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,920
You can have him.

339
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,120
But right now, he's probably
freezing to death thanks to your brother.

340
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,000
Not while I'm here.

341
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,760
<i>Xiao Huan,</i>

342
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,880
<i>this is all I can do for you.</i>

343
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,080
What are you looking at?

344
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,200
The stars.

345
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
They are especially bright here.

346
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
Haven't you seen stars before?

347
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,080
It's been two years

348
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,680
since I last looked up properly.

349
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,200
You're unbelievable.

350
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,400
In a situation like this,
you still care about stargazing?

351
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,160
At least we're under the same sky now.

352
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,160
That's a kind of bond, isn't it?

353
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,520
Just sharing

354
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,120
the same sky is enough for you?

355
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,400
Being able to see her again at all

356
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,360
is already a rare blessing.

357
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,360
I doubt I can hope for anything more.

358
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,320
You're easy to satisfy.

359
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,000
Too bad

360
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,080
she said she didn't care for you anymore.

361
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,760
She's giving you to me.

362
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,840
Your Highness must be joking.

363
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,600
A princess like you
will find a fine match.

364
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,280
You really are devoted.

365
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Let me warn you,

366
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,280
the night winds here can freeze
cattle and sheep to death.

367
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,320
Aren't you afraid of the cold?

368
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,000
No, I'm used to it.

369
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,080
Here, Mr. Bai,

370
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,720
take this cloak.

371
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,720
Make it through the night.

372
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,880
<i>Kumor, I tested</i>

373
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
both of them as you said.

374
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,480
I don't think they're faking it.

375
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Minjia,

376
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,760
you grew up on the steppe.

377
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,440
You don't know how cunning
the Central Plains people can be.

378
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,640
But Kumor,

379
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,800
Bai Chifan saved my life.

380
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,760
If you let him freeze to death,

381
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,320
that wouldn't be right.

382
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,960
Minjia,

383
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,760
don't tell me
you've taken a liking to him.

384
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,480
Of course not.

385
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,680
Why would I fall for someone
whose heart belongs to another?

386
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,440
I'm just touched by his devotion.

387
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,640
Don't worry.

388
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,240
He won't die yet.

389
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,400
We'll decide his fate

390
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,840
after the delegation comes.

391
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,800
- Is the hot water ready?
- Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,160
The braziers are lit too.

393
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,360
Mr. Bai,

394
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,680
I've prepared a tent for you.

395
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,320
Take a hot bath once you get there.

396
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
I added herbs to help you warm up.

397
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

398
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,080
Come on, let's head back.

399
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,320
Didn't expect that.

400
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,600
You braved the northern wind
all night and are still standing.

401
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,280
It seems I underestimated you.

402
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,480
I've roamed the martial world for years.

403
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,320
A bit of cold wind

404
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,680
is nothing.

405
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,840
In that case,

406
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,800
stay out for a few more nights.

407
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,800
Kumor,

408
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm indebted to Mr. Bai.

409
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,360
I won't let you treat him like this.

410
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
Mr. Bai, let's go.

411
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,960
<i>Is she really not the Empress?</i>

412
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,760
General, the delegation
from Great Qi is at the gate.

413
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,200
Very well. Let them in.

414
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,120
Yes, General.

415
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,040
- Cangcang.
- Minjia?

416
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,960
The delegation from Great Qi is here.

417
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,520
- They're here?
- Let's go.

418
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Kumor's waiting for us.

419
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,960
Come on.

420
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,080
Du Tingxin, envoy of Great Qi,

421
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,360
greets General Kumor.

422
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,840
By order of His Majesty,

423
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
I've come to negotiate peace.

424
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,320
Looks like I hold
quite a place in the eyes

425
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,560
of the Emperor of Great Qi.

426
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,840
He actually sent
the Imperial Preceptor here.

427
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,040
This shows

428
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,880
His Majesty's sincerity.

429
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,080
Very well.

430
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,160
Then let me show your emperor

431
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,400
my sincerity as well.

432
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,680
Bring her up!

433
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
General.

434
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,840
Preceptor Du,

435
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,480
aren't you going to kneel
before your empress?

436
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,960
The Empress?

437
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,840
Where?

438
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,960
Didn't the Emperor of Great Qi
receive my letter?

439
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,720
Calm down, General.

440
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,920
I came precisely to address this matter.

441
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,560
This is a handwritten letter
from His Majesty.

442
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
Please see for yourself.

443
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,720
THE PHOENIX SEAL OF GREAT QI
RECENTLY WENT MISSING.

444
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,560
I HEARD IT WAS FOUND
BY GENERAL KUMOR, SO I SENT A DELEGATION

445
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,000
TO RETRIEVE THE STOLEN SEAL,
RECLAIM THE CAPTIVES, AND NEGOTIATE PEACE.

446
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,040
The Empress of Great Qi is still
in the palace?

447
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,360
Yes.

448
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Her Majesty is safe and sound.

449
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,240
His Majesty sent this delegation

450
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,480
to retrieve the stolen Phoenix Seal,

451
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,400
reclaim the captives,

452
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,560
and negotiate terms

453
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,360
for peace.

454
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,360
Preceptor Du,

455
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,800
do you know this woman?

456
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,880
This is the thief?

457
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,480
How dare you steal the Phoenix Seal?

458
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,920
Your crime is unforgivable!

459
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,920
Guards,

460
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,920
take her back to Jiangzhou for punishment!

461
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,080
- Wait.
- Understood.

462
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,000
No need for all that trouble.

463
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,400
According to custom in Xijiang,

464
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,840
a thief's right hand is chopped off
in public

465
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,520
and thrown in the wilderness
to feed the wolves.

466
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,400
In that case,

467
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,280
let's follow local custom.

468
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,320
Do you have anything to say?

469
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,840
General,

470
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,640
to the Imperial Preceptor,

471
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,600
I am indeed a thief
who stole the Phoenix Seal.

472
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,360
I have nothing to say.

473
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,080
Please do the honors, Preceptor Du.

474
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,160
Then please have your men

475
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,600
hold the thief down.

476
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,920
Preceptor Du,
your inner force may be mediocre,

477
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,320
but your resolve
to chop off her hand is admirable.

478
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,120
What is it?

479
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,200
Have you changed your mind
about punishing her?

480
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,120
Since she is not the Empress of Great Qi,

481
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,400
her matter can wait.

482
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,280
Let us discuss real business.

483
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,040
Since you were sent
by the Emperor of Great Qi,

484
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,640
you must have brought
some token of sincerity.

485
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,560
Bring it up!

486
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
What is this?

487
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,480
Do you think you can

488
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,200
buy me off with a bit of money?

489
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,680
This is 3,128 liang and nine qian of gold.

490
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,640
It is not "a bit of money."

491
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,440
This is the money people in Xijiang paid
to purchase proper status

492
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,400
after the status verification system
was implemented last year.

493
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,080
I had the Ministry of Revenue
convert it into gold

494
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,000
and brought it here to you.

495
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,719
I didn't go through all this trouble

496
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,560
for a bit of gold.

497
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,960
Since the status verification system
was enforced,

498
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,400
those without proper status
have been reduced to slaves.

499
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,840
Ordinary folk have had no choice
but to purchase good status.

500
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,520
How is this any different
from daylight robbery?

501
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,760
If the system is not abolished,

502
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,960
this gold you brought

503
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,440
will be nothing but a drop in the ocean.

504
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,080
General, mind your words.

505
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,639
The status verification system is
a national policy

506
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,880
established to maintain order.

507
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,880
How can it be abolished so easily?

508
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,679
You are mistaken, Preceptor Du.

509
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,600
Only when all people are free and equal

510
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,199
can the land be at peace.

511
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,520
As I see it,

512
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,920
the status verification system
is the very cause of chaos in the land.

513
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,600
I am merely carrying out orders
to deliver this gold to you, General.

514
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,680
Matters regarding the system

515
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,960
are not for me to decide.

516
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,280
I've heard you're
the Emperor of Great Qi's trusted aide.

517
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,800
Seeing you today, I can't imagine why.

518
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,880
I will report your thoughts
to His Majesty.

519
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,280
Good.

520
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,160
Please do.

521
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,400
When you decide to abolish

522
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,080
the status verification system,

523
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,400
I will consider
when to withdraw my troops.

524
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,920
General, are you truly turning down

525
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,720
3,000 liang of gold?

526
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,200
Did I say I was?

527
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,040
Aren't the Phoenix Seal and the captives
worth 3,000 liang of gold?

528
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,120
General, how bold you are.

529
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,920
Very well.

530
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,960
In that case,

531
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,120
the gold is yours.

532
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,840
As for the captives, the Phoenix Seal,
and her, I'm taking them all.

533
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,160
Preceptor Du,
you are being a bit too greedy.

534
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
You may take the captives.

535
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,000
As for the Phoenix Seal and her,
you may choose only one.

536
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Then please, chop off her hand
and feed it to the wolves for me.

537
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,200
<i>As for the Phoenix Seal and her,</i>
<i>you may choose only one.</i>

538
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,800
Then please, chop off her hand
and feed it to the wolves for me.

539
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,040
<i>The Preceptor never intended</i>
<i>to take me away.</i>

540
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,640
<i>Was she acting on his orders?</i>

541
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,040
<i>No matter.</i>

542
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,880
<i>I am no longer the Empress of Great Qi.</i>

543
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,440
<i>Why should I care what he wants?</i>

544
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,160
<i>If the Preceptor can at least tell Jueding</i>
<i>that I'm safe,</i>

545
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,440
<i>it will put his mind at ease.</i>

546
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,800
<i>If I can use this opportunity</i>

547
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,200
<i>to learn the Black Tiger Army's defenses…</i>

548
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,560
What are you thinking?

549
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,720
Nothing.

550
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,440
Are you sad?

551
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,200
Of course.

552
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,600
All the captives have left.

553
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,600
I'm the only one left behind.

554
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,320
General, you don't still think
I'm the Empress of Great Qi, do you?

555
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
To be honest,

556
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,040
I still have a tiny bit of doubt.

557
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,800
But right now, I see no reason

558
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,600
to believe you are.

559
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,960
Then what do you plan to do with me?

560
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,120
I intend

561
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,080
to treat you two

562
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,040
as honored guests.

563
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,960
When the war ends,

564
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,680
I will see you both off myself.

565
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,160
This is how you treat honored guests?

566
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,960
You're practically putting me
under house arrest.

567
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,480
Inside the camp,
you two are free to go wherever you like.

568
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,680
But if either of you steps outside,

569
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,760
don't blame me for being ruthless.

570
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,360
All right.

571
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
Since you're so "hospitable,"

572
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,840
I suppose I'll stay.

573
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
But there is one thing I don't understand.

574
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,440
Now that you know I'm not the Empress,

575
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,640
why haven't you killed me?

576
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
I can't bear to.

577
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,640
I just think

578
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,840
that you are a woman of honor.

579
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,800
You stole provisions to save the people.

580
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,960
I admire that.

581
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,840
Rest assured.

582
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,960
Since I said
I'd treat you as honored guests,

583
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,400
I'll keep my word.

584
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,480
Good.

585
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Your Highness.

586
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,360
Mr. Bai, are you better now?

587
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,920
Thank you for the cloak.

588
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,480
Cangcang?

589
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,120
<i>She should have left with the delegation.</i>

590
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,760
<i>Why is she still here?</i>

591
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,160
Yes, that's Cangcang.

592
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,320
What's wrong?

593
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,880
Nothing.

594
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,280
Did
the delegation from Great Qi come today?

595
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,400
They did. And they've already left.

596
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,680
Can you believe my brother?

597
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,920
Earlier,

598
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,800
he suspected
that Lin Cangcang was the Empress

599
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,520
and even had me follow the two of you.

600
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,440
Only when the delegation

601
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,040
confirmed her identity today
did he finally relax.

602
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,280
If you ask me,

603
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,960
the whole thing is simple.

604
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,440
If Cangcang were the Empress,

605
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,760
wouldn't that make you the Emperor?

606
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Exactly.

607
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,280
QI

608
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,120
General.

609
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,720
Greetings, Preceptor Du.

610
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,640
General Ling, no need to look around.

611
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,240
Her Majesty

612
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,280
is not with us.

613
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,320
Why not?

614
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,760
Kumor made me choose
between the 300 captives and Her Majesty,

615
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,360
but she would rather die
than admit who she was.

616
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,560
I had no choice but to respect her wishes,

617
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,960
so I only retrieved
the stolen Phoenix Seal

618
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,160
and brought back the captives.

619
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,720
Then what about my sister?

620
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,800
Her Majesty put the greater good first.

621
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,080
Heaven will watch over her.

622
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
I will also

623
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,240
pray for her safety day and night.

624
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,640
Cangcang.

625
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,760
Minjia?

626
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,360
Why are you staying
in your tent all the time?

627
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,680
Why not go out for a walk?

628
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,760
What's the point?

629
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
I can't leave the camp anyway.

630
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,080
What, do you know somewhere worth going?

631
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,520
I wish.

632
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,680
I still have to clean the stables
this afternoon.

633
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,480
Clean the stables?

634
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,240
A princess like you
cleans the stables yourself?

635
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,720
Of course.

636
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,960
As my brother says,

637
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
there are no princesses in the camp,
only soldiers.

638
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,200
If I want to stay here,

639
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I have to work like everyone else.

640
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,600
Anyway, enough about that.

641
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,040
I snuck out to chat with you.

642
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,040
About what?

643
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,760
If it's about Bai Chifan, forget it.

644
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,520
That's exactly what I want to talk about.

645
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,160
Why did you break up with him?

646
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,040
He clearly cares for you deeply.

647
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,600
I used to think so too.

648
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
Only later did I realize

649
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,760
he had ulterior motives.

650
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,000
Mr. Bai is not that kind of man.

651
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,600
He risked his life to save you.

652
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,160
Enough.

653
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,400
I don't want to talk about him.

654
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,080
I bet you still have feelings for him.

655
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,880
If you truly didn't care,
you wouldn't sound so bitter.

656
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,520
You say you've moved on,

657
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,400
but you still hold grudges.

658
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,760
If you ask me,

659
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,080
your anger comes from love.

660
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,000
Really?

661
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,200
I hit the mark, didn't I?
