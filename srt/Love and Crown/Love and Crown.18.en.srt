ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,920
Farewell, Your Majesties.

3
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Today, we bid you farewell
as Bai Chifan and Lin Cangcang.

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
Mr. Bai, did you succeed
in winning your beloved back?

5
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,600
Isn't it obvious?

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,400
Didn't you see the way
Miss Lin looked at Mr. Bai just now?

7
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,320
Later, I will have a grand gift prepared
to thank Your Highness.

8
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
All right.

9
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,080
This journey to Xijiang
has taught me much.

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,760
Thank you.

11
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Though parting is hard,
we have to say goodbye.

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,320
- Take care.
- Take care.

13
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,680
Let's go.

14
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Goodbye.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,120
Kumor,
I'll really miss Cangcang and Bai Chifan.

16
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,680
What shall we do?

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,920
Should we have them find
you a husband in the Capital?

18
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,520
What are you talking about, Kumor?

19
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,400
My silly sister has grown up.
She's actually blushing.

20
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Ying.

21
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,800
Qianqing, here's the powder you wanted.

22
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,920
You're amazing, Ying.

23
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,520
I'll bring you a gift
when I come back, all right?

24
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
Qianqing, take care of yourself.

25
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,640
What are you doing?

26
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,640
You scared me.

27
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Why are you here?

28
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,880
This trip will be perilous.

29
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,920
I was afraid
you wouldn't be able to handle it alone,

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,680
so I decided to escort you myself.

31
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,080
I have guards with me. You needn't
trouble yourself, Your Highness.

32
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Wait.

33
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,400
You are a woman after all.

34
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,440
Oh? You know that?

35
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,200
Then why not spare me this mission?

36
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Go by yourself.

37
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
That won't do.

38
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,200
You know Xuzhou better than I do.

39
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,160
I can't go without you, Master Zhong.

40
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,280
What was that?

41
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,960
Master Zhong.

42
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
Let's go.

43
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,080
<i>Imperial Physician Li left the Capital</i>
<i>in secret two days ago.</i>

44
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,200
<i>Track him immediately.</i>

45
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,640
<i>I will wait for your report in Xuzhou.</i>

46
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,520
XUZHOU

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,440
GOOD FORTUNE AND PROSPERITY

48
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,520
This trip wasn't in vain.

49
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
I can't believe the Governor of Xuzhou

50
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,640
actually dared to tell such blatant lies.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,200
It's late autumn.
Winter is coming. Let's hurry.

52
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,840
The sooner we reach Xuzhou,
the sooner we can distribute grain.

53
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,280
Only with food to eat and strength
to work can the people endure the cold.

54
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,040
YAMEN OF XUZHOU PREFECTURE

55
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,400
I didn't sleep at all last night.

56
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
Here they come. Come on.

57
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
They're here.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
Greetings, Your Excellency.

59
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,640
Who are you?

60
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
I am Li Youlin, a county governor.

61
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,480
The Governor of Xuzhou
committed suicide in prison out of guilt.

62
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,200
I have temporarily taken his place
to handle Xuzhou's affairs.

63
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,160
<i>We were just talking about him.</i>

64
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
<i>He killed himself already?</i>

65
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,520
<i>Grand Tutor Ling really</i>
<i>intends to eliminate all loose ends.</i>

66
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,400
I see.

67
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,480
Store half of the relief grain
in the prefecture granary

68
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,920
and distribute the other half
according to the household registry.

69
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,760
If I find any shortage or deception,

70
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
I will punish without mercy.

71
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,640
Rest assured, Your Excellency.

72
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,320
I will have my men inventory
and process everything overnight.

73
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,760
This is a special
locust-repelling powder from the palace.

74
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,520
You may try it.

75
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,440
If it works,

76
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,440
I have the recipe, and you can have
it produced in large quantities.

77
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,560
Understood.

78
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
We've also been trying

79
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,680
to drive the locusts away
with torches and wild ducks.

80
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,400
Now, with this powder added,
there are three methods in total.

81
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,160
We should see results soon.

82
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,960
My Lord,

83
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,840
word from the palace.

84
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,760
The Prince of
Yuzhang secretly left the Capital.

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,080
He left?

86
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Send men after him.

87
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,840
Whatever Xiao Qianqing is planning,

88
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,040
I will make sure he never rises again.

89
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,880
POST STATION

90
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,480
- Who is it?
- If you fail your task,

91
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,840
the Lingbi Sect will never let you go.

92
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,520
KILL THE PRINCE OF YUZHANG

93
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,600
Zhong Lin,

94
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,520
I am punishing you.

95
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,680
Tell me,

96
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,760
have you been trying to seduce me?

97
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
Otherwise,

98
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,880
why would I feel like I'm falling for you?

99
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,440
I've never fallen

100
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,400
for anyone before.

101
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,000
<i>Miss Zhong, you're brave and sharp.</i>

102
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,440
I've decided it's you.

103
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,480
Be quick.

104
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,240
My life is in your hands now,
Vice Sect Leader Zhong.

105
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Deal.

106
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,080
<i>Zhong Lin,</i>

107
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,800
<i>why did you try to kill me?</i>

108
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,760
Thank you.

109
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,360
Take it easy. There's enough for everyone.

110
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,320
Give me some!

111
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,080
- Get in line.
- Thank you.

112
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,560
Thank you.

113
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,760
- Here.
- Next.

114
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,200
- Line up!
- Thank you.

115
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,160
- No rush. You'll all get your share.
- No pushing!

116
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,200
Get in line!

117
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,200
Get in line!

118
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't push. There's plenty.

119
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,760
Everyone, line up.

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No rush.

121
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Sir, please give me a little more.

122
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
- Sir…
- Come here.

123
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,720
- Stay in line!
- There's plenty!

124
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't push. You'll get your share.

125
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,360
Please give me some.

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
Don't push. There's plenty.

127
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,920
Everyone will get some.

128
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,760
We succeeded
because you rushed back in time.

129
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,360
You deserve the top credit. Cheers.

130
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,280
No need for that.

131
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
Just keep your word
and let me see Cangcang.

132
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,880
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>Zhong Lin owing you any favors.</i>

133
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I have one more favor to ask.

134
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
Please look after her.

135
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
Keep her from coming after me.

136
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,160
Thank you, sir!

137
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,000
We're out of congee. Please wait a moment.

138
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Stay in line, everyone!

139
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,040
Here you are.

140
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,160
What's wrong?

141
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
Zhong Lin,

142
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,640
you're not yourself today.

143
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
- If you have time to stand here,
- Thank you.

144
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,640
why not help us instead?

145
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,680
I'm used to having everything done for me.

146
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Great acts of charity
like distributing congee

147
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,040
should be left to Your Excellency.

148
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,760
Here. Move aside.

149
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,040
Is it ready yet, Madam?

150
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,600
- Almost.
- I know you.

151
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,640
Your name is Niqiu.

152
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
You already got your congee.

153
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Everyone only gets one serving a day.
Move along.

154
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,800
Sir, please,

155
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
let me get some more. I'm really hungry.

156
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Don't you understand the rules?

157
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,080
Get out of here!

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,840
Your Highness.

159
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,960
Careful.

160
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,760
Did you hurt yourself?

161
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,240
Here, take this.

162
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,360
Go on home.

163
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

164
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,960
Did my gentle

165
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,520
and benevolent nature stun you?

166
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,960
Your Highness.

167
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
What's wrong?

168
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,360
Come with me.

169
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

170
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,960
- Bless us.
- Bless us.

171
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,080
What are they worshipping?

172
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
The Tudigong?

173
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,200
Your Highness, that's no Tudigong.

174
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,440
It's the Locust Lord.

175
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
The Locust Lord?

176
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
That's absurd.

177
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,120
Why would anyone worship
something that only brings disaster?

178
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,280
Common folk have long seen
locust plagues as divine punishment.

179
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,000
They believe only sincere prayers
will earn mercy and end the plague.

180
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,240
Why didn't you officials do anything
to stop such absurd rumors?

181
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,360
People were uncertain at first.

182
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,160
But after the Governor of Xuzhou

183
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,440
suddenly killed himself in prison,

184
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,480
they became convinced their worship
moved the Locust Lord

185
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,880
to deliver justice,

186
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,320
so things kept escalating.

187
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,520
"Know the enemy and know yourself,
and you'll never lose."

188
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,720
We should head back

189
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
and come up with a plan.

190
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,160
Where are you going?

191
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,400
I didn't haul grain all the way to Xuzhou

192
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,760
just to let them
offer it to a swarm of bugs!

193
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,400
- What are you planning to do?
- Out of the way!

194
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,640
What are you doing?

195
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,320
Everyone! Everyone,

196
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,240
- please listen to me!
- Locust Lord!

197
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
The Governor of Xuzhou has
confessed and paid for his crimes,

198
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,720
and we've found a way to end the plague.

199
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,640
The grain distributed by the government

200
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
is to get you through the famine,

201
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,600
not to be offered

202
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,200
to the very pest that caused it!

203
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,920
Please get up and take your grain home.

204
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,160
- Madam, get up.
- Liar!

205
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,080
You officials are the ones who harmed us!

206
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
You…

207
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,280
If that wretched
governor hadn't stolen our grain,

208
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,600
would we be starving now?

209
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,640
- Nonsense!
- The Locust Lord

210
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,960
is our guardian spirit!

211
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,200
It punished

212
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,960
the Governor of Xuzhou for us!

213
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,920
Anger the Locust Lord,

214
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
you'll suffer retribution!

215
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,520
You…

216
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,280
They look down on the Locust Lord

217
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,720
- because they don't want us to live well!
- Exactly!

218
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,840
- That's right!
- Move aside!

219
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,800
Calm down! Everyone, listen to me!

220
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,000
It's not like that!

221
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,960
How dare he?

222
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,160
- Listen to me…
- Beat him!

223
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,320
Listen…

224
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,280
The darn official is attacking people!

225
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,319
He's attacking people!

226
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,480
- Step back!
- Step back!

227
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,359
Beat him up!

228
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,079
How can they attack people?

229
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,160
Beat him!

230
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,280
- Catch them!
- Let's go.

231
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,720
Don't let them get away!

232
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,880
Catch them!

233
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,880
After them!

234
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Stop! Don't run!

235
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,880
They're up ahead! Hurry, catch them!

236
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
- Hurry!
- Stop!

237
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,920
Come on!

238
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Where are they?

239
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,920
- Over there!
- That way!

240
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,640
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

241
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,720
- Hurry up!
- That way!

242
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,760
Hurry!

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,640
Mr. Song, I'll draw the crowd away.

244
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,760
- You protect His Highness and leave.
- All right.

245
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,800
- Be careful.
- There they are!

246
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,120
- Run!
- Let's go!

247
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,480
Where did they go?

248
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,440
Search!

249
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,440
Hurry up…

250
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,040
Stop right there!

251
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,600
I'll hold them off. Go!

252
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
No. We leave together.

253
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,800
- Catch them!
- Come on.

254
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,840
- Don't run!
- Stop!

255
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,760
This way.

256
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,680
- Stop!
- Stop!

257
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,040
- Come on.
- Stop right there!

258
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
They're over there!

259
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,520
Don't run!

260
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Stop!

261
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,080
That way! Hurry!

262
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's go.

263
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,600
Search.

264
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
Boss,

265
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,960
they're not in the house.

266
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,280
Keep looking!

267
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,000
Xiao Qianqing. Wake up, Xiao Qianqing.

268
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,320
Xiao Qianqing, wake up!

269
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,480
<i>Complete the mission and you'll be free.</i>

270
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,240
<i>If I kill you, I'll be free.</i>

271
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,560
If you fail your task,
the Lingbi Sect will never let you go.

272
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,560
KILL THE PRINCE OF YUZHANG

273
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,160
- Did you find them?
- Sir, no trace of them anywhere.

274
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
Where are they?
How could they just vanish?

275
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,000
Sir, a search is underway,

276
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,920
but we

277
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,080
haven't found anything yet.

278
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,440
Please grant us more time.

279
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,080
We can't wait any longer.

280
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,960
Arrest every person
who was worshipping that Locust Lord!

281
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,720
Interrogate them. Torture them.

282
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,120
We'll see how long they can hold out!

283
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
But… Sir,

284
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,320
there were far too many people.
It isn't realistic

285
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,720
to arrest them all.

286
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,320
Do you know who is missing?

287
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,360
I'll be honest.

288
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
It's not just the Imperial Commissioner.
There's also…

289
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,160
Also who?

290
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,680
In short,

291
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,680
someone you can't afford to offend!

292
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,080
Listen closely.

293
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
From now on, no eating, no drinking,

294
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,120
and no rest until you find them!

295
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,480
Turn the place upside down if you have to!

296
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,440
Is that clear?

297
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,800
Yes!

298
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,200
Careful.

299
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
You're hurt.

300
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,280
Where are we?

301
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
We fell into a dry well.

302
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,480
I can't believe those people…

303
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,080
This time, it's my fault.

304
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,000
Had I not provoked them,

305
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,320
you wouldn't be injured
or trapped down here.

306
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,040
I'm hungry.

307
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,760
You heard me.

308
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,400
Hurry and figure out a way out.

309
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,120
I've already checked. The well isn't deep,

310
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,600
and there are stone bricks we can climb.

311
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,800
But in our condition,

312
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,680
we probably can't make it up.

313
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
Then how about this?

314
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,360
Shout for help.

315
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,080
Maybe someone will hear you,

316
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,600
- and we'll be saved.
- What?

317
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,640
Why don't you shout?

318
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,920
Me?

319
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,040
My arm hurts.

320
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,880
<i>So troublesome.</i>

321
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,760
<i>If I'd known,</i>
<i>I would've just killed you earlier.</i>

322
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,240
Why are you still staring at me?

323
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,680
Hurry up and shout.

324
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,320
If you wait any longer,

325
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,960
my arm will break.

326
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,760
Help.

327
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,320
Louder.

328
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
Help!

329
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,760
Is anyone there?

330
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,760
Help!

331
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
Help!

332
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
Is anyone there?

333
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,920
Come and help us!

334
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,160
All right, enough.

335
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,720
In a deserted yard like this,
no one's coming.

336
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,440
Save your strength.

337
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,960
Why didn't you say so earlier?

338
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,880
You said

339
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,600
I ended up like this because of you.

340
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,800
So what's wrong with
making you shout a bit?

341
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,080
Something's not right.

342
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,080
Your Highness, you didn't
seem surprised at all when they rioted.

343
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,560
You knew this trip would be dangerous,

344
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
so why did you insist on coming with me?

345
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,320
I had my reasons.

346
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,400
What reasons?

347
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
To protect you.

348
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,440
You've helped me so many times.
I can't let you walk into danger alone.

349
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,480
Stop sitting there.

350
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,600
Come here.

351
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,160
Here's the plan:

352
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,600
step on me and jump.

353
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,640
See if you can grab the vines
and climb out.

354
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,400
What about you?

355
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,800
I'll stay and wait for you to bring help.

356
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,040
Don't… don't get sentimental.

357
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,200
I only said that
because I have an important task,

358
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,520
and a little sacrifice is necessary.

359
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,320
Once you get out,

360
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,600
bring people back immediately.

361
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,680
Understand?

362
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,400
Yes.

363
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,200
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

364
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
<i>I don't want to kill you,</i>

365
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,480
<i>but I can't let you live either.</i>

366
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,920
<i>We part ways here.</i>

367
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,800
<i>Whether you survive</i>

368
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,120
<i>depends on yourself now.</i>

369
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,040
Sir…

370
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,560
You saw the Ghost King Token.
Why are you still hesitating?

371
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,000
The Ghost King has just passed away,
and you've already forgotten your place?

372
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,320
I wouldn't dare. Please, sir, spare me.

373
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,040
Remember the fate of traitors.

374
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,560
Spare me, sir!

375
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,320
As long as you live,

376
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,560
no matter where you go,

377
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,200
you must stay loyal to the Lingbi Sect.

378
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,000
Go and kill Xiao Qianqing.

379
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,360
What took you so long?

380
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,920
Xiao Qianqing,

381
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,080
you're the first person
who ever said you had feelings for me.

382
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,720
But you and I
belong to two different worlds.

383
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,400
One of us must die.

384
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,560
Even if I don't kill you,

385
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,400
they'll send someone else.

386
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,320
I can only buy you some time.

387
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,880
Once the Xuzhou matter is settled,

388
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,360
we'll go our separate ways.

389
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Fate is to blame.

390
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,200
Just pretend

391
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,000
there was never a Zhong Lin in this world.

392
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,040
Mr. Song!

393
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,640
Mr. Song!

394
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
Mr. Song!

395
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,080
Come quickly! Mr. Song is here!

396
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Are you all right?

397
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,680
Divine spirit above, hear our plea.

398
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,200
We were reckless earlier and offended you.

399
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,040
We beg your forgiveness.

400
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,320
Now, I, Song Lanxi,
together with the people of Xuzhou,

401
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,520
humbly pray

402
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,720
for blessings and safety,

403
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,640
and for the locust
plague to be dispelled soon.

404
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
I have received an edict
from the Shrine of Great Qi.

405
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,960
Today, I lead
the people in sincere prayer,

406
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,720
seeking the descent of the divine spirit

407
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,760
to deliver us from hardship.

408
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,120
Who is that?

409
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,960
The deity has manifested!

410
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,240
Bow!

411
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
A manifestation!

412
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,960
Oh, deity!

413
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,000
Please save us, deity!

414
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,520
Filled with compassion for all beings,

415
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,760
I traverse the mortal world.

416
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,640
Passing through this place,

417
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,000
I saw Xuzhou ravaged by disaster

418
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,800
and its people in misery.

419
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,960
In honor of your sincere prayers,

420
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,200
I bestow upon you this Immortal Dew.

421
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,880
Scatter it upon the locusts,

422
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,640
and the plague will be dispelled.

423
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,360
Thank you for your divine grace.

424
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,400
Scatter the Immortal Dew
to eliminate the locusts.

425
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,320
Understood.

426
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
We're saved by the deity's blessing!

427
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,520
Wait!

428
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,520
He's a fake!

429
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,760
Why would a deity
be wearing official boots?

430
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,199
Don't let him fool you!

431
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,040
I've been waiting for you! Seize him!

432
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,520
Arrest him!

433
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,880
Get them!

434
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,520
KILL THE PRINCE OF YUZHANG

435
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,440
<i>Why would I feel like I'm falling for you?</i>

436
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,680
Look out!

437
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,000
I, Li Youlin,

438
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,720
together with the people of Xuzhou,

439
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,360
am here to see Mr. Song off.

440
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,040
Mr. Song traveled far to deliver grain

441
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,080
and gave his all.

442
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,040
We will never forget

443
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,920
his life-saving grace!

444
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,840
Mr. Song,

445
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,480
may you rest in peace!

446
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,120
Keep moving!

447
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,880
What are you planning to do?

448
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,800
Your life

449
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,920
is in my hands now.

450
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,720
I have only one question:

451
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,000
who are you, really?

452
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,360
What do you mean?

453
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,480
I'm Zhong Lin. Who else would I be?

454
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,880
Is that so?

455
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,480
Then why did you try to assassinate me?

456
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
I…

457
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,000
I thought

458
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,680
I could finally escape my past.

459
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,840
But as it turned out,

460
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,120
I could never break free
from being someone else's pawn.

461
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,640
Whose pawn?

462
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,360
The Lingbi Sect?

463
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,200
There's no point in saying more.

464
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,480
Your Highness, kill me.

465
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
If that's the case,

466
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,680
don't blame me.

467
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,760
<i>I am Zhong Lin, Vice Sect Leader</i>
<i>of Fenglai Pavilion.</i>

468
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,440
<i>I'm willing to serve</i>
<i>Your Highness with all my heart.</i>

469
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,440
Go.

470
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,520
Song Lanxi is dead.

471
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,600
You are free again.

472
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,720
From now on,

473
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,120
you are not Song Lanxi.

474
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,320
Nor are you Zhong Lin.

475
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,640
You can be yourself.

476
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,960
No one will ever use you as a pawn again.

477
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,040
Go!
