00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,080
Father,

3
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,360
what if His Majesty told her

4
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,080
that Mr. Li Lu went to his death willingly
on your orders?

5
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,480
He would never spell it out.

6
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,480
And I'm doing this for the Ling clan too.

7
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,600
Even so,

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,880
aren't you afraid
that once Young Lady learns the truth,

9
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,840
she won't be able to bear it?

10
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,200
She's a daughter of the Ling clan.

11
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,800
There are things she has to endure!

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,320
And for all that she's the Empress,

13
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,880
in the end,

14
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,800
the Ling clan's what she leans on.

15
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,040
Only if the Ling clan stands strong

16
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,440
can she be safe.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
At court now,

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,520
Xiao Huan is closing in on me
at every turn.

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,720
If I lose the backing
of the senior ministers,

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,120
I'll hardly be able to stand.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,560
So,

22
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,960
Cangcang must bear a prince
as soon as she can.

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Any news of the Saintess
of the Lingbi Sect?

24
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
Finding her

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,880
is the key to winning back Moon-Eclipse.

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,520
I will give my all,
even at the cost of my life!

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
It fears my Begonia Pendant!

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,840
This pendant must hold Wanwei Herb.

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
It's a rare medicinal herb.

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,160
When it senses poison,
it glows and drives the poison away.

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,680
With it on you, no toxin can hurt you.

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,000
Moon-Eclipse is the Ghost King's token.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,560
It feeds on Wanwei Herb

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,440
and is born among it.

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
Planted in a human heart,

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,800
it can awaken the host's hidden potential,

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,920
but at the cost of their lifespan.

38
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,240
If the host dies,

39
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,000
Moon-Eclipse is left hanging by a thread.

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,040
Only by returning to Wanwei Herb

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,920
can it breed and survive.

42
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,560
Li Hongqing oversaw Master's burial
back then.

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,240
If I want to untangle
what really happened in the palace,

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,040
it seems I must first reclaim
the Phoenix Seal.

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,240
LINGHE HALL

46
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,680
While I was away,

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,840
has anything interesting happened
in the palace?

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
I wouldn't dare to say.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
You wouldn't dare?

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
That only makes me want to hear it more.

51
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,200
Then Your Majesty mustn't get angry.

52
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,200
I won't. Speak.

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,200
I've heard
the Empress Dowager has lately been busy

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
choosing consorts for His Majesty.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
What a "good" thing.

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,640
How is that good?

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,520
Have you forgotten how the Empress Dowager
used to make things so hard for you?

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Of course it's good. Come on.

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,120
Greetings, Mother.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,120
Have you ever

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,280
seen me as your Mother at all?

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
What do you mean by that, Mother?

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
Even now,

64
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
you still play dumb with me?

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,280
Mother, I truly don't know.

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
As Empress,

67
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,720
you've been in the palace so long
without His Majesty's favor,

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,720
with no hope of heirs.

69
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,520
I want to choose concubines
for His Majesty,

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,720
yet he keeps saying
he must discuss it with you.

71
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,400
What,

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,880
you don't want him to take concubines?

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,800
Mother, please understand.

74
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,440
I've only just returned to the palace
and only just heard of this.

75
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,000
So, now you know that?

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,880
Yes.

77
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
Rest assured, Mother,

78
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll help you persuade His Majesty

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,640
to take more consorts

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,080
and give the royal family heirs.

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,000
Really?

82
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,960
Absolutely.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Your Majesty,

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,360
these are ladies of the right age

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
the Empress Dowager and I
have carefully chosen for you.

86
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,200
They're all from respectable families
and outstanding in looks.

87
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,680
Please look them over.

88
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,760
You want to pick consorts for me?

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
- Exactly.
- Why?

90
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,440
You sit on the throne above all
and should expand the harem

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,880
to carry on the royal line.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,080
Do you even hear yourself?

93
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,600
As Empress, it's only right
that I help the Empress Dowager

94
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
manage the inner palace.

95
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,000
That's my duty.

96
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
Must you talk to me like this?

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Please take your time choosing.

98
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
I'll take my leave.

99
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,320
Do you realize
the Empress Dowager is doing this

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,640
to plant her own spies at my side?

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
There's no real affection
in this palace anyway.

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,840
Spy or not, what difference does it make?

103
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,800
All right.

104
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,920
If that's how it is,

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,560
I'll take my time and choose carefully.

106
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,520
As you wish.

107
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,440
PURE AND SPOTLESS

108
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,200
Her Majesty must have been pressed
by the Empress Dowager.

110
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,120
Have Li Hongqing look into every detail
about these noble ladies.

111
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,440
I want to know everything,
down to the smallest thing.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Your Majesty,

114
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,960
please don't be upset.

115
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
What would I be upset about?

116
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,920
I've heard His Majesty
chose Minister Xing's daughter

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,640
and plans to make her Noble Consort,

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,000
showering her with gifts every day.

119
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,680
Minister Xing's daughter?

120
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,360
They say, at court,

121
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,200
Minister Xing and the Grand Tutor

122
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
have never really seen eye to eye.

123
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,000
It doesn't matter.
As long as His Majesty is pleased.

124
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,600
Miss Xing Yiyi is gentle and sweet,

125
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,760
graceful and charming.

126
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
I like her very much.

127
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,600
What title
do you think I should grant her?

128
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,480
Since Your Majesty likes her,
you can decide that yourself.

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,960
I like her gentleness
and I like her grace.

130
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,320
Should I name her Consort Rou,
or Consort Wan instead?

131
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
If you like her that much…

132
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,679
how about
I just give her the Empress's seat?

133
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,600
You're quite mistaken.

134
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,919
The Empress's duty is to run the harem,
an exhausting task.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,760
How could I bear to let Miss Xing Yiyi
work herself so hard?

136
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,400
My dear, you're in a bad mood?

137
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,800
No need for you to worry.

138
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,840
If you're in a bad mood,
you could simply say so.

139
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,840
I won't take her in, then.

140
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
Don't you dare.
You should take her in quickly.

141
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,600
I still have a pile of harem affairs
to manage

142
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,080
and won't stay here to witness your bliss.

143
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,120
<i>Cangcang,</i>

144
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
<i>you do care about me after all.</i>

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,680
His Majesty chose Yiyi.

146
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,000
He really chose Yiyi?

147
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,200
Would I lie about that?

148
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,520
That Empress was furious.

149
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
This Xiao Huan…

150
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,280
I understand him less and less.

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,120
Perhaps His Majesty is simply tired
of that Ling father and daughter

152
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,240
and wants to lean toward your side.

153
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,600
Not necessarily.

154
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,080
The Empress has always
loved blades and spears,

155
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
headstrong and domineering.

156
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,680
Maybe it's Yiyi's gentle, sweet nature

157
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,280
that Xiao Huan favors more.

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,920
Whatever the reason,

159
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
it's a good thing in the end.

160
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Ling Cangcang really thinks

161
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
I don't see she's using this

162
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,880
to reclaim the Phoenix Seal?

163
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,080
She's digging her own grave.

164
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,160
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

165
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,280
Who says I'm angry?

166
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
They say Miss Xing excels
in every refined art,

167
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,200
with a slim waist, long legs,
and gifted in song and dance.

168
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,600
If she really enters the palace,
Your Majesty would…

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
In a few days, it'll be the Lotus Banquet
the Empress Dowager ordered.

170
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,840
They say she'll be granted a title
at the Lotus Banquet.

171
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,600
Xiaoshan,

172
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,000
go inform the Empress Dowager
that I've caught a chill,

173
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,200
and can't help her host the Lotus Banquet.

174
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,360
And also…

175
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,480
Come here.

176
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,960
Minister Xing,
your daughter is truly striking in looks.

178
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,640
My dear, what do you think
of Miss Yiyi's dancing?

179
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,560
Very good.

180
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,920
If Miss Yiyi enters the palace one day,

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,280
let her dance for us every day.

182
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,400
How about that?

183
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,800
You may enjoy that by yourself.

184
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,120
After all,

185
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
I've always liked blades and spears.

186
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,600
If I were to hurt Miss Yiyi by accident,
that would be awful.

187
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,120
Yiyi really is beautifully made,

188
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,240
talented and accomplished.

189
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
What do you say, Cangcang?

190
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,520
You're absolutely right.

191
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
Why don't we
let Miss Yiyi enter the palace sooner,

192
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,080
so she can keep His Majesty company
more often.

193
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,960
Minister Xing.

194
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,280
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Are you willing to part with her?

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
For Yiyi to receive Your Majesty's favor

196
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,400
is fortune beyond three lifetimes.

197
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,160
How would I dare say I'm unwilling?

198
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,480
In that case, there's no day like today.

199
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,480
Yiyi will stay in the palace tonight.

200
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,560
Wait!

201
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,560
Wait!

202
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,840
Who are you, daring to make a scene here?

203
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,920
I…

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
Yiyi and I already made a lifelong vow.

205
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,640
How outrageously bold…

206
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,800
Insolent wretch!
Who sent you to slander my daughter?

207
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,680
Your Majesty,
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager, I…

208
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,360
I don't even know this man!

209
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,480
Yiyi,

210
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,920
how can you be so heartless?

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,240
Which one of the skills you have
wasn't taught by me?

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,680
Shut up!

213
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
Your Majesty,

214
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,400
this is the Noble Consort
you chose so carefully?

215
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,880
Please, calm your anger.

216
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,160
Mother must have been overwhelmed
by all the harem affairs.

217
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,360
It's my fault too
for not easing her burdens sooner.

218
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,840
Your Majesty,

219
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,920
you've worked so hard
running the inner palace all these years.

220
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,520
Why not leave these matters
to the Empress?

221
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,560
At your age,

222
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,480
you deserve some peace and rest.

223
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,920
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager,
please spare me!

224
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,680
I'll do everything you say from now on.

225
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,400
<i>At court this morning,</i>

226
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,200
<i>Grand Tutor Ling</i>
<i>and others submitted memorials,</i>

227
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,480
saying a man slipped
into the royal banquet

228
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,680
and that you failed in your oversight.

229
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Since Xing Yiyi
was your personal recommendation,

230
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,360
with her conduct in question
and her dignity lost before all,

231
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,680
you cannot escape blame.

232
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,280
And…

233
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,200
Why are you stammering? Speak!

234
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Minister Xing had impeached you as well.

235
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Talk about everyone kicking you
when you're down.

236
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,120
He's just trying to wash his hands clean.

237
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,160
That old fox.

238
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

239
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,480
His Majesty has decreed today

240
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,360
that the Phoenix Seal be placed
in the Empress's care.

241
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,280
They…

242
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,160
they've already taken
the Phoenix Seal away.

243
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,080
What?

244
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,560
Satisfied now, my dear?

245
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,640
You knew my plan from the start,
that's why you chose Xing Yiyi?

246
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,920
What else?

247
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,640
Did you really think I actually liked her?

248
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,680
Whether you like her is your business,
nothing to do with me.

249
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,640
I had every candidate's background
thoroughly checked

250
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,960
before settling on Xing Yiyi.

251
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,280
Even if you hadn't picked her,
I had other ways.

252
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,240
Oh?

253
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600
What ways?

254
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,080
All the names I handed you
were filtered by me,

255
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,320
each with their own issues.

256
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,000
So you're saying

257
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,760
you never meant to choose consorts
for me at all?

258
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,800
Whether you take consorts isn't the point.

259
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,640
What matters is

260
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,079
I've finally got the Phoenix Seal.

261
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
You care that much about the Phoenix Seal?

262
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,920
Only with it in my hand

263
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,560
can I do what I need to do.

264
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,880
Your Majesty, please save me!

265
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm…

266
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
I'm already carrying a child.

267
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
You're carrying a child

268
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
and still dare to dream of marrying
into the throne?

269
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,040
You insisted I enter the palace.

270
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,720
You said back then

271
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,400
if I came in to spy
on His Majesty for you,

272
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,080
you'd see the Xing clan
rise high and smooth.

273
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,120
That still doesn't excuse you
for such deceit and betrayal!

274
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,120
Please, calm your anger.

275
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,400
It was all my negligence.
Please punish me instead.

276
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,280
Get up.

277
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,080
At this point, blame won't help us.

278
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,720
It's all my fault

279
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,400
for underestimating that Ling Cangcang.

280
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,320
You're right.

281
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,880
Miss Xing,

282
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
we were all tricked by the Empress.

283
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,760
She only ever meant to use you
to snatch back the Phoenix Seal.

284
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
She let Zhou slip in too.

285
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,960
She's the one

286
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,440
who drove you to this state.

287
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,280
The Empress Dowager spared your life

288
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,120
so you could seize this last chance.

289
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,000
An eye for an eye,

290
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,600
a tooth for a tooth.

291
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,520
Make the one who ruined you

292
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,720
pay the price.

293
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Child,

294
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,520
don't let me down again.

295
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,720
LINGHE HALL

296
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,200
<i>Your Majesty, all the Lingbi Sect files</i>
<i>are stored in the Inner Archive.</i>

297
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,960
Let's go.

298
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,320
INNER ARCHIVE

299
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

300
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,760
Your Majesty,

301
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,600
there are over
eighty thousand dossiers here.

302
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,560
What you seek
really won't be easy to find.

303
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
Are you trying

304
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
to mislead me?

305
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,240
Forgive me, Your Majesty. I wouldn't dare!

306
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,120
Then you'd better talk fast.

307
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,680
If I report to His Majesty
that you offended me,

308
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,000
I can't guarantee you'll like the outcome.

309
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,640
Please, don't be angry!

310
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,560
In answer to Your Majesty,

311
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,160
Commander Li came here yesterday

312
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
and took the dossiers.

313
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,680
He also took a…

314
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,880
a coffin.

315
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,400
A coffin…

316
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,480
INNER ARCHIVE

317
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,760
Your Majesty,

318
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,440
shall we return to Linghe Hall?

319
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,880
You may go back first.
I'll walk by myself for a while.

320
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

321
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,840
Xiao Huan must have known

322
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,840
I'd use the Phoenix Seal
to enter the Inner Archive.

323
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,200
So he moved what I wanted ahead of time.

324
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,040
And that thing

325
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,280
is a coffin.

326
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,960
<i>Moon-Eclipse is the Ghost King's token</i>

327
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>and can be planted in a human heart.</i>

328
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,480
Perhaps, Master's body

329
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,040
lies in that coffin,

330
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,560
with Moon-Eclipse

331
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,920
still inside him?

332
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,640
<i>What's wrong, Master?</i>

333
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,960
The Ghost King is dangerous.

334
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,880
That Ghost King's
committed countless atrocities

335
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,280
and harmed so many people.

336
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,440
None of this
is something you should meddle in.

337
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,440
Remember this:

338
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
in this world,

339
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,480
the only one who's wholly good to you

340
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,840
is your father.

341
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,000
Even I, your master,
you mustn't trust completely.

342
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,760
Master…

343
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,440
are you really the Ghost King?

344
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,840
No way…

345
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,360
That's impossible.

346
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,040
- It was you.
- I'll kill you!

347
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,280
Listen.

348
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,840
Before you ever entered the palace,
I'd already planned a way out for you.

349
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,320
You can choose to stay,

350
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,960
or I can send you out of the palace

351
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,880
to live freely with the man you love.

352
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,320
- Really?
- Of course.

353
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
That was part of my plan all along.

354
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,160
Now that I hold the Phoenix Seal,

355
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,360
one decree from me
and no one will dare stop you leaving.

356
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,640
They will never let you
walk out of here alive.

357
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,080
Why not?

358
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,920
Because

359
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,640
they

360
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,320
want you dead!

361
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,560
That useless girl,

362
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,080
good for nothing and only making trouble.

363
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,320
Please, calm your anger.

364
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,120
At least Xing Yiyi had the sense

365
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
to die at the Empress's hand.

366
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,040
Send word to Minister Xing

367
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,440
that the Empress punished Xing Yiyi
for disrupting the harem

368
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,000
and had her tortured to death.

369
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

370
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,640
Ling Cangcang, you little brat,

371
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,760
how could you ever be a match for me?

372
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,000
We'll see who comes to save you this time.

373
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
WUYING HALL

374
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,520
Your Majesty,

375
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,440
Minister Xing is kneeling
outside the hall,

376
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,280
saying Xing Yiyi died miserably
in the palace.

377
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,840
He begs Your Majesty to clear her name.

378
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,160
Send him back.

379
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,880
Tell him I'll handle it.

380
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,000
<i>They will never let you</i>
<i>walk out of here alive.</i>

382
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,120
They

383
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,040
want you dead!

384
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,080
Your Majesty, Eunuch Feng is here.

385
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

386
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,000
I bear an oral decree from His Majesty.

387
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,280
His Majesty asks you to hand
over the Phoenix Seal.

388
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,000
What? Hand over the Phoenix Seal?

389
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,400
I'm only here to pass
on His Majesty's words.

390
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,080
PURE AND SPOTLESS

391
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,280
Why must I hand over the Phoenix Seal?

392
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,400
Do you know

393
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
that these
are all memorials impeaching you?

394
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,400
This was all arranged
by the Empress Dowager.

395
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,920
She ordered Xing Yiyi to kill me,
never intending to let her live.

396
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,840
- I'm well aware of that.
- And you still do this?

397
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,720
This is the palace, not the martial world.

398
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,080
The palace is an arena of power,

399
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,960
not a place for weighing right and wrong.

400
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,360
So Xing Yiyi dies
without the truth, just like that?

401
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,600
Is a human life

402
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,000
nothing more than a tool
to seize the Phoenix Seal?

403
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,200
Hand over the Phoenix Seal first.

404
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,520
When this blows over,
I'll give it back to you.

405
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,720
You want me to hand it over

406
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,480
because they've impeached me,

407
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,200
or you can't bear me

408
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,720
walking freely through the palace

409
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
with the Phoenix Seal?

410
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,560
What are you implying?

411
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,240
You know very well.

412
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I did move your master's body.

413
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,680
I didn't want you to find it.

414
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,320
But it was also because

415
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,240
I didn't want you dragged into this.

416
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,240
My Begonia Pendant glows

417
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,280
whenever it's near poison.

418
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
When it was close to my master's body,
it glowed.

419
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,880
Is it because his body

420
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,680
was hiding Moon-Eclipse?

421
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,160
Did you already know

422
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,760
he was the Ghost King,

423
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
and kill him for that?

424
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
<i>Cangcang,</i>

425
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,320
<i>there was more to your master</i>
<i>than just being the Ghost King.</i>

426
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,520
So moving his body

427
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,600
was also to stop Moon-Eclipse
from harming the world?

428
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,920
Is that it?

429
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,240
Answer me.

430
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,440
- I gave your master my word.
- He had no right to decide for me!

431
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,400
And neither do you.

432
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,320
Fine.

433
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
I'll take you somewhere now.

434
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,400
Master… Master…

435
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,200
Yes. It's your master.

436
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,800
It's my master.

437
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,960
Master…

438
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,680
Why did you lie to me?

439
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,560
Why?

440
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,600
Why are you the Ghost King?

441
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,640
Cangcang,

442
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,040
I killed him because I had no choice.

443
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,800
Because he was the Ghost King,

444
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,000
that was

445
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,040
why you approached me from the start,

446
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,640
used me

447
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,080
and lied to me?

448
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,480
You say you had no choice,

449
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,040
tossing out those few words so lightly.

450
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,800
But do you know

451
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,720
that I've endured

452
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,800
this heart-rending pain,

453
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,640
day and night,

454
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,000
with no relief at all?

455
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,760
Do you think I don't hurt too?

456
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
You hurt?

457
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,680
Every time I see you sad and in pain,

458
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,680
see you misunderstanding me, hating me,

459
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,520
it hurts every time.

460
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
Cangcang,

461
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,520
in this position,

462
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,800
I truly have no say most of the time.

463
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Then keep hurting.

464
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,200
And let me go on hating you.

465
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,400
You're the one

466
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,840
who, from the very start,

467
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,520
only ever lied to me and used me.

468
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,720
Cangcang,

469
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,200
I've always been sincere with you.

470
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Sincere?

471
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,200
What counts as sincerity?

472
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,400
Even Master

473
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,000
I was closest to and trusted most

474
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,520
was lying to me.

475
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,640
In this world,

476
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,440
who else can I trust?

477
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,600
Master,

478
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,520
tell me…

479
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,800
in this world,

480
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,280
who can I still believe in?

481
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,800
Tell your disciple,

482
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,159
who

483
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
can I still trust?

484
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,400
<i>Cangcang,</i>

485
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,960
<i>believe it or not, it's up to you.</i>

486
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,320
<i>But I will spend this life</i>

487
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,120
<i>giving everything to shield you</i>

488
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,880
<i>and keep you safe and sound.</i>

489
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,680
Father, Cangcang saw Li Lu's body.

490
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
It seems Moon-Eclipse is still in him.

491
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,520
Other than that,
what else did Cangcang find?

492
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,120
I don't know.

493
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
Sound Cangcang out for me.

494
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,760
Find out how far she's gotten

495
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,240
with Li Lu's case.

496
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,320
Understood.

497
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,960
Your Majesty.

498
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
You may go.

499
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,880
Your Majesty,

500
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,720
Heaven rewards the diligent.

501
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Our people have finally caught something
on the Empress.

502
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,920
CHANGYUE TAVERN

503
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,680
XIJIANG MOON

504
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,360
Cangcang.

505
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,680
Cangcang, why not meet at the Ling Manor?

506
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,840
Did he forbid you to go home?

507
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,720
I just don't want to worry Father.

508
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,280
Have a seat now.

509
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Master

510
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,360
really was the Ghost King.

511
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,000
If that's true,

512
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,000
then the Sword Cottage incident
wasn't a frame-up.

513
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,000
Are you sure?

514
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,840
I saw Master's body.

515
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,880
Moon-Eclipse really is inside him.

516
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,400
So Xiao Huan hid the body

517
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,760
because of Moon-Eclipse.

518
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,280
He only didn't want it
falling into the wrong hands.

519
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,040
Cangcang,
how can you take his word for it?

520
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,760
If you ask me,
you still need to find a way

521
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,600
to get Moon-Eclipse in your own hands.

522
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,360
If that booklet is telling the truth,

523
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,960
then in your pendant is Wanwei Herb,

524
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,680
the perfect vessel for Moon-Eclipse.

525
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,440
Cangcang,

526
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
this concerns the lives
of people across the land.

527
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,800
You must think it through.

528
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,240
You mean he covets Moon-Eclipse,

529
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,480
- rather than…?
- Cangcang,

530
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,680
just because Mr. Li Lu is the Ghost King,

531
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,040
you're going to forgive him again?

532
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,280
I'm not.

533
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,520
I have thought he might have had no choice
about killing Master,

534
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,440
but lying to me

535
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,240
and using me to get close to Master,
that was his own choice.

536
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,080
I…

537
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,200
I don't know…

538
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,240
I don't know who I can trust anymore.

539
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,560
Even Master lied to me.

540
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,720
Can I trust you?

541
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,880
You've never lied to me, right, Luo?

542
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,800
Of course not.

543
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,800
Cangcang, have you forgotten?

544
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,800
My life was saved by you and Father.

545
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,720
How could I ever lie to you?

546
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,480
How is Father?

547
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,480
Aside from worrying
that you're being bullied in the palace,

548
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,680
he's fine.

549
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,040
At least I still have you and Father.

550
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,720
Cangcang,

551
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,280
even if Father keeps saying

552
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,040
you should hold tight
to the Empress's seat,

553
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,760
you must think it through.

554
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,240
Remember how he tricked you
in Southern Chu and used you.

555
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,080
Don't let him cloud your judgment again.

556
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,320
- Here we are! Come with me!
- Yes!

557
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,440
Find them!

558
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
Officers…

559
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,920
Aunt Chan?

560
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,920
Palace guards on royal orders!

561
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,880
How did she find this place?

562
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,440
Your Majesty,

563
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,600
the Empress Dowager
heard you left the palace without leave

564
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,280
and sent this maid
to remind you of the rules.

565
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,000
I brought the Empress out to drink tea.

566
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,800
Do I now need
the Empress Dowager's permission as well?

567
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,080
This maid deserves death!
This maid deserves death!

568
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,840
For disturbing our pleasant outing,
you certainly do.

569
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,520
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

570
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,120
- Forgive me, Your Majesty…
- Get lost!

571
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,200
I'll deal with your offense back
at the palace.

572
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,200
Why did you come here?

574
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,800
I heard Aunt Chan had brought guards here

575
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,640
and came out of curiosity.

576
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,560
I didn't expect to run into you.

577
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,720
Their tea and snacks are good.
I came to try them.

578
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,600
Drinking tea alone,

579
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,840
yet two cups on the table?

580
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,400
Since you know I'm not here alone,

581
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,440
why cover for me?

582
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,520
I told you I'd keep you safe.

583
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,680
Since I'm rarely
out of the palace incognito,

584
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,000
why not stroll around with me?

585
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,560
Watch this!

586
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,200
Look at that!

587
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,280
Lanterns!

588
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,240
Lanterns!

589
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,800
Take a look, miss.

590
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,880
Fireworks!

591
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,280
Honey puffs! Fresh honey puffs!

592
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,040
Try before you buy! Cheap and tasty!

593
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,920
These are from our Yuan family,
made with our secret recipe!

594
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,200
Come have a taste!

595
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,760
Honey puffs!

596
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,320
Come on, sir, have a bite!

597
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,280
YUAN'S HONEY CAKE SHOP

598
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,520
Sir, one serving of honey puffs.

599
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,040
- Got it.
- Pack one piece separately for me.

600
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,040
Sure.

601
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,680
- Please try it.
- All right.

602
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,360
Come catch me!

603
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,040
Here. Have a taste.

604
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,920
All right. Thank you.

605
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,920
- You're too kind, sir.
- So sweet.

606
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,040
This was my favorite treat as a child.

607
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,400
Why?

608
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,480
I had a cold sickness growing up.

609
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,120
When my mother was alive,

610
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,000
every time she gave me medicine,
she'd give me a piece of honey puff too.

611
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,840
No matter how bitter the medicine was,

612
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,960
as long as there was honey puff,
all I could taste was sweetness.

613
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,080
But I've hardly ever seen it
in the palace.

614
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,040
After my mother died, I swore off sweets.

615
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,880
I wanted to remember that bitterness

616
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,560
and remind myself never to slack off.

617
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,680
But later,

618
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,320
when I tasted your pear blossom honey,

619
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,480
I realized

620
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,560
sweetness still beats bitterness
after all.
