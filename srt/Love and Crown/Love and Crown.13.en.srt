ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
"MY QUEEN" BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,400
General. The darn emperor's
reinforcements have arrived.

3
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,560
JIANGZHOU

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Retreat ten li!

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,920
Retreat ten li!

6
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
Jueding.

7
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
Jueding. How is it?

8
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
- Leave.
- Yes.

9
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,320
Is it serious?

10
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
You're being reckless.

11
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,680
As the empress,
you should stay in the palace.

12
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,960
How can you come to such a place?

13
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,400
How dare you mention that?

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,920
I heard the situation
in Jiangzhou is critical.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you know how worried I am about you?

16
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,320
Regarding your arrival in Jiangzhou today,

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
did Father and His Majesty know?
Could they rest assured?

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
I didn't tell Father.
As for the other one,

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,320
it's better not to tell him.

20
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,960
Did he bully you?

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,520
His Majesty has always been calculating.

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,760
I know

23
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,840
he wants to use
you to achieve direct rule.

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,760
He doesn't care about your safety at all.

25
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,760
None of that matters now.

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,880
Sit.

27
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,080
What matters
is I can now confirm you're safe.

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,600
Otherwise, how could I rest easy
staying in the palace?

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,280
Cangcang.

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,240
I know you want to
roam the martial world alone,

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
being free and carefree.

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
If it weren't for the Ling family
or for Father,

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,280
how would you have
been coerced by Xiao Huan?

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,760
When I learned you were to marry him,

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
I thought about returning to the Capital,

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
but that Xiao Huan wouldn't let me.

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Orders are orders.
Without imperial decree, I cannot return.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
But if I had known
today would turn out like this,

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,480
I would have risked my life
to bring you out of that cage.

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Jueding has really grown up.

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
You even worry about me now.

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,680
But what you just said

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,840
is beyond our control.
No need to blame yourself.

44
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,640
Very well.

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
Since you've come to Jiangzhou,

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
stay safely in the camp.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
Don't run around.

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,200
I'll send someone to escort you back soon.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,320
I won't go back.

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,040
Do you even remember who you are?

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,920
- I…
- Jiangzhou's situation is grim.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,240
If anything happens to you,
how could I explain to Father?

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,840
You rushed to
the battlefield to save me earlier.

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
Just as reckless as before.

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
But if something happens,

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,120
- how am I supposed to handle it?
- Jueding.

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm
no longer a weak woman needing protection.

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
Although I'm not
an expert in military strategy,

59
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,320
I know a bit.

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,760
Jiangzhou's situation is dire.

61
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,839
You urgently need manpower.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,079
- I must stay and help you.
- But…

63
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,440
No discussion.

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,480
Jiangzhou is dangerous.

65
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,440
But fortunately, reinforcements are here.

66
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
They can temporarily
hold back Kumor's army.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,720
I've analyzed Kumor's army's
positions and terrain

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,960
and have some speculations.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Your Majesty. Victory at Jiangzhou.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,600
Reinforcements have reached Jiangzhou.

71
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Kumor's forces have retreated ten li.

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
Xiaoxing Guards
reported back with intelligence.

73
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,520
Kumor is assembling his troops,
planning a counterattack.

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,280
He's always ruthless and cold-blooded.

75
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,480
But my collected intelligence

76
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
regarding his personal habits is limited.

77
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,640
It seems

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,720
my plans must be advanced.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,840
JIANGZHOU

80
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,120
Sir.

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
What is it? Speak.

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,840
Sir. I've received news

83
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,240
Young Lady has arrived in
Jiangzhou with the westbound army.

84
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,200
Currently, she is in General Ling's camp.

85
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,480
Her Majesty has traveled west,

86
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,160
yet I had no knowledge of it.

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
I deserve punishment.

88
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,560
Sir. The palace publicly claims

89
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
that Her Majesty is
recuperating at the outer palace,

90
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,640
but Li Hongqing has
sealed it off completely.

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,160
My men can't gather any information.

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,200
Nor did we know Young Lady is
with the westbound reinforcements.

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,480
Please punish me.

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
You may leave.

95
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,320
Yes. Thank you.

96
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
Stay calm.

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,160
General Ling has already
gathered supplies for everyone,

98
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,200
ensuring that every
citizen in Jiangzhou receives food.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,440
- Good!
- Good!

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,000
Line up. Everyone will get a share.

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
- Thank you.
- Don't rush. Everyone will get a share.

102
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,040
Thank you.

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,880
It's the year of famine.

104
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,080
Food is scarce everywhere.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
You distribute food to
the people of Jiangzhou.

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,720
You're indeed
an excellent general of Great Qi.

107
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,520
Cangcang. Stop praising me.

108
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,520
- Let's hand out the food together.
- Line up.

109
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
Alright.

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,360
QI

111
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
The westbound reinforcements' supplies

112
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,080
can only temporarily
ease Jiangzhou's crisis.

113
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
The imperial grain shipments

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,400
will take at least another half month.

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,000
So, we need to consider other solutions.

116
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
With the Xijiang snow disaster,
Kumor is also short of supplies.

117
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,200
If Kumor runs out of supplies,

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,200
will he have to retreat?

119
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
What do you mean?

120
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
During war,

121
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
both armies will
always set up key supply points.

122
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,080
We might as well make use of it
and kill two birds with one stone.

123
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,200
Look.

124
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,920
This is Jiangzhou City.
This is Kumor's camp.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,560
Kumor's Black Tiger Army

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,320
charged toward
Jiangzhou City with unstoppable momentum.

127
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Smooth and unhindered.

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
But to their east lies
dense forest and swamp.

129
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,240
Behind them is Qianlai Valley.

130
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,760
Qianlai Valley is
known for its bottleneck terrain.

131
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,280
The mountains on both
sides aren't high, but they're steep.

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
Kumor's tactics are cunning.

133
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,240
They chose this terrain

134
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,400
to prevent ambushes.

135
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,280
And they can fall back and defend.

136
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
But Qianlai Valley's
mountain paths are extremely difficult.

137
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,920
It's not a suitable place for
storing or transporting military supplies.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,160
Moreover,

139
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
the valley sits against
the mountains and by the water.

140
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,040
Are you saying

141
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,520
they traveled by water to Sand City,

142
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,160
and Sand City is their key supply point?

143
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
It's possible.

144
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
If it's their vital point,
it'll be heavily guarded.

145
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,200
Our army won't be
able to take it so easily.

146
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,720
Our goal isn't to take over Sand City,

147
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
but to seize their grain supplies.

148
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,200
<i>I can lead a night raid on Sand City.</i>

149
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
SAND CITY

150
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
<i>We'll catch them off guard.</i>

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
<i>If we manage to seize the grain,</i>

152
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,679
<i>not only will the people in the city</i>
<i>and the soldiers get a breather,</i>

153
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,200
<i>but it may also help end the war quickly.</i>

154
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
You control the others.

155
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,320
You come with me to find the main house.

156
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
- Yes.
- Let's go.

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,760
Spare me, Sir. Spare me.

158
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,800
Fix your clothes.

159
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,880
- You're kind-hearted.
- Cut the nonsense.

160
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,640
Where is your commanding general?
Tell me, and I'll spare your life.

161
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,400
I don't know.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,520
Kumor suffered a defeat.

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,640
As soon as the sun
set, he took people away,

164
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,000
saying they had important
military matters to discuss.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
And who are you?

166
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
My name is Minmin.

167
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
They abducted me.

168
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,800
I… I don't know anything.

169
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
How am I supposed to know

170
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,040
you're not lying to me?

171
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,400
They gave me these whip marks.

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,680
I've been living in hell every day.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Thank god you came.

174
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
Take me with you.

175
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,760
Commander. We're running out of time.

176
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,240
If Black Tiger Army finds out
something is off with Sand City,

177
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
forget transporting supplies,
we won't even get out alive.

178
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,400
I know where this city's grain is stored,
but I have one condition.

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,120
If you find the grain,

180
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
you must take me with you.

181
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,280
How is the situation?

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,920
We've basically secured everyone here.

183
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Good. Leave a few men to watch them.

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
- The rest, come with me.
- Yes.

185
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Sir.

186
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,880
Can I at least have a sip of water?

187
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,040
Your Highness. Are you alright?

188
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,080
Do I look alright to you?
A bunch of useless fools.

189
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,160
If I hadn't improvised on the spot
and fooled them,

190
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,800
I, the commander of Sand City,

191
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,840
would've become
the joke of Black Tiger Army.

192
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,760
Yes.

193
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
Your Highness. What should we do now?

194
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,080
Go.

195
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,680
Release the refugees we locked up.

196
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
<i>- Tell them they have food now.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

197
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,280
<i>This grain was way too easy to get.</i>

198
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,760
<i>Kumor suffered a defeat.</i>

199
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,080
<i>As soon as the sun</i>
<i>set, he took people away,</i>

200
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,520
<i>saying they had important</i>
<i>military matters to discuss.</i>

201
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,960
My name is Minmin.

202
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,720
They abducted me.

203
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,760
I… I don't know anything.

204
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,640
<i>I know where this city's grain is stored,</i>

205
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,080
but I have one condition.

206
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,560
<i>Something's off with that woman.</i>

207
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,440
All soldiers, listen up!

208
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,440
Take the grain and evacuate immediately!

209
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,840
Yes!

210
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
Quick, keep up!

211
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Why can't we see
which direction the tracks go?

212
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,240
Could it be they sensed it beforehand?

213
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,440
Move.

214
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,880
- Where's the grain?
- It's all gone.

215
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,000
- What happened?
- How is everything gone?

216
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
Yes.

217
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,040
Looks like they already knew. Retreat.

218
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,760
Sir. You scared me.

219
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,520
We meet again. Sand City Lord.

220
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,400
You're quite clever.

221
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,840
May I ask where I slipped up?

222
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
Your whip marks.

223
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,280
I heard noise last night.

224
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,040
Knowing I couldn't escape,

225
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,720
I quickly whipped myself a few times.

226
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,760
Just enough, not too heavy.

227
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,920
And I usually use a long whip.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,680
So having old marks is unavoidable.

229
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Yes.

230
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
At first, your mix of old and new marks
did fool me.

231
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,720
After all,

232
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,280
a woman as pretty as you

233
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,200
is hard not to sympathize with.

234
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,560
But you still held back too much.

235
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,440
Some marks were too fresh.

236
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,280
And your room
was decorated far too femininely.

237
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,080
So you hid the direction of the tracks,

238
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,480
keeping us from finding the grain.

239
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,200
You think you can stall us?

240
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,480
Ask my whip if it agrees.

241
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,080
Don't come closer.

242
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,240
One more step and I'll kill her.

243
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,880
Stop him.
I'll give you three days' worth of food.

244
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,760
Don't come closer. Back off!

245
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,960
To them,

246
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,720
you're just meat
that can fill a starving wolf.

247
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,920
They won't let go.

248
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,320
You're kind-hearted,

249
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,040
so will you kill these refugees to escape

250
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,600
or surrender?

251
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,040
Who are you? Ling Jueding's subordinate?

252
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Do you know the punishment
for stealing military grain?

253
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,760
You seem bold and shrewd.
And you fight well.

254
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Why don't you work for me?

255
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,920
Maybe I can persuade
my brother to spare you.

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,520
You have quite the temper.

257
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,800
But I'd like to see
if you're still this tough

258
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,120
when you meet my brother.

259
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,480
Winning and losing are part of war.

260
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,760
I just want that darn emperor
to feel miserable.

261
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,160
Here.

262
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,480
A toast to General.

263
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,840
Kumor.

264
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,320
Sand City's grain has been seized.

265
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,480
- What?
- Bring him over.

266
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,800
It's him.

267
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
He led the raid to steal the grain.

268
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,839
This guy looks familiar.

269
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,840
I remember now.

270
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,040
You shot an arrow at me
on the day of the siege.

271
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,760
You've got guts.

272
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,920
How dare you steal my rations?

273
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
You're about to die,
yet you can still smile?

274
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,880
If one life

275
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,280
can force a general
to run out of supplies,

276
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,680
- it's worth it.
- You…

277
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
If you can tell me where the grain is…

278
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,760
I suppose it's
already in Jiangzhou's camp.

279
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,720
Drag him away.

280
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,120
Kill him and use him as
a sacrifice to the war flag.

281
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,680
Yes.

282
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,920
Your Majesty. Are you alright?

283
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm fine.

284
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,280
I just had a nightmare.

285
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,440
PURE AND SPOTLESS

286
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,680
Speaking of,

287
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,800
Why is today's battle report
still not here?

288
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,880
I'll urge Commander Li again.

289
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,480
Bring all Great Qi prisoners.

290
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,320
Kill them as sacrifice to the war flag.

291
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,480
Yes!

292
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,520
Wait!

293
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,520
I'm the one who stole your grain.

294
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,320
You should kill me first.

295
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,160
Winners rule, losers fall.

296
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,600
You've fallen into my hands.

297
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,880
What right do you have to negotiate?

298
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,680
One takes responsibility
for what they've done.

299
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
This whole grain raid
had nothing to do with them.

300
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,280
I've long heard General Kumor was brave.

301
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,600
Could it be

302
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,520
you're just a coward
who slaughters innocents?

303
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,120
Since you have a death wish,

304
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,360
I'll personally send you on your way.

305
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,200
Good. Again!

306
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,160
<i>Phoenix Seal?</i>

307
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>Why would Phoenix Seal be on me?</i>

308
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,680
So you're a woman.

309
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,160
EMPRESS'S SEAL

310
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,360
Keep a close eye on her.

311
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,880
Kumor. What about the sacrifice?

312
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,680
We're not doing it.

313
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm keeping this woman.

314
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,280
Then… What about the grain?

315
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,480
With this generous gift
from Emperor of Great Qi,

316
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,880
why would we fear lacking grain?

317
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,560
I fear even this war

318
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,240
may soon come to an end.

319
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,440
What you're holding isn't mine.
Don't overthink it.

320
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,160
- Take her away!
- Yes!

321
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,800
EMPRESS'S SEAL

322
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
Your Majesty.

323
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,280
The battle report has arrived.
There's also a letter from Kumor.

324
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,960
YOUR EMPRESS IS IN MY HANDS.

325
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,920
EMPRESS'S SEAL

326
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,880
Your Majesty. What happened?

327
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,280
The Empress's Phoenix Seal.

328
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,800
Your Majesty, rest assured.

329
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,280
If Kumor saw Phoenix Seal,

330
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,040
he would never dare harm Her Majesty.

331
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,280
Kumor thinks

332
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,040
capturing my empress gives him a chance.

333
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,320
I would like to see clearly

334
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,240
whether this is my downfall

335
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,880
or Xijiang's turning point.

336
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,760
Your Majesty.

337
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,040
When the palace gates opened this morning,

338
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,880
Grand Tutor Ling is
already waiting outside the hall.

339
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,200
He said he has urgent matters to discuss.

340
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,400
Should we summon him in?

341
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,440
Prepare to go to Nanrong Palace.

342
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,800
Your Majesty.
You didn't sleep at all last night.

343
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,640
Should you rest for a while first?

344
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,560
No need.

345
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,520
My time is running out.

346
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,840
Preceptor Du.

347
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
You're distracted.

348
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,120
Your board is a bit chaotic.

349
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
I'm most apprehensive.

350
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,920
It's your move.

351
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,360
I heard

352
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,880
Ling Xuefeng is already

353
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,560
waiting outside
Wuying Hall for Your Majesty this morning.

354
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,040
There must be emergency
military news from Jiangzhou.

355
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,720
Yet Your Majesty

356
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,040
came to play chess with me instead.

357
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,000
Kumor has captured my empress.

358
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
The empress?

359
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,760
Her Majesty is the empress.

360
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,440
She fell into enemy hands.

361
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,320
The war situation is unsettled.

362
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,560
One wrong move,

363
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,600
and everything is lost.

364
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,280
What do you think?

365
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
How should I play this move?

366
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm dull-witted. I dare not speak rashly.

367
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,360
I intend to go to Xijiang myself

368
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,600
and negotiate with Kumor.

369
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,880
What do you think?

370
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,920
No.

371
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,440
This empire's fate
rests entirely on Your Majesty.

372
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,200
You must not leave
the palace at such a time.

373
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,320
Going alone into danger

374
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,360
will cause unthinkable consequences.

375
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,120
In your opinion, who would be suitable?

376
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
If Your Majesty wishes for peace talks

377
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,000
to save Jiangzhou,

378
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,720
the envoy
must hold status and authority in court.

379
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,960
Grand Tutor Ling has
been waiting outside the hall,

380
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,280
and Xiao Qianqing is in the Capital.

381
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,640
If Grand Tutor Ling goes,

382
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,920
whether it's out of
concern for his daughter

383
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,920
or to protect
Ling Jueding's command in Jiangzhou,

384
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,200
it would harm the interests of Great Qi.

385
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,600
Xiao Qianqing is ambitious and ruthless.

386
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,560
If he colludes with Kumor

387
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,920
and Jiangzhou falls,
Your Majesty's life would be in danger.

388
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,400
I, Du Tingxin, am willing to
serve as the imperial envoy to Xijiang

389
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,720
to go on Your Majesty's
behalf to the rebel's camp

390
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,320
and negotiate with Kumor.

391
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,600
You're righteous
to resolve the crisis for me.

392
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,160
Before you depart,

393
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,640
I wish to request something.

394
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,040
Everything I have
was given by Your Majesty.

395
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Whatever you desire,

396
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,800
I will give
whatever I have without hesitation.

397
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,120
Yushu Pill.

398
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,280
Yushu Pill?

399
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,440
Yushu Pill is potent.

400
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,680
While it can forcibly
suppress cold poison,

401
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,520
it's only temporary.

402
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,360
- It may even accelerate…
- I know

403
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,680
it could hasten my death.

404
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,800
But Great Qi is facing
internal and external crises.

405
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,200
I must endure this period.

406
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,560
I cannot afford any mistakes.

407
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,000
If my body suffers any mishap,

408
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,240
do you think
Ling Xuefeng and Xiao Qianqing

409
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,520
will spare me?

410
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Since you know,

411
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,200
why

412
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,880
give the life-saving
medicine to Her Majesty?

413
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,560
Preceptor Du.

414
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,680
You've overstepped.

415
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,800
Rise.

416
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,400
I know you've always been loyal to me.

417
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,240
In that case,

418
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,160
give me Yushu Pill.

419
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,360
During this period,
you must not use inner force.

420
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,800
I will do my utmost

421
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,520
to find a cure for you.

422
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,920
If the poison reaches the heart,

423
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,960
I fear even I can't do anything.

424
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,080
Very well.

425
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,240
Your Majesty.

426
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,200
I'm fine.

427
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,600
You need not worry.

428
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,360
This time,

429
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,560
your mission to Xijiang

430
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,600
must succeed.

431
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,320
How long has Grand Tutor been waiting?

432
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,960
Your Majesty.
It has already been three hours.

433
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,960
Very well.

434
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,840
Let him continue to wait.

435
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,520
Shi Yan.

436
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,160
Take Xiaoxing Guards to Xijiang

437
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,400
and find a way
to investigate Kumor's camp.

438
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,520
Search for any trace of the Empress.

439
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,840
Leave no clue unexamined.

440
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,640
Yes.

441
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,720
WUYING HALL

442
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,720
You're in such a hurry to see me.
What's the matter?

443
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,240
Your Majesty.

444
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,840
Her Majesty has been
recuperating at the outer palace for days.

445
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm very concerned and wish to visit her.

446
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,400
I hope you will grant permission.

447
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,640
The Empress's
condition has worsened recently,

448
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,840
making it inconvenient for visitors.

449
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,240
Is it inconvenient or impossible?

450
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,640
Why do you say so?

451
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,120
Have you heard some rumor?

452
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,480
Since Your Majesty

453
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,520
does not wish to discuss the Empress,

454
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,640
I won't press the matter.

455
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,320
I suddenly remembered

456
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,320
when Your Majesty suddenly fell ill

457
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,719
before ascending the throne,

458
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,000
and the Empress Dowager
urgently summoned me to the palace.

459
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,560
I know this,

460
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,199
but the Empress Dowager
had already concluded

461
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,120
that I was incapable

462
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,560
and tried to recruit you

463
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,719
to depose me

464
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,639
and make Xiao Qianqing emperor.

465
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,000
These old events are not worth mentioning.

466
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,920
What I wish to tell you

467
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,960
is something

468
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,520
unknown to you.

469
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,719
Somehow,

470
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,679
Cangcang hid in my sedan chair

471
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,880
and entered the palace with me.

472
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,440
By some twist of fate,

473
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,719
she sneaked into
Your Majesty's bedchamber.

474
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,400
You're the emperor
ascending the throne tomorrow?

475
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,840
How hot.

476
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,240
Cold. It's cold.

477
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,120
Is this better?

478
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,880
Do you feel better?

479
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,440
- Am I going to die?
- You won't die.

480
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,200
Have you forgotten?
You're ascending the throne tomorrow.

481
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,320
Really?

482
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,840
Can I really ascend the throne?

483
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,760
Of course.

484
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,920
You're the chosen one,

485
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,280
destined to be the emperor of Great Qi.

486
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,760
With a sweeping gesture of your sleeves,

487
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,120
you rule the world

488
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,520
and command respect from all sides.

489
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,600
Rule the world

490
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,840
and command respect from all sides.

491
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,320
Later, I finally found Cangcang.

492
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,920
On the way home,

493
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
she told me

494
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,440
you're the chosen one.

495
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,280
I had been hesitating.

496
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,680
Upon hearing this,

497
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,120
I suddenly

498
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,400
became determined
and believed that the two of you

499
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,640
are a match made in heaven.

500
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,880
I never expected

501
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
you share such
a deep bond with your daughter.

502
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,920
Even your decision to support me

503
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,720
was because of a playful
remark the Empress made in her youth.

504
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,040
If the Empress hadn't been poisoned,

505
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,320
and the poison

506
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,440
wasn't coincidentally
in the pear blossom honey you sent,

507
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
I would have almost…

508
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,160
almost been moved by your fatherly love.

509
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Your Majesty.

510
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,520
Why such suspicion?

511
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Grand Tutor.

512
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,640
I'm your student.

513
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,680
You need not pretend

514
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,440
in front of me.

515
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,760
I no longer want to guess

516
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,400
how much of your love for you daughter

517
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,640
is genuine

518
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,560
and how much is mixed with ambition.

519
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,280
But I know you value

520
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,360
command of the Jiangzhou army
more than the Empress's life.

521
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,080
Ling Jueding is
straightforward and forthright.

522
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,360
If he knew his sister
was trapped in enemy territory,

523
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,320
he might risk everything
and lead troops to save her.

524
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,880
The ministers at court
are all keeping an eye on Jiangzhou's war.

525
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,160
If he makes even a single mistake,

526
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,240
he could lose his position as general.

527
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Do you

528
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,160
have no genuine
feeling for Her Majesty at all?

529
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
I plan

530
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,360
to send word to Kumor

531
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,400
that Phoenix Seal has been stolen.

532
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,840
Do you think Kumor will believe it?

533
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,240
As long as everyone else does,

534
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,640
it doesn't matter if he believes it.

535
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,080
I want him to know

536
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,560
he can't threaten me.

537
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,200
Without her status as the Empress,

538
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,680
Kumor would kill her without hesitation.

539
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,240
If he kills Cangcang,

540
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,880
Jueding will surely slaughter Xijiang.

541
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,680
If he wins,
you can avert the crisis in Xijiang.

542
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,040
If he loses,

543
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,120
you can reclaim
command of the Jiangzhou army.

544
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,680
If you dislike this,

545
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,200
I have another plan.

546
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,600
I will personally go to Xijiang,

547
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,400
negotiate with Kumor,
and bring the Empress back.

548
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,200
Your Majesty.

549
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
What do you want?

550
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,360
During my absence from the Capital,

551
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,880
I want Prince of Yuzhang,
Xiao Qianqing, to act as regent.

552
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,400
Your Majesty is wise.

553
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,280
I will fully support
Prince of Yuzhang as regent.

554
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,160
You just heard, right?

555
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,040
The Empress has been captured.

556
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,760
I will personally rescue her.

557
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,480
During this period,
you will act as regent.

558
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,280
You worry Grand Tutor Ling

559
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,240
will seize control of
the court after leaving the Capital?

560
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,640
Now that Her Majesty has been captured,

561
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,320
you act accordingly,

562
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,760
forcing Grand Tutor Ling
to support my regency.

563
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,480
I'm determined to get
the command of the Jiangzhou army.

564
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,840
What if I refuse?

565
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,240
Why refuse?

566
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,640
I'm afraid of being plotted against

567
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,440
and not know how I end up dying.

568
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,680
If I tell you

569
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,000
everything I do is for Cangcang,

570
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,560
would you believe me?

571
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,120
No.

572
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
The Jiangzhou war is unpredictable.

573
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,160
Your imperial power is unstable,

574
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,040
so you will personally go to Jiangzhou,

575
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,640
defeat Kumor,
and reclaim the army's command.

576
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,040
Every step of your plan

577
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,080
is for your imperial power.

578
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,160
Yes.

579
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,120
My throne was hard-won,
so I must protect it.

580
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,320
But this time,

581
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,520
you're closer to my throne than ever.

582
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,160
If I were you,

583
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,840
I would cherish this opportunity.

584
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,120
Alright. I…

585
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,560
I thank Your Majesty for your grace.

586
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,320
- Prince of Yuzhang, receive the decree.
- I am ready.

587
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,640
I am ill
and needs rest in the secondary palace.

588
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,560
During this time,

589
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,440
Prince of Yuzhang,
Xiao Qianqing, will act as regent.

590
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,040
I, Xiao Qianqing,
accept the decree with gratitude.

591
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,560
Rise.

592
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,600
You may open this pouch

593
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,600
when the time is right.

594
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,040
When is the time right?

595
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,320
You'll know when the moment comes.

596
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,080
I shall take my leave.

597
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,600
Your Majesty.

598
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,600
Are you really giving
the regency to Prince of Yuzhang?

599
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,520
What if he and Empress Dowager Liu…

600
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,880
My brother is remarkably intelligent.

601
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,600
He knows
the fiercer he clashes with Grand Tutor,

602
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,920
the easier it is for me to benefit.

603
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
But he also knows

604
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,760
I placed him in this position

605
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,080
so that he can't avoid conflict.

606
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,080
Any mistake

607
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,680
could make him
completely devoured by the opponent,

608
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,840
but I chose him for another reason.

609
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
What is that?

610
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,120
I trust

611
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,160
this brother still has a conscience.

612
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,320
He would never
ignore the people of Xuzhou.
