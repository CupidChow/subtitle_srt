Judging by the relationship between Lingbi Sect and Nanrong Palace,

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,220
You have to be able to differentiate

189
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,250
between right and wrong.

190
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,820
So what if you do ascend the throne?

191
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,370
What do you think people will think about you?

192
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,300
You'll truly become a villain who usurped the throne by killing your brother!

193
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,130
Qianqing, do you like the present

194
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,570
I gave you?

195
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,240
The Xiao Qianqing I love is already dead.

196
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,980
From today onward,

197
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,490
you and I

198
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,250
will cut all ties.

199
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,220
Your Highness, you didn't attend the morning court session.

200
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,060
It turns out that you're here,

201
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,770
fretting over your lost love.

202
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,700
Preceptor Du,

203
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,650
you should mind your own business.

204
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,700
I don't mind

205
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,980
getting another obedient lackey from Nanrong Palace

206
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,580
and allowing him

207
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
to enjoy the fun of being the next Imperial Preceptor.

208
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,340
I came to find you

209
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,490
because I have some business

210
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,580
with you.

211
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,250
Du Tingxin!

212
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,610
You think I don't dare to kill you?

213
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,420
If you capture a bird with a fiery personality,

214
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,580
there's no way you can trap it in a cage.

215
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,420
It'll think of everything it can to escape.

216
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,060
It will only give up after ramming itself to death

217
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,490
in the cage.

218
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,180
Your Highness, please be appeased.

219
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,180
But I have a way

220
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,250
for you to keep her by your side.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,530
I can turn her

222
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,850
into your personal doll.

223
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,340
She'll be obedient,

224
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,100
charming,

225
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,580
and will only answer to you.

226
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,850
She won't betray you

227
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,010
no matter what happens.

228
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,850
And, from now on,

229
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,420
you're the only thing in the world

230
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,890
that matters to her.

231
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,460
In the future, you can dress her up like your personal doll.

232
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,700
She'll smile and cry

233
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,010
when you want her to.

234
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,460
If you tell her to say "I love you",

235
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,010
she'll say it...

236
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,140
for all eternity.

237
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,700
Physician Li,

238
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,570
I brought a buddy of mine to test your medicine...

239
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,480
Do not speak!

240
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,660
It's completed!

241
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,140
Hurry and feed your buddy with it.

242
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,050
Okay.

243
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,860
Here.

244
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,140
How can this be?

245
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,700
Try ringing the Heartbane Bell.

246
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,810
My heart no longer hurts.

247
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,650
Young man,

248
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,010
are you sure about that?

249
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,860
Yes, sir.

250
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,770
I succeeded.

251
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,620
I succeeded!

252
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,730
- You actually succeeded. - Yeah!

253
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,290
We finally managed to live up to His Majesty's expectations

254
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,750
and created the antidote to Heartbane.

255
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,270
Hurry and produce the antidote according to this prescription.

256
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,160
Yes, sir.

257
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,730
You guys actually succeeded.

258
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,050
Ghost King will never

259
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,290
go back on his promise.

260
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,090
Why are you guys helping us out?

261
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,420
Ghost King said

262
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,360
that one can never truly dominate people with poison.

263
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,220
Someone said the same thing to me once.

264
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,570
Who is it?

265
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,420
It's a friend of mine.

266
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,730
Her name is Dienu.

267
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,530
She was also once a member of Lingbi Sect.

268
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,090
But now,

269
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,490
no one remembers her name anymore.

270
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,050
She's already dead.

271
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,700
She was killed by Heartbane

272
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,420
in her attempt to regain freedom.

273
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,050
She once told me to escape with her.

274
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,660
But I was terrified of the heart-consuming pain.

275
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,530
I betrayed her.

276
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,290
Don't tell me

277
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,620
you would rather be affected by Heartbane for the rest of your life.

278
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,570
Between freedom and life,

279
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,460
make your choice.

280
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,490
She chose to protect her freedom

281
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,140
by jumping off the cliff

282
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,900
while I managed to get by,

283
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,490
albeit leading a regretful life.

284
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,180
It's all in the past now.

285
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,440
Is that so?

286
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,380
Perhaps everything would've been different

287
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,490
had I encountered Ghost King sooner.

288
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,810
Your Majesty,

289
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,010
everything has been arranged for.

290
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,180
Excellent.

291
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,980
The day we storm the Sacred Hall

292
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,980
is the day of the Saintess's death.

293
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,330
As per your instructions,

294
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,860
I've jotted down

295
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,770
her food preferences, address,

296
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,700
hobbies, habits,

297
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,010
everything that's related to her.

298
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,720
[Daily Necessities: Pear blossom, especially fond of honey puffs]

299
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,180
But are these details actually important?

300
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,140
I thought we were going to...

301
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,250
Pear blossom?

302
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,660
[Especially fond of honey puffs]

303
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,730
Fond of honey puffs?

304
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,900
What's the matter?

305
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,490
It's nothing.

306
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,900
Where's Cangcang?

307
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,140
Her Majesty is still trying to locate you.

308
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,520
How's the situation in the palace?

309
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,660
Prince of Yuzhang acted as if he had no interest in handling court affairs.

310
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,330
But after my investigation, I found out

311
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,090
he has already transferred his personal guards in Southern Chu

312
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,980
to the Capital secretly.

313
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,220
[Changhe Gate]

314
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,700
Your Highness.

315
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,420
What's wrong?

316
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,330
Princess Zhong Lin was taken away by the Imperial Preceptor.

317
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,570
Just now, I had a dream.

318
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,810
It was as if I fell into a pool of black water.

319
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,330
It was terrifyingly cold.

320
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,900
It was just a nightmare.

321
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,290
You don't need to take it to heart.

322
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,530
Is that so?

323
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,620
So, it was just a dream.

324
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,900
Zhong Lin,

325
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,010
the palace is no longer safe.

326
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,660
Du Tingxin is growing increasingly ruthless.

327
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,730
I don't know what'll happen after this.

328
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,870
Just stay with me in the palace.

329
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,620
Let's be together

330
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,250
for the rest of our lives, okay?

331
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,250
Put me down.

332
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,250
I have something to tell you.

333
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,380
Zhong Lin,

334
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,980
what are you up to?

335
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,040
Xiao Qianqing.

336
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
Please don't attempt such folly.

337
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,420
Let me go.

338
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,230
Trust me. I won't bring harm to you.

339
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,810
If so, in the future, we can still...

340
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,570
I don't want to wait any longer.

341
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,090
Let me go.

342
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,660
Aunt Chan served Mother.

343
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,980
And now, she's missing.

344
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,940
If you want to show me the truth,

345
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,730
you must present your evidence.

346
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,140
Arrest the assassin!

347
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,290
- Hurry! - Hurry!

348
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,050
We were late to your rescue.

349
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,090
Your Highness, please pardon us!

350
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,730
Relay my order.

351
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,770
Zhong Lin tried to assassinate me.

352
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,250
Seal off all the palace gates.

353
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,980
Arrest the assassin.

354
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,010
Yes, Your Highness!

355
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,860
Over here!

356
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,090
Come with me!

357
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,730
Hurry! Over there!

358
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,090
Search the area!

359
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,530
Search over there!

360
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,730
You guys, follow me!

361
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,250
Did you guys find her?

362
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,180
Not yet.

363
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,250
Dispatch all of the Imperial Guards.

364
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,250
Find her

365
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,530
at all costs.

366
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,180
Yes, Your Highness!

367
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,010
Your Highness.

368
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,220
Escort Zhong Lin out of the palace in secret.

369
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,180
Yes, Your Highness.

370
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,900
I also made a discovery just now.

371
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,980
Preceptor Du has left the palace.

372
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,660
Stop right there!

373
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,050
You,

374
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,180
wait here for me.

375
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,140
This is the Prison of Thousand Threads that I had awakened with your blood.

376
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,730
Keep it for ten days.

377
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,820
After that, put it in the body of the person you wish to control.

378
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,300
The target will lose consciousness

379
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,340
and fall under your complete control eventually.

380
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,380
Thank you, Saintess.

381
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,820
Saintess, I always wanted

382
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,620
to ask you a question.

383
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,930
What is it?

384
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,140
Why go out of your way to help me?

385
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,210
Is it only because I'm the daughter of your savior?

386
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,100
Xin,

387
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,930
I may have lost most of my memories,

388
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,140
but I never forgot about your mother.

389
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,010
Back then,

390
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,930
I was just a junior disciple in Lingbi Sect.

391
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,300
But your mother?

392
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,780
She was the most spiritually gifted sacred maiden

393
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,340
chosen from the Imperial family.

394
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,650
Even so, we were the best of friends.

395
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,860
Sui and I

396
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,820
roamed the lands with our swords.

397
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,860
Those days were satisfying

398
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,580
to say the least.

399
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,170
Sui.

400
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,410
What actually happened

401
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,860
all these years?

402
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,580
How come I can't remember any of them?

403
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,860
The elders said

404
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,170
I went berserk while trying to master

405
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,490
the divine art of Lingbi,

406
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,060
causing me to lose my memories.

407
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,820
But,

408
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,210
it felt like I've lost much more than that.

409
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,650
What are they?

410
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,580
What exactly have I lost?

411
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,580
Who is he?

412
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,210
Who is this child?

413
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,450
Why does he

414
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,060
keep appearing in my head?

415
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,100
Your Highness,

416
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,930
this is a list of palace maids

417
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,410
found in Nanrong Palace.

418
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,820
[Register of Palace Attendants' Return, Liu Chan, Lin Nianwei]

419
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,690
Preceptor Du,

420
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,270
our scouts managed to track down Ling Cangcang's whereabouts on the outskirts.

421
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,430
We've already dispatched our men to capture her.

422
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,850
Zhong Lin.

423
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,060
Hand this letter to Xiao Qianqing.

424
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,490
Hurry and leave!

425
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,010
Just go!

426
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,730
Cangcang!

427
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,580
Over there!

428
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,060
It's you?

429
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,780
Did he tell you to rescue me?

430
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,580
Where is he?

431
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,820
I don't know.

432
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,620
You don't know?

433
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,170
Why is he avoiding me?

434
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,620
Li Hongqing,

435
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,650
this is an order.

436
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,010
Take me to him immediately.

437
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,780
You shouldn't have been here.

438
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,340
Were you the one who left the white umbrella at the inn?

439
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,490
Were you the one at Lingbi Sect's branch?

440
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,380
Are you

441
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,170
the Ghost King?

442
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,210
How long do you intend to avoid me?

443
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,250

Bai,

450
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,900
you're in a perilous spot now.

451
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,900
You must act cautiously.

452
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,140
I will wait for you to return safely

453
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,060

Your Majesty,

everything is ready.

456
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,010
Greetings, Ghost King.

457
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,860
Ghostly messenger, lead the way.

458
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,530
Ghost King has arrived.

459
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,780
Greetings, Ghost King.

460
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,340
So, you are Ghost King?

461
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,660
That's right.

462
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,970
I am Ghost King.

463
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,900
I knew you harbored ulterior motives.

464
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,530
You have a death wish.

465
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,340
How dare you guys betray me?

466
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,220
Could it be

467
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,340
that you guys have forgotten

468
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,970
about the pain of Heartbane?

469
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,970
Did you cure them of Heartbane?

470
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,860
Indeed.

471
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,380
Heartbane, the poison that I've invented,

472
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,410
it has no cure.

473
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,610
That's because

474
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,220
you never wanted to cure them from the start.

475
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,180
Ghost King managed to create an antidote

476
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,180
and neutralize the poison for them.

477
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,260
Why else do you think

478
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,900
they're betraying you?

479
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,410
It seems you've plotted for this day for a long time.

480
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,260
Who exactly are you?

481
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,010
I'm your undertaker.

482
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,490
Dienu.

483
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,740
I've made my choice as well,

484
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,530
even though I might only be free at this exact moment.

485
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,530
I suppose that's enough.

486
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,410
You're truly beyond salvation.

487
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,820
Those who betray the sect

488
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,740
don't deserve to live.

489
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,660
Mother,

490
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,300
I'm so cold.

491
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,410
Huan, be a good boy.

492
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,490
You won't be cold after you take the medicine.

493
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,200
Mother,

494
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,740
it's so bitter.

495
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,200
Why am I the only one who's suffering like this?

496
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,090
Why am I the only one who has had to take medicine from a young age?

497
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,050
It's all my fault.

498
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,740
I failed to protect you.

499
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,970
Here, Huan.

500
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,090
I'll give you some honey puffs

501
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,820
after you finish your medicine,

502
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,610
okay?

503
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,380
Here.

504
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,960
Why do you have this tattoo?

505
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,520
Did you visit the Central Plains

506
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,590
over two decades ago?

507
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,900
Have you been to Great Qi

508
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,610
over two decades ago?

509
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,900
Have you...?

510
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,570
Why is my child afflicted

511
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,610
with cold-related ailments since his birth?

512
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,570
Why must it be him?

513
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,610
Why must he suffer like this?

514
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,130
You have to leave the palace as soon as possible.

515
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,930
You can save Huan

516
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,570
only if you find the Frost Reed.

517
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,380
This is a fake-death decoction I made for you.

518
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,660
The only way you can leave the palace

519
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,930
is to drink this.

520
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,130
Kill me.

521
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,090
Kill me if you dare.

522
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,860
Do you think you can rule over Lingbi Sect

523
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,490
just because you've defeated me?

524
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,570
You're getting ahead of yourself.

525
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,340
When the full moon shines,

526
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,860
the Ghost King returns to his tomb.

527
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,180
If you want to end everything before that happens,

528
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,860
kill me right now!
