00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
"MY QUEEN" BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,520
Miss Ling.

3
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,000
Greetings, Miss Ling.

4
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,560
I've gathered all members of
Fenglai Pavilion from every region.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,480
They've been slipping
into the Capital in secret

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
and are now standing by.

7
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,880
Very well. Follow the plan.

8
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,560
Take your men to the Prince of
Yuzhang's Manor and assist Zhong Lin.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
The rest is to stay put for now.

10
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,840
Yes.

11
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,400
What about you, Miss Ling?

12
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,520
Phoenix Terrace.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,160
Minister Lin, you're back.

14
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,840
Your Majesty,

15
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
I have returned

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,400
alive.

17
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,560
You've served two reigns
and are revered by all.

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,920
Yet due to the Ling faction's framing,

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,920
you rose and fell three times

20
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,480
and were only reinstated today.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
You've suffered a lot.

22
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,760
I was stubborn and rigid.

23
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,000
Your Majesty's decision to exile me

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,240
was to protect me.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,960
I understand.

26
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,400
Minister Lin, you're an upright man.

27
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
The future of Great Qi will depend on you.

28
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
Mr. Li.

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
I hope you will continue

31
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,560
to select worthy talents for Great Qi

32
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,480
and demand justice for the people.

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,520
Also, the status verification
system must be abolished.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,440
Only then can
Great Qi remain stable for long.

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,160
Your Majesty, if you face any difficulty,

36
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
you must tell us.

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Even if it costs my life,

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,320
I will protect you.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,720
I appreciate it, Mr. Li.

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,200
I would give

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,280
everything for Great Qi,

42
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,960
even if at the cost of my life.

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,360
Since birth,
I have suffered from cold sickness.

44
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
It's only with everyone's care

45
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,320
that I have lived to see this day.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,360
I thank you all.

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,760
Thank you for never abandoning me

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,920
so that we could build
this flourishing age together.

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
Today,

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,560
I'd like to look upon

51
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,000
my capital,

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,920
my officials and people,

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,680
and my land.

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,000
Long live the wise ruler!

55
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,520
Golden Phoenix Bids Farewell.

56
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,720
<i>Cangcang,</i>

57
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,840
<i>when you see these fireworks,</i>

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
<i>leave this place.</i>

59
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
<i>Don't come back.</i>

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,240
<i>This place is dangerous.</i>

61
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,720
<i>If I survive this,</i>

62
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
<i>I will never let you leave me again.</i>

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Could it be…?

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
Xiao Huan!

65
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,960
Your Majesty,

66
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,840
you said you wished to die with dignity.

67
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,160
Do it now.

68
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Is this the ending you all wanted?

69
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

70
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,920
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

71
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,120
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

72
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,200
Xiao Huan!

73
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,040
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

74
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,720
No!

75
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
Cangcang.

76
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,320
Zhong Lin. Where's Xiao Huan?

77
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,520
His Majesty jumped from Phoenix Terrace.

78
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,920
The river was fast.

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,760
Shi Yan and I have searched for him.

80
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,680
Xiao Qianqing's men are
also looking along the banks,

81
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,200
but haven't found him.

82
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
Cangcang. Where are you going, Cangcang?

83
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm going to find him.

84
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,080
Du Tingxin has
soldiers all over Phoenix Terrace.

85
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,200
If you go now,
you're walking to your death.

86
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,040
Saintess.

87
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,320
Speak.

88
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,240
The Emperor of Great Qi
jumped from Phoenix Terrace.

89
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,280
Is he dead?

90
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,040
They haven't found his body.

91
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,200
But no one has ever
survived the Qining River.

92
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,840
He does have some backbone

93
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,480
to choose such a decisive way to die.

94
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I didn't get to meet him once.

95
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,480
Now that I think of it,

96
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,440
that's a shame.

97
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,400
WUYING HALL

98
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,360
<i>Well?</i>

99
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
<i>Do you like the gift I gave you, Qianqing?</i>

100
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,880
<i>No.</i>

101
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,040
<i>When I wanted it, you didn't give it.</i>

102
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,680
<i>It means nothing when it comes late.</i>

103
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,840
It's like sincerity.

104
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
If no one answers it,

105
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,800
then the answer no longer matters.

106
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Tell me.

107
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,280
Other than the map, what else do you want?

108
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,640
<i>I only wish to serve you</i>

109
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,600
<i>and help you claim the throne.</i>

110
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
Let's celebrate in advance.

111
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,320
May Great Qi have peaceful weather

112
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,360
and thriving people.

113
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,280
<i>Xiao Huan…</i>

114
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,520
He jumped from Phoenix Terrace.

115
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,560
He might…

116
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
- He might be…
- I don't believe it.

117
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,840
I don't believe a single word you say

118
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,560
unless I see it myself.

119
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,480
Cangcang.

120
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,320
Ying,

121
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,920
do you remember

122
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,120
we used to play

123
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,560
at Wuying Hall back then?

124
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,520
Thank you, Huan.

125
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,920
<i>You said the mandarins were bitter</i>

126
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,520
<i>and refused to eat them</i>
<i>unless we removed the pith.</i>

127
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,160
<i>But you didn't like the ones I peeled.</i>

128
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,080
<i>You said they were ugly.</i>

129
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,240
<i>You would only eat</i>
<i>the ones Xiao Huan peeled.</i>

130
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>I was upset</i>

131
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,280
- <i>so I peeled a lot for you.</i>
- Tasty. I want more.

132
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,880
Peel one more.

133
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,640
If you like it, I can peel more.

134
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,920
Here.

135
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,960
No. Ugly.

136
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,320
Ying, you must finish the mandarins

137
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,320
I peeled for you.

138
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,160
If not, I'll tell our mother
that you're playing favorites.

139
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,360
Your mandarins are ugly.
I don't want them.

140
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,120
Eat.

141
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,320
- If you don't finish them…
- No. Your mandarins are ugly.

142
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,080
Eat.

143
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
You have to finish them.

144
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,320
Ying.

145
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,880
<i>Huan.</i>

146
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,920
Help, Huan.

147
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Ying!

148
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,400
Ying!

149
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,200
Ying!

150
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
You're bad!

151
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,520
Ying.

152
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,040
You're bad! I don't want them. Go away!

153
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,520
- Ying.
- You're bad!

154
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,320
- Ying.
- You're bad!

155
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,600
You're bad!

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,120
Don't be afraid, Ying.

157
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm here.

158
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,680
Don't be afraid, Ying.

159
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,480
Huan.

160
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,480
What exactly happened

161
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,800
during the fire at Luling Palace that day?

162
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,920
What do you think happened?

163
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Why did you abandon Ying?

164
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,280
You knew how she loved you, respected you.

165
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,720
Why didn't you save her?

166
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,600
You and I
were born into the imperial family.

167
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Yes.

168
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
We were born into the imperial family.

169
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,480
<i>Is this</i>

170
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,400
<i>the ending you all wanted?</i>

171
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,880
<i>What did Du Tingxin do to you?</i>

172
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,760
Xiao Huan.

173
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,240
Why did you choose to
jump from Phoenix Terrace?

174
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,560
You haven't even told me the truth.

175
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
What should I do now?

176
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,000
VIRTUE HELD WITHIN

177
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,960
Your Highness,

178
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,320
the Imperial Preceptor ordered
me to bring the Princess of Ding'an back.

179
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,960
Where's Cangcang?

180
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,960
Even like this,

181
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,800
- all you care about…
- Tell me where Ling Cangcang is!

182
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,600
She's fine.

183
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,880
She's the Empress of Great Qi.

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,160
Of course, she's in Linghe Hall.

185
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,200
Your Majesty,

186
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,600
it's been a long while.

187
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,800
It feels like a lifetime.

188
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Preceptor Du, you went to all this trouble

189
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,960
to bring me back to Linghe Hall.

190
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,040
Surely it's not for a casual chat.

191
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,080
You're the Empress.

192
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,800
Naturally, you should be in Linghe Hall.

193
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,640
I'm only doing my
duty as Imperial Preceptor

194
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,240
to escort Your Majesty back to the palace.

195
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,400
- You want to kill me?
- Of course.

196
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,560
I can't wait to cut you into pieces.

197
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,360
If not for you,

198
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,280
Xiao Huan wouldn't
have ended up like this.

199
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,720
His condition today is all thanks to you.

200
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,480
Your fate is said to curse His Majesty.

201
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,640
As long as you're near him,

202
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
he will never meet a good end.

203
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,280
He's not dead.

204
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,800
He can't be dead.

205
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,079
I saw him jump from
Phoenix Terrace with my own eyes.

206
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,880
Even if you lie to yourself,

207
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,839
I'm telling you, he will not survive.

208
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,319
For you,

209
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,119
Xiao Huan gave up
the only medicine that could save him.

210
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,560
What were you doing?

211
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,520
For you,

212
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
he risked his life to travel
alone to Xijiang for peace negotiations.

213
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,920
What were you doing?

214
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,880
Ling Cangcang,

215
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,040
he gave you everything he could.

216
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,240
Now that he's already
jumped from Phoenix Terrace.

217
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,360
Why are you still alive?

218
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
Why didn't you

219
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,800
die with him?

220
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,560
Madam.

221
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,120
Madam.

222
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,400
They found this
blood-soaked robe in the Qining River.

223
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,600
How could I…

224
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,200
How could I possibly

225
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
let you die so easily?

226
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,680
Don't worry.

227
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,680
I won't torment you for long.

228
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,040
Once I've had my fun,

229
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,600
I'll send you

230
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,680
to your demise.

231
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,680
Du Tingxin,

232
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,000
if you want to kill me,

233
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,480
do it now.

234
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,800
Otherwise,

235
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,200
I swear I'll make you pay.

236
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,760
As matters stand,

237
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,560
what price could you make me pay?

238
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,200
It's been three days since
His Majesty fell into the river.

239
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,880
The Capital Patrol Office
has been dispatched

240
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,160
and searched the entire Qining River,

241
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,960
but they've found no trace of him.

242
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,920
Your Highness,

243
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,160
the Qining River is dangerous.

244
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,280
There are countless
undercurrents and whirlpools.

245
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,800
I fear His Majesty

246
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,560
may not survive.

247
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

248
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,200
The nation can't be
without a ruler for even a day.

249
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,680
His Majesty has met with disaster
and left no heir.

250
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,080
Prince of Yuzhang, you're the regent now.

251
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,760
For the sake of the people of Great Qi,

252
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,200
you should…

253
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,520
How presumptuous!

254
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,920
Minister Xing,

255
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,480
what are you trying to say?

256
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,640
His Majesty's condition remains unclear,

257
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,040
and all of you

258
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,920
are already rushing to curry favor

259
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,640
with the Prince of Yuzhang.

260
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,280
How shameful.

261
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,960
If His Majesty never returns,

262
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,040
what will become of Great Qi?

263
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,760
What will become of the imperial court?

264
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,600
In my opinion,

265
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,440
at a time like this,

266
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,120
only the Prince of Yuzhang…

267
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm not interested.

268
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,160
Prince of Yuzhang.

269
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,280
If any of you

270
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,480
wish to fight over the throne, go ahead.

271
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm not stepping into this mess.

272
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,000
His Majesty slipped

273
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,560
and fell into
the river from Phoenix Terrace.

274
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,920
All the ministers present
saw it with your own eyes.

275
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,560
No one who falls into the Qining River

276
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,680
has ever survived.

277
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,040
Even though the Capital atrol Office
is still searching…

278
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,000
Whether alive or dead,

279
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,760
we must find His Majesty.

280
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Until it's confirmed,

281
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,240
no one

282
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
is to covet the throne.

283
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,240
Minister Lin,

284
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,760
I know you're loyal to the Emperor.

285
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
I myself have known
His Majesty since childhood.

286
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,120
All the more reason
I can't accept this either.

287
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,800
But if His Majesty can't be found,

288
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,440
we can't wait forever.

289
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,240
You're right, Preceptor Du.

290
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,000
- True.
- Yes.

291
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,720
However, according to
the founding laws of Great Qi,

292
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,080
if the emperor's life or
death remains unknown,

293
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,320
only after one hundred days

294
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,600
with no word
may the throne pass to another.

295
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
One hundred days?

296
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,080
If any of you doubt it,

297
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
you may consult the law

298
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,040
and see whether I lie.

299
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,160
Uh…

300
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,080
Minister Lin has served two reigns

301
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,120
and even helped
the late Emperor revise the code.

302
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
He's never mistaken.

303
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,560
However, during these one hundred days…

304
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,200
We must ask the Prince of Yuzhang

305
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,160
to act as Regent during this period.

306
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,040
When His Majesty returns,
all will naturally return

307
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,560
to its rightful order.

308
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes.

309
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
That makes sense.

310
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,960
Please stay, Prince of Yuzhang.

311
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,360
His Majesty jumped from Phoenix Terrace,
and we don't know if he's alive.

312
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,840
You don't seem to care.

313
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,560
Why should I care about

314
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,480
the murderer
who killed my mother and Ying?

315
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,080
Do you have no interest in the throne?

316
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,040
Since when have I ever cared for it?

317
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,480
I only wanted the throne

318
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,040
because Xiao Huan
valued it more than his own life.

319
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
If he dies,

320
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,440
what use is the throne to me?

321
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,920
Right now I have only one thought.

322
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,280
I hope he doesn't die in the Qining River.

323
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,400
I want to take his life with my own hands.

324
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
Then you should think about

325
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,960
how to find His Majesty first.

326
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,200
By the way,

327
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,800
the Empress weeps day and night.

328
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,600
She says she wants
to die with His Majesty.

329
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,080
Your Highness,

330
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,600
what do you think we should do with her?

331
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,120
What do the rites say?

332
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,960
If there is no news
from His Majesty after a hundred days,

333
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,600
the Empress must be buried with him.

334
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
We'll follow this rite then.

335
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,920
I shall obey.

336
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,920
Your Highness,

337
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,160
when the decree announcing
the emperor's passing is issued,

338
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,840
please deliver the decree

339
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,200
for the Empress to be buried with him.

340
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,680
I will.

341
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,800
It was Xiao Huan.

342
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,840
He fooled me.

343
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,040
Now it's clear

344
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,440
that he was the one who killed Ying.

345
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,160
He would rather choose death
than admit it.

346
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,440
So he can't blame me

347
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,600
for destroying everything he cares about.

348
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,400
Your Highness.

349
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,080
Investigate all contact

350
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,880
between Nanrong Palace and
Xuanguang Hall before the incident.

351
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,240
Do it quietly.

352
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,440
Don't let anyone in the palace find out.

353
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,680
Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,480
PROSPERITY IN FULL VIGOR

355
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,400
Your Highness.

356
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,280
LINGHE HALL

357
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,720
Your Highness.

358
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,880
The Imperial Preceptor said

359
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,440
Her Majesty is grieving too deeply

360
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,760
and shouldn't be disturbed.

361
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,640
But she must repay me

362
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,520
what she owes me.

363
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,320
Now you finally understand my pain.

364
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
Give it back to me.

365
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,920
The pain of having your heart ripped out.

366
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,040
The pain of a thousand
arrows through the chest.

367
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
I want you

368
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,240
to feel it just as I have.

369
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,360
Soon,

370
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,320
the news of His Majesty's passing

371
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,560
will be announced.

372
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,920
You're the Empress.

373
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
You will be buried with him.

374
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,920
But before that,

375
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,400
I want you to eat well and stay alive.

376
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I want you to live in torment

377
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,960
for every single moment.

378
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,120
You know you're going to die,

379
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,960
yet you don't even flinch.

380
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,520
Truly a lovely couple
who would die for each other.

381
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,080
He said he wanted to die with dignity.

382
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,840
Then he turned around

383
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,880
and jumped off Phoenix Terrace.

384
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,680
He just wanted to be
thought dead and gone!

385
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,040
How I wish

386
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,720
I could run a sword
through his heart myself.

387
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,080
Your Highness.

388
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,920
He said he chose death,

389
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,440
but jumped from Phoenix Terrace

390
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,400
and disappeared.

391
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,560
That means

392
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,440
there's still hope.

393
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,200
If he only disappeared,

394
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,960
then there's still hope.

395
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,880
THE START OF A BRIGHT FUTURE

396
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,199
I passed by

397
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,080
your favorite dessert shop today.

398
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,280
I bought a few bowls

399
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,120
of your favorites.

400
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Eat.

401
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,840
Do you know why I like that shop?

402
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,200
No.

403
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,640
Because they use more sugar.

404
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
When it's sweet,

405
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,440
life doesn't feel so bitter.

406
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,840
But now it feels too sweet.

407
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,320
It doesn't taste good.

408
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,640
Fine.

409
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,000
Tomorrow I'll buy from another shop…

410
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,880
Do you find this fun?

411
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,640
How many days can you keep me here?

412
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,440
I do find it fun.

413
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
I think you're doing well here.

414
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,560
Are you really that eager to leave me?

415
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,560
Xiao Qianqing,

416
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,280
I have to go.

417
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,280
I need to save Cangcang.

418
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,520
<i>What did you say?</i>

419
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,000
She's started eating again?

420
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,240
Yes, Madam.

421
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,480
Her Majesty has found her will to live.

422
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,840
I thought your love for Xiao Huan
was so deep

423
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,560
that you'd cry day and night
and suffer endlessly.

424
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,000
Since that's the case,

425
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,120
I won't let you live

426
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,520
a day longer.

427
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,400
Your Majesty, be on your way, please.

428
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,560
What?

429
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,720
Du Tingxin can't wait

430
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,080
for the Empress of Great Qi to be buried?

431
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Is she so afraid I'll live another day?

432
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,080
Please do it yourself, Your Majesty.

433
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,800
If I do it,

434
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,680
it'll be painful.

435
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,880
How could I give you what you want?

436
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,920
Forgive me then.

437
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,920
Zhong Lin?

438
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,760
Let's go.

439
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,600
Careful.

440
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,920
Madam,

441
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,120
Her Majesty has escaped.

442
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,640
I didn't know
Her Majesty still had influence

443
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,040
inside the palace.

444
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,840
I truly

445
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,080
underestimated her.

446
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,600
FAYUN TEMPLE

447
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
Father.

448
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Father.

449
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm here.

450
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Great that you're safe.

451
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,600
Father.

452
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,960
About what Du Tingxin has done,

453
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,080
were you involved?

454
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Is it nippy outside?

455
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,440
Your hands are cold.

456
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,360
You're a grown-up

457
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,960
and still don't know
how to take care of yourself.

458
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,320
Here. Take this.

459
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,800
Take this.

460
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,240
Do you know about the death

461
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,000
of the Empress Dowager Liu
and Princess Ying?

462
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,720
Cangcang,

463
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,280
you came here

464
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
just to ask about this?

465
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Stop hiding it, Father.

466
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,040
Xiao Huan has disappeared now.

467
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,320
The Prince of
Yuzhang has turned against him

468
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,960
and joined Du Tingxin in the coup.

469
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,240
- I need to know the truth.
- Cangcang, stop digging.

470
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,440
What matters most
now is that you head north

471
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,840
and meet Jueding.

472
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,640
The Northern Garrison Army
can protect you, understand?

473
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,080
You want me

474
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
to leave the Capital

475
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,920
and go to the northern border?

476
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,120
What about Xiao Huan? What about Great Qi?

477
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,400
Cangcang, even if you find out the truth,

478
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
what difference does it make?

479
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,040
It does make a difference.

480
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,040
Father,

481
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,680
if Xiao Huan has only
disappeared, it means there's still hope.

482
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,000
I believe

483
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,880
he'll come back alive.

484
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,240
That's why the truth matters.

485
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,200
Father,

486
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,560
please tell me.

487
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,920
Cangcang,

488
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,320
you're so stubborn.

489
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,960
You wouldn't listen to
a single word I said.

490
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,600
Do you know

491
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,880
what you're about to face?

492
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,080
Du Tingxin.

493
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
She's a mad dog.
