00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
EPISODE 8

4
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,360
<i>All the poisons</i>
<i>have already been destroyed.</i>

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,480
<i>Why then does the Begonia Pendant</i>
<i>still react so strangely?</i>

6
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,360
<i>Could it be that there are still</i>
<i>other toxins hidden within the palace?</i>

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,800
<i>Princess Ying's mind is unclear.</i>

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
<i>Her words cannot be taken as truth.</i>

9
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,320
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,919
I mean no disrespect.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,240
It is by His Majesty's command.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,360
Should a single lamp
be lit in this cold palace,

13
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
a guard's life must be taken in exchange.

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm truly fearful.

15
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Ying.

16
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Ying. Ying.

17
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,840
Ying.

18
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
I'm your brother.

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,440
I have come to see you.

20
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,600
Qianqing!

21
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Come.

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Ying.

23
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,000
It's so cold,

24
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,880
remember to keep your shoes on
from now on.

25
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,200
Ying. Stop painting.

26
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,520
Your brother and I have come to see you.

27
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,440
Ying.

28
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,520
I brought you osmanthus
and red bean dumplings.

29
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,600
After you eat them,
you should go to sleep early.

30
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,920
How did you know I like these?

31
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,880
Who are you?

32
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,079
Then do you want to eat them?

33
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,520
When I've killed them all, then I'll eat.

34
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,360
Kill whom?

35
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,320
Why don't you help me,

36
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,120
and kill them all?

37
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Mother, this teacup is exquisite.

38
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,360
Fine porcelain, so clear and delicate.

39
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,360
Ying's illness has always come and gone.

40
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,920
After much effort to nurse her,

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,600
her confusion still outweighs her clarity.

42
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
That Xiao Huan
is determined to take our lives!

43
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Mother.

44
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,280
Ying gave poison to the Empress,
and attempted to assassinate His Majesty.

45
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,040
She was only punished by ten days
without lighting a lamp.

46
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
That punishment
is already merciful enough.

47
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,360
Ying has never been of sound mind.

48
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,280
- But why did she become this way?
- You know the reason well.

49
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,640
Had it not been for that great fire
at Luling Palace back then,

50
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
when Xiao Huan abandoned her,

51
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,360
she would never
have been so deeply scarred.

52
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,320
Then why did Luling Palace
suddenly burn for no reason?

53
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,800
What do you mean by that?

54
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,560
You are my own flesh and blood,

55
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,120
the child I carried for ten months,
born through hardship and pain.

56
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,880
Do you not know why,
or for whom, I have done all this?

57
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
So Mother has always known
the truth behind Ying's madness,

58
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,880
yet chose never to tell her,

59
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,640
encouraging her
instead to resent His Majesty.

60
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
Is this, Mother,
what you call love for me and Ying?

61
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,760
So,

62
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,800
it is because of your sister's matter

63
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
that you have borne a grudge
against me all this time.

64
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,000
You were in Southern Chu
for so many years,

65
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,640
yet not once did you send a letter home.

66
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Whatever I asked you to do,
you brushed aside carelessly, and even

67
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
stood against me.

68
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,000
Mother. You speak too harshly.

69
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,840
Does it hurt?

70
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,880
It does not.

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,200
Mother,

72
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,120
please be at ease.

73
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,560
Now that I have returned,

74
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,920
I shall protect you and my sister
with all that I am.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,120
I will never let
either of you suffer again.

76
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,720
The injustice Ying endured,

77
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,520
I will never forget.

78
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Well? Did you meet His Majesty?

79
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,120
Does that mean I can stop practicing?

80
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,960
Look at me, do I look like I've met him?

81
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,120
Then what should we do?

82
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,360
His Majesty could summon
Song Lanxi at any moment.

83
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
He values him so highly.

84
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,880
Even if I practice until I'm perfect,

85
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
the moment His Majesty
sees the real one, I'll be exposed.

86
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
His Majesty is gravely ill now.

87
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
He is unlikely to grant
an audience for the time being.

88
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,480
As for you, put your mind
to practicing your calligraphy first.

89
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,280
We'll talk once you've fooled
the officials in the Capital.

90
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,640
Come, show me.

91
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,040
Your writing does resemble his,

92
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
yet it still lacks spirit.

93
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
Anyone who has seen Song Lanxi's true work

94
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,960
will see through it at a glance.

95
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
Song Lanxi is a master of calligraphy.

96
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,640
A four chi scroll of his sells for
more than a hundred liang of silver.

97
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
How could that be copied so easily?

98
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,080
At the start, you insisted
on accompanying me to the Capital.

99
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,000
You boasted
as if nothing were beyond your ability.

100
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,880
I said I wished to go to
the Capital with you,

101
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
but did I say I meant
to impersonate Song Lanxi?

102
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
If you think my writing is poor,
do it yourself if you can.

103
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
This robe of mine is suited to
the Dragon Boat Festival season.

104
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,280
It is costly and difficult to make, you…

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,840
What now?

106
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,160
- What are you doing?
- Do not move.

107
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,160
TURTLE

108
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,920
Do not be angry, Your Highness.
Please look.

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,160
This is the character
I have practiced for over a month,

110
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,960
the one that most resembles his writing.

111
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,800
TURTLE

112
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
Here.

113
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,440
TURTLE

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,520
TURTLE

115
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,600
Characters like this,
how many can you write?

116
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,400
I can write not many.

117
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,360
- About two hundred or so…
- Two hundred or so?

118
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,800
Come, write them all for me.

119
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,720
Quickly. Sit.

120
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,400
Come, write.

121
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,120
Your Highness, you're blocking the light.

122
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
I can't have anyone standing here
when I'm writing.

123
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,000
Fine.

124
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,040
Hurry and write.

125
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
For the Grand Tutor's kindness to me,

126
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,720
I would give my body and soul,
and repay it fully.

127
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,640
At the palace examination,

128
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
I will take first place.

129
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,200
Good.

130
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
You may go.

131
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,560
Well? Any word of Cangcang?

132
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,040
She claimed she was going to
the Summer Palace,

133
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,200
but went to the Sword Cottage instead.

134
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,360
It seems her visit to
the Sword Cottage isn't simple.

135
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,960
Then Father means…

136
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,800
Regarding Li Lu's death,

137
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,080
she has never let it go.

138
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,080
How is the truth

139
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
she seeks coming along?

140
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
<i>Master.</i>

141
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,800
<i>I miss you.</i>

142
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,760
<i>The longer I stay in the palace,</i>

143
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,240
<i>the more I miss</i>
<i>the carefree days I had here.</i>

144
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,520
<i>But you're gone.</i>

145
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,720
<i>Xiao Huan won't even give me a reason.</i>

146
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
<i>Master,</i>

147
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,520
<i>what exactly were you all hiding from me?</i>

148
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,440
<i>The imperial family is heartless,</i>
<i>yet Xiao Huan keeps helping me.</i>

149
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,800
<i>Why is that?</i>

150
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,640
Why did you kill my master?

151
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,680
I promised him I wouldn't tell you.

152
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
What did you say?

153
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,240
What aren't you allowed to tell me?

154
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,600
<i>What are you all hiding from me?</i>

155
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,640
You're back, little glutton.

156
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,840
What do you want to eat?
I will make it for you.

157
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,720
<i>Master, is it ready?</i>

158
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,720
What gift are you giving me?

159
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,920
You may open your eyes now.

160
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
What a beautiful pendant.

161
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,480
This is a protector I give you.

162
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,600
You must keep it with you from now on.

163
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,840
Well? Do you like it?

164
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I do.

165
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
Father never remembers my birthday.

166
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,360
Master is much better than Father.

167
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,720
Thank you, Master. I really like it.

168
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
As long as you like it.

169
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
Master,

170
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,800
can you tell me

171
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,400
why Xiao Huan

172
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,720
had to kill you?

173
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,720
Who?

174
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
Luo.

175
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,280
Cangcang.

176
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,960
Speak. Why are you here?

177
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,600
I came to pay my respects too,
to share a drink with him.

178
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,600
But Master never drank Bamboo Leaf Green.

179
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,680
Are you really here to pay respects?

180
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
Cangcang,

181
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Father

182
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,920
was worried about you.

183
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,680
Luo,

184
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
do you still remember this pendant?

185
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
This Begonia Pendant

186
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,920
was given to me by Master.

187
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,440
He said it would keep me safe.

188
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,080
I remember.

189
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,320
I only learned recently

190
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,359
that it is a treasure beyond price.

191
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,240
With it on me,

192
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,359
no poison can get close.

193
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,160
Master was protecting me all along.

194
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,200
But I do not even know why he died.

195
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,240
I do not even know why he died!

196
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,000
Am I that useless?

197
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,200
Cang…

198
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
Cangcang.

199
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
I remember when I was little,

200
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,120
I loved leaning against this forge.

201
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,680
No matter how cold it was outside,

202
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
it was always warm here.

203
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,160
Tell me,

204
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,480
when have you ever approached me

205
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
without a purpose?

206
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,600
No, My Lady. It was Father…

207
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,680
Master forged the Rex Sword for you

208
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,520
and you used that very sword to kill him.

209
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,000
- How am I supposed to trust you again?
- I…

210
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,240
How am I supposed
to grow old at your side,

211
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,920
to live with you in harmony?

212
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,200
Since I became empress,
I've swallowed every grievance.

213
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,360
In the palace,

214
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,000
there hasn't been a single day
I didn't try to uncover the truth!

215
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
Tell me the truth!

216
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,240
Do you want me to hate you
for the rest of my life?

217
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,200
Do you

218
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,200
not want to hate me?

219
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,720
I…

220
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,880
I don't want to hate you.

221
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,360
I don't want to hate you!

222
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,720
I hate myself.

223
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,160
Once,

224
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,280
I even thought

225
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,200
of roaming the world with you,
sword in hand.

226
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,200
Leave.

227
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
Go!

228
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
Stay away from me.

229
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,400
I don't want to see you.

230
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,400
Master.

231
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,120
Master…

232
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,160
I want to…

233
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,000
I want to learn sword-forging from you.

234
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,600
I'll stay here

235
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,640
and wait for you.

236
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,480
So,

237
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,880
you still love him.

238
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
After everything,

239
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
you still…

240
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,560
You still love him.

241
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,800
Cangcang, you're awake.

242
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,320
You drank too much last night.

243
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,800
Cangcang,

244
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,520
do you remember what you said last night?

245
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,640
What did I say?

246
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,160
You didn't say anything.

247
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,120
Strange, I remember
it being so warm here last night.

248
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,160
How come this morning,
now that the sun is out,

249
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,560
it's suddenly chilly?

250
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,880
I remember there was a cellar
at home once,

251
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
just like this,
warm in winter and cool in summer.

252
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,000
Strange,

253
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,120
why is there a cold draft here?

254
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,800
Cangcang.

255
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,960
Could it be there's a cellar here too?

256
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,400
Let's look.

257
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,120
Cangcang.

258
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Try this.

259
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
It's so cold.

260
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
Why is the wind so strong?

261
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Could it be there's a cellar underneath,

262
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,400
connected to Sword Cottage?

263
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,000
Take out the sword.

264
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,640
I didn't expect Master

265
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,320
had hidden a place like this.

266
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,960
Cangcang, look.

267
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,280
These belong to Tang.

268
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
Every time I mentioned Tang,

269
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,760
Master would say it was in the past.

270
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,840
But in his heart, he never really let go.

271
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,000
This is…

272
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,560
This isn't Master's wife.

273
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,760
I remember how she looked,

274
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,000
round-faced,
with a mole at the corner of her mouth.

275
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,080
Then this…

276
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,160
How could her portrait be here
with Master?

277
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
These eyebrows and eyes,

278
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,880
why do they look so familiar?

279
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,880
Cangcang, let's verify this later.

280
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,560
This is the Ghost King's mask.

281
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
How could it be
in your master's Sword Cottage?

282
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
This is…

283
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,440
How could this be?

284
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,640
How could this be?

285
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,680
Cangcang, look at this.

286
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,720
STONE MAN PRACTICING GU ARTS

287
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,880
Stone Man…

288
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,400
Secret art…

289
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,360
This is the secret art
of the Ghost King of the Lingbi Sect.

290
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,560
Could it be that Mr. Li Lu is…

291
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,360
Impossible.

292
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,200
I don't believe it!

293
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,840
How many days has the Empress been away?

294
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,160
Report to Your Majesty,
it's been fewer than five days.

295
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,960
Any news?

296
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,720
None that I've heard.

297
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,160
Your Majesty.

298
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,400
Has the Empress sent any word back?

299
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,320
Her Majesty's letters are not here,

300
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,880
but there are a few of
Mr. Song Lanxi's writings

301
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,640
that leaked from
the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

302
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,320
Why would Song Lanxi
be staying in the manor?

303
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,040
He said he was injured on the road
and needed to recuperate at the manor.

304
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,520
I have received some good news.

305
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,400
Though perhaps not entirely good news.

306
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
Some bad…

307
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,680
- Though not exactly bad.
- What news?

308
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,520
His Majesty just issued an order:
Because he is seriously ill,

309
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
the final imperial exam is postponed.

310
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,480
It's good news.

311
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,520
But I wonder, could it be

312
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,520
because he discovered something?

313
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,360
Impersonating Song Lanxi in the Capital
is a capital offense.

314
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,040
I am also complicit.

315
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,960
Naturally, I shall protect you.

316
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,000
If you want to go, go yourself.
I'm not going.

317
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,720
After Ling Cangcang entered the palace,
the first gift she received…

318
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
Do you know what it was?

319
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,240
What was it?

320
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,920
A finger of her adoptive brother,
Luo Xianxue.

321
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,000
So,

322
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,480
you may not trust me.

323
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Between us, there is no common interest.

324
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,560
However, we share a common enemy.

325
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,520
Then what should we do?

326
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,640
If he discovers
I'm impersonating Song Lanxi,

327
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,080
you must save me.

328
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,000
Your Highness,
Mr. Xu Feng, requests an audience.

329
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,240
Which Mr. Xu?

330
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,160
- No.
- No.

331
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,360
He is a student of Mr. Ling Xuefeng.

332
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,960
Ling Xuefeng?

333
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,440
What should we do?

334
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,840
Your Highness,

335
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,080
I heard that Mr. Song Lanxi
has been ill for a long time,

336
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,040
and Grand Tutor Ling is very concerned.

337
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,240
This is Physician Liu,
a miraculous healer.

338
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,840
Grand Tutor specifically sent him here
to diagnose Mr. Song.

339
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,480
To be honest,

340
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,280
Mr. Song's condition is indeed serious.

341
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,080
To be precise,

342
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,960
on the way here,
he was attacked by assassins,

343
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,880
and the injuries were severe.

344
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,960
Then, in that case,

345
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,360
please summon Mr. Song.

346
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,600
Mr. Song, have you disguised yourself?

347
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,080
Mr. Song was severely injured
on the head and neck

348
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,760
when on the way to the Capital.

349
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,920
His vocal cords were damaged,

350
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,480
and he cannot speak for now.

351
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,440
Since the injuries are severe,

352
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,920
- Physician Liu, please take care of him.
- Yes.

353
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,280
Mr. Song was attacked in the night,

354
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,480
and was greatly frightened.

355
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,760
Since then, he has refused
any physical contact with others.

356
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,480
Mr. Song,
I have admired you for a long time.

357
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,400
Your calligraphy is renowned
throughout the land.

358
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,320
Now that I see you,

359
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,680
I wonder if you might grant me
a few characters.

360
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,240
This…

361
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,080
Mr. Song's calligraphy
was already circulated yesterday.

362
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,720
Why can't he display it publicly today?

363
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,440
Xu Feng, you are taking this too far!

364
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
But

365
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
since you are Grand Tutor Ling's student,

366
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,520
I naturally have to show him some respect.

367
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,640
Mr. Song,

368
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,760
what do you think?

369
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,440
Someone, bring ink and brushes.

370
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,320
WUYING HALL

371
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,440
CALLIGRAPHY OF SONG LANXI

372
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,560
Song Lanxi has always been modest.

373
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,360
Why has so much calligraphy
been circulated?

374
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,040
It is said that too many people
came to request his writing,

375
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,480
and Prince of Yuzhang had no choice
but to ask Mr. Song to comply.

376
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,480
I doubt it.

377
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,200
Your Majesty, what seems off?

378
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,400
Along the way,
there were too many strange things.

379
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,640
Since Your Majesty is doubtful,

380
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,760
then when the Prince of Yuzhang came
to request an audience a few days ago,

381
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,760
why didn't you ask directly?

382
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,000
I had just punished Xiao Ying,

383
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,160
and if I saw him now,
wouldn't it only cause trouble?

384
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,840
<i>After all this time,</i>
<i>unable to master a single character of Xi.</i>

385
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,200
Your Highness.

386
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,160
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

387
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,040
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, SONG LAN

388
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Song Lanxi of the Western Garden
in Guzhou,

389
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,120
a character worth a thousand gold coins.

390
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,159
This writing is now given to you.

391
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Since that's the case,

392
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,280
I wish Mr. Song a speedy recovery.

393
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,920
Your Highness, I take my leave.

394
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,440
I'm suffocating.

395
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,240
No.

396
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
I nearly died of fright!

397
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
If Xu Feng found out, I'd be finished!

398
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,080
If I'm caught impersonating
an imperial official,

399
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,960
how many heads do I have
for Xiao Huan to chop off?

400
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,400
I can't believe you even know that!

401
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,040
How dare you let Zhong Lin
impersonate Song Lanxi?

402
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,480
Song Lanxi was assassinated
by your father-in-law.

403
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
If I hadn't done it,
how could I have kept it from him?

404
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,600
Kept it from him, or kept it from me?

405
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,720
As soon as I returned,

406
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,960
I came straight to the palace
to confess to you.

407
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,920
But you refused to see me.

408
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,200
I haven't yet punished you
for failing to protect him,

409
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,040
and you blame me instead.

410
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,480
Fine. Fine.

411
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,680
Then please punish me, Your Majesty.

412
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,320
It would be best to punish
Zhong Lin's crime along with mine.

413
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,160
Are you trying to use
Zhong Lin to threaten me?

414
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
I wouldn't dare.

415
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,520
Zhong Lin is just a commoner.

416
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,280
How could she
possibly threaten Your Majesty?

417
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,960
But I heard that
the Empress misses her dearly.

418
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,000
Then you will bear Zhong Lin's crime.

419
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,680
Your Highness, you just saw for yourself.

420
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,560
Ling Xuefeng's people already believe

421
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,200
that Song Lanxi
is living safely in my manor.

422
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,960
If you punish me now,

423
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,360
wouldn't that cause pain
to loved ones and joy to enemies?

424
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
So this is your plan.

425
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,400
You're using Ling Xuefeng to pressure me.

426
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,440
I wouldn't dare.

427
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,040
If Ling Xuefeng knew that
Song Lanxi was dead,

428
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,600
it would benefit neither of us.

429
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,360
Why not maintain the lie together?

430
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,200
You truly have a lot of nerve.

431
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,160
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

432
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,080
I am trembling with fear.

433
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,040
Having me cover the lie for you
is not entirely impossible.

434
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,680
But you must do
one thing for me in return.

435
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,400
What is it?

436
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,640
Have you heard of Li Chengtian?

437
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,920
Li Chengtian?

438
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,800
He was once a senior minister
in the court.

439
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,680
After losing to Ling Xuefeng,
he retired to the countryside.

440
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,040
Yet his name remains illustrious
among the gentry.

441
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,120
Many upright officials in the court
were his students.

442
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,000
Song Lanxi was also his student.

443
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,160
Indeed.

444
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,640
Your Majesty is truly cunning
and strategic.

445
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,920
So Song Lanxi was merely
a lure to draw out Li Chengtian.

446
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,480
Ling Xuefeng killed his beloved student.

447
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,360
What would he feel?

448
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,640
Your Majesty intends for me to summon
Master Li out of retirement.

449
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,920
What do you think?

450
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,240
TAKE CARE, SONG LAN

451
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,520
Greetings, Father.

452
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,080
Song Lanxi is not dead.

453
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,560
Impossible. I personally struck him down.

454
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,240
TAKE CARE, SONG LAN

455
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
This is Song Lanxi's calligraphy.

456
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,200
Since you personally attacked him,

457
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,120
there must be hidden circumstances.

458
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,320
I will investigate further.

459
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,800
Get up.

460
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,640
All traces of Li Lu's interactions with us
should be cleared away.

461
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,160
Rest assured, Father.
Everything has been properly handled.

462
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,960
But…

463
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,480
I know you cannot bear it.

464
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,200
And as a father, neither can I.

465
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Yet this is the truth
she most wishes to know.

466
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,640
It is also what she must face.

467
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,240
But Young Lady refuses to believe that
Li Lu is the Ghost King,

468
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,880
thinking instead that someone framed him.

469
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,920
- Who does she suspect?
- She has not mentioned it.

470
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,160
She is heading straight to the palace now.

471
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,480
WUYING HALL

472
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,280
Is the Empress's favourite
pear blossom honey all ready?

473
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,280
Prepared long ago.

474
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,080
Your Majesty, the Empress has arrived.

475
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,840
Why does Your Majesty
look so surprised to see me?

476
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,840
I just thought

477
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,480
you would be happier to step out
of the palace for a while.

478
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,920
Why should I be happy?

479
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,080
This is pear blossom honey
from this year's harvest.

480
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,520
Taste it.

481
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,640
You haven't finished speaking.

482
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,160
Why would I

483
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,920
be happy?

484
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Should I be happy

485
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,160
that my master is the Ghost King?

486
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,280
What are you talking about?

487
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
All along, you've had people following me,

488
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,200
never leaving my side.

489
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,400
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

490
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,000
I had them follow you to protect you.

491
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,720
Since you admit it,

492
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,200
then the items of the Ghost King
in the Sword Cottage…

493
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,480
You were the one who placed them?

494
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,320
You are suspecting me
of framing your master?

495
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,880
No.

496
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,360
If I truly wanted to frame your master,
why wait until today?

497
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,080
Then tell me,

498
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,280
why did you kill my master?

499
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
I promised your master

500
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,360
I wouldn't reveal the truth to you.

501
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,000
Fine.

502
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,200
I'll find out myself.

503
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,480
Cangcang, have you considered

504
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,680
that perhaps the truth
is more than you can bear?

505
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,560
If I didn't know the truth,

506
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,920
how could I bear it?

507
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,720
<i>Ling Xuefeng,</i>

508
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,400
<i>are you betting that</i>
<i>I wouldn't break my vow?</i>

509
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,960
<i>Grand Tutor Ling has been kind to me.</i>

510
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,520
He helped me avenge my daughter's wrongs.

511
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,120
He allowed me to live again.

512
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,600
For him, I would face mountains
of blades and seas of fire,

513
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,000
even if my soul were to shatter,
I would not hesitate.

514
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,160
If I told you that it was Ling Xuefeng

515
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,040
who abducted your daughter?

516
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,240
All of this

517
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,960
was orchestrated by him as a bitter ruse.

518
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,480
Impossible.

519
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,560
It's impossible.

520
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,120
Everything I saw was real.

521
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,680
Everything I did was of my own free will.

522
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,040
I was not used by anyone.

523
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,360
I will never regret it.

524
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,600
Is that so?

525
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,080
Then these words,
would you dare to say them to Cangcang?

526
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
Do not tell Cangcang the truth.

527
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,280
Understood.

528
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,000
A promise from the sovereign
is never broken.
