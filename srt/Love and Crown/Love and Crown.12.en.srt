00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,280
LOVE & CROWN

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
Grand Tutor Ling forced me to choose.

4
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,160
So, I want him to know
how hard that choice is.

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm innocent!

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,720
Your Majesty, I'm truly innocent!

7
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,880
I never forced Your Majesty!

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,800
Father…

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,360
Sir,

10
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,120
I want to save the people of Jiangzhou
and the people of Xuzhou.

11
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,800
Tell me, what should I do?

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,479
If you're killing me, do it.
No need for all this chatter!

13
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,800
- Loose the arrows!
- No!

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,160
WINE

15
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,760
No! Your Majesty…

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm begging you! Please let him go!

17
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,600
It was my fault!

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Please, Your Majesty!

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
Just let him go…

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm begging you…

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
I was wrong…

22
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,040
It's all my fault…

23
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,440
Please…

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,800
Sir, what do you say?

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,280
I will do everything I can

26
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,520
to get grain to Xuzhou and Jiangzhou.

27
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,120
I was wrong! It's all my fault!

28
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Xiao Huan… Xiao Huan…

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,840
spare him…

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
Please spare him, I'm begging you…

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,680
WINE

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,880
Cangcang. Father.

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,280
My death means nothing!

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,080
I only hope

35
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,480
you're never threatened again!

36
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,400
Luo!

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,760
No!

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,480
Luo!

39
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
Xianxue…

40
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,080
Cangcang…

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
I can't protect you anymore.

42
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,360
You have to live well.

43
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,120
You must keep on living!

44
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,040
Still trying to run?

45
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,960
Let me tell you:

46
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,760
Even if you flee to the ends of the earth,

47
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,080
with this Heartbane in you,
there's no escape!

48
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,320
I… I won't dare again.

49
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,080
Never again.

50
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
You opened this Butterfly Lock?

51
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,000
- Yes.
- Such a complicated Butterfly Lock,

52
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,120
and you still managed to open it.

53
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,800
Looks like you've got some skills.

54
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,360
Come with me.

55
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,960
<i>I have a disciple named Cangcang.</i>

56
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,680
You'll stay by her side,
and be her friend.

57
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
No matter what happens,

58
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,800
you must protect her,

59
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,560
even if it costs your life.

60
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,840
Cangcang,
why don't we go back to Southern Chu

61
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,600
and rebuild Fenglai Pavilion?

62
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,480
Can I ever be
the Ling Cangcang I used to be?

63
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,680
PURE AND SPOTLESS

64
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Grand Tutor Ling, you're in quite a hurry.

66
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Is there news of the grain?

67
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Your Majesty,

68
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,240
I've contacted the grain merchants
in the Capital and all the prefectures.

69
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,800
They've volunteered
300 thousand dan of grain.

70
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,200
It'll all be delivered within a month.

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,440
This is their joint petition.

72
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,600
Eunuch Feng,

73
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,480
show Grand Tutor Ling the plan
to send aid to Jiangzhou.

74
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Your Majesty.

76
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
What's the matter?

77
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
<i>We truly cannot go back?</i>

78
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,520
From the very beginning,
there was only deceit between us.

79
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,040
My death means nothing!

80
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,000
<i>I only hope</i>

81
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,120
<i>you're never threatened again!</i>

82
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,160
<i>Why did you kill my master?</i>

83
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,360
Did you approach me

84
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
just to kill my master?

85
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,520
I know you misunderstood me before.

86
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,080
Can you give me one more chance
so we can start over?

87
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,680
<i>You don't need to rush to answer me.</i>

88
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,400
<i>I'll stay by your side</i>

89
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,360
<i>until you willingly walk toward me.</i>

90
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
<i>This is the palace,</i>

91
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,680
not the martial world.

92
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
The palace is an arena of power,

93
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,960
not a place
that cares about right or wrong.

94
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,040
<i>Ling Cangcang,</i>

95
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,400
you're still not ruthless enough.

96
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Cangcang, what are you doing?

97
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,760
It's so quiet here.

98
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
I'm just calming down here

99
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,560
and thinking some things through.

100
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Think about what?

101
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,440
First,

102
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,320
you used me again,

103
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
killing two birds with one stone.

104
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,840
You forced my father to give in

105
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,960
and got Luo killed.

106
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I never once thought of using you,

107
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
and I never meant
to drive Luo Xianxue to his death.

108
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,720
It doesn't matter anymore.

109
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,000
He's gone for good, anyway.

110
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,520
Second,

111
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,360
I don't want to be empress
not even for one more day.

112
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,280
This splendid capital

113
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,880
is rotten with schemes and treachery.

114
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,400
I used to think

115
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,880
that staying in this palace,

116
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,160
I could at least protect
the people I care about.

117
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,960
I lost.

118
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
And I'm tired.

119
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,320
Tell me, if I really jump from here,

120
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
will I finally be free?

121
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
There's one more thing.

122
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,680
Do you want to hear it?

123
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
What?

124
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
I hate myself
for judging people so poorly,

125
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
for giving my heart to the wrong person.

126
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,320
I deserve this heartbreak.

127
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,520
Zhong Lin.

128
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,440
Zhong Lin…

129
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,560
What are you hiding?

130
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,840
Nothing. I was just carving.

131
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,200
Oh, right… I just went to see the Empress.

132
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,640
- Do you know what she said to me?
- What did she say?

133
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,040
You've got guts, Zhong Lin.

134
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,400
Now you even dare forge the Imperial Seal!

135
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,680
PALACE DEFENSE MAP

136
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,840
A map of the palace defenses?

137
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
Zhong Lin, are you insane?
Do you know what you're doing?

138
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Keep your voice down!

139
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
Are you trying to get me killed?

140
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm getting you killed?

141
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,040
Right in my manor,
you're making something like this.

142
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
You're trying to get me killed!

143
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,520
This is a capital crime
that wipes out your whole clan!

144
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,160
I don't even have a clan.

145
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,720
Besides,

146
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,000
if you keep quiet, who'll ever know?

147
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,240
Move. You're blocking my light.

148
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,000
What exactly are you trying to do?

149
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,520
I'm going to save Cangcang.

150
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,840
Abducting the Empress
is a capital crime too.

151
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,200
Trust you to come up with that!

152
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,320
Cangcang sent me a message.

153
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,440
She said
she doesn't want to stay in the palace.

154
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,120
Anything Cangcang wants to do,

155
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,840
I have to help her do it.

156
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,840
Your plan definitely won't work.

157
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,560
Then do you have a better one?

158
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm the Prince of Yuzhang.

159
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
What's wrong with me taking someone out?

160
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,960
So can you help me?

161
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,360
As long as you help me, I can…

162
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,440
You can… do what?

163
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,840
I can help you take Xiao Huan's throne.

164
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,040
I'll risk life and limb,
whatever it takes!

165
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
You hate Xiao Huan that much?

166
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,600
If he makes Cangcang sad,
then I'm not okay with it.

167
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,600
Anyone Cangcang doesn't like,
I don't like either.

168
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,120
So are you helping me or not?

169
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,200
Depends on my mood.

170
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,280
Depends on your mood?

171
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,880
So that's a no!

172
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,800
LINGHE HALL

173
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
Your Majesty.

174
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,760
This was sent over from Xuanguang Hall.

175
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,920
It looks like wine mash,

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
but why is it shaped so oddly?

177
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
You may go.

178
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

179
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,760
TOKEN

180
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,720
His Majesty arrives!

181
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

182
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Three days from now,

183
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,600
the reinforcements will depart
for Jiangzhou

184
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,800
to support General Ling.

185
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

186
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,000
As for Luo Xianxue's death,

187
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,240
I never expected he would do that.

188
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,599
I understand.

189
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Your Majesty has your own burdens.

190
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,920
You need not blame yourself.

191
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,960
Cangcang,
you've gotten much thinner lately…

192
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,480
Your Majesty,

193
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,280
I heard when the reinforcements march out,

194
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,800
Nanrong Palace will hold
a grand river-offering ceremony

195
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
at the banks of the Qining River,
praying for the soldiers.

196
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
Is that so?

197
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,360
Yes.

198
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Would you care to attend with me?

199
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,240
I was actually going to say

200
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,120
I'm not fond of noisy occasions,

201
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
so I won't go.

202
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,040
His Majesty arrives!

203
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

204
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,720
Carry on with your drills.

205
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,040
How are preparations
for the ceremony coming along?

206
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,480
Please rest assured. Everything is ready.

207
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,680
As for the finale of the fireworks,

208
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,520
would you prefer
a golden dragon in the sky, or…?

209
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,200
A golden phoenix.

210
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,080
Let the golden phoenix see them off
and bless their journey.

211
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
The Empress doesn't even want to come.

212
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,920
Does it really mean anything
to do all this?

213
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,520
What if

214
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,600
the Empress changes her mind?

215
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,920
She doesn't have you in her heart.

216
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,360
Why would she change her mind?

217
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,160
Did you get the exit token I sent you?

218
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
In two days,
it's the river-offering ceremony.

219
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,480
With crowds going in and out
of the palace,

220
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,760
that token will let you leave.

221
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,280
Why are you helping me?

222
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,960
I gave Zhong Lin my word.

223
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,880
More than helping Zhong Lin,

224
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,320
I'm afraid what you want most is to see
the Emperor and Empress fall out.

225
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,680
You saw through all that?

226
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,640
If you leave my brother,

227
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,040
the Ling clan
won't be backing him as much.

228
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,560
Then, I'll have my chance.

229
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,520
Thank you for your kindness,

230
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,920
but I have my own way.

231
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
You really don't need my help?

232
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm usually cold and heartless.

233
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,600
It's rare I offer to help.

234
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,920
And you still don't appreciate it?

235
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,640
I don't want Zhong Lin owing you a favor.

236
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,680
There's one more thing
I'd like to ask of you.

237
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Go ahead.

238
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,720
Please take good care of Zhong Lin.
Don't let her come looking for me.

239
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,400
Where are you going?

240
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Better if you don't know.

241
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,440
Ladies,

242
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,880
this year's river-offering ceremony
is especially grand.

243
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,640
I hear His Majesty
will personally see off the troops.

244
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I heard that too.

245
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,160
To be chosen by Preceptor Du to dance

246
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,320
- is such an honor.
- Yeah.

247
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,080
After today's sword dance,
we get to escort the army out of the city.

248
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,920
- How glorious is that!
- Yeah!

249
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,560
Ladies!

250
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,160
Ladies,

251
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,800
the river-offering ceremony
is about to begin.

252
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,040
Hurry and come with me.

253
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
- Move it!
- Come on, quickly!

254
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,600
QI

255
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,200
Her Majesty still refuses to come.

256
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,520
Our best wishes to His Majesty
and the Empress Dowager!

257
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,840
Rise!

258
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,920
The Empress still hasn't changed her mind.

259
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,280
To skip such an important ceremony,

260
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,600
seems she has no respect

261
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,360
for our ancestral rites.

262
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,680
The Empress cares deeply for Great Qi.

263
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Wherever she is,

264
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,000
she'll be praying for our land.

265
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,800
Let's begin!

266
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

267
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,560
The auspicious hour has come!

268
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,640
We, the people of Great Qi,

269
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
with heaven, earth, sun
and moon as our bounds,

270
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,520
and nourished by the grace of our rivers,

271
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,880
rise early and toil till night,
plowing fields and tending grain.

272
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,120
We pray the River Deity to bless Great Qi,
let our lands be rich,

273
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
our harvests be full,
winds and rains be gentle,

274
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
and our years full of plenty.

275
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,160
Offer incense!

276
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,480
Offer the wine!

277
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,440
Send the offerings!

278
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,000
Sword dance to honor Heaven,
may our land stand strong!

279
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,960
Today's sword dance was well done.

280
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,360
All of you, step forward.

281
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,560
I like your dance very much.

282
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,560
Today, you'll join me for the banner rite.

283
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,880
Your Majesty, this goes against ritual.

284
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,480
In the Emperor's banner rite,

285
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,000
how can a mere palace maid
stand beside you?

286
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,600
I've already decided. No need to say more.

287
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,520
I

288
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,960
just want to stand with you.

289
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,840
His Majesty shoots the banner
to honor the river!

290
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,000
Today, I offer sacrifice to the deity

291
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,200
to bless the soldiers of Great Qi.

292
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,560
May you keep our land safe
and return in triumph!

293
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,920
Return in triumph!

294
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,160
Return in triumph!

295
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,320
Did you plan to give me a surprise?

296
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,520
Let me go.

297
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,840
Is life by my side
really worse than death?

298
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,280
It is.

299
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,680
All right.

300
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
You may go.

301
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,160
I always thought

302
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,880
Your Majesty would never
show your emotions.

303
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,880
Turns out

304
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,080
you just hadn't met
the one you cared about.

305
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,440
That palace maid today was the Empress.

306
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,720
Since you recognized her, why let her go?

307
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,120
You've done so much for her,

308
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,120
and she knows nothing.

309
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,800
Letting her walk away like this,

310
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,600
can you really accept that?

311
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
What she wants is freedom.

312
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,720
In your whole life,

313
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
have you ever had
a single moment of freedom?

314
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,640
I never had a choice.

315
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,120
That's why
I don't want her to become another me.

316
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,680
<i>You want to go to Jiangzhou, don't you?</i>

317
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,400
<i>You may go.</i>

318
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,720
<i>From Phoenix Terrace I gaze at the sky.</i>

319
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,040
<i>Only the golden phoenix</i>
<i>carries parting in its wings.</i>

320
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,080
<i>Phoenix and fenghuang</i>
<i>were meant to fly together.</i>

321
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,560
<i>If only the golden phoenix flies alone,</i>

322
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,920
<i>isn't that the saddest farewell of all?</i>

323
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,640
LINGHE HALL

324
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,200
FATE'S RISE AND FALL HEED NO ONE'S WILL

325
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,040
FATE'S RISE AND FALL HEED NO ONE'S WILL

326
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,720
Rise.

327
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,320
From today on,

328
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,560
the Empress will be said
to suffer from head pains

329
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,920
and will recover in the outer palace.

330
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,240
No one is allowed an audience.

331
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,680
You truly love her that much?

332
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,040
<i>Ling Cangcang,</i>

333
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,120
<i>you've hurt him this deeply.</i>

334
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,400
<i>If you stir up trouble again,</i>

335
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,800
<i>I will never let you live in peace!</i>

336
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,560
Your Majesty.

337
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,800
Give this Phoenix Seal to Cangcang for me.

338
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,719
- Your Majesty…
- She is Empress of Great Qi after all.

339
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,800
Whether she accepts it or not,

340
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,600
this Phoenix Seal belongs to her.

341
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,719
Yes, Your Majesty.

342
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,719
<i>Cangcang…</i>

343
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,400
<i>I let you go.</i>

344
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,120
<i>May you one day truly be free.</i>

345
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,320
Speak. What is it?

346
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
His Majesty ordered me
to bring you the Phoenix Seal

347
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,520
and say you will always be
Empress of Great Qi.

348
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,080
Have you ever seen an empress
who walked away from the palace?

349
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,360
PURE AND SPOTLESS

350
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,440
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

351
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,200
Leave it there for now.

352
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,840
The situation at the front is complicated.

353
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,120
There's no need to press yourself.

354
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,520
Please take care of your health.

355
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,520
I know what I'm doing. You may go.

356
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,760
Your Majesty.

357
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,720
Is she all right?

358
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,600
The Empress slipped into
the westbound relief army.

359
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
She's fine for now.

360
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,560
Once the battle reports
from Jiangzhou arrive,

361
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,120
bring them straight to me.

362
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

363
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,480
<i>You let her go,</i>

364
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,160
<i>yet you still can't let her go.</i>

365
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,720
