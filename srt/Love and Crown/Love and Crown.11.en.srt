ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,000
The best effect of birth-control tea
lasts only three days.

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,320
So this is what you call keeping me safe?

4
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,600
Yes.

5
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Well.

6
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,240
Then it must be to go along

7
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,520
with His Majesty's wishes.

8
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,720
Why?

9
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,360
If you truly wish to ask me,

10
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
then I shall tell you.

11
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,280
I cannot have

12
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,560
a child of the Ling bloodline.

13
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,200
Liar.

14
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,080
Liar!

15
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,079
Which words of yours are true,
and which are false?

16
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,440
You push me away ten paces,

17
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
then pull me back again.

18
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,560
Do you truly find this amusing?

19
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,240
WUYING HALL

20
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,920
Your Majesty.

21
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,680
You may return.

22
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
There is no need to administer
the needles today.

23
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,360
Why does Your Majesty
not tell Her Majesty the truth?

24
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,240
Why not tell her

25
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,880
what manner of cruel man her father is?

26
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,600
Ling Xuefeng has always showered
her with affection.

27
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,440
How could she possibly accept
such a truth?

28
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
Must all of this

29
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,760
fall upon Your Majesty alone?

30
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
I am used to it.

31
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Your Majesty has grown used to
Her Majesty's many misunderstandings.

32
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,840
So used, even,

33
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,680
that you would give up
the life-saving cure.

34
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
Is this the sincerity
Your Majesty speaks of?

35
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,000
Regarding the Frost Reed,

36
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
I hope the Imperial Preceptor
will never mention it again,

37
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,120
especially before the Empress.

38
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
If I discover that you defy my will,

39
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,200
do not blame me for showing no mercy.

40
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

41
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,040
Your Majesty. Song Lanxi,
the lady-in-waiting, seeks an audience.

42
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
Sect Leader.

43
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,040
It is me.

44
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,040
Zhong Lin.

45
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,520
This… What has happened?

46
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,280
It truly is you.

47
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,240
So much has happened in so little time.

48
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,360
I told you that Bai fellow,
he was never anything good.

49
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,360
Cangcang.
Why don't we return to Southern Chu?

50
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,920
We can restore Fenglai Pavilion.

51
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,560
Restore Fenglai Pavilion…

52
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,200
Can I still become
the Ling Cangcang I once was?

53
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,600
Of course you can. Why wouldn't you?

54
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,760
You are the famed heroine
everyone speaks of.

55
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Xiao Qianqing… Would he even let you go?

56
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,040
Why should I care?
He certainly can't stop me.

57
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,760
I cannot leave yet.

58
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
There is something I must do.

59
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
What is it?

60
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,840
You said His Majesty gave
Her Majesty birth-control tea?

61
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes.

62
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Rumors are already spreading
in the palace.

63
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
- They say…
- They say what?

64
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
They say His Majesty

65
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,240
does not want the Empress
to bear a child of the Ling bloodline.

66
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
Xiao Huan is out of his mind.

67
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,840
Father. If this continues,

68
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,360
Cangcang will be doomed sooner or later.

69
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,080
She will not.

70
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,560
A man at death's door
is hardly worth fearing.

71
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Xianxue.

72
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,440
Contact Cangcang at once.

73
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
She must be heartbroken right now.

74
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
This is our best chance

75
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
to obtain the Moon-Eclipse.

76
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
Yes, Father.

77
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,920
HANMO

78
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,920
Wait.

79
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
Xianxue.

80
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,080
I know you worry for Cangcang.

81
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,800
As her father, so do I.

82
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,880
If you wish to truly protect her,

83
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
then you must first

84
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
become stronger.

85
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
Master.

86
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,080
No…

87
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,520
Your Majesty. What troubles you?

88
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,120
Another nightmare?

89
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,640
It is nothing.

90
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,960
Your Majesty's health
has only just improved.

91
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
You are still vulnerable
to outside chills.

92
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,880
You have stayed
inside the palace chambers for days.

93
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,120
You should at least go out
and take in some sunlight.

94
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,320
Well.

95
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
WUYING HALL

96
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
Your Majesty.

97
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,680
I have already done as ordered

98
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
and deliberately leaked
the news to Grand Tutor Ling.

99
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,240
May he restrain himself,

100
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,360
and cease using Cangcang again.

101
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,040
But I have just learned

102
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,560
that Her Majesty has left the palace

103
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,040
and headed toward
the hot-spring palace residence.

104
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,120
Greets Your Majesty.

105
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
We greet Your Majesty.

106
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,040
LINGQUAN PALACE

107
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>Your Majesty is not in a rush</i>
<i>to depart, right?</i>

108
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,640
If not,

109
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,000
I would like to accompany
Your Majesty in a game of chess.

110
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,920
Would that be agreeable?

111
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,360
My chess skills
were all taught by the Grand Tutor.

112
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,280
Today, Grand Tutor may judge for yourself

113
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
whether I have improved.

114
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,200
In recent days, I heard a curious tale.

115
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
It is said that the magistrate of Mixian
tried a peculiar case.

116
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,440
Two women, both claiming a single infant.

117
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,880
Each insisting the child was her own.

118
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,920
Your Majesty.

119
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,920
If this case were left to you,

120
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,840
how would you judge it?

121
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,120
Let the two women
each take one of the child's hands.

122
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,480
The infant is frail
and cannot endure such struggle.

123
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,080
To keep the child unharmed,

124
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,000
the one who lets go first
must be the true mother.

125
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,520
Your Majesty is indeed wise.

126
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,960
Victory and defeat lie
between a single thought.

127
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,720
Because she could not bear it,
she chose to let go.

128
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
But whether that is victory or defeat,

129
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,800
in truth, it is difficult to say.

130
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
Your Majesty grew careless.

131
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Your teachings, I have taken to heart.

132
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I also remember

133
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,200
Grand Tutor once taught me…

134
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,440
Pride must not rise,
the heart must not overflow.

135
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,240
As for where the blossoms fall,
nothing is certain yet.

136
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,760
Your Majesty is indeed
the finest student I have ever taught.

137
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,040
This strike, sharp and decisive,
is fine play.

138
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,920
It is Grand Tutor's teachings
that were fine.

139
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
But Grand Tutor need not worry.

140
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,920
In me,
there will never be a woman's softness.

141
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,480
- Hongqing.
- Yes.

142
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
Grand Tutor is weary.

143
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,360
Escort him to the side hall
to rest for the night.

144
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,680
Have you decided?

146
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,760
Will you truly retrieve the Moon-Eclipse?

147
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
You are right.

148
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
Only if the Moon-Eclipse is in my hands
will it be safest.

149
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,400
I must destroy it myself.

150
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,000
Only then can I ensure
it never harms the world again.

151
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,600
Master…

152
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,840
You wished for this as well, did you not?

153
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
Cangcang.

154
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,599
Cangcang, are you all right?

155
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
We must leave first.
We will destroy the Moon-Eclipse later.

156
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,480
Go.

157
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,360
Your Majesty.

158
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,640
The assassin who threatened the Empress
has been seized.

159
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
This was found on his person.

160
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,600
He did not threaten me. I summoned him.

161
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,240
Are you certain
you have not been deceived by this thief?

162
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,360
The one who deceived me…

163
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,960
Was it not you?

164
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,840
Your Majesty speaks the sweetest words,

165
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
yet does the things that hurt me most.

166
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
I was a fool.

167
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
Time and again I let you deceive me,

168
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,920
and still believed you.

169
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,920
Cangcang. I warned you long ago.

170
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
You should never trust him.

171
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,280
- Take him away.
- Yes.

172
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,600
I told you the fault is not his.

173
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,880
This matter has nothing to do with him.
The fault lies with me.

174
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,880
The one who deceived me… Was it not you?

175
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,840
Your Majesty speaks the sweetest words,

176
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,280
yet does the things that wound me.

177
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,880
I was a fool.

178
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,120
Time and again I let you deceive me,

179
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,680
and still believed you.

180
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
What brings you here?

181
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,280
I heard

182
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,680
one must not drink
while soaking in the hot spring.

183
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,680
If you have something to say,

184
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,600
you may speak plainly.

185
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,280
If one drinks this wine,

186
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,760
it will make one

187
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,520
lose all sense and restraint

188
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,640
and lose all control.

189
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,040
For Luo Xianxue,

190
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,760
you dare tease me?

191
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,640
It is from the heart.

192
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,440
Very well.

193
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,720
Just now,
did you not say it was from the heart?

194
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Let him go.

195
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,080
Let him go?

196
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
I wish nothing more than
to have him torn apart.

197
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,560
Yet you ask me to spare him?

198
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,320
Then let me hate you.

199
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,800
For Luo Xianxue,

200
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,360
you truly dare to do anything.

201
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,720
I will not kill you.

202
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,840
After all,

203
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,120
I cannot let the Ling clan
follow me to the grave.

204
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
EMPEROR'S SEAL

205
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,480
Peace to the Empress.

206
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,920
- Open the door.
- Yes.

207
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,520
Luo.

208
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,600
Cangcang.

209
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,320
Release him.

210
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,040
Without His Majesty's order, I dare not.

211
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,720
This is His Majesty's order.

212
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,640
Yes.

213
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,520
Cangcang.

214
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,360
Luo, go now. Do not return.

215
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,680
You are not leaving?
Let us leave together.

216
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,480
I cannot leave. Nor can I go.

217
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,880
But you are releasing a major criminal.
He will not spare you easily.

218
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,280
I promised to keep you safe,
so I must do so.

219
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,960
As for me,

220
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,880
you need not worry. I have my own way.

221
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,960
There is no time. Go.

222
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,760
LINGQUAN PALACE

223
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,560
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

224
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,760
Good. Very good.

225
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,040
I defied Your decree.
I ask for punishment.

226
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,200
Empress, you have nothing to explain?

227
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,360
Nothing.

228
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,680
The Empress has failed in virtue.

229
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,960
Return to the palace
and remain confined for three days.

230
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,480
Kneel and copy
the scriptures in repentance.

231
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,640
I accept the decree.
And give thanks for the grace.

232
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
Do you think I will spare Luo Xianxue?

233
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,920
XIJIANG

234
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,520
QI

235
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,240
Soldiers, hear my command.

236
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,680
Swear to defend Great Qi with your lives.

237
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
Swear to guard the border to the last.

238
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,040
<i>In the ninth year of Yongxi,</i>

239
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,800
<i>Kumor, Prince of Xijiang,</i>

240
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,560
<i>resented the census decree,</i>

241
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,600
<i>and marched to besiege Jiangzhou.</i>

242
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,960
<i>Ling Jueding, Governor of Jiangzhou,</i>

243
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,280
<i>led the troops in defense,</i>

244
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
<i>and repelled the foe again and again.</i>

245
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,480
<i>But Kumor's advance was relentless.</i>

246
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,200
<i>Jiangzhou was in peril.</i>

247
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,760
Governor Ling Jueding reports,

248
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,000
Kumor rejects the census decree,

249
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,520
and has surrounded Jiangzhou.
Jiangzhou is in danger.

250
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,280
My ministers, what counsel have you?

251
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Your Majesty.

252
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,880
Kumor harbors ill intent.

253
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,960
Jiangzhou lies barely
a thousand li from the capital.

254
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,440
If left unchecked,
the danger may reach the capital itself.

255
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,320
So I propose

256
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,560
Your Majesty dispatch troops
to aid Jiangzhou.

257
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
I disagree.

258
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,880
A report came from Xuzhou yesterday.
The locust plague has not yet passed.

259
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,000
The autumn harvest in Xuzhou
has already suffered greatly.

260
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,200
In my view,

261
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,680
the plague must be
our foremost concern at present.

262
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,160
What has this to do with aiding Jiangzhou?

263
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,640
Before the troops set out,
provisions must be prepared.

264
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,120
I once reviewed the state granaries

265
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,400
with Minister Xing
regarding the disaster relief.

266
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,240
Minister Xing knows this matter best.

267
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,600
Your Majesty,

268
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,480
as for the stored grain,

269
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,040
we have less than
eight hundred thousand shi left.

270
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,360
If we reinforce Jiangzhou,

271
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,120
Xuzhou's relief may have to be delayed.

272
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,240
If Your Majesty sends troops to Jiangzhou,

273
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,200
the capital's guards must be mobilized.

274
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,840
Xuzhou is barely a thousand li away.

275
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,120
If the people there cannot be appeased,

276
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,160
and unrest follows,

277
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,360
the capital will be left vulnerable.

278
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,120
Grand Tutor,

279
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,760
what say you?

280
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,000
In my view,

281
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,960
Your Majesty should send aid,

282
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,400
and reinforce Jiangzhou.

283
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,480
And what of Xuzhou?

284
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,360
Xuzhou holds but disaster victims.

285
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
But Jiangzhou

286
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,800
is the land of Great Qi.

287
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
General Ling Jueding

288
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,480
won fame from youth,

289
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,200
commanding the entire Western Garrison.

290
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,560
To defend Jiangzhou

291
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,200
is hardly beyond him.

292
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,680
General Ling guards Jiangzhou
for Your Majesty,

293
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,640
loyal and steadfast.

294
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
Grand Tutor,

295
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,760
what are you implying?

296
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,840
No one trusts General Ling more than I do.

297
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,680
Else why would the command tally
rest in his hands to this day?

298
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,200
Would you not agree, Grand Tutor?

299
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,600
Indeed, Your Majesty.

300
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,560
Xuzhou is in crisis.

301
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,920
I cannot ignore it.

302
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,640
Yet Jiangzhou must be held.

303
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,960
Otherwise,

304
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,120
even General Ling's life
would not absolve him.

305
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,880
This matter is difficult.
I shall ponder it for two more days.

306
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,840
We await Your Majesty's decree.

307
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,600
The Imperial Preceptor says
Your Majesty is gravely ill and must rest.

308
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,280
- No one may enter.
- Commander Li.

309
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,320
You've no idea how chaotic it is outside.

310
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,040
One group after another
is demanding entry.

311
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,160
I can't hold them off.

312
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,600
They're either imperial kin,
or high ministers of court.

313
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,960
Not a single one I dare offend.

314
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,120
I mustn't offend any of them.

315
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,719
So the one you can offend is me?

316
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,719
Your Majesty, I would never dare.

317
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,679
Then hurry back out and face them.

318
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,360
I…

319
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,760
Well.

320
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,639
So Your Majesty claims illness

321
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,199
only to hide here
in Nanrong Palace for peace and quiet.

322
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,000
Are you saying that I'm not ill?

323
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,800
Your Majesty is ill indeed.

324
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Then Your Majesty must rest
as a sick man should,

325
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,320
and not burden the mind.

326
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,280
Though Your Majesty is here,

327
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,320
the thoughts are still in turmoil.

328
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,920
This does no good
for Your Majesty ailment.

329
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,080
This is a critical time.

330
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,880
I cannot relax for a moment.

331
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,280
I must save
Jiangzhou's soldiers and people.

332
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,320
Yet I cannot abandon
the people of Xuzhou either.

333
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,880
Behind Ling Xuefeng,
stands an entire host of noble clans.

334
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,680
I know this all too well.

335
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,440
If I don't force his hand,

336
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,760
he'll surely abandon Xuzhou
to protect Jiangzhou.

337
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,400
I must take this gamble with him.

338
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
His Majesty has feigned illness
and hidden in Nanrong Palace.

339
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,960
I expected it.

340
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,880
Why aren't you peeling the grapes?

341
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,360
These mare-milk grapes must be eaten
with the skin to keep their crispness.

342
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,120
I'll take the rest with me.

343
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,600
You've only just sat down
and already you're leaving.

344
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,480
Didn't I report everything to you earlier?

345
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,440
I strongly opposed
sending troops in court.

346
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,560
His Majesty seemed inclined to agree.

347
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,640
That Ling Xuefeng looked quite distressed.

348
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,160
Ling Jueding holds the military power.

349
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,160
If he loses his standing in this campaign,

350
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,720
Ling Xuefeng will be
as if cut from his right arm.

351
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Naturally His Majesty will be pleased.

352
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,960
So you think

353
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,120
His Majesty would abandon Jiangzhou?

354
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,880
What is it? You don't think so?

355
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,960
Mother, what are you imagining?

356
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,760
If Jiangzhou falls,

357
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,840
who could bear such infamy for all time?

358
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,400
Ling Jueding has guarded Jiangzhou
for years.

359
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,320
There is no one
who knows that land better.

360
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,400
His Majesty would never strip him
of command at such a time.

361
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,400
Then why stage all of this?

362
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
The people of Xuzhou are
people all the same.

363
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,000
What did you say?

364
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,360
Nothing.

365
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,640
Mother is wise. I shall take my leave.

366
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,880
The Empress confinement is not yet lifted?

367
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,840
Yes.

368
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,120
With Jiangzhou in peril,

369
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,680
as the elder sister of Young General Ling,

370
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,840
how could she not know?

371
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,120
And if she knew His Majesty refused
to send reinforcements,

372
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,280
what would she think then?

373
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,640
My Lady, Aunt Chan has arrived.

374
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,200
Her Majesty is confined
and copying sutras.

375
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
It must drain her spirit.

376
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,080
The Empress Dowager pities her,

377
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,640
so she prepared medicinal dishes

378
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,840
and sent me to deliver them.

379
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,720
Thank the Empress Dowager
for her kindness.

380
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,080
I must continue copying.

381
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,120
Aunt Chan may go.

382
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,280
Perhaps Her Majesty hasn't heard.

383
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,320
Something has happened in Jiangzhou.

384
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,400
What did you say?

385
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,200
NANRONG PALACE

386
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,200
Move aside. I must see His Majesty.

387
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,920
Your Majesty. I know you're inside.

388
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,040
Come out. Your Majesty.

389
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,640
Why will you not send aid to Jiangzhou?

390
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,520
Your Majesty.

391
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,160
- Your Majesty.
- It seems the Empress

392
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,680
already knows of Jiangzhou.

393
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,040
Since Your Majesty has chosen
this political gamble,

394
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,720
you must lay down your stake.

395
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,720
Your Majesty,

396
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,960
you must not soften
because of the Empress.

397
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,600
What lies between me and the Empress
needs no comment from the you.

398
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,920
Did the Grand Tutor
send you to seek me out?

399
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
My father?

400
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,760
What has this to do with him?

401
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,200
I came on my own.
It has nothing to do with my father.

402
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,080
My father would never use me as you do.

403
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,760
I was just about to leave the palace.

404
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,800
Come with me.

405
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
Come out.

406
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,000
Luo.

407
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,280
You managed to find this place.

408
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,320
I told you that I would never spare you.

409
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,960
- If you want to kill him, kill me first.
- Cangcang.

410
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,880
You are my Empress. Why would I kill you?

411
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,040
Cangcang.

412
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,680
You sought me out today

413
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,440
to urge me to send troops to Jiangzhou

414
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,080
and save your brother, Ling Jueding.

415
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Yet now
you risk your life to protect Luo Xianxue.

416
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,120
Empress,

417
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,120
you certainly care for many people.

418
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,560
I am the only one
you never hold in your heart.

419
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,960
I once held you in mine.
How did you treat me then?

420
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,160
We truly cannot go back.

421
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,640
From the very beginning,
there was only deceit between us.

422
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,320
In that case,

423
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,160
if you kill Luo Xianxue
with your own hand,

424
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,280
I may consider sending aid to Jiangzhou.

425
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,200
You're mad.

426
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,560
If the Empress will not strike,

427
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,560
I can do it for you.

428
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,880
Do you mean to save Luo Xianxue,

429
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,120
or your brother, Ling Jueding?

430
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,520
Xiao Huan!

431
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,440
You are a sovereign.
How can you trifle with lives?

432
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,240
Yet the Empress forces me
to send troops without heed.

433
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,960
Is that not also
treating other lives as trifles?

434
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,040
Jiangzhou and Xuzhou
are both part of my realm.

435
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,320
The Grand Tutor forces me to choose,

436
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,920
so I shall show him

437
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,720
the weight of that choice.
