EPISODE 24

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,360
You don't like me because of her?

5
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,680
That maid has nothing to do with me.

6
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,360
Please give her the antidote.

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,160
Then come out of the palace with me.

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,440
We'll go fly a kite, okay?

9
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,560
Just this once.

10
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
Just this once, please?

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,160
Fly the kite with me,
and I'll give you the antidote right away.

12
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,080
I've never lied to you.

13
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,160
Careful!

14
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,440
Your Highness, forgive me.

15
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,040
Li Hongqing, I like you like this.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
Here, Your Highness.

17
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,680
The kite string actually cut your hand.

18
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,680
Let's get rid of it!

19
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,280
It's just a little scratch.

20
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
What are you doing?

21
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,520
Spit helps with the pain.

22
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,920
An old nanny taught me that.

23
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
Are you cold?

24
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,120
Why would I be?

25
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm used to it.

26
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
I don't want your cloak.

27
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,920
I overstepped.

28
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,360
Your Highness…

29
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
Why is your heart beating so fast?

30
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,160
Are you ill?

31
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,040
No…

32
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm… perfectly fine.

33
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,920
Then… why are you stuttering?

34
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,800
I…

35
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
I'm hungry.

36
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,760
Then…

37
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,280
I'll take you to get something to eat.

38
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Miss, you're so pretty!

39
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,880
Just you wait!
I'll call my brother to beat you up!

40
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,200
He can't beat me.

41
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,520
Kid,

42
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,240
how about we buy your tanghulu?
(*candied hawthorn)

43
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,280
I don't want money!
I just want the tanghulu!

44
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,040
It's so good.

45
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,360
You just wait!

46
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,560
Don't you run! I'll get my brother!

47
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,720
If you've got guts, don't run!

48
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,520
Your Highness, let's go.

49
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,600
He told me to wait here. I can't leave.

50
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,400
When he comes back with his brother,

51
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,680
you can help me
knock his brother's teeth out.

52
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Are you upset again?

53
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,440
Did I do something wrong?

54
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,120
Your Highness,

55
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,640
you can't snatch tanghulu from a child.

56
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm a princess.

57
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,200
If I want to eat it, why can't I?

58
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,680
And that maid.

59
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,320
I was never going to accept
her sachet anyway.

60
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,640
She didn't do anything wrong.
Why should she have to die for it?

61
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,280
You really wouldn't have taken it?

62
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
That's not the point.

63
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,760
I just don't like her.

64
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,840
If that makes you unhappy,

65
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
then maybe I can like her too.

66
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,800
Does it have anything

67
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,200
to do with whether I'm happy?

68
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,800
Of course it does.

69
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,840
I like you. I just want you to be happy.

70
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,920
Then do you like me?

71
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
What if I don't?

72
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,160
Would you tell me to die too?

73
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
I wouldn't.

74
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,160
Commander Li can't die.

75
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,280
If you died, I'd be really sad.

76
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,960
Sadder than if I died myself.

77
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
When Your Highness knows what's right

78
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,960
and what's wrong,

79
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,200
you're actually very lovable.

80
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,600
Your Highness, where are you going?

81
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
To buy tanghulu!

82
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
He just said…

83
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,640
he only wants the tanghulu,

84
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,440
not the money!

85
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,480
LINGHE HALL

86
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,720
Xiao Huan, you're awake.

87
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,920
Cangcang, you're awake too.

88
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,400
Princess Ying?

89
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,040
My greetings to you both.

90
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,880
- What's this about?
- What are you doing here?

91
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

92
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,200
What is it?

93
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,880
Commander Li said

94
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,960
he has to ask you
if he's allowed to like me.

95
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
You have to say yes.

96
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,720
A dignified, gracious,
broad-minded princess

97
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,720
should come find me
at Wuying Hall tomorrow,

98
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,200
not barge into Linghe Hall at night
and disturb my sleep.

99
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,960
If I have to wait till tomorrow,

100
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,960
I might just die from it.

101
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,040
Don't worry. I'll think it over.

102
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,000
Not "think it over."

103
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,720
You have to agree!

104
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
All right.

105
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
I understand.

106
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,360
Go back and get some sleep.

107
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes!

108
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,960
Then I'll take my leave.

109
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,840
I used to hit you and yell at you.

110
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,480
I even poisoned you. That was my fault.

111
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,920
So I'm here to apologize.

112
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,720
You're all forgiving me?

113
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,000
- We do!
- We do!

114
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,520
- We do!
- We do!

115
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,400
- Ying.
- Qianqing!

116
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,760
What's going on with them?

117
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm apologizing to them.

118
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,080
They're all happily forgiving me.

119
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,640
They're happy?

120
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,640
- Happy!
- Happy!

121
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,800
- So happy!
- So happy!

122
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,120
See? They're really happy.

123
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,400
The sky's clear now.

124
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Qianqing, come sit in the sun with me!

125
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,760
Come on.

126
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,280
Qianqing, what is filial piety?

127
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,600
Is it just doing what you're told,

128
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
and being there at the very end?

129
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,800
More or less.

130
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,560
Qianqing,

131
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,960
I'll definitely be there for you
in the end.

132
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,400
I won't try to kill His Majesty anymore.

133
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
Brother Hongqing said

134
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,080
when Luling Palace was on fire,

135
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,680
His Majesty was still very young
and in poor health,

136
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,640
so it wasn't on purpose
that he didn't save me.

137
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,360
So I can't blame him.

138
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,760
Well, well.

139
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,640
So now you've got
a Brother Hongqing besides me.

140
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,960
Qianqing…

141
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
let me tell you a secret.

142
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Go on.

143
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
Yesterday, he took me out to have fun.

144
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,480
He told me lots of things.

145
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,480
He said

146
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,520
he kind of likes me.

147
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,040
If I can be a bit more proper,
he'll like me even more.

148
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,000
So I stayed up all night
memorizing two books.

149
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,920
I'll recite them for you, okay?

150
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,960
Okay.

151
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,640
"A gentleman
does not seek fullness in food

152
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
or comfort in living.

153
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,480
He is diligent in action,
cautious in speech,

154
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,040
and learns from the virtuous
to correct himself.

155
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,320
This is…

156
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,960
what it means to love learning."

157
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
What you memorized overnight
is the <i>Analects of Confucius.</i>

158
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,600
- And you…
- Don't interrupt me, or I'll forget it!

159
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,040
All right.

160
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,000
"A gentleman
can shoulder great responsibilities…"

161
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,040
Later,

162
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
when Hongqing comes,

163
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,960
remember to wake me up.

164
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Don't worry.

165
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,480
I promise.

166
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,880
You have grown up

167
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,080
and finally found your own happiness.

168
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
I'm happy for you.

169
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,360
That's wonderful.

170
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,360
Qianqing…

171
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,160
I'll be there for you in the end.

172
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
All right.

173
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,240
I'll be waiting for you to see me off.

174
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,800
Court's off today and the weather's good.

175
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
It's nice to come out for some fresh air.

176
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,280
What a shame
this outfit isn't good for archery.

177
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,520
Or we'd show those two up in archery.

178
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,320
Your Majesty,
let's settle it at the range today.

179
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,960
If you lose, don't be a sore loser.

180
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
You still talk too much.

181
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,760
This is so sour.

182
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,960
How can you eat this?

183
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,880
I don't think so.
It's really refreshing. Tastes great.

184
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,600
You're flirting right in front of us?

185
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,920
Which of them do you think will win?

186
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,240
I bet His Majesty will win!

187
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,040
Good!

188
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,880
That one doesn't count!

189
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,280
I just slipped up.
This round doesn't count.

190
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,800
You're still just like before,
can't stand losing.

191
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,360
Who's a sore loser?

192
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,760
You only won once.

193
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
If you've got guts, let's go again.

194
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,400
Maybe I'll go easy on you

195
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,760
and let you win one.

196
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
I don't need that.

197
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
Congratulations on your victory.

198
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
Your Majesty is truly impressive.

199
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,720
Feng Wufu!

200
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
You're such a suck-up!

201
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
Your Highness, he just outmatches you.

202
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
Don't take it out on me, please.

203
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,200
This dagger cuts iron like it's nothing,

204
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
a rare treasure in this world.

205
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,320
Thank you.

206
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,120
What are you grinning at?

207
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Sit down.

208
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,400
They're being all lovey-dovey.

209
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,880
What's so great about watching them?

210
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
You're only allowed to look at me.

211
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,880
All right. I'll only look at you.

212
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,640
Your Highness
is the cutest man in the world,

213
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,320
the most handsome, and the most fun.

214
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,720
You're the only one
in my heart and in my eyes.

215
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,920
Satisfied now?

216
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,240
Your Majesty really hides
your talents well.

217
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
You roast meat

218
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,720
as well as any master cook
in the martial world.

219
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
That's because when he was little,

220
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,760
he went through too much hardship.

221
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,320
It's all in the past.
No need to bring it up.

222
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,320
Here.

223
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,560
Smells amazing!

224
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,640
Zhong Lin, have a taste.

225
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,560
Delicious! So good!

226
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,280
My grilled fish is just as carefully made.

227
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,040
Don't play favorites, okay?

228
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,520
Zhong Lin, here. Have a taste.

229
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,080
Cangcang, after you.

230
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,320
What's wrong, Cangcang?

231
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
Nothing.

232
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,880
Maybe today's fish…

233
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,440
is a bit fishy.

234
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,320
Let me smell.

235
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
It doesn't smell fishy.

236
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,600
You usually love fish the most.

237
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,880
Why the change in taste today?

238
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,960
No way.
The fish I grilled could never be fishy.

239
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,600
I told you, I'm fine.

240
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't get so worked up.

241
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,280
You couple
should really let me worry less!

242
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Physician Li,

243
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
is there something wrong with her health?

244
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Your Majesty…

245
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,880
you'd better get ready.

246
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,080
Get ready?

247
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Get ready for what?

248
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,680
Her Majesty is carrying your child!

249
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,040
Get ready to be a father.

250
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,040
So you mean she is pregnant?

251
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,440
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

252
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,120
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.

253
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,320
- Congratulations, Her Majesty!
- Congratulations, Her Majesty.

254
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,000
Although in the past,
Her Majesty's health took some damage,

255
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,880
thankfully her constitution
is still very strong,

256
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,480
and so is yours.

257
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,720
In a moment, I'll prescribe some medicine
to protect the baby.

258
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,360
You must take it regularly

259
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,720
and must not overwork yourself again.

260
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,960
You two really are trying
to smash my good reputation, aren't you?

261
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
Physician Li,

262
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,600
for these next ten months,

263
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,760
I hope you can stay here in the Capital.

264
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,960
You brat,

265
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,680
now you want to chain me here?

266
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,840
Fine.

267
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,080
From now on, your married life
is my responsibility.

268
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
What are you all standing around for?

269
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
Get out!

270
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,440
Thank you, Physician Li.

271
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,880
Cangcang,

272
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,480
thank you.

273
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,040
I heard you went to Wuying Hall.

274
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,360
Did His Majesty make things hard for you?

275
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,080
No.

276
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,640
I showed him most of my sincerity.

277
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,760
Even with all the resentment in his heart,

278
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,560
we've helped each other after all.

279
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,800
I figured he'd remember that bond

280
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
and show me some mercy.

281
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,840
Even if there's trust,
it's not like before.

282
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
It doesn't have to be!

283
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,720
In his eyes,

284
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,360
I never mattered much.

285
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,560
That's true.

286
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,000
I know you really

287
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,880
have my best interests at heart.

288
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,920
Madam, you don't have to force yourself.

289
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
I know you're unhappy today.

290
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,680
Why would I be unhappy?

291
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,160
His Majesty…

292
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,160
finally has an heir.

293
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,480
We should be happy for him!

294
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,360
We should be celebrating!

295
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,640
I just don't understand

296
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,680
how the Xiao family can live so happily
after ruining my mother!

297
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,520
It's not fair!

298
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,160
Do you like children?

299
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,560
Or only the one

300
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,800
she'll give you?

301
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,960
LINGHE HALL

302
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,160
Your Majesty,

303
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,120
forgive me for the offense.

304
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,360
Search the place!

305
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,840
Cangcang,

306
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
can you explain what all this is?

307
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,360
Why can't you keep the promises
you made to me?

308
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,720
I was just reading them.

309
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,800
I didn't mean anything else.

310
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,120
Besides, those street tales,

311
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,240
sometimes, they're…

312
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,240
not as thrilling as ghost stories.

313
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,480
Isn't martial arts enough?

314
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,880
No. Not exciting enough.

315
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,040
Don't be mad.

316
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,800
Mr. Bai.

317
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Dear Bai.

318
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,600
Mr. Bai.

319
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,240
Dear Bai.

320
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
That won't work on me.

321
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,040
No, really…

322
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,080
they're actually quite good.

323
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,640
Let me show you.

324
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,800
Just read this one.

325
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,640
It's the story of Swallow Eight.

326
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,320
She can catch demons,

327
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,880
but she's actually a demon herself.

328
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,240
Later she's killed for drinking too much,

329
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,520
then she turns into a woman

330
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,680
and falls for the man who killed her.

331
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,000
And this one.

332
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,800
It's really good too.

333
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,880
Let me show you.
This one is about a male ghost.

334
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,840
He always puts a robe
over the woman he loves

335
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,360
after she falls asleep.

336
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,720
It's actually a very heartwarming story.

337
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,560
Really! If you don't believe me,

338
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,840
you can ask Eunuch Feng.

339
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,120
Right?

340
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,040
Yes…

341
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,120
Ever since Her Majesty
first told me that story,

342
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,160
I've been full of energy when helping you

343
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,960
with memorials, not sleepy at all.

344
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,960
And there are even more stories like that.

345
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,120
All right, Cangcang.

346
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,320
Earlier,
I've specially looked up some classics.

347
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,280
The mother of King Wen of Zhou
never looked at anything improper

348
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,520
or listened to anything unpleasant
when she was pregnant.

349
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,040
That's what they call prenatal education.

350
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,440
Prenatal education?

351
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
- So…
- So,

352
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,240
I've specially picked out this book,

353
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,680
Tales of Rivers and Mountains,
full of travel notes and insights.

354
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,920
You can read it properly.

355
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,680
Come on, sit back down.

356
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,280
Wufu.

357
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Here.

358
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,120
So many words,

359
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,040
packed so tightly.

360
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,800
TALES OF RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS

361
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,360
How am I supposed to get through this?

362
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
It's all right.

363
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,680
I can read it to you slowly.

364
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,600
Once we're done, you have to eat properly.

365
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,760
What would you like to eat?

366
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,440
I…

367
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,800
Five-spice crispy fish.

368
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,960
No.

369
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,720
Smells fishy.

370
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,520
Next.

371
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Crystal mutton jelly.

372
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,360
Next.

373
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,600
Stuffed eight-treasure duck.

374
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,600
You don't even want that?

375
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,640
No. I'm not hungry.

376
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,440
Maybe… just don't serve anything.

377
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,040
Since she has no appetite,
take it all away.

378
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,960
Out of the palace,
I ran around so many restaurants for you.

379
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,920
My legs nearly broke.

380
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,800
And she doesn't even want a single dish!

381
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,960
My reputation's already taken a hit,

382
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,920
and you clear everything away
and won't even let me eat?

383
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,280
She can't handle anything greasy.

384
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,720
- Take it all away.
- What a waste.

385
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,760
Pack it all up and take it to my manor.

386
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,360
- I'll share it with Zhong Lin.
- Okay.

387
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,400
What are you thinking about?

388
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,600
I was thinking
spring will be here in a few days.

389
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,440
Yes.

390
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,960
I've already approved
this year's court assembly.

391
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,960
So much has happened lately.

392
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,440
My father
should have been here by my side,

393
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
but now…

394
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,120
Cangcang, you still have me,

395
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,280
Zhong Lin, Xiao Qianqing,

396
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,080
and the child we'll have in the future.

397
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,480
If you miss your father,
you can visit him.

398
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,360
If he knows we are having a child,

399
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,760
what will he think?

400
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,360
DEER COURTYARD

401
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,440
When you break through the earth,

402
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,639
it will be time for great deeds.

403
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,159
LINGHE HALL

404
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,320
Your Majesty.

405
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,440
His Majesty had the kitchens
prepare this bird's nest soup.

406
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,960
He told me to make sure you taste it.

407
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,520
Eunuch Feng?

408
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,360
Peace to Your Majesty.

409
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,000
What brings you here?

410
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Where is His Majesty?

411
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,680
Your Majesty,
His Majesty is busy in Wuying Hall.

412
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,960
He sent me
to change out Your Majesty's incense.

413
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,480
Change the incense?

414
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,000
The one I have is perfectly fine.
Why change it?

415
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,840
His Majesty said

416
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,920
the old incense was for clearing the head
and wasn't the best for you now.

417
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,240
So he wants this gentler blend instead,

418
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,680
to keep Your Majesty relaxed every day.

419
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,880
Very well.

420
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,920
All right.

421
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,840
Xiaoshan, go bring me my sword.

422
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,760
I'm in the mood today.

423
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,760
No!

424
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,480
Your Majesty, you're not well right now.

425
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,840
You mustn't practice swordplay.

426
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,760
I can't do this either?

427
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,280
I was once
the proud leader of Fenglai Pavilion,

428
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,160
and now
I've become some pampered hothouse flower?

429
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,840
Forget it.

430
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,720
Your Majesty, where are you going?

431
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,320
His Majesty said you mustn't run around.

432
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm going to find him, all right?

433
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,560
Your Majesty…

434
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,560
Your Majesty.

435
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
Cangcang!

436
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,200
What brings you here?

437
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
I'm here to take you back.

438
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,640
Xiaoshan watches me all day,

439
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,960
saying you told her I can't do this
and I can't do that.

440
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,240
I'm about to turn into a complete invalid.

441
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,520
I wouldn't even mind being useless,

442
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,480
but…

443
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,960
could you at least
not take away my freedom?

444
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,400
Cangcang, it's all for your own good.

445
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,560
Once Physician Li says
you can move around,

446
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
you'll have more freedom.

447
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,880
All right.

448
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,040
Then until Physician Li nods,

449
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,920
I promise I'll behave myself.

450
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,560
- Good.
- Come on.

451
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,480
Let's go back to Linghe Hall.

452
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,200
Let's go.

453
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,120
- Wufu.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

454
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,480
Double-check everything
the Empress eats or uses.

455
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
No errors are allowed.

456
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,760
Understood.

457
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,280
You'll personally keep watch over
the guards at Linghe Hall.

458
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,280
Understood.

459
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Your Majesty,

460
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,920
isn't this a bit much?

461
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,640
But don't worry.

462
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,600
I'll keep an eye on my mother.

463
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,920
We'll see your heir safely born.

464
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,280
All right.

465
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,720
How are things at Deer Courtyard?

466
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,520
Your father-in-law
works the fields there every day.

467
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,960
He caught a slight chill recently
and has been coughing.

468
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,960
The imperial physicians have seen him.

469
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,360
Aside from that, nothing unusual.

470
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,280
Make sure he's well taken care of.

471
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,720
After all, he's getting old.

472
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,520
Understood.

473
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,280
Add some coltsfoot blossoms.

474
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,760
They're very good for easing the cough.

475
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Here, Madam.

476
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,920
"Shi Yan will launch a surprise attack

477
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,080
on Lingbi Sect's Langye Mountain branch
in two days."

478
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
Leak this news to Lingbi Sect.

479
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,720
But won't that put Shi Yan in danger?

480
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,920
If something happens to Shi Yan,

481
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,400
what will Li Hongqing do?

482
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
With the commander
of the Imperial Guards away,

483
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,400
you, the deputy commander,
can serve a greater purpose.

484
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,960
Understood.

485
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,000
That mad princess in the palace

486
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,120
is still
a clever move we haven't even played.

487
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,720
Saintess.

488
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,080
I have received word

489
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,280
that the Emperor's Xiaoxing Guards

490
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,440
plans to strike
Lingbi Sect's Langye Mountain branch.

491
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,600
SAINTESS, LINGBI SECT

492
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,520
Is the report accurate?

493
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,960
Yes.

494
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
Shi Yan meant to strike straight
at the heart

495
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,080
and take the Langye Mountain branch
in one blow.

496
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,560
But he walked into an ambush.

497
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,720
Though the Ghost King is dead

498
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,760
and they're now headless,

499
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,960
they've been
in the martial world for years

500
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,360
and are hard to wipe out completely.

501
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,200
Earlier, Zhu Sha mentioned the Saintess,

502
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,320
saying she's their true master.

503
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,920
I request permission to set out
to bring Shi Yan back

504
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
and uncover the truth for Your Majesty.

505
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,120
All right. Then be careful.

506
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,840
Commander Li.

507
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,280
What did you need from me?

508
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,400
I'm leaving on urgent business.

509
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,360
The palace patrols
and His Majesty's safety

510
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,200
- will be in your hands.
- We're buddies.

511
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,400
No need to be so formal.

512
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,680
Besides, this is all part of my duty.

513
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
Also, over at the cold palace,

514
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,520
no more than three lamps are allowed.

515
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,560
All lamps must be out by the hour of Xu.

516
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,280
Though that's the servants' task,

517
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,080
have the men keep an eye on it too.

518
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,520
Ask them to help watch it.

519
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,880
Three lamps. Hour of Xu. No problem.

520
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,520
- Thank you.
- Oh, yes.

521
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,080
You know what the princess is like.

522
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,120
I'm afraid the guys won't handle her well

523
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,680
and make her unhappy.

524
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,520
It's fine.

525
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,000
Just coax her and say

526
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,280
as long as she doesn't get mad
or hit anyone,

527
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,360
the flower will bloom soon.

528
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,080
What kind of flower is it?

529
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,880
Honestly, I'm not quite sure.

530
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,720
But once it blooms, we'll know.

531
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,760
I'll take good care of it.

532
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,280
I'll make sure
it grows up well and blossoms.

533
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,600
Then we can see
what it looks like together.

534
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,080
I'm not eating until Hongqing comes back.

535
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,720
Your Highness,

536
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,520
Commander Li will be gone
for quite a few days.

537
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,320
You'll ruin your health if you starve.

538
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,480
We can't have that.

539
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,720
All right then.

540
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,600
I should be more understanding.

541
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,080
Then, I'll eat ten bites today,

542
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,800
nine bites tomorrow…

543
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,720
If he still isn't back in ten days,

544
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
I won't eat a single bite!

545
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,600
Your Highness,

546
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,960
this… this absolutely won't do!

547
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,280
Let me talk to Her Highness.

548
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,680
