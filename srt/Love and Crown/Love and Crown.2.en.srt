00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,240
You again.

3
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,280
I just wanted to greet a friend.

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,880
How did you find this place?

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,880
<i>Other than the quarry,</i>

6
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,640
<i>I also saw Zhong Lin change her clothes</i>

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,080
<i>and met with His Highness's subordinates.</i>

8
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,560
I was bored so I asked around

9
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
and deduced where both of you would be.

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
Then, I came to pick you up.

11
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,600
I saw you both come out
of His Highness's manor

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,520
whilst disguised as tattoo artists.

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,480
You also mentioned forging just now.

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,320
So, I ran it through my mind

15
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,360
to see what exactly

16
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,600
you need forged in
Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

17
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
Well,
if you wish to forge His Highness's seal,

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,200
allow me to suggest

19
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
Wuxi green jade.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,520
Miss Ling, Wuxi green jade

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,520
is indeed the material with
which the royal seal is made.

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
I keep running into you.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,880
What are you after?

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,160
I wish to follow you and achieve greatness

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,960
to make a name for myself

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,960
in this martial world.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
Fame and glory are but an illusion.
I do not share your goal.

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
We all have different ambitions.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,520
But isn't it beautiful

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,960
to share a journey together?

31
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Wuxi green jade
for your perusal, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,640
Good.

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,200
Why are you shaking?

34
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
I'm not killing you.

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,920
Thank you for clemency, Your Highness.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
Have you found

37
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,800
the two fraudsters?

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,040
Your Highness,

39
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,280
they snuck out of the manor stealthily
and disappeared.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,280
But none of our property is lost.

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
And you couldn't discern
real tattoo artists from the fake ones?

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,200
Tattoos have intricate patterns.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,440
But those fraudsters did a good job
replicating the patterns.

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,400
So you're saying

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
that they put in so much effort

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,920
into approaching me

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,520
so that they could tattoo a bird on me

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,160
to humiliate me?

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,960
You're an idiot!

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,680
You know what?

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,120
Re-enact the whole
scene with the housekeeper.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,200
Even if you can't figure out the truth,

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,720
I will still spare you.

54
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,160
But I'll break your legs

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
and feed you to the hounds.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,519
Make haste.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Yes.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,560
FENGLAI PAVILION

60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,880
Forgive me. All jades are unique.

61
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,520
This one might be slightly different
from the one used by Prince of Yuzhang.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
- It can't be helped.
- This jade

63
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,920
is more polished than the real one.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,440
And you found it within one night?

65
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,600
You're amazing.

66
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
Prince of Yuzhang's seal

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,960
is engraved
with four claws that subdue evil.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,080
Just who exactly are you?

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,440
I'm Bai Chifan

70
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,560
of the Xiling region.

71
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,800
Bai Chifan?

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,880
Bai Chifan.

73
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,440
You have the name of a fraudster.

74
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,720
You are mistaken.

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,320
I come

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
from an affluent family,

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,480
so I must be discreet.

78
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,640
Are you related to the Bai clan of Xiling?

79
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
A distant relative of theirs.

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
A distant relative?

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,800
The Bai clan of Xiling
is a sword-wielding clan.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,760
They were a big name
in the martial world for several decades.

83
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Then, they went to
the western regions to trade.

84
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,160
It is true that they are rich right now.

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
- So you truly are Bai Chifan?
- Yes.

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,280
A spoiled heir who forsook
martial arts for mercantile skills?

87
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Who's your father?
My origin doesn't define me.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,080
Just like I never asked
who your father is.

89
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
Why must you know who my father is?

90
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,880
So you're just a spoiled heir.

91
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,600
Do you even know
what makes the martial world?

92
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Everyone has a different take.

93
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,400
Some fight for vengeance.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,520
Some fight for justice

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
or bonds that cannot be severed.

96
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
They all make up the martial world.

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,000
In my opinion,

98
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,000
it is enough as long as I possess the will

99
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,120
to wield my sword.

100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Since you're so insightful,

101
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,520
can you guess

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,440
what I'm after?

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,520
Expensive robes. Thumb ring.

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,160
Royal seal.

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,960
Are you gathering these items

106
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,680
to impersonate Prince of Yuzhang?

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
It's not that serious.
You'll just get your entire family killed.

108
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh. From what I was told,

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,880
Prince of Yuzhang might seem boisterous,

110
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,320
but he's actually quite observant.

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,040
He might
have already seen through your trick.

112
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,920
It seems like I did underestimate you.

113
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,960
I hope you won't bar me

114
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,680
from joining Fenglai Pavilion

115
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,280
simply because I know too much.

116
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
Of course, not.

117
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
Fenglai Pavilion
never breaks its promises.

118
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,320
My friend, take a seat.

119
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,880
Don't worry.
We do not renege on our promises.

120
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,760
Give me a few days.

121
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,480
After I consult the rest,

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,760
I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,600
Miss Ling, you're committing a crime.

124
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,200
It's against our sect's rules.

125
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,640
He knows too much.

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,000
I can't risk letting him ruin our plan.

127
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,560
Luo, imprison him.

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,560
- Yes.
- Zhong Lin.

129
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,840
Check if someone did
leave the Bai clan of Xiling

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,240
to go on an adventure
in the martial world.

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,400
Yes.

132
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,640
FENGLAI PAVILION

133
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,720
<i>They know Cangcang</i>
<i>is after Frostflame Iron.</i>

134
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,120
<i>Something's afoot.</i>

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,440
<i>Report back to the capital immediately.</i>

136
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,680
We get in from this side

137
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,160
and you will enter from here.

138
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,080
REFINEMENT QUARRY

139
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,200
We'll group up here.

140
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,039
Once it's done, wait for my signal.

141
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,360
- Cangcang.I need to tell you something.
- Oh, you're here.

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,080
Luo. Look. The royal seal is done.

143
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,280
Everything is in order.
It's up to you now.

144
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,040
Cangcang. I have to be away for a while.

145
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,800
Are you serious?

146
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,160
- I'm serious.
- You are?

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,600
But

148
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,760
we planned this for so long.

149
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,160
If you leave now,
everything will go to waste.

150
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Besides, how am I supposed
to find another Prince of Yuzhang?

151
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Why don't we delay it for a few days?

152
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,840
No.

153
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
If we miss the timing, we'll be in danger.

154
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,160
It is an urgent matter
that I must attend to.

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,480
Is it my father?

156
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
The worst outcome will always happen.

157
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Why must he take
you away at this crucial moment?

158
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,520
Just go.

159
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,280
- What will you do now?
- What can I do? I'll figure it out.

160
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,520
He left for real.

161
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
I…

162
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Cangcang.

163
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
He left just like that.
Who can impersonate Prince of Yuzhang now?

164
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,720
How would I know?

165
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Perhaps…

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
Miss Ling.

167
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,680
How have you been?

168
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,360
What do you think, Cangcang?

169
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
It's not good.

170
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
What do you mean?

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,640
I have the thumb ring and the fan.

172
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,880
No, it's not good.

173
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,800
You look like a feeble scholar,

174
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,240
and not a prince.

175
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,760
What do we do now then?

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
Are we just going to give up?

177
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,600
This is bad.

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,080
What should we do?

179
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I have an idea.

180
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,600
I was careless.

181
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,440
Miss Ling, what is the meaning of this?

182
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,040
Speak! Who exactly are you?

183
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,480
- Bai Chifan.
- Stubborn, aren't you?

184
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,720
Bring them in.

185
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,240
Fenglai Pavilion
has a wide selection of torture tools.

186
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm giving you one last chance.

187
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
Answer honestly.

188
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
If you lie to me,

189
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,000
you'll have a taste
of all my torture devices.

190
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Ask away.

191
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,760
Did my father send you here to spy on me?

192
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,000
No one

193
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,640
can order me around.

194
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,760
You can be the first if you let me

195
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,160
join Fenglai Pavilion.

196
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
How arrogant.

197
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
Who are you? The emperor?

198
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,120
If my father did not send you here,

199
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,920
why do you know and care about

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,760
my whereabouts and Fenglai Pavilion?

201
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,680
Explain yourself.

202
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
One who understands
the rules of the five elements

203
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
and the nature of humanity

204
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,680
will know all there is
to know in the universe.

205
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,080
Enough of your nonsense.

206
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,040
I am not making anything up.

207
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,520
My father did not send you here?

208
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,720
Shouldn't I be more trustworthy

209
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,160
if I were close to your father?

210
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,080
Release him.

211
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,840
<i>He has the looks</i>

212
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,000
<i>and the comportment for it.</i>

213
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,600
<i>Since I have no better option,</i>

214
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,920
<i>I'll just have to use him.</i>

215
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,840
Bai Chifan.

216
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,200
I have a use for you.

217
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,640
FENGLAI PAVILION

218
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,520
Miss Ling, can you tell me

219
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,640
why I must impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

220
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,840
and risk getting my entire family killed?

221
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,280
Don't worry.
Now that you're part of my sect,

222
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,080
you're mine.

223
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,560
Come what may,

224
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
I'll protect you.

225
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,640
And if I insist on finding out why?

226
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
Right.

227
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Since you're taking the risk,

228
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,160
you earn the right to know.

229
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,800
Give me a moment.

230
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,040
FROSTFLAME IRON

231
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
Frostflame Iron?

232
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,320
Yes. Did you know?

233
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,800
One who owns Frostflame Iron

234
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,240
can craft a divine
weapon to lead the martial world.

235
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,000
Frostflame Iron

236
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,120
must first endure
abyssal flame for a millennium

237
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
before being frozen for another millennium

238
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,520
in order to form this distinct pattern.

239
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,760
Also,

240
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,200
a sword made of this iron

241
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,560
is indestructible.

242
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,920
The Great Qi Dynasty has not seen

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,640
such material in several centuries.

244
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,080
Several days ago,

245
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,520
they found one
in the quarry in Southern Chu.

246
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,480
So you want me to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

247
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
to get this iron ore?

248
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,440
Yes. Prince of Yuzhang rules Southern Chu.

249
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,640
If Prince of Yuzhang wants it,

250
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,880
they'll have to turn it in.

251
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,560
You're so naive.

252
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,720
Do you really think a few weapons
with this iron will allow you

253
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,720
to rule the martial world?

254
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,640
What's wrong with that?

255
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,080
In this martial world,

256
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,520
the sharper the blade,
the more power you have.

257
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,400
What else?

258
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,280
BRUSH AND INK

259
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
Father, I am telling the truth.

260
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,320
In that case, explain why

261
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,040
Cangcang put in so much effort

262
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,040
for one Frostflame Iron.

263
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,640
She was looking for the hall master

264
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,520
and wanted someone to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang.

265
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
If she wanted the iron ore,

266
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
she could've come to me.

267
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,480
Perhaps Young Lady

268
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,680
doesn't want to rely
on you for everything.

269
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
It's not as simple as that.

270
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,040
Cangcang has always
been an opinionated kid.

271
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,000
Xianxue.

272
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,600
I know

273
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,480
you are loyal, responsible,

274
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
and meticulous.

275
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,680
But you seem to forget to mention

276
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
a certain Bai clan member of Xiling

277
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
who approached Cangcang lately.

278
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,240
He…

279
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,440
He's Bai Chifan.

280
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,360
He keeps pestering Young Lady.

281
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,400
But she doesn't really take him seriously.

282
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,880
She even thought
you had sent him to spy on her.

283
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,240
Do you know why I summoned you

284
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
back here?

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Please enlighten me.

286
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
Xianxue.

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,720
You must know

288
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,480
that Cangcang

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,160
is now in Southern Chu,

290
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,360
the territory of Prince of Yuzhang.

291
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,360
Xianxue.

292
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,359
No matter what happens,

293
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,960
you must protect her.

294
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,040
In the meantime,

295
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,720
I need to know

296
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,920
what she's doing.

297
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,119
Yes, Father.

298
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,040
Now return to Southern Chu.

299
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,040
I need you to do something.

300
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,640
- Yes, Sir.
- Go now.

301
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,560
Xianxue.

302
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,640
You must know that Cangcang

303
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,040
will be the Empress consort.

304
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,080
So cease whatever wishful thinking

305
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
you have now.

306
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,640
Yes.

307
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's go.

308
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,040
People have gone missing lately.

309
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,480
Let's hurry up.

310
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,720
We've been foraging
for vegetables in the mountains.

311
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm so hungry that I can't walk.

312
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,160
A bun!

313
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,120
Don't eat it.
We don't know where it's from.

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,280
What if it's poisoned?

315
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,680
Why would anyone poison a bun?

316
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,640
Wake up!

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,160
Get up!

318
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
Get up!

319
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,520
Eat the buns now

320
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,600
or you won't even be able to afford it

321
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,280
in the quarry.

322
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

323
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,440
Why are you

324
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,000
sneaking up this late at night?

325
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,600
It is my duty to make sure

326
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,440
that you are always alert, Your Majesty.

327
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
All right, Shi Yan. Take a seat.

328
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,160
Shi Yan. Did you find anything

329
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,880
about Refinement Quarry
that I told you to?

330
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,080
Your Majesty, on the surface,

331
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
that quarry mines and processes ores.

332
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,800
But in reality, it runs a monopoly

333
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,400
that abducts citizens to be miners
and forges weapons without authorization.

334
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,640
Many people have died.

335
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,840
Many young boys went
missing in Southern Chu.

336
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,880
In fact, more than 100
young boys have disappeared.

337
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
Southern Chu is an affluent region

338
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,040
that is governed by Prince of Yuzhang.

339
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,760
You must have misheard, Your Majesty.

340
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,280
In that case,
they are behind the missing boys

341
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,280
of Southern Chu.

342
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,360
At this moment, it seems so.

343
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,640
My investigation

344
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,440
reveals that Lingbi Sect
is behind the quarry.

345
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
And the one running the sect is…

346
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,000
Grand Tutor Ling is quite ambitious.

347
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,520
Southern Chu is
Prince of Yuzhang's territory,

348
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,840
and he is committing his crime here.

349
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,880
Isn't Ling Cangcang
sabotaging her father's plan

350
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
by going to the quarry?

351
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,720
Perhaps she isn't even aware

352
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,640
of the ties between
her father and Lingbi Sect.

353
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,480
Luo Xianxue
returned to the capital suddenly.

354
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,640
He might already know that I'm here.

355
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,560
This time, not only must
we bring back the Empress,

356
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
we must also get rid of Lingbi Sect,

357
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,800
thereby extinguishing
his contingency plan.

358
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,480
The marriage is inevitable.

359
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,520
We must now help Ling Cangcang
achieve her goal as soon as possible.

360
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,680
Impersonating me in public?

361
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,880
The audacity of it!

362
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,400
Slow down. They can't have run far.

363
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,280
Are you sure
they headed to Refinement Quarry?

364
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,320
Yes. Absolutely.

365
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,320
All right.

366
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,880
If you make another wrong judgment,
you'll pay for it.

367
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,720
Hurry up! Faster!

368
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm talking about you! Hurry!

369
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,400
There are only kids in this cave.

370
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
No need to feed them properly.

371
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
Just one bun per day.

372
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,920
If that's not enough,

373
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,960
tell them to drink water.

374
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,720
Sir, the laborers we have
are too swollen to walk now.

375
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,520
Ten kids died last month.

376
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,960
All our men are out there capturing kids.

377
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,000
But we still don't have enough manpower.

378
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,480
There is even a rumor saying

379
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,240
that the ghosts are kidnapping kids.

380
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,160
Besides,

381
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,960
if something bad happens,

382
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,120
what do we do?

383
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
We are working
for the Ghost King after all!

384
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,200
Right.

385
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,440
He wants the money urgently.

386
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,080
What can we do?

387
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,600
And you. You talk a lot

388
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,720
and eat a lot.

389
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,120
What now?

390
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,360
Why are you in a rush?

391
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,800
Prince of Yuzhang is here.

392
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,600
Prince of Yuzhang?

393
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
What is he doing here?

394
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,840
Greetings, Your…

395
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,680
Are you the owner of this quarry?

396
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

397
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,080
What can I do for you?

398
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,320
I was told

399
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,880
that you found Frostflame Iron.

400
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
Your Highness, you need not come here

401
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,560
in person for one iron ore.

402
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
If you desire it,

403
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,600
just say so

404
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,800
and I will have
it delivered to your manor.

405
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,240
What?

406
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
Are you doubting my identity?

407
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,720
Of course, not.

408
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,400
Look closely.

409
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,080
Wuxi green jade.
Even a fortune can't buy it.

410
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,520
It is in the right form too.

411
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Frostflame Iron, is it?

412
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Let me retrieve it now.

413
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,240
You, come with me.

414
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,760
- You two, serve His Highness tea.
- Yes.

415
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,160
What a delicate chest.

416
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,480
It must have been
made by a famous blacksmith.

417
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,520
You know many things, Your Highness.

418
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,320
Precious iron ores must
be stored in a precious box.

419
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,600
Please, Your Highness.

420
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,840
How dare you
try to murder Prince of Yuzhang!

421
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,160
Prince of Yuzhang?

422
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
The prince's royal seal

423
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,640
has four claws to subdue evil.

424
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,240
But yours has five claws.

425
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,120
Prince of Yuzhang's seal is engraved

426
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,440
with four claws to subdue evil.

427
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,120
If I don't even
possess such basic knowledge,

428
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,440
how can I even run my smithing business?

429
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,640
Insolence!

430
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,880
Hold your breath.

431
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,560
Give chase now! Quick!

432
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,200
Hurry!

433
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,560
Over there!

434
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
You can escape no more.

435
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,320
Don't you know where you are?

436
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,880
You think you
can steal the Frostflame Iron?

437
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
Who says

438
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,680
we're after the Frostflame Iron?

439
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,840
Mister, you are…

440
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,000
I am Shi Yan. Mr. Bai Chifan asked me

441
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,360
to assist Fenglai Pavilion.

442
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,040
Bai Chifan…

443
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,200
What is going on?

444
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,040
I think Quarry No. 2 blew up.

445
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,760
Sir, this is bad!

446
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,000
Sir! The slaves…

447
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,080
- The slaves escaped.
- What?

448
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,000
But sir, you said someone
was impersonating Prince of Yuzhang.

449
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,960
So I dispatched all our men here.

450
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,640
You fled on purpose

451
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,640
to lure us here?

452
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,640
It seems like
I've underestimated you both.

453
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
I'm glad you know that.

454
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,080
Bai Chifan.

455
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,640
Zhong Lin already rescued those kids.

456
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,880
Find an opening and flee.

457
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,000
I'll watch your back.

458
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,880
No, allow me to protect you.

459
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,000
What a tear-jerking pair
of star-crossed lovers.

460
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,480
Unfortunately for you,
my smoke is laced with potent poison.

461
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
It won't be long till you fall.

462
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,440
Surrender

463
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,720
yourself now and come clean.

464
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,440
Then perhaps I'll spare you.

465
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Kill them all!

466
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,000
Leave none alive. Kill them all!

467
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

468
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,520
Charge!

469
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
Run now.

470
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,760
Come!

471
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Don't worry about me. Just go.

472
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,160
Come.

473
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,600
Take this.

474
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,680
What is it?

475
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,640
A pill to save you.

476
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,080
You don't want to
leave any witnesses alive.

477
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,760
Ghost King of the Lingbi Sect?

478
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,800
What a monster reared by Lingbi Sect.

479
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,200
He is invincible.

480
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,520
Prince of Yuzhang? He's finally here.

481
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,000
Quite late too.

482
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,880
Your Highness, please capture
these unscrupulous scoundrels.

483
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,320
<i>It's you, my dear brother.</i>

484
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,800
You're the unscrupulous scoundrels.

485
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,920
Subdue them!

486
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,600
- Yes, Your Highness.
- It's not us.

487
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,560
You're mistaken.
We did this because we wanted to rescue…

488
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,800
Let go of me.

489
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,920
Let go!

490
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,000
This is just a misunderstanding.

491
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,240
We did this because
we wanted to rescue the slaves.

492
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
Let me talk to His Highness! Don't go!

493
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,880
I'm sorry.

494
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,200
I promised to protect you.

495
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,040
I failed that.

496
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,320
But who knew Prince of
Yuzhang would arrive this late?

497
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,480
So you wanted to
impersonate Prince of Yuzhang

498
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,680
to lure the culprits away

499
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,000
before you could bring them to justice?

500
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,240
The miners were abducted off the street.

501
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
Many of them are just teenagers.

502
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,560
Fenglai Pavilion
doesn't covet fame and glory.

503
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,200
We just want to help the helpless ones.

504
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,080
<i>So that's why</i>
<i>she refuses to enter the palace.</i>

505
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,640
If the plan fails, you might die.

506
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,960
Have you thought about that?

507
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,960
My life is precious, but so are theirs.

508
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,840
I used you as bait today.

509
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,280
I'm sorry.

510
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,320
But it wasn't my
intention to get you hurt.

511
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,240
Show me your wound.

512
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,240
It's nothing.

513
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,560
But you…

514
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,840
In this vast world,
it's hard to find someone

515
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,880
who will defend those victims.

516
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,320
If this is your goal,

517
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,000
I'll do everything I can

518
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,240
to make sure you're not alone in this.

519
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,800
<i>Speaking of which,</i>
<i>he has saved me several times.</i>

520
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
No, allow me to protect you.

521
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,640
Your pulse is stable but weak.

522
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,440
It's all thanks to your pill.

523
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,920
It sped up the recovery.

524
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,600
How come you are immune

525
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,040
to the poisonous smoke?

526
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,760
Besides, you were shot by an arrow too.

527
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,960
I am immune to all poisons.

528
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,720
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

529
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,960
I'm serious.

530
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,120
I'll tell you more in the future.

531
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,480
Your Highness.

532
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,480
A missive from the Empress Dowager.

533
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,200
Your Highness! What if Her Highness wishes

534
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,600
to tell you something important?

535
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,760
Every time Mother wrote to me,

536
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,680
it was about His Majesty.

537
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,040
I know what I'm doing.

538
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm leaving now.
Are you not going to see me off?

539
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,280
From now on,

540
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,000
you're a prince who governs a region.

541
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,200
You'll have to think before you act now.

542
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,520
Huan, before I leave, can you please

543
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,640
give me the Great Qi Divination Chart

544
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,320
drawn by Father?

545
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,880
Father left it behind,

546
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,840
and I wish to keep it

547
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,280
as memorabilia.

548
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,000
Father's chart

549
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,040
contains the topography

550
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,760
of Great Qi.

551
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,160
You're asking for this chart.

552
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,640
Does this mean you are still

553
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,640
coveting the throne?

554
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Remember now.

555
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,360
As long as I breathe,

556
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,600
you will not

557
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,080
have the divination chart.

558
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
Prince of Yuzhang? You're finally here.

559
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,120
I did impersonate and deceive you.

560
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,520
But it was to save the kids.

561
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,520
My achievement can offset the crime.

562
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,440
No, it cannot.

563
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,080
Can you be a generous soul
and let it slide?

564
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,040
I hate the word,

565
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,720
generous, the most.

566
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,680
When I see that bird on my back,

567
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,800
it only fuels my hatred more.

568
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,560
Unless…

569
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,960
Unless what?

570
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,720
Unless the man behind you

571
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,000
can apologize to me properly,

572
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
then I may consider forgiving your crime.

573
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,760
Look.

574
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,440
I coerced him into coming here.

575
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
It has nothing to do with him.

576
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,800
I'll apologize to you on his behalf.

577
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,800
I am Bai Chifan.

578
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,840
It was not my intention to offend you.

579
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,560
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

580
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Mr. Bai,

581
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,440
you can put your dignity aside
when need be.

582
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,440
Are you Bai Chifan for real?

583
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,120
Yes.

584
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,400
If that's the case,

585
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,120
do you know the consequences

586
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,600
of impersonating me?

587
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,840
Wait, Your Highness.

588
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,880
You are the ruler of Southern Chu

589
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,480
yet you did not know
that there was an illegal quarry

590
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,040
that refined iron in your feudal land.

591
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,400
If His Majesty learns of it,

592
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,640
you will be beheaded.

593
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,720
We found the culprit for you.

594
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,000
Your Highness
will not be seen as colluding with them.

595
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,200
And with this achievement,

596
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,960
His Majesty will surely praise you.

597
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,280
By right, you should reward us.

598
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,160
I'm here to punish you.

599
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,960
Why must I reward you?

600
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,360
Didn't I explain?

601
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,800
Our achievement offsets the crime.
It's even now.

602
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,360
All right now.

603
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,080
We'll be leaving now.

604
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,560
No need to see us off.

605
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,640
Halt.

606
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,040
To reward you two,

607
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,240
I have set up a banquet.

608
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,760
Won't you do me the honor?

609
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,800
You did what
you did to save innocent lives.

610
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,400
On behalf of Southern Chu citizens,

611
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,320
allow me to thank you.

612
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

613
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,920
I'll dig in then.

614
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,840
Miss Ling, you are still injured.

615
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,720
You shouldn't ingest chilled food.

616
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,800
Pear soup is rejuvenating.
You should drink more.

617
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,320
- Here.
- Thank you.

618
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,360
Mr. Bai, you seem to care a lot

619
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,600
about this woman.

620
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,040
Forgive me.

621
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,720
How may I address you, miss?

622
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm…

623
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,160
<i>Oh. He's a prince.</i>

624
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,680
<i>Surely, he knows</i>
<i>about the marital arrangement.</i>

625
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,320
<i>I should not cause any unwanted trouble.</i>

626
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,960
I'm Zhong Lin, Vice Sect Leader
of Fenglai Pavilion.

627
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,680
Oh, Miss Zhong.

628
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,640
<i>She must be Ling Cangcang.</i>

629
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,080
<i>Huan always moves with a goal in mind.</i>

630
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,320
<i>So he is after her.</i>
