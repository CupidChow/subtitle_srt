00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,320
Enjoy, Your Majesty.

3
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
So

4
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
what did you put in the liquor?

5
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,200
You know I spiked the drink,

6
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
but you drank it still.

7
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,040
I thought

8
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
you had put some potent venom.

9
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,960
So it was just
to trigger my cold sickness.

10
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I just need you to stay
here for one more night.

11
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,560
I need the Phoenix Seal.

12
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,640
Otherwise, I can't do much in the palace.

13
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,960
My dear, you're too naive.

14
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
You think keeping me here

15
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,560
will get you the Phoenix Seal
from the Empress Dowager?

16
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
Father aided you for many years.

17
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
Empress Dowager Liu is our common enemy.

18
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,480
You want your power. I have my goal.

19
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,080
We can work together.

20
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
Even willing to look past
what happened before?

21
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,920
Yes.

22
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,880
Xiaoyue, you're back.

23
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,720
I don't want to talk about it.

24
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,320
- Madam.
- Madam.

25
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
What happened to His Majesty?

26
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Her Majesty
seems to have offended His Majesty.

27
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,720
Ling Cangcang.

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
Where is your respect?

29
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,600
Who said you could come in?

30
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
Get lost!

31
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
I am unable to ascertain

33
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,800
what happened in the chamber.

34
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,600
But His Majesty
was lashing out against Her Majesty.

35
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,800
He even hollered at Imperial Preceptor Du
who barged in thereafter.

36
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,560
It seems like Her Majesty hasn't earned

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,520
His Majesty's favor.

38
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,560
Indeed.

39
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,320
It means nothing even if
she's the daughter of Ling Xuefeng.

40
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,840
She's just a stepping stone

41
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,120
for Xiao Huan to amass more power.

42
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,160
Then shall we proceed with the plans

43
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
we have devised against her?

44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,240
No need.

45
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,400
A disfavored Empress is no threat.

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,480
Xiao Huan doesn't love her.

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
So she isn't my enemy.

48
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,400
In that case,

49
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm sure

50
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,440
she'll be too ashamed to
get the Phoenix Seal from you.

51
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,200
By His Majesty's decree,

52
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,800
Her Majesty's oversight has caused

53
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,920
the resurgence of
His Majesty's cold sickness.

54
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,560
As an act of punishment,

55
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,480
His Majesty declares that from now on,

56
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,000
Her Majesty cannot leave the inner palace.

57
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
May Her Majesty profit

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
from this period to reflect upon herself.

59
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,400
Father. I have bad news.

60
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,440
What is it? Why the panic?

61
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,960
Her Majesty has been grounded.

62
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,960
Grand Tutor Ling, did
you rush into the palace

63
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,120
for whatever reason?

64
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,000
I must have spoiled my daughter

65
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
that she grew flippant.

66
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,360
That's why you had to put her in place.

67
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,720
I came to apologize on her behalf.

68
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,520
It's not that serious, Grand Tutor Ling.

69
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
The Empress poisoned my drink

70
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,640
in an attempt to harm me.

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,280
But I knew that if

72
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,960
I punished the Empress
in accordance with the law,

73
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,560
ministers in the court

74
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,440
would think that
there was discord between us.

75
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,040
So I made a declaration

76
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
that the Empress had angered me

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,480
and was grounded as a result.

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,040
Are you happy

79
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,760
with such an approach?

80
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,920
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,120
You're welcome.

82
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,360
Alas, I am still plagued by my sickness.

83
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
I count on you to handle

84
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,600
the endless matters in the court.

85
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,920
I wish to consult
your opinion on one matter.

86
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,560
Do tell.

87
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,440
The talent recommendation system

88
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,760
will bring a boon to our nation.

89
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,640
After several days of research
and deliberations,

90
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,640
I've decided

91
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,760
to agree with the suggestion
of the Ministry of Personnel.

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,240
We should implement the system.

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,400
I am glad to see your devotion

94
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,840
to our national welfare, Grand Tutor Ling.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,560
LING MANOR

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,560
Father. You're back.

97
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
Fortunately, this drawing

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,240
can yet be saved.

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,600
Otherwise, I'll have
to discard and redraw it.

100
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,080
Father, what did your visit
to the palace yield?

101
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,280
What did it yield?

102
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,480
His Majesty grounded Cangcang

103
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,400
so that I'd agree to let

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,680
Song Lanxi assume office in the Capital.

105
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
He used Cangcang again.

106
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,840
For my daughter,

107
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,919
I'm willing to concede.

108
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,440
- But Father…
- Don't worry.

109
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,120
If I can raise a dragon,

110
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,080
I can tame it.

111
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,880
Once Cangcang is conceived with a child,

112
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,360
a young emperor
who died before the age of 30

113
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,520
won't be a threat.

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,320
His Majesty implements
the talent recommendation system

115
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,040
in order to shuffle
the current power dynamics in court.

116
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,080
That will not do me or Liu any good.

117
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
Even if I concede, I'm sure

118
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,200
Liu will do something about it.

119
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,800
His Majesty allows
Qing to return to the Capital?

120
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,720
Yes.

121
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Because Qing has to escort that Song back?

122
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,640
Song Lanxi.

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,880
I knew he was up to no good.

124
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,440
I disagreed with
the talent recommendation system.

125
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,560
So he wants to use Qing to deal with me.

126
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,080
Calm down, Your Majesty.
His Highness is coming back.

127
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,160
You will be freed from the pain

128
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,040
of missing your son.

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,160
If Qing escorted
Song Lanxi to the Capital safely,

130
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,240
Xiao Huan would be able
to implement the new policy.

131
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,760
It would not do us any good.

132
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,560
If they had an accident, however,

133
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,760
Qing would bear full liability.

134
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,400
Xiao Huan

135
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
is getting smarter and smarter.

136
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,760
What should we do then?

137
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,720
Qing is at stake. I cannot act recklessly.

138
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,760
We'll let them
return to the Capital safely.

139
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,480
Fortunately for us, Song Lanxi

140
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,600
is only slightly popular among the nobles.

141
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,040
He is young and inexperienced.

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,680
Using him to implement the new policy

143
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,680
will not be as easy.

144
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,720
It's late now.
Her Majesty must be asleep now.

145
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Xiaoyue who serves
the Empress works for the Dowager Empress.

146
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,040
Find a way to get rid of her.

147
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,960
I don't want any unscrupulous party

148
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,080
to be working closely with her.

149
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
It'll be done, Your Majesty.

150
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
Wufu.

151
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,120
The Empress's palace
could use some decorations.

152
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,440
Find some art pieces

153
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,040
and give them to her tomorrow.

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,880
And tell her

155
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,080
that the confinement has been lifted.

156
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,680
Noted, Your Majesty.

157
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm sure Her Majesty will
appreciate Your Majesty's gesture

158
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
once she received the drawings.

159
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,360
<i>Cangcang,</i>

160
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
<i>I used you again.</i>

161
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,200
<i>You must resent me even more now.</i>

162
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,200
- Here. Roll it.
- Okay.

163
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,720
Your Majesty.

164
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,600
Have you arranged for the candidates
to enter the Capital?

165
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,440
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

166
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,880
Shi Yan has brought the candidates to Chu.

167
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,800
Fenglai Pavilion will assist further
and Prince of Yuzhang will escort them.

168
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,320
Additionally,
Lingbi Sect is now left leaderless,

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
and has suffered great loss.

170
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,720
Their disciples are vying for power now.

171
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Ling Xuefeng will not
be able to do much for now.

172
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,000
The Lingbi Sect might have fallen apart,
but it's not gone yet.

173
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,560
Even though Ling Xuefeng
has lost his forces in the martial world,

174
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,200
he still has murder thralls.

175
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,120
We cannot underestimate him.

176
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
Right.

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
But Your Majesty,

178
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,040
you are wary of the Grand Tutor.

179
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Why did you summon
Prince of Yuzhang back here?

180
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,800
Because I can profit from some infighting.

181
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,680
Your Majesty. Eunuch Feng is here.

182
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

183
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,320
You're here, Eunuch Feng.

184
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,320
His Majesty asked me

185
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,960
to bring some drawings as gifts for you.

186
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,200
Here.

187
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,920
Allow me to thank His Majesty.

188
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,240
Is he recovering from his cold sickness?

189
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,600
Worry not, Your Majesty.

190
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,440
His Majesty is doing well.
He is now discussing

191
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,320
important matters
in Wuying Hall with Grand Tutor Ling.

192
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
His Majesty sure is shrewd.

193
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
Your Majesty,

194
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,400
His Majesty misses you a lot.

195
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,600
Look.
He also asked me to come here to tell you

196
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,040
that your confinement had been lifted.

197
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,400
The drawings…

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,440
I understand, Eunuch Feng. You may return.

199
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,640
Okay.

200
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,880
By your leave.

201
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,880
Your Majesty. Do you want to look
at His Majesty's gifts?

202
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
No. Put them aside.

203
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,040
SOUTHERN CHU

204
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
FENGLAI PAVILION

205
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
LIST OF CANDIDATES

206
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,400
ZHANG YU, LIN CHUWEI

207
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,640
I only have to escort
a few people back to the Capital.

208
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,880
Why must I enlist
Fenglai Pavilion's help too?

209
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,720
The martial world is dangerous,

210
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,520
and our enemies hide in the shadows.
We must be careful.

211
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,000
Besides, it's a precondition
for your return to the Capital.

212
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
Fine.

213
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,680
I cannot defy His Majesty's decree.

214
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,960
If Fenglai Pavilion is assisting me,
how many of you will be there?

215
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,320
Zhong Lin, Vice Sect Leader
of Fenglai Pavilion,

216
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,840
will be at your service.

217
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,760
I'll escort you back to the Capital.

218
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,080
Miss Zhong, this is not right.

219
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,760
You have been managing

220
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,320
Fenglai Pavilion, Mr. Shi.

221
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm free and could use some exercise.

222
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,200
What's wrong with that?

223
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,320
You must be Miss Zhong.

224
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,400
I haven't settled
the score of that hideous tattoo.

225
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,240
And here you are, surrendering yourself.

226
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,400
Your Highness.

227
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,400
You want a peacock tattoo.

228
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,400
That's easy.

229
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,520
Once you bring me to the Capital,

230
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
I'll modify your tattoo into a peacock.

231
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,280
Bring you to the Capital?

232
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,720
Do you want to see Ling Cangcang?

233
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,840
Sorry.

234
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
I was born selfish.

235
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,960
Altruism is not in my nature.

236
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,440
What a shame.

237
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,240
Shi Yan.

238
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,400
There's only one such name list.

239
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,400
Is that right?

240
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,440
Miss Zhong. What are you doing?

241
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,360
I don't have many talents,
but I have a good memory.

242
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,840
The name, age, physical descriptions,

243
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,040
and habits

244
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
of the candidates on the name list

245
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,200
are all seared in my mind.

246
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,240
However,

247
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,200
if Your Highness insists on
not bringing me back to the Capital,

248
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,359
I'll miss Cangcang so much

249
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,960
and fall into depression.

250
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,720
When that happens,
I might just forget everything.

251
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,359
The powder you used just now…

252
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,560
It's phosphor.

253
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
And the different pouches you're carrying…

254
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
They contain different powders
with different effects.

255
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,119
Wow.

256
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,280
Miss Zhong, you are brave and smart.

257
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,720
You will come with us.

258
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,560
But no. Your Highness,
His Majesty asked me to come with you.

259
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,240
The entire Fenglai Pavilion
can come with me.

260
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
Your Highness, why did His Majesty

261
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,160
summon you back to the Capital?

262
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,040
Who knows what happened in his crazy mind?

263
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,360
But knowing him,

264
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,360
it's not a good thing.

265
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
But I haven't returned in many years.

266
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,480
I do miss Mother and Ying.

267
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
FENGLAI PAVILION

268
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,360
We'll cross the bridge when we get there.

269
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,880
Zhong Lin is witty and cunning.

270
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Why did you pick her, Your Highness?

271
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,520
Are you dumb?

272
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,400
Shi Yan works for His Majesty.

273
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,680
Right.

274
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
Putting you on escort duty must be a trap.

275
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,320
If Shi Yan pulls
a trick during the journey

276
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
and the candidates are in danger,
you'll be implicated.

277
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,160
Zhong Li doesn't get
along with Shi Yan well.

278
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,600
Wise choice, Your Highness.
Ask everyone in the manor to get ready.

279
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,160
- I want to return to the Capital already.
- Are you not taking me, Your Highness?

280
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,560
For you to mess everything up?

281
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,040
Stay here to watch Shi Yan closely.

282
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,320
Your Majesty,
for once, you're in a good mood.

283
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,640
Did something good happen?

284
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,040
A friend outside of
the palace wrote to me,

285
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,400
saying that she'd be in the Capital soon.

286
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,760
Speaking of which,
we haven't met for a while. I miss her.

287
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,000
How wonderful.

288
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,680
I'm happy for you, Your Majesty.

289
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,040
<i>The Begonia Pendant lit up.</i>

290
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,840
PRISTINE INTEGRITY

291
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,000
What is this place?

292
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,760
Your Majesty,

293
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,080
this is the cold palace
where Princess Ying resides.

294
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
A cold palace?

295
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,040
How come I've never heard of this place?

296
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,000
And who is Princess Ying?

297
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,640
It's only normal
that you did not know, Your Majesty.

298
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,440
Princess Ying is
a taboo subject in the palace.

299
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
No one brings her up.

300
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,720
Tell me more.

301
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,800
Tell me. We are alone here.

302
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,560
Well,

303
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,840
Princess Ying is
the Empress Dowager's adoptive daughter.

304
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,000
Her birth mother passed away early.

305
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Prince of Yuzhang
brought her back to Xuanguang Hall.

306
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,880
When she was little,
she was close to His Majesty.

307
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,640
But then, there was
an inferno all of a sudden

308
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,640
and she almost lost her life there.

309
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,280
Princess Ying suffered a great shock.

310
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,880
She became addled upon being rescued.

311
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,160
They had no choice

312
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,560
but to put her here.

313
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,120
An inferno all of a sudden?

314
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,480
Why would the Empress Dowager
let her only daughter

315
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,080
stay in such a forsaken place?

316
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,120
Actually,

317
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,080
that is Princess Ying's own decision.

318
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,720
After she survived the inferno,

319
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,240
she became afraid of her own palace.

320
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,040
But wherever she relocated to,

321
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,400
she would run out in distress.

322
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,720
She only manages to calm herself down

323
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,360
in the cold palace.

324
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,080
The Empress Dowager had no other choice.

325
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,960
Let's go.

326
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
<i>The Begonia Pendant never lights up,</i>

327
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,400
<i>but it reacts to the cold palace.</i>

328
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,400
<i>How odd.</i>

329
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,040
Do not touch my belongings!

330
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,160
XIAO YING, PRINCESS OF GREAT QI

331
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
I do not like you.

332
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,920
Go away.

333
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,040
You don't know me.

334
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,080
Why do you not like me?

335
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,800
I know who you are.

336
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,120
His Majesty got married the other day.

337
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,560
No one invited me,

338
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
but I snuck out to watch the ceremony.

339
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,520
I hate you.

340
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,800
I hate anyone who has ties with Xiao Huan.

341
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,080
Then you should like me.

342
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,960
Because I hate Xiao Huan too.

343
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,760
Why did you marry him then?

344
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,400
I had no choice.

345
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,160
You are able-bodied.

346
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,080
What do you mean you had no choice?

347
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,520
I came to ask you something.

348
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,440
Maybe you could help me.

349
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,760
Do you recognize this Begonia Pendant?

350
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,480
If you kill Xiao Huan for me,

351
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,160
I'll tell you everything.

352
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,120
What?

353
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
You don't want him killed?

354
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,680
Then you don't hate him for real.

355
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,240
Go away.

356
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,440
I want him killed.

357
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,720
But he is the Emperor.
No one can kill him easily.

358
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,560
I can.

359
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
What? Are you scared now?

360
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,840
If you are scared, you can still run.

361
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,480
Otherwise, I might kill you too.

362
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,160
You only chase me out because you can't

363
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,120
answer my question.

364
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,840
You don't know what it is at all.

365
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
And you don't know why it lit up.

366
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,720
- I do!
- Then tell me.

367
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,960
Azure firefly.

368
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,000
You know many things.

369
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,960
Yes. This is an azure firefly as
recorded in the Tome of All Venom

370
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,640
It grew up ingesting
the poisonous powder I made.

371
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,120
It is afraid of my pendant.

372
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,120
Amazing.

373
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,400
It scares my firefly.

374
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,360
Your pendant

375
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,280
must have contained Wanwei Herb,

376
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,520
a precious herb

377
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,720
that will light up to expel
all venomous creatures near it.

378
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,880
With it,

379
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,600
no venomous bugs can hurt you.

380
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,440
<i>Why would Master</i>
<i>give me a special artifact</i>

381
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,400
<i>as an ordinary accessory?</i>

382
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,160
Where did you get this amazing artifact?

383
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
My master gave it to me.

384
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,040
Your master is so sweet.

385
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,440
He was very kind to me.

386
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,880
But

387
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,480
he was killed.

388
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,600
By Xiao Huan?

389
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,880
That's why you hate him.

390
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,720
Yes.

391
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,960
I have a limitless supply of poisons.

392
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
I can help you kill him.

393
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,080
Your Majesty,
Her Majesty went to the cold palace.

394
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,240
Cold palace?

395
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,280
What for?

396
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,640
Princess Ying said
she wanted to help her kill you.

397
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,240
Your Majesty,

398
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,200
allow me to bring her back.

399
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,360
No need.

400
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,040
Your Majesty,
I am worried about Her Majesty.

401
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,520
Princess Ying might hurt her.

402
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,480
She won't.

403
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,560
They have a common enemy.

404
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,320
Xiao Ying wants to use her to kill me.
She won't hurt her.

405
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,520
Worry not, Your Majesty.
Her Majesty did not agree to her request.

406
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,280
LINGHE HALL

407
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,520
Stop drinking, Your Majesty.
It's bad for your health.

408
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,960
No,

409
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
it's bad if I don't drink it.

410
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,920
You're drunk, Your Majesty.
You should stop drinking.

411
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,800
Drunk?

412
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,080
I'm not drunk.

413
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,480
You don't believe me?

414
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,920
Come.

415
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Let's have an arm wrestle.

416
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,880
Zhong Lin and I played it a lot.

417
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,440
And she never won.

418
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,360
- Come.
- Your Majesty, you're teasing me again.

419
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,640
You're a heroine.

420
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,440
I can't win even if you're drunk.

421
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,520
Heroine?

422
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
I'm not a heroine.

423
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
I'm just

424
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,320
a caged canary bird.

425
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,160
Drink up!

426
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,960
Be careful, Your Majesty.

427
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,360
You soaked the drawings.

428
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,760
Your Majesty, I didn't
expect to see this side of you.

429
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,080
You're so cool

430
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,400
and free-spirited.

431
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm sure the author of this drawing

432
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
must be very close to you.

433
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,360
Why do you say so?

434
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,320
Because Your Majesty
smiles so brightly in the drawing.

435
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,600
I've never seen you like this.

436
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,200
His Majesty has arrived.

437
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,880
Why did you come here?

438
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,280
To apologize.

439
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,360
Apologize?

440
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,720
I spiked your drink.

441
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
You committed no fault.

442
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,440
If that's the case,

443
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,600
would you want to drink with me?

444
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,280
What if I poisoned you again?

445
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,040
It doesn't matter.

446
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,240
Come.

447
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,800
Drink up.

448
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,440
Do you remember

449
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,880
the first time we climbed to the roof?

450
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,880
The audacity of you to bring it up.

451
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,960
I bet

452
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,080
I've always been the bargaining chip

453
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,640
for you to fight against my father.

454
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,680
Tell me now.

455
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,480
What is your agenda this time?

456
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Whatever justification

457
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,520
I bring up will be useless.

458
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,760
Exactly.

459
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,200
I don't believe

460
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
in any word you say.

461
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
What about the Phoenix Seal?

462
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,520
Do you still want it?

463
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,960
What?

464
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
Are you helping me?

465
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,520
Or lying to me?

466
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,120
Lying to me again.

467
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,560
Come.

468
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,480
Drink up.

469
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,440
Look. Our relationship

470
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,400
is just

471
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,760
like this cup.

472
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,080
It's broken.

473
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,520
It's broken.

474
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
No.

475
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,320
Our relationship

476
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
is just a pipe dream of mine.

477
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
Cangcang. You're drunk.

478
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,600
No, I'm not.

479
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,680
I just

480
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,440
don't get it.

481
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,320
Why did you kill my master?

482
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,040
I don't get it.

483
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,080
Did you approach me

484
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,040
just to kill my master?

485
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,080
Cangcang.

486
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,120
I'm serious about you.

487
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,760
And your serious commitment

488
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,440
can kill.

489
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,560
Drink up!

490
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,760
Are you happy?

491
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
Let's find our new ally.

492
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,080
No wonder you won't kill Xiao Huan.

493
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,280
He

494
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,440
likes you.

495
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,680
Come in, mister.

496
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,280
I'm coming!

497
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Come inside.

498
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,600
How may I help, sir?

499
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,440
It's summer now.

500
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
You must have fresh pufferfish.

501
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,560
We are a group of 30-something travelers.

502
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,160
One braised pufferfish
with rushes for everyone, please.

503
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,800
Sir,

504
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
we do have pufferfish.

505
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,200
But unfortunately, we don't have a chef

506
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,240
who can cook pufferfish here.

507
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,720
Gold?

508
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,680
You shall have fresh pufferfish tonight!

509
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,120
You will be served our best Sangluo Wine

510
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
as well.

511
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,640
Come. Follow me.

512
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,160
Let's go.

513
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Xiao Qianqing made
a huge deal out of his escort duty

514
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,520
with regards to the candidates.

515
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,320
Everyone knows about it.

516
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,480
I found

517
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,800
this new blade for you.

518
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,800
It's light and gentle.

519
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,640
You have trouble using a blade
due to your missing right index finger.

520
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,360
This blade will suit you well.

521
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,000
Thank you, Father.

522
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
Xiao Qianqing.

523
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,960
They call him the Peacock Prince.

524
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,640
He isn't as superficial as he seems.

525
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
He's returning to the Capital in grandeur

526
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,160
because he wants to meddle
in the implementation of the new system.

527
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
We cannot give him
the opportunity to do this.

528
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,320
You must

529
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,080
eliminate Song Lanxi and the rest.

530
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,800
Kill everyone you think is your target.

531
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,800
I know you are rich,

532
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,160
but it's better to lie low

533
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,560
when you're escorting
someone to the Capital.

534
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,080
A humble peacock

535
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,000
is no different from a fowl.

536
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,400
If someone has ill intentions,

537
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,440
being discreet will not make a difference.

538
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,760
You're so gullible.

539
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,720
An unfallen mulberry leaf

540
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,720
is endowed with plump leaves.

541
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
A fallen mulberry leaf

542
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
is crisp and mellow.

543
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,920
The Sangluo Wine
mustn't be savored like this.

544
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,240
Servants!

545
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,520
- Sir.
- Bring my ice here.

546
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,440
Sure.

547
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,040
You are a heroine, yes.

548
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,680
But rolling your eyes

549
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,960
is an indecent thing to do.

550
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,840
I will attend to other officials.
Enjoy your meal.

551
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,880
I have a question.

552
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,960
Song Lanxi is just a new, lowly candidate.

553
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,880
Why must we kill him?

554
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Who Song Lanxi is doesn't matter.

555
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,120
What matters

556
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,560
is his tutor, Li Chengtian.

557
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,680
He was my rival
in the court for many years,

558
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,600
and gave me many headaches.

559
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,600
While he retired many years ago,

560
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,080
his influence runs deep

561
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,400
and can still be felt.

562
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,720
The moral ones
in the court view him as a leader.

563
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,600
I understand now.

564
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,280
If Xiao Huan uses Song Lanxi to entice

565
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,280
Li Chengtian into coming back,

566
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,480
that will be a threat to us.

567
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,440
Song Lanxi

568
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,840
is Li Chengtian's student
after he went into retirement.

569
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,840
Not many know that.

570
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,960
Even I only found out recently.

571
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,520
Again, His Majesty

572
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,040
is one step ahead of me.

573
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,640
It's my fault.

574
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,480
We have lost our head start.

575
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,600
You cannot make any mistakes now.

576
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,000
And make sure to leave no traces behind
that reveal who you are.

577
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,400
Yes, Father.

578
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,320
I will not let you down.

579
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,360
Your Majesty, please put it on.

580
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,600
It's okay. I'm not cold.

581
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,880
Your Majesty, it's late and misty now.

582
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,080
Even if you're not cold,
you must make sure you won't catch a cold.

583
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,520
I'm fine.

584
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,120
This is…

585
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,160
Someone wants to see me.

586
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,160
They worked together flawlessly

587
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,920
and killed them in one slash.

588
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
They left none alive.

589
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,400
What a professional group of assassins.

590
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,200
It's good that you found criminals
on the death row to impersonate them.

591
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,320
Do you understand why
I maintain a high profile now?

592
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,160
Yes.

593
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,360
It's just a small trick.

594
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,680
What small trick?

595
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,760
I am brave and wise.

596
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,280
My tactics are unrivaled.

597
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,120
We still have to exercise caution.

598
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,080
The Capital is far.

599
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,640
We might run into another incident.

600
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,560
I must live till I get to the Capital
and find Cangcang.

601
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,600
Don't worry. You can count on me.

602
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,520
Bad news!

603
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,560
Bad news!

604
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,600
Your Highness. Official Song…

605
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,840
- What happened?
- For some reason, Official Song

606
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,160
left on his own.

607
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
When I found him,

608
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,680
he was barely alive.

609
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,600
He will die soon.

610
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,920
We did everything we could,
but it was still not enough.

611
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,640
What do we do now?

612
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,920
Official Song is a priority.

613
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,200
<i>If something happens to him,</i>

614
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,800
<i>Xiao Huan will say</i>
<i>that I failed in my duty to escort him.</i>

615
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,520
<i>I cannot let this happen.</i>

616
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,720
<i>Let me think of a solution.</i>
