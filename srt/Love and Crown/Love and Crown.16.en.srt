ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,720
Minjia.

3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,080
Cangcang? What brings you here?

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,080
Nothing much is happening in camp,
so I came out to stretch my legs.

5
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Perfect timing.
I was just about to brush the horses.

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
Come on.

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
I'll help you.

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,760
<i>I can tell,</i>
<i>you still have feelings for him.</i>

9
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,920
<i>If you really didn't care about him,</i>
<i>you wouldn't be so bitter.</i>

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,760
<i>You say you're over him,</i>

11
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,560
but you're still hung up
on everything he did.

12
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Honestly,

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,320
you love him so deeply,
that's why you hate him so much.

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,560
Mr. Bai, you're here too?

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
What a coincidence.

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Are you both here
to help me brush the horses?

17
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,160
Then come on, let's do it together.

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,680
Stop hiding.

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,080
The more you hide, the more it shows

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,520
you still care about him.

21
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Her Highness sent me over
to grab two more brushes.

22
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,800
Understood.

23
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,160
I've long heard General Kumor

24
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
is the most respected general in Xijiang.

25
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,000
Now I know the tales are true.

26
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,800
Of course.

27
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,320
Our general is the finest under heaven!

28
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,480
Ever since he joined the army,
he's gone on rounds every night,

29
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,920
rain or shine, never missing a single day.

30
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,840
General Kumor is the pride of Xijiang!

31
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,640
Here you are.

32
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
Thanks.

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,520
Cangcang, why are you still here?

34
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,920
Didn't Preceptor Du take you away?

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,320
Preceptor Du?

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,800
She never meat to take me with her.

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
And wasn't that what you ordered?

38
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,760
She had no intention of taking you?

39
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,320
Cangcang,

40
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,960
in your eyes,
am really I that kind of man?

41
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,360
In my eyes,

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
you only come to me
when you want something.

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
That's who you are.

44
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,040
Who knows this time
what you're really after.

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,440
- I'll find a way to get you out of here.
- No need.

46
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
I have my own reasons for staying.

47
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,840
Don't trouble yourself.

48
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
The court is swamped with affairs.

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Your Majesty should return soon.

50
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
- Let's go.
- Yes, Sir.

51
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,560
- The horses ran off!
- Go after them!

52
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
<i>So there was a mechanism.</i>

53
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,920
<i>Cangcang…</i>

54
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
<i>As expected.</i>

55
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,720
It's me.

56
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,640
What are you doing here?

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
If I'm not mistaken,
we're here for the same thing.

58
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,240
There are mechanisms here. I'll handle it.

59
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,680
MILITARY DEPLOYMENT MAP

60
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,480
With war about to break out,

61
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,360
we must tighten our defenses.

62
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,000
If you see anyone suspicious,
report it at once.

63
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Yes, Sir!

64
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
Take the map and go.

65
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
- I'll go out and draw him away.
- No need!

66
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
All units on alert!

67
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
- Take some men and come with me!
- Yes, Sir!

68
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,880
That signal arrow just now
must've been fired

69
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,400
from the snowy peak a few miles away.

70
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,120
It must be the signal for a sneak attack.

71
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
Ling Jueding just took a spin
outside the city

72
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,160
without making any real move at all.

73
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,520
The enemy is
clearly trying to throw us off.

74
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,880
What are they really up to?

75
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,720
The Military Deployment Map!

76
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,760
If the map is gone,

77
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,320
Kumor will surely lock down
the whole camp.

78
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,680
Then it won't be so easy
to get the map out.

79
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,760
MILITARY DEPLOYMENT MAP

80
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,000
PATROLS; CROSSBOWMEN

81
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,840
I'll find a way to get the map out.

82
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,880
So you really stayed for this.

83
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,120
Do you know how dangerous this is?

84
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,440
- Leave the map to me. I'll get it out.
- No way!

85
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,560
It's already really dangerous
for you here.

86
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,840
We can't risk you getting hurt!

87
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,160
So you are worried about me?

88
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm not caring about you.

89
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,320
I just know an empire
can't go a day without its emperor.

90
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,640
Cangcang,

91
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,640
if one day, I'm no longer here,

92
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,160
will you still hate me like this?

93
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
Don't jinx it.

94
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,040
Scoundrels live long. You are not dying.

95
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,400
What if I really did?

96
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,760
If…

97
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,680
If you really died,

98
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,480
I wouldn't even visit your grave.

99
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
So you'd better stay alive for me.

100
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,640
Let go of me.

101
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,920
I promised
to deliver this map to Ling Jueding.

102
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,680
Once I get
Kumor's Military Deployment Map,

103
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,480
I'll find a way to leave it

104
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,440
in the woods
three li outside the enemy camp.

105
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
There's a cluster of three stones.

106
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,440
You can send men there to check every day.

107
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,160
I will not fail Your Majesty's trust.

108
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,400
Once I have the map,
I'll send out the troops at once

109
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
and wipe out
Kumor's rebel forces in one strike.

110
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
No.

111
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,840
That's not the outcome I want.

112
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Kumor's revolt this time

113
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
is entirely because
of the snow disaster in Xijiang.

114
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
The people there can hardly survive
and had no choice but to rebel.

115
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,400
Which shows

116
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,520
Kumor is also a lord
speaking up for his people.

117
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,120
So, what you must do

118
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,080
is work with the Xiaoxing Guards

119
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,560
to end this war
with the least possible bloodshed.

120
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,200
I understand, Your Majesty!

121
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,560
So you two had this planned all along.

122
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,440
That's right.

123
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,920
So that signal arrow just now

124
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
was also part of your secret coordination?

125
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,800
You could call it that,
and a bit of luck too.

126
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Just how many things
are you still keeping from me?

127
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,440
Ever since I got here,
you've barely even looked at me.

128
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,360
I didn't get the chance to say anything!

129
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,280
With your brains, Mr. Bai,
if you really wanted to tell me,

130
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,600
you'd have a hundred ways.

131
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm afraid from the very start,
you never meant to tell me at all.

132
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,960
Good thing our ideas still line up.

133
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,000
Guess we're a bit on the same wavelength.

134
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,560
Who's on the same wavelength with you?

135
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,800
Cangcang?

136
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,320
Your Highness.
I've already turned in for the night!

137
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,880
My brother just said

138
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,120
Ling Jueding wants to launch
a sneak attack

139
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,080
and told me to check on you.

140
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,840
Cangcang!

141
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,160
Cangcang, are you all right?

142
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,600
You… you two…

143
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,640
Your Highness,

144
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
staring at us like that
isn't exactly proper, right?

145
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,000
So sorry! I'll stop bothering you.

146
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,240
Get out.

147
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,360
Kuminjia just left.

148
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,280
If I walk out now,
won't that prove we were faking it?

149
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
If you ask me,

150
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,560
I should stay here a little longer.

151
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,320
Only then will people believe
our little act was real.

152
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm only playing along like this
because of the situation.

153
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,960
Don't read anything into it.
Don't get the wrong idea.

154
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
What are you trying to say?

155
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm saying

156
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,680
since there's no going back for us,

157
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,640
let's stop clinging to each other.

158
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
I'll help you get the map out.

159
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,360
Stay away from me after this.

160
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
If you want to stay here, then stay.

161
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm leaving.

162
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's cold outside. This is your tent.

163
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,200
I should be the one to go.

164
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,560
<i>I'm saying</i>

165
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
since there's no going back for us,

166
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,640
let's stop clinging to each other.

167
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,599
Mr. Bai,

168
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,640
why the long face?

169
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,200
Where's Cangcang?

170
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,359
Didn't you two rekindle your old flame?

171
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,200
Get back together?
If only it were that easy.

172
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,720
You were fine just yesterday.

173
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,760
How come she doesn't like you again today?

174
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,720
It's my fault.

175
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,000
Cangcang once said
she wanted to visit Xijiang

176
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,920
for the most beautiful grasslands

177
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,480
and the most beautiful snow mountains.

178
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,840
She wanted to ride across them with me.

179
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,200
But I promised her
and never kept that promise.

180
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,640
When we brought it up last night,

181
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,440
she got mad at me.

182
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,880
Then just go. What's so hard about that?

183
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
The general ordered
that we're not allowed to leave the camp.

184
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,960
We're in a truce right now.

185
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,360
What's the big deal?

186
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,760
You've got me anyway.
I'll go with you both!

187
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,760
Cangcang still holds it against me.

188
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,360
She won't agree.

189
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,200
Mr. Bai,

190
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,080
you really don't understand women at all.

191
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,560
Cangcang, Mr. Bai and I are going hunting.

192
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Do you want to come?

193
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
You're going out hunting?

194
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,320
Yeah. Just the two of us.

195
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,200
<i>This is actually the perfect chance</i>
<i>to get the map out.</i>

196
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,560
Cangcang, don't you want to come with us?

197
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,800
You ride and shoot so well.

198
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,760
You're no less skilled
than us grassland folk.

199
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,960
Well?

200
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,640
My hands are itching for a match anyway.

201
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,880
Dare to have a contest?

202
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
Contest in what?

203
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,640
Hunting, of course.

204
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
Whoever wins,

205
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,200
Mr. Bai has to wait on them tonight.

206
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
How about it?

207
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
Fine.

208
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
Very well.

209
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,160
Then tonight, just let him wait on you.

210
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you actually like him or not?

211
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,320
Last night, I saw you two

212
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
sharing the same bed.

213
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,600
So do you really not care,
or are you jealous?

214
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,840
Who says I'm jealous?

215
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
What she means is,

216
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,640
alive or dead, I'm hers all the same.

217
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,040
- She'd never get jealous.
- Hey…

218
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,320
<i>When did I ever say that?</i>

219
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,520
<i>You want her to see right through us?</i>

220
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
All right, we're just teasing you.

221
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,400
I don't need him waiting on me anyway.

222
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,520
Let's go!

223
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,680
<i>With all these soldiers tailing us,</i>

224
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,160
<i>I have to shake them off</i>
<i>to get the map out.</i>

225
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,960
Your Highness,

226
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,840
are we really just hunting like this?

227
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,920
Why? Do you really want that contest?

228
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,040
Of course.

229
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,760
I need to prove myself to Cangcang.

230
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,080
You really are persistent.

231
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,640
Cangcang, what do you think?

232
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,160
If we really do compete,

233
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,640
he might not even be a match for us.

234
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,360
All right.

235
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,000
In that case,
let's have ourselves a contest.

236
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,680
Mr. Bai, if you win,

237
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,200
I'll be the witness to you two.

238
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,560
But if your skills fall short,

239
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,800
then from now on,
stop clinging to our heroine Cangcang.

240
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,880
- Deal. What are the rules?
- Couldn't be simpler.

241
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,200
Within an hour,

242
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,800
whoever brings back more game wins.

243
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,760
- What about the hunting range?
- Go wherever you like.

244
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,880
But if you're not back in an hour,

245
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,400
your catch won't count
no matter how big it is.

246
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
- All right. Then let's begin!
- Start the clock!

247
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,520
Cangcang's this nervous about the result.

248
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,640
Looks like she's really not into you.

249
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
You're doomed.

250
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,160
Your Highness, we only just started.

251
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,560
Don't write me off so quickly.
What if I win?

252
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
All right. I'll be waiting to see.

253
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,280
Lin Cangcang,

254
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,880
if you lose,
I'm going to set you up with Mr. Bai.

255
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,560
It's a bit early to be calling it now.

256
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,120
Kumor, what are you doing here?

257
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,240
I had some free time today.

258
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,640
I heard you were out hunting here,
so I came to take a look.

259
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,040
- Where's Mr. Bai?
- He…

260
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,240
I just saw him chasing after a young deer.

261
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,000
Guess he's really desperate to win.
The match isn't over yet, right?

262
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
Your Highness, you've got five kills,

263
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
and Miss Lin has five as well.

264
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,760
Didn't expect you to be this good.

265
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,120
Now it all depends on Mr. Bai.

266
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,840
<i>He still isn't back.</i>

267
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,200
<i>If Kumor discovers our plan…</i>

268
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,600
Mr. Bai, how did you do?

269
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,120
With an hour out there,

270
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm sure you brought in quite a haul.

271
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,040
Here, take a look.

272
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,360
<i>With this much game,</i>

273
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
<i>Kumor won't suspect</i>
<i>he had time to do anything else.</i>

274
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,800
Your riding and archery are impressive.

275
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,160
You have my respect.

276
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
Your Highness,
how exactly are you planning to help me?

277
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,840
No matter how she helps, I'm not into you.

278
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,360
I'll go talk to her for you.

279
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,560
I didn't expect you to be a real hunter.

280
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,960
You flatter me.

281
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,160
I had to give it my all
just to please Cangcang.

282
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
Ever heard the saying,

283
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,160
"Forced love never turns out sweet"?

284
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,560
Cangcang gave up on you long ago.

285
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,760
And have you ever heard,

286
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,200
"Sincerity can move even stone"?

287
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,800
You really are stubborn.

288
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,720
You're just as stubborn as I am.

289
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,080
Mr. Bai,

290
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,720
what do you mean by that?

291
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,600
You refuse to pull your troops back.

292
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,520
Isn't that stubbornness too?

293
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,200
You're just a wandering swordsman,

294
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,520
yet you dare lecture me on war?

295
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,040
Aren't you afraid
I'll start doubting who you really are?

296
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
All I'm saying is,

297
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,120
you're not a man who kills for pleasure.

298
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Whether it's your soldiers
or the common folk,

299
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,400
you value every life.

300
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
But if you insist on not withdrawing,

301
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,800
once you go to war with Great Qi,

302
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,800
many lives will be lost.

303
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,040
Since the status verification system
was put in place,

304
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,480
generations of hard work
from Xijiang folks vanished overnight!

305
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,200
Then came a year of disaster,

306
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,360
with corpses of the starved
all over the land.

307
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,800
You think I want to fight?

308
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,680
If my people could just live in peace,

309
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
who would choose to live by the blade?

310
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,320
War is never the best choice.

311
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,720
For me, the best choice

312
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,520
is letting my people live better lives.

313
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,560
But war will
only make more innocent people die.

314
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,920
Have you ever considered
ending this peacefully?

315
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,320
The weak are meat for the strong.
Only the fittest survive.

316
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
Even if I were willing,

317
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,520
would that rotten emperor agree?

318
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,200
You won't know unless you try.

319
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Bai Chifan,

320
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,080
you're undermining the troops' morale!

321
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,600
I wouldn't dare.

322
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,680
I just feel

323
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,320
if you truly put your people first,

324
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,640
then it's worth taking the long view.

325
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,040
During this time,
you must not use your inner force!

326
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,120
If the poison reaches your heart,

327
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,760
even I may be powerless to save you.

328
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,840
<i>I've already lost so much time.</i>

329
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,040
<i>There's barely any left to hunt.</i>

330
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,920
<i>But if I come back empty-handed,</i>
<i>it will surely arouse suspicion.</i>

331
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,560
<i>It's only late autumn</i>
<i>in the Central Plains,</i>

332
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,440
<i>but it's already winter out here.</i>

333
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,680
<i>Today's bitter cold</i>
<i>means a blizzard is coming.</i>

334
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,160
<i>Cangcang has to leave this place</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

335
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,280
Eat up!

336
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,200
Fill it up!

337
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,600
Guys! The meat's here!

338
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,000
- Hurry up!
- Drink up!

339
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,080
Have a drink!

340
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,680
Another one!

341
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,520
Down it!

342
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,120
Drain it!

343
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,560
Here! Pour it!

344
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,240
Mr. Bai! Get over here!

345
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,440
Deputy General Zhang got us
the best cuts of meat!

346
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,640
Have a drink!

347
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,200
Smells amazing!

348
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,400
Coming!

349
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,800
- Fill it up!
- Fill my cup!

350
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,080
Come on, have another piece!

351
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

352
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,120
Minjia, sit here.

353
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,160
- Okay.
- Come for more when you're done!

354
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,680
This is mutton boiled in ice water.

355
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,360
It's how we grassland folk eat it.

356
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
Come and try.

357
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,520
How come there's suddenly so much mutton?

358
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,440
The General's supplies have arrived?

359
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,640
Should be. No idea.

360
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,920
Whatever, let's eat!

361
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,880
Sir!

362
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,360
Deputy General Zhang,

363
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,760
I said

364
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,520
no one was to harass the common folk!

365
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Why did you disobey my orders?

366
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,560
Spare us, Sir!

367
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Sir,

368
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,600
Deputy General Zhang really had no choice.

369
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,000
Our supplies are almost gone.

370
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,920
The soldiers have been living
on plain rice porridge for days.

371
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,280
If this keeps up,
before we even reach the walls,

372
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,000
our morale will be crushed!

373
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,600
Deputy General Zhang has defied orders.

374
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Twenty lashes!

375
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,600
Let that be a warning!

376
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,360
Yes, Sir.

377
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,880
Men, hear my order!

378
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,080
The meat you're boiling right now

379
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,520
was all seized from the villagers!

380
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,680
Whatever you've eaten,

381
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,720
you'll pay back in full!

382
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
The rest goes back exactly as it is!

383
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,160
Supplies are already on the way.

384
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
Starting tomorrow,

385
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,920
I'll send a small unit out
to hunt every day.

386
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,920
I give you my word:

387
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,760
I won't let any of you starve!

388
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,360
But from this day on,

389
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,880
if anyone dares bother the people again,

390
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,840
- I will not let it slide!
- Yes, Sir!

391
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,440
You want my poison powder?

392
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,400
Ying,

393
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,200
is there any way

394
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,720
to make some poison or powder

395
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,880
that will infect the locusts
but leave the flowers unharmed?

396
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,920
And the poison has to spread fast.

397
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,800
Spread to the Emperor?

398
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,960
No, spread to other bugs.

399
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,400
So you want a poison or powder

400
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,880
that kills the insects
but not the flowers…

401
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,480
- is that it?
- Exactly!

402
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,360
You're really clever.

403
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,160
No.

404
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,240
I don't have anything like that.

405
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,960
It's fine.

406
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,600
I was just asking.

407
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,600
But I can try to mix something.

408
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,960
But Qianqing,

409
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,400
you have to promise me one thing.

410
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,720
Let's hear it first.

411
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,120
Relax.

412
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,480
This time,

413
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,239
I'm not after the Emperor's life.

414
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,199
Your Highness.

415
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,000
His Highness asked me to help you

416
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,320
with an experiment
that will benefit the realm.

417
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,800
Let's begin.

418
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,280
At this time of year,

419
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,760
how are there still fireflies?

420
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,280
All these bugs
are dusted with my glowing powder.

421
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,760
Pretty, aren't they?

422
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,400
They are.

423
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,480
Do you like them?

424
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,760
Let's stay here and watch,

425
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,560
see how long it takes

426
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,680
before they all…

427
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,840
one by one…

428
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,440
one by one…

429
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
die out!

430
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,040
The three days are up.

431
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,000
Your Highness,
please give the order at once

432
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,400
to release grain to Jiangzhou.

433
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,320
You truly live for the country.

434
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,280
You worry day and night over Jiangzhou.

435
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,520
Aren't you afraid
you'll work yourself sick?

436
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,360
Easing Great Qi's troubles
is simply my duty.

437
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,400
As a subject of the realm,

438
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,560
I trust Your Highness feels the same.

439
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,320
Of course.

440
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,880
What did that memorial from Xuzhou
say again?

441
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,280
Ah yes, I remember.

442
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,440
It claimed the Governor of Xuzhou

443
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,800
had the disaster under control

444
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,080
and all was well.

445
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,000
Yet the reports I received say

446
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,960
the Xuzhou officials
neglected their duties

447
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,360
and the disaster is long out of hand!

448
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,920
If Your Highness has doubts,

449
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,120
you can send people to investigate.

450
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,080
But the army grain for Jiangzhou
keeps being delayed.

451
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,320
If you ignore the lives
of the border troops,

452
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,760
I'm afraid you cannot shrug off the blame.

453
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,680
So what you mean is

454
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,560
that we must settle the matter

455
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,880
of Jiangzhou's grain today?

456
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,120
We must.

457
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,320
Very well!

458
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,680
Bring ink and brush.

459
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,560
Eunuch Feng,

460
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,160
what's today's date?

461
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,360
Your Highness, it is Year Nine of Yongxi…

462
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
All right.

463
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,280
I remember now.

464
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,360
<i>Zhong Lin, if you don't get back soon,</i>

465
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,240
<i>I'll lose this whole game.</i>

466
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,880
Urgent dispatch from Xuzhou!

467
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,760
MEMORIAL FROM THE GOVERNOR OF XUZHOU

468
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,480
LOCUST PLAGUE HAS LEFT THE PEOPLE
STARVING AND DISPLACED

469
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,160
Mr. Song, you must be weary from the road.
Please, rise.

470
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,080
Thank you.

471
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,840
Your Highness,

472
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,280
the locust plague in Xuzhou is severe.

473
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,720
The prefecture office was slow to respond,

474
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,080
leaving the people without grain
and refugees on the move.

475
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,760
Neighboring prefectures have
already been affected.

476
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,920
Soon, this tide of refugees

477
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,200
may even reach the capital.

478
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,360
How dare he!

479
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,760
- Indeed.
- That's deceiving the throne!

480
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,280
Just as I thought.

481
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,280
The Governor of Xuzhou is bold indeed

482
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,880
to lie in a report to the throne!

483
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,840
Someone took the chance

484
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,160
to collude with the Governor

485
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,080
to seal the city off for a time.

486
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,440
No one was allowed in or out,

487
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,480
hoping to grind Xuzhou down
into a dead city!

488
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,800
I have fulfilled my duty

489
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,920
and brought back
the Governor's letter of confession.

490
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,400
MEMORIAL FROM THE GOVERNOR OF XUZHOU

491
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,600
The proof is here.

492
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,360
Grand Tutor Ling,
do you have a plan to deal with this?

493
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,920
That brat Xiao Qianqing
went behind my back,

494
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,880
and turned the tables on me in court.

495
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,040
He only did this to force my hand

496
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,560
into raising grain for him.

497
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,440
My Lord,

498
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,560
sacrificing the Governor of Xuzhou
as a pawn

499
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,200
won't really hurt our foundations.

500
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,120
It's just that
the army grain for Jiangzhou…

501
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,440
It really can't be delayed any longer.

502
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,160
And the grain merchants?

503
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,400
None of them
can raise grain on short notice?

504
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,960
No, Sir.

505
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,720
Which one

506
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,200
complained the loudest about his troubles?

507
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,440
Wan of Wan's Rice Shop.

508
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,400
He claims he's taken a huge loss.

509
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,520
I see.

510
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,240
Fine.

511
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,680
You'll pay him a visit yourself

512
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,360
and bring Mr. Wan…

513
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,720
a little "comfort".

514
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,280
Yes, My Lord.

515
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,760
WAN'S WINERY

516
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,640
WAN'S RICE SHOP

517
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
Your Highness,

518
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,720
Grand Tutor Ling
has secured grain this morning.

519
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,440
Together with the surplus
in the national granary,

520
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,800
it's enough to cover Jiangzhou
and Xuzhou's needs.

521
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,320
Forcing him to show his hand…

522
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,200
all my scheming was worth it.

523
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,080
By the way, any news from Jiangzhou?
