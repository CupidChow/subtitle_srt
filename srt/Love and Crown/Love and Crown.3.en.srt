00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,920
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
<i>She must be Ling Cangcang.</i>

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>Huan always moves with a goal in mind.</i>

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,280
<i>So he is after her.</i>

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,120
I've long admired Miss Ling,
your sect's leader,

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,080
and always wished to meet her,

7
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,040
but official duties kept me too busy.

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,280
Busy with official duties?
Aren't you known for being quite idle?

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
You've actually met Miss Ling.

10
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,160
She was the one
who tattooed you last time.

11
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
With your sect's leader and you

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,880
both so brave and clever,

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,120
Mr. Bai here must be

14
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,560
no ordinary man either.

15
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,600
Naturally.

16
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,520
Then why not have Mr. Bai

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,280
perform a sword dance

18
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,920
to enliven this gathering?

19
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,160
Your Highness,

20
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,280
I don't think that's necessary.

21
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
We're swordsmen, not…

22
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
Since Your Highness
wishes to be entertained,

23
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,480
I shall oblige.

24
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,040
Has Mr. Bai lost his mind?

25
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,200
How dare he swing at His Highness?

26
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Does he have a death wish?

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
Do they have some kind of grudge?

28
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
His Highness is
Empress Dowager Liu's only son.

29
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Even the Emperor
treads lightly around him.

30
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,240
Who would dare offend him?

31
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,760
Then Bai must be a man of integrity

32
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
who fears no authority.

33
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
You came all the way to Southern Chu.

34
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,520
You've made quite the effort to marry

35
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
the Grand Tutor's daughter.

36
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm merely traveling incognito.

37
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,080
You're overreacting.

38
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
Traveling incognito?

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,520
And you just happened
to come to my territory

40
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,560
and join Fenglai Pavilion?

41
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,120
All under heaven belongs to the Emperor.

42
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
If you've done nothing wrong, Qianqing,

43
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,280
why the unease?

44
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,640
Or have you just realized

45
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,520
there's corruption festering

46
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
in your domain?

47
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,880
<i>Why is the cold poison flaring now?</i>

48
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
Due to my clumsy swordsmanship,

49
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,600
I damaged Your Highness's flowers.

50
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,480
Please forgive me.

51
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,880
Miss Zhong, Mr. Bai,

52
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,840
goodbye.

53
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,840
Your Highness,

54
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,080
the mine incident was
the Lingbi Sect's doing.

55
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
Please look into it.

56
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,280
Rest assured, Miss Zhong.

57
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,240
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

58
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,360
I'll investigate

59
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,880
this matter thoroughly.

60
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,160
If there's any progress,

61
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,640
Fenglai Pavilion will be
the first to know.

62
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,880
Good. Thank you, Your Highness.

63
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,720
If I manage to wipe out
the Lingbi Sect entirely,

64
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,320
I wonder how you will thank me, Mr. Bai.

65
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Your Highness already rules over Chu

66
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,720
and has everything one could desire.

67
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,280
Surely there's nothing I can offer.

68
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,560
What if I do have a request?

69
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
What did he mean by that?

70
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,040
You're awake?

71
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
Where's Cangcang?

72
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,200
She's safe and sound.

73
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,960
The mine has been forced to shut down.

74
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,320
The Lingbi Sect suffered heavy losses.

75
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,760
The Grand Tutor is not pleased.

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
I failed to live up to Father's trust.

77
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,800
Fortunately, the mine owner is dead.

78
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,480
They won't be able
to trace anything useful.

79
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,600
But that man

80
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,720
won't give up so easily.

81
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,360
If he…

82
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,720
if he uses Cangcang…

83
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
Focus on your recovery.

84
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll take care of the rest.

85
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,440
PURE INTEGRITY

86
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,760
Shi Yan,

87
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
do you think slipping in
and out unseen is the only way

88
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
to live up to your title
as a Xiaoxing Guard?

89
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,120
Your Majesty,
how did the cold poison flare up?

90
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,760
Hasn't Preceptor Du's medicine
always kept it under control?

91
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,120
Take this.

92
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,720
The medicine's run out.

93
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,160
You're out of medicine?

94
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,280
Why didn't Li Hongqing
send someone back to fetch more?

95
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
- How is he doing his job?
- It's not his fault.

96
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
Things have been hectic.

97
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,680
Have the miners been properly settled?

98
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,480
Li Hongqing and I

99
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
have already sent people
to escort them home.

100
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,200
But the number of miners we found

101
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,200
doesn't match the number reported missing.

102
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Could some have died in the mine?

103
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
We've counted all the bodies,

104
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,960
but the total still falls short by many.

105
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
Perhaps some escaped.

106
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
No one's been found
returning home on their own.

107
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
Then something else is going on here.

108
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,120
I'll keep investigating.

109
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,760
What about that masked young man
in the forest? Any leads?

110
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,440
I never saw him in my past contact
with the Lingbi Sect.

111
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,120
Despite several attempts to investigate,

112
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
I found no trace of him.

113
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,120
It seems the Lingbi Sect
is still growing stronger.

114
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,960
Shi Yan,

115
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,840
I have a new mission for you.

116
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,280
At your service.

117
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
Strengthen Fenglai Pavilion.

118
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,360
FENGLAI PAVILION

119
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,360
Bai.

120
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,880
You're up early.

121
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,360
You just promoted me to hall master.

122
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,480
Of course I should set an example

123
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,720
for the other disciples.

124
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Looks like I didn't misjudge you.

125
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,360
Really?

126
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,560
Funny. As I recall, you used to keep me

127
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,600
well outside the door.

128
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Did I?

129
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,440
Well, life in the martial world
leaves one little room for trust.

130
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,600
You can never be too cautious.

131
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,160
Bai, I admit it.

132
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,480
I once suspected you were my father's spy,

133
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,160
so I was wary of you.

134
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,480
Then I tricked you into posing
as the Prince of Yuzhang,

135
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,240
and you were injured

136
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,400
and even imprisoned.

137
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
That was my fault.

138
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,440
Bai Chifan, I apologize.

139
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,920
Bai… no,

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,080
Master Bai, Hall Master Bai,

141
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,880
thank you for not abandoning me in danger

142
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
and for sending people to
help Zhong Lin rescue those children.

143
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,080
Bai, I swear,

144
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,880
from now on, I'll see you
as my brother-in-arms at Fenglai Pavilion.

145
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,880
I'll never deceive you or doubt you again.

146
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
Hopeless.

147
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,480
You still won't forgive me?

148
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,040
You'd better find a new bookkeeper.

149
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
Here, take a look.

150
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Since Fenglai Pavilion was founded
over a year ago,

151
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,120
we've run a deficit of 3,800 liang.

152
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,320
That's why you sighed?

153
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Of course.

154
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,600
That's no big deal.

155
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,720
I'll just steal
a few of my father's paintings or antiques

156
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,040
and make up the loss. There are plenty.

157
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,720
That's not a long-term solution.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
Relax, Bai.

159
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,440
Fenglai Pavilion isn't short on money.

160
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,680
Besides,

161
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
we've got you, haven't we?

162
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,840
Miss Ling!

163
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,080
Miss Ling,
a big crowd has gathered outside.

164
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,880
They all want to join Fenglai Pavilion!

165
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,000
What?

166
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,320
FENGLAI PAVILION

167
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,240
What were you two talking about just now?

168
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,960
Nothing much.

169
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,440
Nothing much?

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,000
I doubt that.

171
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,840
You used to be so wary of him,

172
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,680
but now look at you,

173
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,000
making him a hall master
and calling his name nonstop.

174
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,920
Cangcang,

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,040
what exactly happened between you two?

176
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
I'll do all I can

177
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,600
so you won't have to act alone.

178
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,120
Really, nothing happened.

179
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,160
He saved my life.

180
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,520
Then we spent
one night together in prison.

181
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,800
One night?

182
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,000
And you call that nothing?

183
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,880
Don't tell me you plan
to repay him with your heart.

184
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,240
What are you…?

185
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,280
- Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
- You…

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,720
Don't you think he's

187
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
dashing,

188
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,520
charming,

189
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
and easy on the eye?

190
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
Not one bit.

191
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,880
I think he's

192
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,840
all appearance

193
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,160
and no substance. Absolutely repulsive.

194
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,880
Why do I feel

195
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,480
like his every move

196
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,400
carries a kind of…

197
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,960
A kind of duplicitous danger?

198
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,320
A kind of fatal charm.

199
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
You're hopeless!

200
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,360
My name is Shi Yan.
I specialize in the blade,

201
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,000
especially the 72 Kunlun Swift Strikes.

202
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,320
Cangcang, that man

203
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,920
is the one who helped us
rescue the children last time.

204
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,960
That's right. Greetings, Miss Ling.

205
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,200
Very well. You're in.

206
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Miss Ling,

207
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,320
shouldn't you think it over?

208
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,000
What's to think about?

209
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,880
He's Bai's man. I trust him.

210
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
Master, I led Fenglai Pavilion

211
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,200
to strike a heavy blow against
that inhumane Refinement Quarry.

212
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,640
We rescued all the children
who'd been taken there by force.

213
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,960
I know you mean to rid the world of evil,

214
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,720
but do you understand

215
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,720
how tangled the powers
behind that mine are?

216
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Of course.

217
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
They're all people from the Lingbi Sect.

218
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,440
I even saw

219
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
the Ghost King himself.

220
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,840
What is it, Master?

221
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,880
The Ghost King is dangerous.

222
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,400
Yes,

223
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,600
he's committed countless atrocities
and harmed so many people.

224
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,960
And guess what?

225
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,480
They didn't take those children

226
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,320
just to work as slaves.

227
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,400
They were turning
them into stone-like creatures.

228
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,840
There must be a greater plot behind it.

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,360
I hear Bai never leaves your side.

230
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,760
His ambitions may

231
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,800
well match the Ghost King's.

232
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,160
Did Zhong Lin say something to you?

233
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,000
I've looked into him.

234
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,760
His identity is false.

235
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,040
I knew that already.

236
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,599
And you still trust him?

237
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,480
Everyone has their own burdens
and secrets.

238
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,720
Just because he hasn't told me the truth

239
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,240
doesn't mean he never will.

240
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,680
I can wait.

241
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,480
Besides,

242
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,880
I've kept my own identity from him too.

243
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,839
The human heart is unpredictable.

244
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,720
He's worked hard to get close to you.

245
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
He must have his own agenda.

246
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,800
Perhaps
it has to do with your other identity.

247
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Time reveals all.

248
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,240
Whether he cares for me as
the Sect Leader of Fenglai Pavilion

249
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,200
or as the Grand Tutor's daughter,

250
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,760
I'll find out one day.

251
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Cangcang,

252
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,680
I know you've always been kind

253
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,040
and unwilling to see
the world through suspicion.

254
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,160
But remember, the only person

255
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,800
who loves you without reservation
is your father.

256
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
Even I, your master,
am not worthy of your full trust.

257
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,040
How could you say that?

258
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,680
If you hadn't saved me back then,

259
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,560
I would've been taken away and killed.

260
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
You saved my life.

261
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,800
If I can't trust you, who can I trust?

262
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
Enough, Cangcang.

263
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,680
Your father entrusted you to me,

264
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,680
so I must keep you safe.

265
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,680
Promise me

266
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,240
you'll keep your distance from Bai,
all right?

267
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,560
Now rest. I'll take my leave.

268
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Master…

269
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,000
I received word from
the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor

270
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,120
that His Highness released the Emperor

271
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,280
and started investigating the Lingbi Sect.

272
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,880
Sometimes,

273
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
I truly wonder what goes on

274
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,960
in my own son's head.

275
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,920
Please calm down, Your Majesty.
Anger will only harm your health.

276
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
How did I give birth
to such a stubborn child?

277
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,360
Instead of seizing
the opportunity to deal with Xiao…

278
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,040
he had to provoke the Lingbi Sect.

279
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
Does he know how powerful they are
in the martial world?

280
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,440
What a troublemaker.

281
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,120
- What should we do with the Emperor?
- At this point,

282
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,360
we'll have to take
matters into our own hands.

283
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,760
Bai.

284
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,120
FENGLAI PAVILION

285
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
Miss Ling, we've taken in

286
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
73 disciples over the past few days.

287
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,920
I've written down

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,600
all their details here for you to review.

289
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,640
Good. Bai, thanks for your hard work.

290
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,640
It's nothing.

291
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,520
Earning your trust is what matters.

292
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,760
I just got my hands
on two fine jars of wine.

293
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,000
It's the Lantern Festival.

294
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,360
Let's celebrate.

295
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Celebrate?

296
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,920
FENGLAI PAVILION

297
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,000
Here.

298
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
You're in quite the festive mood today.

299
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,840
Good wine should always
be shared with good friends.

300
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Cheers.

301
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
Go on and try it.

302
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,960
Excellent wine.

303
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,880
Does it remind you of your hometown?

304
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,880
It's called Sangluo Wine.

305
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
"There we sit, sharing Sangluo Wine

306
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,960
and playing with chrysanthemum branches."

307
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,400
It's brewed by the Bai clan of Xiling.
Do you recognize it?

308
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,640
I suppose you've figured out

309
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,840
that I'm not from the Bai clan of Xiling,

310
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,040
yet you still treat me as a close friend.

311
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,840
As close friends,

312
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,720
we should be straightforward
with each other

313
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,640
rather than play tricks.

314
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,080
Very well.

315
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,720
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

316
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,120
I do

317
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,080
see you as a close friend.

318
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,480
But I still think you haven't
been entirely honest with me.

319
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,920
For instance, I still don't know
who you really are.

320
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,680
What about you, Miss Ling?

321
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,600
Will you tell me your true identity?

322
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,440
That's not the same.

323
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,360
I have secrets I cannot speak of.

324
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,520
How do you know

325
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,080
I have no secrets I must keep?

326
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
I…

327
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Since we both carry secrets
we cannot share,

328
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,200
we are not so different after all.

329
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,520
Someone told me

330
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,600
you got close to me with a plan.

331
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,720
Or perhaps…

332
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,120
Perhaps what?

333
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,040
Nothing.

334
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,400
Who said I meant you harm?

335
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,680
Someone I trust.

336
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,640
Have I ever harmed Fenglai Pavilion?

337
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,960
Have I ever hurt you?

338
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,640
Then I suppose

339
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,320
my master is suspicious of you

340
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
because he doesn't know you well enough.

341
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
So it was your master.

342
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,640
As distance tests a horse's strength,

343
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,960
time reveals a person's heart.

344
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,920
You need not trust me now.

345
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,880
Just…

346
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,400
Bold fools,

347
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
how dare you break into Fenglai Pavilion?

348
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,520
You go first. I'll handle them.

349
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,160
We'll fight together.

350
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,760
Look out!

351
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,160
Assassins!

352
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,160
Bai, are you all right?

353
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,520
- Let's go.
- Seize them!

354
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,280
Be careful.

355
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,720
Bai.

356
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,280
Bai?

357
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,760
Bai?

358
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,160
Somebody!

359
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,440
Hurry! Get a physician!

360
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,840
Go after them!

361
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
Stop him!

362
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,640
It was a suicide mission.
They all had poison in their mouths.

363
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,760
Sir, how is he?

364
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,720
I've never seen
such a complicated pulse before.

365
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,880
What do you mean?

366
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
The poison has invaded
his internal organs.

367
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,960
He won't live long.

368
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,480
Now that he's lost so much blood,

369
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,000
his pulse should be weak.

370
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,280
- But…
- But what?

371
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,720
But his pulse is still strong and steady.

372
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,560
Then why hasn't he woken up?

373
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,560
That's what baffles me.

374
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,720
You said the poison had

375
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,640
reached his internal organs.
What does that mean?

376
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,720
Judging by his pulse,

377
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,040
he's suffering from cold poison.

378
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,240
It must have been
in his body for over ten years.

379
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,440
Impossible.

380
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
He seemed perfectly fine,

381
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,720
and his martial skills are extraordinary.

382
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,640
How could that be?

383
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,280
Then it makes sense.

384
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,400
His martial arts training has allowed him

385
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,560
to keep the poison
in check with inner force.

386
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,080
That's why his pulse
remains strong despite the blood loss.

387
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,200
He must have been taking
an antidote regularly.

388
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,720
Antidote?

389
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,520
What is this?

390
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,240
A life-saving medicine.

391
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,360
He gave me his last pill.

392
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,760
Then you must find him
another one at once.

393
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,240
Shi Yan must know about the antidote.

394
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,960
- Hurry. Get Shi Yan here.
<i>- Got it.</i>

395
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,000
Shi Yan!

396
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,560
- Do you have Hall Master Bai's antidote?
- What happened to him?

397
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,600
He fainted.

398
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,800
The physician said he needed the antidote.

399
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,200
I'll be right back.

400
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Bai, you fool.

401
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,120
That antidote was meant
to save your own life,

402
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
yet you gave it to me.

403
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,680
You risked your life for me
again and again,

404
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,920
yet I still doubted you.

405
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,880
Master only grew suspicious of you

406
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,600
because he didn't know you.

407
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,560
But deep down,
I'd already come to trust you.

408
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,360
I shouldn't have tested you.

409
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,480
It was my fault.

410
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,280
You haven't even heard my apology yet,

411
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,200
so you can't die.

412
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,120
Please, wake up soon.

413
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,840
Please, wake up soon.

414
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,280
Cangcang,

415
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,440
what's wrong?

416
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,720
Bai,

417
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,520
you're really awake.

418
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
You've been crying?

419
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,040
I…

420
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,600
I haven't.

421
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,320
I was just a little scared.

422
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,520
Don't worry.

423
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,360
It'll take more than this to kill me.

424
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,200
I had a dream.

425
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,080
In it, I was wandering near death's door.

426
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,600
Then suddenly, someone called my name.

427
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,120
When I turned around,

428
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
I saw that it was you,
crying your eyes out.

429
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,000
I couldn't help but laugh.

430
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,560
Then I woke up.

431
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,920
You're making fun of me
at a time like this?

432
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,040
Did I hurt you?

433
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,040
I'm fine.

434
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,360
You were worried about me?

435
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,360
Of course.

436
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,560
When I got sick as a child,

437
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,840
my father would stay up all night
by my bedside too.

438
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,000
Are you close to your father?

439
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,920
My mother passed away
when I was very young.

440
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,040
Father raised me on his own.

441
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Then how could he allow you

442
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,080
to wander the martial world alone?

443
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,560
Because I have my master.

444
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,960
No wonder your master's words
carry such weight.

445
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Bai,

446
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,000
my master only doubts you

447
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,200
because he doesn't know you.

448
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,200
Don't worry.

449
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,920
I'll make sure

450
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,840
he trusts you

451
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,040
as much as I do, all right?

452
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,840
Now, get some more rest.

453
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,320
I'll go check on the antidote.

454
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,880
Wait.

455
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,200
Did you get the antidote?

456
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,040
The Imperial Preceptor just made it.
Why the rush?

457
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,080
His Majesty's cold poison has flared up.

458
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,000
How could that happen?

459
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,400
It's complicated. Let's head back first.

460
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,560
You're in this condition
and still planning to go out?

461
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,360
I'm going to take Cangcang away.

462
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
In your state,

463
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,920
even if you see her, what can you do?

464
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Cangcang is naive and easily deceived.

465
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,160
I'm taking her back to the Capital.

466
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,760
Whether by deceit or by force,

467
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,120
I'm taking her back.

468
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,240
The Lingbi Sect's affair
is what matters most right now.

469
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,440
If they really uncover something,

470
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,000
how should we answer to the master?

471
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,840
Father ordered me to protect Cangcang.

472
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
If anything happens to her,

473
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,840
how will I face him?

474
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,120
Are you doing this
for your adoptive father's sake

475
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,520
or for your own?

476
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,440
You know the answer better than I do.

477
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,600
So Your Majesty
gave the antidote to Miss Ling.

478
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,200
I failed to notice

479
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Your Majesty's relapse earlier.
I deserve punishment.

480
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,400
I've had this cold poison since birth.

481
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,320
After all these years, I'm used to it.

482
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,040
Have you traced the assassins?

483
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,800
I let one escape on purpose

484
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,400
and sent the Xiaoxing Guards after him.

485
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,560
He eventually turned up

486
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,280
at the Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

487
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,640
The Prince of Yuzhang's Manor?

488
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,240
Your Majesty,

489
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,080
we may have found a clue
about the murder thralls at the mine.

490
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,560
What is it?

491
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,760
The Botang Pleasure Boat.

492
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,000
- The Botang Pleasure Boat?
- The Botang Pleasure Boat

493
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,280
is not that well-known,
but I've heard of it.

494
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,640
Despite its name,
it offers no pleasure of that sort.

495
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
Rare and valuable items are
auctioned there. It's highly exclusive.

496
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,680
It's said that one must have

497
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,440
a special invitation to board.

498
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,960
Zhong Lin can handle that.

499
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,000
I want to see it for myself.

500
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,560
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

501
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,600
You still haven't

502
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,280
found the Ghost King?

503
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,240
What have you all been doing?

504
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
At this rate,

505
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
when will you catch him

506
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,280
and root out the Lingbi Sect?

507
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,840
Make the Ghost King
show himself in three days,

508
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,400
- or bring me your heads!
- Understood!

509
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,720
Your Highness,
Bai Chifan from Fenglai Pavilion

510
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,120
just sent word.

511
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,920
What is it?

512
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,560
Three words: Botang Pleasure Boat.

513
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,239
<i>Why does he</i>

514
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,440
<i>look different today?</i>

515
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,000
<i>Was he always like this?</i>

516
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
Good morning, Miss Ling.

517
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,040
Good morning.

518
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,320
Are you feeling better?

519
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,880
Much better.

520
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,760
Thank you
for taking care of me last night.

521
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,560
After all, you were hurt because of me.

522
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,200
It's only right that I look after you.

523
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,200
Why do you seem different today?

524
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,760
So uneasy.

525
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,440
Do I?

526
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,880
- Is it because of last night…?
- No!

527
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,080
What?

528
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
I…

529
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
I…

530
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,160
I feel a little dizzy.

531
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,920
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

532
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,480
I should go.

533
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,600
Your pulse is racing.

534
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,160
That's not quite normal.

535
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,400
But your complexion doesn't look like
that of someone ill.

536
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,200
Is something bothering you?

537
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,120
How about I take you out

538
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,160
for some fresh air?

539
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,120
Hurry, honey.

540
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,960
I heard the boat had a Harmony Chamber,

541
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,920
and only couples are allowed inside.

542
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,040
A trip on this boat
without a fair lady for company

543
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,080
- would be a waste indeed.
- It'll be a sleepless night.

544
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,560
A night of romance…

545
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,560
- Wait.
- …is what makes the trip worthwhile.

546
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,200
Why did you bring me here
dressed like this?

547
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,720
Look around.

548
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,120
Isn't it obvious what we're here for?

549
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Then I'm not going.

550
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,120
You can't back out now.

551
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,680
Everything's ready. Only you're missing.

552
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
What?

553
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,240
Yes, I've roamed the martial world
and care little for rules,

554
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,520
but I'm not that kind of girl.

555
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,000
What does that have to do
with rescuing missing youths?

556
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,280
What missing youths?

557
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,400
The number of rescued miners didn't match
the missing count.

558
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,960
I suspect many were sold here.

559
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,360
That's why I invited you along.

560
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,480
Anything wrong with that?

561
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,120
Nothing.

562
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,280
Let's go, then.

563
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,480
You two look unfamiliar.

564
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,200
First time aboard?

565
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,000
A green haitang blossom?

566
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
Distinguished guests indeed.

567
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,520
Sir and madam, this way, please.

568
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
Sir and madam?

569
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,320
After you, honey.

570
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,920
The boat is setting sail!

571
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,280
Setting sail? Why?

572
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
You truly are newcomers.

573
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,480
The boat sails to open waters

574
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,480
before trading begins.

575
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,400
<i>Once it's out at sea,</i>

576
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,160
<i>Shi Yan's men on shore</i>

577
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,840
<i>will be of no use.</i>

578
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,000
Sir and madam, come.

579
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,520
- Look at his fan.
- I know.

580
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,320
- Isn't that…?
- He looks

581
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,560
so dignified.

582
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,840
Who would've thought?

583
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,840
What a pity.

584
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,880
- Who would've thought?
- Exactly.

585
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,840
Let's go.

586
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,600
- Did you see that?
- A green haitang blossom!

587
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,520
Did you see it?

588
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,800
- Yes, I saw it.
- What do the different colors

589
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,760
- even mean?
- I have no idea.

590
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,080
Everyone's staring at us.

591
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,000
Zhong Lin said she saw an invitation
with a green haitang blossom,

592
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,320
so she made one just like it.

593
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Maybe we should slip away while we can.

594
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,480
Come, honey.

595
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,680
I'm not your honey.

596
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,520
If we're acting,
we should make it convincing.

597
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,120
Don't forget why we're here, honey.

598
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,840
Sir and madam,

599
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,680
this way, please.

600
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,600
Let's go, honey.

601
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,480
Please come in.

602
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,240
Come on, honey.

603
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,160
Sit.

604
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,640
Playing the loving couple
in the Green Haitang Chamber?

605
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,680
Aren't you tired?

606
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,600
Xiaoyang, mind your tongue.

607
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,160
They're guests. Serve them tea.

608
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,320
What would you like?

609
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,120
That depends on what you have to offer.

610
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,840
Tiger, snake,
and lion parts, dragon pills,

611
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,880
invincibility pills,
prepared salt, and stink bugs.

612
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,480
As long as you can pay,

613
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,640
we have whatever you desire.

614
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,640
And how brave you are, sir.

615
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,600
We rarely see male guests
in the Green Haitang Chamber.

616
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,640
- Did you see that?
- A green haitang blossom!

617
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,080
- Did you see that?
- He looks dashing.

618
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,480
- Who would've thought?
- Exactly.

619
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,280
Such a shame.

620
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,200
You don't understand what's going on.

621
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,080
Keep quiet. Let me handle this.

622
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Now, that's not very nice to say.

623
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,920
My husband and I share true affection.

624
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,560
I won't despise him
just because he's frail.

625
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,400
No matter what happens to him,

626
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,160
- I'll love him all the same.
- How touching.

627
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,040
For such devotion,

628
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,560
I'll give you a discount.

629
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,120
Here's the thing, madam.

630
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,160
Ordinary medicine

631
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
doesn't work

632
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,680
on my husband.

633
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,640
Then what are you saying, madam?

634
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,120
I mean,

635
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,880
on a grand pleasure boat like this,

636
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,080
surely there are other chambers
that can help him.

637
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,360
The red, yellow, and blue
haitang chambers.

638
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,640
What are they all for?

639
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,880
Besides medicine, what else can we try?

640
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,800
Do you look down on my chamber?

641
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,360
Not at all.

642
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,360
I don't doubt
the quality of your goods, madam.

643
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,600
It's…

644
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
it's my husband's body I don't trust.

645
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,640
Say something, my love.

646
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,840
All these years, has any medicine

647
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,440
worked for you?

648
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Well,

649
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,800
none so far.

650
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,600
Madam, you heard him.

651
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,920
Please, help us.

652
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,840
Let us enter the other types of chambers.

653
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,160
Sir and madam, please leave.

654
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,080
Go that way.

655
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,680
A boat will take you ashore.

656
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,360
Don't you claim to fulfill
every wish here?

657
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,800
Why drive us out simply for not buying
your medicine?

658
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,000
That's how
the Botang Pleasure Boat operates.

659
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
If you refuse to leave,

660
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,920
you'll be thrown overboard
to feed the fish.

661
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,080
Don't make this hard.

662
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,880
<i>If we're thrown out now,</i>
<i>this trip will be for nothing.</i>

663
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,800
<i>I know.</i>

664
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,080
<i>As Sect Leader of Fenglai Pavilion,</i>

665
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,080
<i>I won't take this lying down.</i>

666
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,240
Go.

667
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,280
Wait.

668
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,720
Those

669
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,400
animal parts, dragon pills, and whatnot.

670
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,880
We'll buy them.

671
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,520
My love,

672
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,640
get… get the money.

673
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,520
In that case, sir and madam,
please follow me.

674
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,320
Sir and madam,

675
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,280
follow me.

676
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,480
Sir and madam, upstairs, please.

677
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,400
Can't we go in there?

678
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,720
We have an invitation.

679
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,280
Please, go upstairs
to the Green Haitang Chamber.

680
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,680
This young lady is a distinguished guest.
