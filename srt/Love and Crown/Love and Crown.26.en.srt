ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,000
The baby…

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
How is the baby?

4
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,000
Cangcang, don't worry.

5
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,160
Take good care of yourself.

6
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,320
We'll have another child one day.

7
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,560
I failed to protect him…

8
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,760
It was my fault.
I failed to protect you both.

9
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,040
I don't blame you.

10
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
You said…

11
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,320
we'd have another child someday.

12
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,520
As long as…

13
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,160
we…

14
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
we're still together,

15
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,280
we'll get through this.

16
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm all right.

17
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,000
The Empress is awake.

18
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
Good.

19
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,160
She reminded me
that I only have one brother, you.

20
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,399
And that brother once risked his life

21
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,000
to bring me lifesaving
medicine from far away.

22
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,200
So, Your Majesty,

23
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,520
for the sake
of the loyalty I once showed you,

24
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
please spare Ying's life.

25
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
Rise.

26
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,680
Go to Wuying Hall and pass on my order

27
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,360
and bring Xiao Ying
back to the cold palace.

28
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

29
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,240
Everyone has someone they care about.

30
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
I know you care about Xiao Ying.

31
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,840
But indulging her isn't truly loving her.

32
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,480
I understand.

33
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,920
As for this matter,
I won't just let it slide.

34
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,760
Why did Xiao Ying change so suddenly?

35
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,440
Why did she never show any sign before?

36
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,400
I believe none of this is a coincidence.

37
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,080
There must be someone
pulling the strings behind her.

38
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,440
I will get to the bottom of this.

39
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,240
Even if it was my mother who ordered it,

40
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,160
I will not cover for her.

41
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
Good.

42
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,960
I expect you to give me an answer.

43
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,800
Ying, what is going on?

44
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,600
Li Hongqing is just a guard commander.

45
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,480
He's not worthy of you. The dead are gone.

46
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Why would you seek revenge for him?

47
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,760
Has someone been filling your head
and leading you astray?

48
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,760
This must all be Xiao Huan again!
It's his plot!

49
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,320
What did you say?

50
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,880
The Empress suffered a grave wound

51
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,840
while saving His Majesty.

52
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
And the baby…

53
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
could not be saved.

54
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,440
Sir…

55
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,960
Sir!

56
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,520
Your Majesty,

57
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
the Imperial Father-in-law is in trouble.

58
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,480
Your Majesty, the Imperial Father-in-law
suddenly collapsed.

59
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,760
How is he now?

60
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,560
He's awake now,

61
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,560
but… not doing well.

62
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,360
Is everyone at Fayun Temple useless?

63
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,800
For now, don't tell the Empress.

64
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,320
Her body can't take any more.

65
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

66
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
Bring Ling Xuefeng back to the Capital.

67
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
Find him the best imperial physician.

68
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,160
Do everything you can to save him.

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,840
If anything goes wrong,

70
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,000
at least let father and daughter
see each other one last time.

71
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,560
Qianqing,
what did His Majesty say about this?

73
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,000
Will he have Ying executed?

74
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Ying,

75
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,160
tell me the truth.

76
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,799
Did someone egg you on

77
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,840
to try

78
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,919
to assassinate His Majesty?

79
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,919
You don't need to ask her.

80
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,120
She's still not herself.

81
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,559
I'll have someone send calming soup

82
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,760
so she can get some real rest.

83
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
This time,

84
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
you were wrong.

85
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,240
When you do something wrong,

86
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,880
there is always a price to pay.

87
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Qianqing, what are you saying?

88
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,360
I wanted to pay that price for you.

89
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,440
But His Majesty is right.

90
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,880
Always indulging you…

91
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,320
is not truly loving you.

92
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
Qianqing…

93
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,320
the flower is about to bloom…

94
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
The flower is about to bloom…

95
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,760
The flower is about to bloom…

96
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,640
Qianqing, what are you doing?

97
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,160
I've cut her inner channels.

98
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
She can never refine poison again.

99
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
Qianqing, are you out of your mind?

100
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm not!

101
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,120
I was the one running away before.

102
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,520
Ying had a miserable childhood.

103
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
No one ever taught her right from wrong.

104
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,440
But in this world,

105
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
no one can spoil her forever.

106
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,240
Ying…

107
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,480
forgive me…

108
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
forgive your brother.

109
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,280
Qianqing!

110
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,280
Xiao Qianqing!

111
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Ying…

112
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,760
it's all right.

113
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,920
It's all right now.

114
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,440
From now on, you can't make poison.

115
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
I'll keep you company in other ways.

116
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,680
I will always…

117
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,200
always stay by your side.

118
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,920
Xiao Qianqing,

119
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,840
tell me,

120
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,680
are you afraid of Wuying Hall now?

121
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,520
Mother,

122
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
did you

123
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
have anything to do with this?

124
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,080
What did you say?

125
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
Did you order Ying

126
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,840
to try to assassinate His Majesty?

127
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,120
Is this how you speak to your mother?

128
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,120
In this palace,

129
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,400
who but you would dare think that way?

130
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,640
Yes!

131
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,440
I wish he would just die right now!

132
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,080
But… do you really think

133
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,040
I would send Ying to do it?

134
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,600
Her mind is not sound.
She is beyond my control.

135
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,720
If anything went wrong,
Xiao Huan would suspect me first!

136
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,600
Why would I set myself on fire?

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,040
And if Xiao Huan survived,

138
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,280
I, the whole Liu clan, and you included,

139
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,600
would all be buried with her!

140
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,520
And today,
you question me for Xiao Huan's sake.

141
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,200
Qianqing,

142
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,080
has your heart

143
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,840
already turned to him?

144
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
Have you forgotten

145
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,240
the humiliation I suffered back then

146
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,480
and how coldly I was treated?

147
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

148
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,840
Xiao Qianqing,

149
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,120
I'm back!

150
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Zhong Lin!

151
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,320
I found it!

152
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,440
This method really works?

153
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,960
It has to work.

154
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,080
Though Gold Incense
is colorless and tasteless,

155
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,400
the red flying ants
that grow on dead branches

156
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
of thousand-year-old golden nanmu
will swarm straight to it.

157
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
They can sniff it out
even from ten zhang away.

158
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,000
I managed to get two of them.
We can give it a try.

159
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,480
You've really helped me a lot this time.

160
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,040
If we can prove my mother is innocent,

161
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
I'll make sure
she credits you with great merit.

162
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,640
I'm not doing this for your mother.

163
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm doing it for you and Ying,

164
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,080
and for Cangcang.

165
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,040
Her baby is just gone.

166
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,280
Whoever is behind this,

167
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
I'll drag them out into the light.

168
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,360
The Emperor just lost his temper.

169
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
His anger at you

170
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,200
was just anger at himself.

171
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,160
Once we catch the culprit,
things will work out.

172
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,000
I know.

173
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,480
Besides,

174
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
even if he keeps his distance from you,

175
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,040
you still have me.

176
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,760
Right?

177
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,800
Zhong Lin,

178
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
if one day I leave this place

179
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
and never return,

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
who would you choose

181
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
between Ling Cangcang and me?

182
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,600
If Cangcang is safe and happy,

183
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
that's all I wish for.

184
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
As for me,

185
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,840
of course I'll go wherever you go.

186
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,160
I go where my man goes!

187
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,760
Your Majesty.

188
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
In the future,

189
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,520
Ying can never refine poisons again.

190
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,280
The venomous insect she used this time
is called Dual-Pupil.

191
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,839
It can rapidly draw
out a person's inner power,

192
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,000
but it does severe damage to the mind.

193
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,079
Right now,

194
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,200
Ying only recognizes me.

195
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,160
Whatever I say,
she doesn't really understand.

196
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,200
I can't get any answers out of her.

197
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,319
But on the day she attacked,

198
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,080
her mind was clear.

199
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,320
That's what Dual-Pupil does.

200
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,880
Once it forces out all your potential

201
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,120
and unleashes your power,
you quickly become dull and witless.

202
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,800
Your Majesty,

203
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
though my mother raised Ying,

204
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,960
she would never make her
use a secret art that ruins her own body.

205
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,960
If my mother chose to use Ying,

206
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,360
she'd be setting herself on fire.

207
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,000
She's not that foolish.

208
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,560
I truly believe

209
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,040
the one pulling Ying's strings
must be someone else.

210
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,840
I will find them.

211
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,760
But Xiao Ying can't say anything now.
How will you find them?

212
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,320
She finished
breeding this insect long ago.

213
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,840
She even bragged about it to me.

214
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,440
But to get this kind
of insect into the body,

215
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
you have to take Gold Incense
for several days in a row.

216
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,560
This stuff is highly addictive.
It's worth a fortune.

217
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,240
It's contraband.

218
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,000
It should never appear

219
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,600
inside the palace.

220
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,520
So you already have a plan?

221
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,000
Within five days,

222
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,320
I will get to the bottom of this
and give you an answer.

223
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,640
UPRIGHT AND HONORABLE

224
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,200
Sir, please don't be angry.

225
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,440
We've been setting this up for so long,
and Xiao Huan is still alive.

226
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,960
On top of that,

227
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,680
I've even lost a grandchild I never met.

228
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,320
How am I supposed to calm down?

229
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,680
But you use this
chance to return to the Capital.

230
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,400
And I've helped you quite a bit.

231
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,880
Now that you're back,

232
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,840
we can finally aim for bigger things.

233
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,120
I've already lost my grandchild.

234
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,040
I just want to go back

235
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,520
and see my daughter.

236
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,960
Are you thinking of backing out?

237
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Don't forget:

238
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
the Empress losing her child

239
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,440
was partly your doing.

240
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,760
Do you really think
you still have a way out?

241
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,800
Commander of the Capital Patrol Office,

242
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,000
Zhang Heng, please come out.

243
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,200
I heard you two have never gotten along.

244
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,440
Because of you,
Mr. Zhang was demoted three ranks.

245
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,160
He had to start over as
a lowly clerk in the North City Patrol

246
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
before climbing back up to commander.

247
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,880
And even as commander,

248
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
he gave you no end of trouble.

249
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,360
Years ago, he stopped your carriage,

250
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,520
saying you were too extravagant

251
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,720
that your carriage exceeded your rank.

252
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,640
If Sir had really wanted
to make things hard for me,

253
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,320
could I have risen safely to commander?

254
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,240
The one playing the game

255
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,800
will sometimes place a hidden piece.

256
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,960
And that hidden piece

257
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,440
often sits at the most critical spot.

258
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,880
Truly, he is a masterful piece.

259
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,960
Right now,

260
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,600
I've turned the key hidden piece

261
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,960
face up for you to see.

262
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,320
Do you still think

263
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,760
I would back down?

264
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,480
General Lu,

265
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,640
let me remind you of one thing:

266
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,560
the Imperial Preceptor
is sacred and untouchable.

267
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,120
The last Imperial Preceptor
had a secret affair

268
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,960
and I personally carried out

269
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,880
her sentence of death by fire.

270
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Inside here are red flying ants.

271
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,600
They love the scent of Gold Incense.

272
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,240
If someone has come into contact with it,

273
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,360
even a dozen days later,

274
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
the red flying
ants can still sniff it out.

275
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,200
This register lists everyone

276
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,480
who has entered or
left the cold palace recently.

277
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
Once we test them with the ants,

278
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,640
the one behind it all
is sure to be exposed.

279
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,760
COLD PALACE ENTRY LOG

280
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,360
- Wufu.
- Yes.

281
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,320
- Summon Lu Qi.
- Yes.

282
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,000
Wait.

283
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,000
Why isn't Lu Qi's name on this register?

284
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,880
He's Li Hongqing's right-hand man.

285
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,800
That doesn't make sense.

286
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,560
He could've had
contact with Xiao Ying too.

287
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,600
That day, the situation
in Wuying Hall was deadly dangerous.

288
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,840
Yet he showed up late,

289
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,240
saying he'd suddenly taken ill.

290
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,080
How could it be such a coincidence?

291
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,760
Lu's family
has been loyal for generations.

292
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,840
He's an upright man, even a bit stubborn.

293
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,120
It's hard to believe he'd be bought off.

294
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,280
We'll know

295
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,560
as soon as we test him.

296
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
Summon Lu Qi!

297
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,400
Yes.

298
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,280
That's roughly what happened
in the cold palace that day.

299
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,760
It was my failure in duty.

300
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,560
I didn't notice anything
unusual about the princess.

301
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,080
It's not your fault.

302
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Any news of Li Hongqing?

303
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,680
None yet.

304
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,040
I've sent more men
to search for Commander Li.

305
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,000
All right. You may go for now.

306
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

307
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,320
Put someone on him. Check everyone

308
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,240
he came into contact with.

309
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,920
Your Majesty,

311
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
I'll look into this myself.

312
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,520
I want to see who's really behind this,

313
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,040
whether they're man or ghost.

314
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,840
Your Majesty,

315
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,880
is something weighing on your mind?

316
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,920
Here, have a candied fruit.

317
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,640
Your Majesty,

318
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,400
have you found the real culprit

319
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,680
behind the princess?

320
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,960
We have a lead,

321
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,800
but nothing is certain yet.

322
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
You said

323
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,440
you would never keep anything from me.

324
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,040
All right.

325
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,520
I promise you I won't hide anything.

326
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,680
But you have to rest

327
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,480
and fully regain your strength.

328
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,440
Otherwise, how can I feel at ease
telling you all these troubles?

329
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm almost fully recovered.

330
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,880
Even Physician Li says so.
I can run and jump now.

331
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,640
- See for yourself…
- All right!

332
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,000
I know.

333
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,280
I know you're back on your feet.

334
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Promise me that whatever happens,

335
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,680
we'll face it together.

336
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,800
All right.

337
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,040
General Lu.

338
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Open the gate.

339
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,680
Your Highness.

340
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,200
Open the gate.

341
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,560
Trinkets!

342
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,080
Trinkets! Take a look!

343
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,680
Kites! Have a look!

344
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,160
Take a look!

345
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,920
Mother,

346
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,320
which of these two

347
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,840
looks better?

348
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,040
Wrap them up.

349
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,480
- Got it.
- Ladies.

350
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,320
Take your time and look around.

351
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,640
Sir, another bowl!

352
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,840
Miss, have a look.

353
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,360
How did Zhang Heng,
commander of the Capital Patrol Office,

354
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,120
and Lu Qi, deputy
commander of the Imperial Guards,

355
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,560
end up together like that?

356
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,480
IMPERIAL ASSEMBLY PATROL

357
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,920
LU QI, DEPUTY
COMMANDER OF THE IMPERIAL GUARDS

358
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
ZHANG HENG,
COMMANDER OF THE CAPITAL PATROL OFFICE

359
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,400
The Imperial Assembly patrol
was always handled by Li Hongqing.

360
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,360
Now, his fate is unknown
and he still hasn't returned.

361
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,640
So the duty has fallen
to Lu Qi and Zhang Heng.

362
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,600
Someone's plotting
something at the Imperial Assembly?

363
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,760
But who is behind it all?

364
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Lu Qi was the one
who escorted Ling Xuefeng back.

365
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,520
You mean Ling Xuefeng still
won't give up his ambitions?

366
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,400
But Zhang Heng
has always been his sworn enemy.

367
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,760
That's why I trusted him so deeply

368
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,800
and put the Capital's
defenses in his hands.

369
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,600
But thinking about it now,

370
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,040
if Ling Xuefeng
really wanted to block him,

371
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,160
how did Zhang Heng
rise so smoothly to commander?

372
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,400
Could Zhang Heng

373
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,440
have been Ling Xuefeng's
secret piece all along?

374
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,160
So, from Shi Yan's incident,

375
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,800
to Li Hongqing leaving the palace,
to Xiao Ying's attack,

376
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,160
and even Zhang Heng
and Lu Qi colluding now,

377
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,600
it was all within his design.

378
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,840
If this really is Ling Xuefeng's work,

379
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
his scheming runs too deep

380
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
for anyone to see through.

381
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,120
I'll go arrest
Zhang Heng and Lu Qi right away,

382
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,960
then find a way to call
off the Imperial Assembly.

383
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,000
No need.

384
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,240
I want to see

385
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
what he plans to do

386
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,640
at the assembly five days from now.

387
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,040
LINGHE HALL

388
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,720
Your Majesty.

389
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,760
It's so late. Why are you still up?

390
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,200
I just saw Zhong Lin and Luo.

391
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,920
Luo said

392
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,000
you told Zhong Lin to bring him here.

393
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,320
Luo Xianxue helped Hongqing save Shi Yan.

394
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,440
I think he did it all for you.

395
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,560
Calling them into the palace now,
what for?

396
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,440
I want them to protect you.

397
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,760
Since what happened to Hongqing,

398
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,560
there are so few
people in the palace I can trust.

399
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,960
I believe the two of them
would risk their lives to guard you.

400
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,800
Your Majesty, I'm so scared…

401
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,200
He really still hasn't given up?

402
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,960
As long as I'm here, he won't succeed.

403
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
What do you plan

404
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,280
to do with him?

405
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,040
Ling Xuefeng's crimes are unforgivable.

406
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,280
I will never spare him.

407
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,480
But rest assured,

408
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,560
the innocent will not be dragged down.

409
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,640
WUYING HALL

410
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,120
WUYING HALL

411
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,920
Everything is ready.

412
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,760
If we fail, we die trying!

413
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,400
All officials of
the Imperial Assembly, enter the hall

414
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,560
and pay respects to His Majesty!

415
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,720
Proceed!

416
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,080
At the dawn of a new year,

417
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,840
all things are made new.

418
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,040
We pray Your Majesty

419
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,040
receive Heaven's blessing

420
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,200
and share in its glory!

421
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,840
Stow your tablets!

422
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,360
Kneel!

423
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,520
All hail!

424
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,760
Long live Your Majesty!

425
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,360
You may all rise!

426
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,680
Present your tablets!

427
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,560
By Your Majesty's grace,

428
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,440
in the ninth year of
Yongxi, Great Qi is rich and strong.

429
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,280
In the southern provinces,
the land is fertile and the waters full.

430
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,960
Though we faced locust plague,
the damage was slight.

431
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,840
Every home has grain stored.

432
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,640
The people are all well fed.

433
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,520
At best, fields yield
two dan of grain per mu.

434
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,440
As for the remaining details,

435
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,040
I've set them out in full

436
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,880
for Your Majesty's review.

437
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,440
Such prosperity
is thanks to all you ministers.

438
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,480
What Great Qi seeks
is not short-term gain.

439
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,960
I hope you will all work as one,

440
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,320
abolish outdated rules,
and push forward new policies.

441
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,120
Let the brave know righteousness,

442
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,400
and the wise cherish benevolence.

443
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,760
We will heed your teachings!

444
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,520
Imperial Preceptor Du
has prepared Tusu wine for everyone.

445
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,360
Let's all raise a toast

446
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,880
to Great Qi's future,
with fair winds and timely rain,

447
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,480
and a peaceful, prosperous people!

448
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,600
How could this cup of wine

449
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,040
possibly go without me?

450
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
Ling Xuefeng,

451
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,840
you dare commit treason!

452
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,120
So you've been
planning this for a long time, Sir.

453
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,920
Since you've come today,

454
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,680
I'm sure you have plenty to say.

455
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,800
Of course.

456
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,800
Today I came to ask just one thing:

457
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,200
Without the full support
of the Ling clan and me,

458
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,000
what right or ability did you have
to sit securely on the throne?

459
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
So, you want to take it for yourself?

460
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,520
I have no wish to usurp you.

461
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,640
But I have already
received an imperial edict.

462
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,080
It states His Majesty is
gravely ill with a cold illness,

463
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,080
and thus he has passed the throne to
the prince in the Empress's womb.

464
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,360
He orders me to bear the imperial seal,

465
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,320
ascend to the Taiji Hall,
assist the new emperor,

466
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,720
share in handling state affairs,
and oversee the realm and armies.

467
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,600
This minister dares not refuse.

468
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,480
Why didn't I know about this edict?

469
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,400
Because… during today's court session,

470
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,520
you will suddenly be taken ill and die.

471
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,720
You're that sure
everything will go your way today?

472
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,080
The hearts of men are with me.

473
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Good.

474
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,440
Very good.

475
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,400
So, you'd planned ahead all along.

476
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,240
I've already spent the night

477
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,360
replacing the Imperial Guards
with my own men.

478
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,480
In fact, I could've taken down
the Capital Patrol commander earlier.

479
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,200
But… I wanted to see

480
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,000
just how many people in this court
truly stand on your side.

481
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,920
Now that you've seen it for yourself,

482
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,760
allow me to send Your Majesty on your way.
