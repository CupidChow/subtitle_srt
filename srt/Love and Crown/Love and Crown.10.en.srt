ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,720
Cangcang,

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
I know you've misunderstood me before.

4
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,280
Could you give me one more chance
to let us start over?

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,040
Okay?

6
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,040
Come catch me!

7
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,080
You don't have to answer me now.

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,640
I'll stay right by your side

9
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,000
until you come to me of your own accord.

10
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,680
Thank you.

11
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,000
Stilts!

12
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,960
Mom, it's stilts!

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,880
Father, come quick.

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
They're on stilts!

15
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,160
They're lighting fireworks!

16
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,560
So pretty!

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
So beautiful!

18
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,920
So beautiful!

19
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,080
There are fireworks!

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
Fireworks!

21
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,360
So beautiful!

22
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,440
I didn't mean it.

23
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,120
Someone bumped into me just now.

24
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
It was just a coincidence.

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,520
Have you ever thought that sometimes,

26
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,080
coincidence is just destiny in disguise?

27
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,160
I've arrived.

28
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,200
Your Majesty, you should head back soon.

29
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm tired too.

30
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,080
I want to go in and rest.

31
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,320
All right. I'll stop teasing you.

32
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,400
Have a piece whenever you're sad.

33
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,960
Then your heart won't feel so bitter.

34
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,640
About today, thank you.

35
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,320
You never need to thank me.

36
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,680
Oh, right.

37
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,640
Aren't you going to ask me
who I met at the tavern today?

38
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,880
I trust my empress.

39
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
All right.

40
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,320
It's chilly out here.
Go in and get some rest.

41
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,440
PURE AND SPOTLESS

42
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
Your Majesty.

43
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,320
The Empress Dowager's spies
planted by the Empress's side

44
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,720
have all been cleared out.

45
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
How can she still track
the Empress's movements?

46
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Someone outside Linghe Hall
intercepted Her Majesty's carrier pigeon.

47
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,280
To keep Her Majesty from noticing,
they released the pigeon again.

48
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,480
- I don't want to see this happen again.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

49
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,480
Keep a close eye on the Empress Dowager.

50
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,080
If there's the slightest stir,
do not overlook it.

51
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Today,

52
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,560
thanks to a guard in her palace
tipping us off.

53
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,680
Reward the informant handsomely.

54
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,360
As you command.

55
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,160
Also, Prince of Yuzhang has sent word
that everything is going smoothly.

56
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,160
This ninth brother of mine

57
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,600
is much easier to deal with
than his mother.

58
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,440
Recommended officials, enter the hall!

59
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,240
The final imperial exam now begins!

60
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,600
In today's palace examination,

61
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,560
all of you must give it your best.

62
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,280
Do not let down my expectations.

63
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,440
PALACE EXAM CANDIDATE: SONG LANXI

64
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,800
Very well.

65
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,040
I'll review the papers as soon as I can.

66
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,160
Please wait patiently for the good news.

67
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Wait.

68
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,880
Your Majesty, in my view,

69
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,840
there is something false

70
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,760
about Mr. Song Lanxi's identity.

71
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,400
Grand Tutor Ling,
what do you mean by that?

72
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,520
This candidate

73
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,320
is clearly a woman.

74
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Mr. Song,

75
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
do you dare take off your hat

76
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,640
and let everyone

77
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,360
have a good look?

78
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,440
Mr. Song,

79
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
didn't you hear what the Grand Tutor said?

80
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Take off your hat and raise your head.

81
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,760
- Oh…
- She really is a woman.

82
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
This is outrageous!

83
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,440
Yeah.

84
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
Far too outrageous.

85
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,120
She really is a woman.

86
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
That's deceiving the Emperor!

87
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,240
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

88
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
Such nerve.

89
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
This is beyond all decorum.

90
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,400
We absolutely can't let her off lightly.

91
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,920
You impudent woman,

92
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
how dare you pose as an imperial official?

93
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,040
Grand Tutor Ling, you're mistaken.

94
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,160
Mr. Song Lanxi has always been a woman.

95
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,400
Although in our dynasty,

96
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,640
there have long been
women serving as officials,

97
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,040
Mr. Song keeps a low profile,

98
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,840
rarely appears in public,

99
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,040
and often dresses as a man.

100
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,960
So only a very few people know
that Mr. Song is a woman.

101
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,360
Your Majesty has long been shut away
in the palace.

102
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,920
I fear someone with an agenda
is deceiving you.

103
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,560
Song Lanxi
comes from a great family in Gusu,

104
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,720
renowned far and wide.

105
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,560
How could he possibly be a woman?

106
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
His calligraphy is bold and forceful,

107
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
clearly a man's hand.

108
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,800
The witness is right here.

109
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,400
Who dares question it?

110
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160
Xiao Qianqing.

111
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,880
Li Chengtian.

112
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,360
Pay our respects, Your Majesty.

113
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,920
Rise.

114
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,200
Song Lanxi

115
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,040
is a disciple of Master Li Chengtian.

116
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,760
Master Li himself is here today.

117
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Who would dare talk nonsense?

118
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,080
Mr. Ling,

119
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
it's been a long time.

120
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,280
Yes, a very long time.

121
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Back then,

122
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,920
you resigned and returned home.

123
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,000
I simply couldn't keep you.

124
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,640
And now,

125
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,280
what brings you back?

126
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,640
Back then, the court reeked of corruption.

127
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,200
I refused to join in the filth.

128
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,760
Now, the world is slowly growing cleaner.

129
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,640
So I'm willing to come out of retirement.

130
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
After all these years,

131
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,680
your tongue is still sharp as a blade.

132
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,960
That depends on who I'm facing.

133
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
Master Li,

134
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
may I ask whether there is any problem
with Mr. Song Lanxi's identity?

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,840
Lanxi,

136
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,400
I've told you long ago:

137
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,480
no matter when,

138
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,640
you must stand tall.

139
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,640
It's nothing more than some schemer
failing to have you killed

140
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,960
and now trying to sling mud instead.

141
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,880
As your teacher, I'll stand up for you!

142
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
Since that's the case,

143
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,800
I ask all of you to wait for
the results of the palace exam.

144
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Not even a word of praise for me.

145
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,320
Using me and then kicking me away,

146
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,880
how heartless of you!

147
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
Grand Tutor Ling.

148
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,520
TAIJI HALL

149
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,720
You've schemed for years,

150
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,440
and now your career is about to collapse.

151
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
You must have lost your mind

152
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
after the loss of your beloved daughter.

153
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,760
Why are you talking such nonsense?

154
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,680
Don't provoke me like this.

155
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
This whole situation now

156
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,600
is all thanks to your fine disciple.

157
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,040
You're not much better off than I am.

158
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,640
WRITING

159
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

160
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,880
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

161
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
You turned things around
in the palace exam.

162
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,000
You specially summoned me here
just to offer congratulations?

163
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
Yesterday, Imperial Physician Li
sent someone over

164
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,160
and had the Frost Reed delivered.

165
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,000
So he has really found it?

166
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,960
With this key herb
that can dispel all poisons,

167
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,480
your cold sickness may finally be cured.

168
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,120
That's wonderful.

169
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,120
I've specially prepared a banquet
to celebrate for Your Majesty.

170
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,280
Thanks for your kindness,
but I still have matters to attend to.

171
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,160
I'll take my leave.

172
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Your Majesty just can't wait

173
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
to share this good news

174
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,040
with the Empress, is that it?

175
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,280
That is between the Empress and me.

176
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,840
Mind your words.

177
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,880
In that case,

178
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
I wish Your Majesty

179
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,160
long life and endless blessings.

180
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,120
May you find joy,

181
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,400
find the one you love,

182
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
and never be lost in doubt again.

183
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,080
Madam, don't let stray desires take root.

184
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,120
All of you, leave.

185
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,240
Yes, Madam.

186
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,480
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

187
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,480
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

188
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
Your Highness!

189
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,599
I want to go out.

190
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,359
If you won't let me out, fine.

191
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,080
How about this?

192
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,440
Pick one of you to stand right here
so I can "light a lantern" on him.

193
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,160
Please spare us!

194
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,040
What is the Princess up to now?

195
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,320
Commander Li,
you'll see once you're there.

196
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,000
Actually, we don't even need fire.

197
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,120
One of these days
I'll sprinkle some powder on you,

198
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,520
and it'll burst into flame
at night all on its own.

199
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,640
It'll be so much fun!

200
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,040
Spare us, Your Highness!

201
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,320
Your Highness.

202
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,200
Please stop causing trouble.

203
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,840
What?

204
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,200
Want to punish me
by putting out the lights again?

205
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm telling you, my brother is back.

206
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
- I'm not scared anymore!
- Forgive me.

207
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

208
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,840
You mustn't do that!

209
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,120
If my powder hadn't been destroyed,
you'd already be dead!

210
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,240
I have so many kinds of poison.
Deadly with just a touch!

211
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,800
Your Highness,

212
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,680
what are you trying to do?

213
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Whatever you want me to do,

214
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,080
I'll do it.

215
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Say it…

216
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
what do you want me to do?

217
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,960
I would like Your Highness

218
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,320
to spare my men
and go back to your chambers to rest.

219
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,800
Fine.

220
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
How long do I have to rest?

221
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,080
How about you rest until tomorrow?

222
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,680
All right.

223
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll go rest now.

224
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,360
See you tomorrow.

225
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Finding you makes me really happy.

226
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,520
Sir.

227
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,760
- Are you okay?
- Are you alright?

228
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,160
What are you looking at?

229
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,120
Do I look that bad?

230
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
Am I poisoned or something?

231
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,920
Your Majesty,

232
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,960
this is the pear blossom honey
Grand Tutor Ling brought today.

233
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,520
I added four spoonfuls,
just as he ordered.

234
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,840
It really does smell sweet.

235
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,520
Whenever Father went away,

236
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,040
he would always bring me a gift,

237
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,800
like milk dates, candied fruit,

238
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,280
mooncakes,

239
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,280
and this pear blossom honey.

240
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,280
He really dotes on Your Majesty.

241
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,120
His Majesty arrives!

242
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,960
It's so late.

243
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,920
What brings you here?

244
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,280
I've had two pieces of good news today,

245
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
so I wanted to come see my empress.

246
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,760
What good news?

247
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
There's hope for my cold sickness.

248
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,840
I no longer have to fear

249
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,720
that one day,
I'll suddenly leave you behind.

250
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,640
What's wrong?

251
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,200
I'm not sure.
I just have a bit of a headache.

252
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,160
Here.

253
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,880
You're burning up.

254
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,920
I'll call the imperial physician
to take a look.

255
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm fine.

256
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,360
Sorry.

257
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,120
I lost my composure for a moment.

258
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,080
Get some rest.

259
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
Xiao Huan…

260
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
should I trust you one more time?

261
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,920
Your Majesty!

262
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
Someone, come quickly!

263
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

264
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,800
She has always been in good health.

265
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,200
How could she suddenly pass out?

266
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,680
Your Majesty,

267
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,040
Her Majesty

268
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,640
has been poisoned.

269
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,840
Poisoned?

270
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,040
How could the Empress be poisoned?

271
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,680
What kind of poison is it?

272
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
A vicious, rare toxin.

273
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,880
It's already entered
Her Majesty's bloodstream.

274
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,600
Her temperature keeps dropping.

275
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,920
This poison
seems to be suppressing her heartbeat.

276
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,880
If this goes on,
Her Majesty will lose all body heat.

277
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,760
I'm afraid

278
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,280
in a few hours,
there will be no saving her.

279
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
How could she be poisoned

280
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,200
here in the inner palace?

281
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,920
She was perfectly fine just yesterday.

282
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,280
Speak!

283
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,520
Your Majesty,

284
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,440
aside from this toxin,

285
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Her Majesty also seems to have taken

286
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,400
Lovesickness Powder.

287
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,200
Lovesickness Powder?

288
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,120
How do we cure it?

289
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,280
I think I've seen it before
at Princess Ying's place.

290
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,800
Don't be afraid.

291
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,960
He said
I shouldn't make things hard for you,

292
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,040
so I won't.

293
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,560
I'll wait for him to come.

294
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,680
I knew it. You were bound to come!

295
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,560
I warned you.

296
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,280
You can hate me, even kill me,

297
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,960
but you may not touch my empress.

298
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,920
Give me the antidote.

299
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,040
What antidote?

300
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,720
I'll say it one more time.

301
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Give me the antidote!

302
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,360
Your Highness.

303
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,360
I've waited for you all day.

304
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,240
Hurry up and tell your master
that I didn't poison the Empress.

305
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Xiao Ying,

306
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,520
I'm not joking with you.

307
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,960
Ying says she didn't.

308
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,560
Your Majesty,

309
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,120
what's going on?

310
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,080
You're not asking what really happened.

311
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,280
You're just lashing out.

312
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,040
Cangcang's poisoned.

313
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,640
The imperial physician says
he's only seen it in the cold palace.

314
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,760
If Ying really used it, would she deny it?

315
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,000
Every day she shouts about killing you.

316
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,040
Has she ever done something
and not owned up to it?

317
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,080
There may be someone trying to frame her.

318
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,080
Your Highness,

319
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,520
the Empress's poison
really wasn't your doing?

320
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
You came by yesterday.

321
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,040
You told me to go rest, so I did.

322
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,320
I only just came here to wait for you.

323
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,320
How would I poison anyone?

324
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,320
Is that so?

325
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,120
Since noon yesterday,

326
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,520
Princess Ying hasn't taken a step
out of the cold palace.

327
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,040
I stake my life on it.

328
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,840
After the Empress was poisoned,
her whole body turned cold

329
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,880
and the veins in her face
went blue and purple.

330
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,640
What kind of poison is this?

331
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,640
Is there an antidote?

332
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
It sounds like…

333
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,440
Frostflower.

334
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
But I don't have an antidote.

335
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,000
I only brew poisons to kill you.

336
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,160
Why would I bother making antidotes?

337
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,000
Can you make one or not?

338
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,520
I already said there is no antidote.

339
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,760
Her temples have gone purple,
which means she'll be dead in a few hours.

340
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,240
Even if someone can make an antidote,
she won't live to see it.

341
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,000
- Li Hongqing.
- Here.

342
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,640
Go to Nanrong Palace at once.

343
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Understood.

344
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,360
Your Majesty.

345
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,000
As for this matter,
you haven't told Preceptor Du, have you?

346
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,640
No.

347
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Your Majesty…

348
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,560
Let go.

349
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,120
Imperial Physician Li has searched
for ten years for it.

350
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,400
It's your lifesaving medicine.

351
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,240
Ten years, that's all.

352
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,880
I managed to wait before.

353
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,520
- I can keep waiting now.
- Your Majesty…

354
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,920
Go back.

355
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
You should know

356
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,920
that once I've made a decision,
no one can change it.

357
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

358
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,760
Your Majesty.

359
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,760
Xiaoshan,

360
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,040
grind this into powder,
mix it with water and bring it in.

361
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,240
I will use it to cleanse the poison
from the Empress.

362
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,200
Yes, Your Majesty. I'll go at once.

363
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,600
Commander Li took away the Frost Reed.

364
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,200
Is it because
Imperial Physician Li is back?

365
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,520
Seems not.

366
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,520
Commander Li said

367
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,720
if you return,
you'd better go straight to Linghe Hall.

368
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,760
Madam, you can't go in!

369
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Madam!

370
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,280
The Empress is about to wake.

371
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,160
If you have something to say,
we can talk in Wuying Hall.

372
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,920
There's no need for this.

373
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm not dead yet.

374
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,960
You can't afford to wait another ten years
for the Frost Reed.

375
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,960
There may still be hope.

376
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,040
From now on, I will do exactly as you say.

377
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,880
I'll take the medicine and the needles

378
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,200
without so much as a frown.

379
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,200
Who did this?

380
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,800
I'll investigate at once.

381
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,760
No need.

382
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,160
At first, I thought it was Xiao Ying.

383
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,600
But when I returned to Linghe Hall

384
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,520
and checked everything carefully,

385
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,880
I understood.

386
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,199
This

387
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,040
is the pear blossom honey
Cangcang has loved since childhood.

388
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,280
Yesterday, Grand Tutor Ling sent it over.

389
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,800
And the poison was hidden right inside it.

390
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,480
The imperial physician also said

391
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,520
that in what Cangcang was given,

392
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,159
there was not only a fatal toxin

393
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,520
but also Lovesickness Powder.

394
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,120
<i>We found an important lead:</i>

395
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,520
the cure for His Majesty's cold sickness,
the rare Frost Reed,

396
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,840
has finally been found.

397
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
If we lay the Lovesickness Powder
and the poison

398
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,800
only on the very top layer of honey,

399
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,240
can you guarantee
the honey beneath is clean?

400
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,040
I can, my lord.

401
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,040
I once trained under the Tang Clan.

402
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,960
I would never leave any trace behind.

403
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,280
You may rest assured.

404
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,600
This poison

405
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,760
was stolen from Princess Ying

406
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,800
by an undercover agent in the palace,
wasn't it?

407
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,920
Yes.

408
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,360
I heard

409
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,320
His Majesty has already visited
the cold palace

410
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,880
and seems to have cleared Princess Ying.

411
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,440
It doesn't matter.

412
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,040
With no solid proof,

413
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
even if His Majesty suspects something,

414
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,080
this case can only be left hanging.

415
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,680
Speak.

416
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,800
My lord,

417
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,840
this Frostflower poison
is incredibly vicious.

418
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,880
If used carelessly, it could take a life.

419
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,840
Are you truly not worried
about Young Lady?

420
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,960
If you had a daughter

421
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,400
who grew up fair and clever,

422
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,400
treasured like a pearl in your palm,

423
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,360
could you not worry,

424
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,360
not feel pain?

425
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,200
I've long since prepared the antidote.

426
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,600
In the last round,

427
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,080
I lost.

428
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,080
So I decided

429
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,920
to place one more bet.

430
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,880
I bet that someone else's feelings
for Cangcang

431
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,160
run deeper

432
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,320
than mine.

433
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,640
<i>He's gambling.</i>

434
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Word about the Frost Reed
must have leaked out.

435
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,320
He's betting

436
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,360
that I won't just stand by and watch
Cangcang die,

437
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,960
that I'll definitely use the Frost Reed
to save her life.

438
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,240
And once I do,

439
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,240
I won't live much longer.

440
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
He can pin it all on Xiao Ying,

441
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,480
and even stir up strife
between me and the Empress Dowager.

442
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,160
And after that,

443
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,880
if the Empress conceives my heir,

444
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,360
this round
really will be three birds with one stone.

445
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
As for this,

446
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,920
you already knew it

447
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,440
before treating the Empress?

448
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,320
This matter cannot simply be let go!

449
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,360
Are you really going to wait

450
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,240
and let Ling Xuefeng
become regent again one day?

451
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
You must not soften again.

452
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,920
If the Empress bears an heir,

453
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,280
Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.

454
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,280
As Grand Tutor Ling is now,

455
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,120
he's resorting to desperate measures.

456
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,960
LINGHE HALL

457
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,000
<i>You must not soften again.</i>

458
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,520
<i>If the Empress bears an heir,</i>

459
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
<i>Ling Xuefeng will surely rebel.</i>

460
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,720
You're awake.

461
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,400
What happened to me?

462
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,440
You were poisoned.

463
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
Poisoned?

464
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,960
Who did it?

465
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
The Empress Dowager?

466
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,880
It doesn't matter anymore.

467
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,760
What matters is,

468
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,640
the poison has been cleared.

469
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,000
People in this inner palace

470
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
are truly like beasts let loose.

471
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,680
What's wrong?

472
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,680
You look so grim.

473
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,880
Before the medicine cools,

474
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
hurry and drink it.

475
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,640
What kind of medicine is this?

476
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,920
Is it bitter?

477
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,280
Birth-control tea.

478
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,400
What

479
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,880
is that supposed to mean?

480
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,760
It's mixed by Preceptor Du.

481
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,080
It won't do your body much harm.

482
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,040
Take it and it'll work at once.

483
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,080
It can spare you and me

484
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,400
a great deal of trouble.

485
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,120
What trouble?

486
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,640
So…

487
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,320
everything that happened yesterday

488
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,040
was all just an act?

489
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,080
That was three days ago.

490
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,080
You've been unconscious for two days.

491
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,520
Three days apart,

492
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,080
your heart has already changed.

493
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,200
So your love

494
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,840
is just a whim.

495
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,080
Once the mood passes,

496
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,640
you throw it away.

497
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,680
Is that it?
