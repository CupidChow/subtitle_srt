ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,240
Cangcang, don't worry.

3
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
His Majesty's a blessed man.

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,920
How can I not worry?

5
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,840
His condition's getting worse
by the minute.

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,760
Why isn't Physician Li here yet?

7
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,080
I received a report

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,200
that Li Hongqing is escorting Physician Li
on his way over.

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,480
He should be here any minute.

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Your Highness.

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,440
POST STATION

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
What brings you here, Your Highness?

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,400
A matter of life and death.

14
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,680
Please mind your words.

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,360
Looks like he really is on his last legs.

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,920
Then I all the more
have to see him one last time.

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,080
- Hey…
- Physician Li is here.

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,680
You're here.

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,880
Quite the crowd you've got here.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,840
Where's that brat?

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
This way, please.

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,440
Cangcang, calm down.

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,640
Physician Li already said
he can still be saved.

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
But he's been treating him all day

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,320
and there's still no change.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,280
Your brother is blessed by heaven.

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
Don't work yourself up.

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,840
No. I'll go check on him.

29
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
Physician Li!

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,440
How is he?

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
Your Majesty,

32
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,200
as long as His Majesty pulls through

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,160
and wakes up, he'll be out of danger!

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
He'll be fine?

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Cangcang,
what's going on between you and Xiao Huan?

36
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,519
What's between us

37
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,440
isn't something you can explain
in a few words.

38
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,480
If he really gets better,

39
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,480
will you go back to the palace with him?

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,720
I don't know.

41
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,400
Given Master's death, Luo's tragedy,

42
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,080
and everything between my father and him…

43
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
Let's not talk about this.

44
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
Why isn't he waking up yet?

45
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,280
You're awake?

46
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,560
Where's Cangcang?

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
She's outside catching up with Zhong Lin.

48
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,520
You saved me at last.

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,840
That stubborn Physician Li forced me

50
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
to hand over the Frost Blossom.

51
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,400
I honestly wasn't planning to save you.

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,800
But Her Majesty
sent her best friend, Zhong Lin,

53
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,760
to cling to me and beg nonstop.

54
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
Only then did I decide to spare your life.

55
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
Once you're better,

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
I'll come settle the score with you.

57
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,160
So you're saying
I don't need to thank you,

58
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,360
just my empress,
Zhong Lin and Physician Li?

59
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Hey…

60
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,400
How can you be so heartless?

61
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,360
So,

62
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,360
do you like the present I gave you?

63
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
<i>This pouch is for you.</i>

64
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,800
<i>When the time is right,</i>

65
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>you can open it.</i>

66
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
I don't like it.

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,960
When I needed it, it wasn't there.

68
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,600
If you send it too late,
it doesn't mean anything.

69
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,360
It's just like a true heart:

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,320
if it gets no answer,

71
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
then there's no need to answer ever again.

72
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,080
Is that so?

73
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Then give the Divination Chart back to me.

74
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,520
Hey…

75
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Trying to take back a gift
you've already given?

76
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,520
Then spit out the Frost Blossom
and give that back to me too.

77
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,760
To find that lousy leaf
that could save your life,

78
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
I almost lost mine.

79
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,960
What are you laughing at?

80
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,040
Name it.

81
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,320
What else do you want
besides the Divination Chart?

82
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,840
Let me think about it.

83
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,280
<i>The poison you took that day</i>
<i>was incurable.</i>

84
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,800
His Majesty

85
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,120
gave you his Frost Reed.

86
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,480
He gave you the only Frost Reed
that could have saved his life!

87
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,920
- Cangcang…
- I'm here. I'm right here.

88
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,200
Don't leave me…

89
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
<i>Cangcang,</i>

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
I really like you.

91
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
Marry me, will you?

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
<i>Cangcang,</i>

93
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,600
Father,

94
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
My death means nothing!

95
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,840
Has the Empress not come yet?

96
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,520
Her Majesty should already be resting.

97
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,920
You should rest early too.

98
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,840
I'll go check on her.

99
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
Your Majesty.

100
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,000
Your Majesty,

101
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,280
do you think my golden reputation
hasn't been smashed hard enough by you?

102
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,680
Physician Li, I'm already fine.

103
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,720
Fine, my foot!

104
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
You just haven't managed to die yet!
Now hurry back!

105
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,200
What a beautiful hairpin!

106
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
<i>When the pear blossoms are in full bloom,</i>

107
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,200
<i>I'll take you to my pear garden.</i>

108
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,120
<i>This splendid Capital</i>

109
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,640
is riddled with scheming and deceit.

110
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,200
I've lost

111
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,200
and I'm tired.

112
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,080
Cangcang,

113
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
what are you thinking about?

114
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Nothing.

115
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
What is it that's got you so happy?

116
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,760
Nothing.

117
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,960
It's just that His Majesty said
life at the border is harsh,

118
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
so he'll give me a month off every year

119
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,400
to come back and visit you and Father.

120
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,200
Really?

121
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,160
He even wrote the decree himself.

122
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,000
He's also sending officials
over agriculture and works

123
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,360
to open up trade routes for Jiangzhou.

124
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,720
Later, I'll meet with Kumor to discuss

125
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,960
how to resettle the people of Xijiang.

126
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,000
That's wonderful.

127
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,480
Cangcang,

128
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,720
Father always told me
emperors are the most heartless,

129
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,880
that a ruler's heart is unreadable.

130
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,480
He wanted me to train hard
and become a strong warlord.

131
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,080
But I think

132
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,640
His Majesty isn't as heartless
as Father said.

133
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,400
He's an emperor,

134
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,080
but he has a kind heart.

135
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Yes,

136
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,240
he's a good emperor.

137
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,240
Most importantly, he treats you well.

138
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
He's willing
to ride into the enemy camp for you,

139
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
risking his life.

140
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,440
You can't ask for more than that.

141
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
Cangcang,

142
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,720
hurry up
and give birth to a little prince.

143
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
I'm dying to be an uncle.

144
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,760
You brat,

145
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,560
what do you think about all day?

146
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,720
Cangcang,

147
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
I feel like
things between you and His Majesty

148
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,960
are a little off.

149
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,360
Back when he was seriously ill,

150
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,120
you stayed by his side every moment.

151
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
When he was in danger,

152
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,680
you even risked your own life to save him.

153
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,840
But now that he's awake,

154
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,520
you won't go and see him.

155
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,760
What's between us

156
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
isn't something you'd understand!

157
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,200
There's nothing a good drink can't fix.

158
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,400
Cangcang,

159
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,760
back when you insisted on
roaming the martial world,

160
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,160
Father was dead set against it.

161
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,440
Didn't you say

162
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,560
all those martial world dreams
aren't worth a single cup of wine?

163
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,480
I've never seen you
this weighed down before.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah.

165
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,920
A sword and a jar of wine,

166
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,200
that's the Cangcang I'm supposed to be.

167
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Cangcang, where are you going?

168
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,720
His Majesty's better now.

169
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,960
I've still got things to do,
so I have to leave first.

170
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
You're not staying with His Majesty?

171
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,040
POST STATION

172
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Your Majesty,
Her Majesty left early this morning.

173
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,360
Summon Kumor and Ling Jueding
to discuss affairs.

174
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,880
Your body
still can't take too much strain.

175
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,080
It's fine.

176
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,520
I need to get everything in Xijiang
and Jiangzhou properly arranged

177
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,760
so we can set out as soon as possible.

178
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

179
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,120
Hongqing,
escort Physician Li back to the Capital.

180
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,800
Shi Yan, return to Fenglai Pavilion.

181
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,040
All right.

182
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,280
General Ling,

183
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
even though Jiangzhou is settled,

184
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,000
there will be plenty of loose ends.

185
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,640
I hope you won't relax your guard.

186
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,960
I obey, Your Majesty.

187
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,800
I will see to everything personally.

188
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,000
General Ling,

189
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,560
do you know where the Empress has gone?

190
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
My sister didn't tell me.

191
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,480
But…

192
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,880
Your Majesty may head toward Yanxia Lake.

193
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,320
She once said she wanted to see it.

194
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
All right.

195
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
Thank you, General Ling!

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,560
Your Majesty!

197
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,200
You've only just begun to recover.

198
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,920
You can't push yourself like this!

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
Physician Li,

200
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,520
didn't I tell you I'm already fine?

201
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,120
And I just took my medicine, didn't I?

202
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
Your Majesty…

203
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,880
Don't kneel.

204
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,160
Madam, General Lu requests an audience.

205
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,360
- Let him in.
- Yes, Madam.

206
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,160
Preceptor Du.

207
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,640
General Lu.

208
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,520
How is His Majesty?

209
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,080
His Majesty and Her Majesty

210
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
will be able to return soon.

211
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
How is His Majesty's health?

212
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,080
His Majesty is in excellent health.

213
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,000
It's just… it's just…

214
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,320
Just what?

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,680
His Majesty gave a verbal edict
for me to pass on to you.

216
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,880
What edict?

217
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,280
His Majesty said

218
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,560
the Empress will soon return
to the palace,

219
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,080
and that you…

220
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,920
that you are

221
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,360
to remember what he told you
back in Jiangzhou.

222
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,119
In this world,

223
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,359
there is more than one person

224
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,359
who can heal my body.

225
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,920
But as for my empress,

226
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,880
there's only Cangcang.

227
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,680
I obey, Your Majesty.

228
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,880
Madam!

229
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,120
Madam, what happened to you?

230
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,840
I followed His Majesty's will

231
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,520
and reflected in Nanrong Palace.

232
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,280
But you can't hurt yourself.

233
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
So what if I hurt myself?

234
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,640
No one cares anyway.

235
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,240
I…

236
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,680
Coward.

237
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,600
- Madam…
- You like someone but don't dare admit it.

238
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,800
If that doesn't make you a coward,
what does?

239
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,520
Madam,

240
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,680
do you still remember
your mother's last words?

241
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
Think this through.

242
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,040
If you stay by my side today,

243
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,480
you belong to me from now on,

244
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,960
your life and death at my command.

245
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,880
If you want my heart,

246
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,160
I will give it to you!

247
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,360
Come catch me!

248
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,400
Catch me!

249
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,600
You can't catch me!

250
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,360
I never imagined

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that after all these years,

252
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,600
there'd be so many shops here.

253
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,560
Sir,

254
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,400
- one plate of fennel dumplings.
- Got it!

255
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,800
Today is my foster son's birthday.

256
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,720
And also,

257
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,960
- bring a small jar of wine too.
- All right!

258
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,560
Luo!

259
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,640
<i>Cangcang!</i>

260
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,840
<i>I can't protect you anymore!</i>

261
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,280
<i>Live well.</i>

262
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,160
<i>You must live on!</i>

263
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,240
Cangcang,

264
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,440
we'll meet again someday.

265
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,400
Good child,

266
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,760
I'll be waiting for good news from you.

267
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,480
I will not fail your expectations!

268
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,840
Long live Lingbi!

269
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,880
All hail the Protector!

270
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,920
Long live Lingbi!

271
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,040
All hail the Protector!

272
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,520
Xianxue,

273
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,560
you've done very well.

274
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
You make me proud.

275
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,480
Thank you for backing me, Father.

276
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,280
But what brings you here this time?

277
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,760
Has something happened in Jiangzhou?

278
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
The Jiangzhou crisis is over.

279
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,520
Jueding got out of it in one piece.

280
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,880
But Xiao Huan

281
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,800
sacrificed the status verification system

282
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,240
to make Kumor agree to withdraw.

283
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,560
But Father,

284
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,080
wasn't the system your idea?

285
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,760
Xiao Huan wants Xiao Qianqing
to act as Regent

286
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,720
mainly to counter me
and the Empress Dowager,

287
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,880
so he can reap all the gains,

288
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,120
and push his
talent recommendation system through.

289
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,440
New emperor, new court.

290
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,480
He means to stand against me completely.

291
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,760
And that's not all.

292
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,400
Xiao Qianqing even went to Jiangzhou
in person.

293
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Who knows what he's plotting.

294
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,960
At this rate,

295
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,120
not only our Ling clan,
but Cangcang as well

296
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,080
will find it

297
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,120
even harder
to survive in that imperial city.

298
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,680
Whatever you need of me,

299
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I will not refuse.

300
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,160
Cangcang, go easy on the wine.

301
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
This really isn't like you.

302
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,720
Jueding said a jar of wine and a sword,

303
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
that's the real me.

304
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
Isn't that just the old Ling Cangcang?

305
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,880
How is that not me?

306
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,120
At this point,
you have to learn to move on.

307
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah, move on.

308
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,120
That's why I'm saying,

309
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,400
why don't we go back
and rebuild Fenglai Pavilion?

310
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,320
What's wrong?

311
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,280
You're acting really strange.

312
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,480
Are you hiding something from me?

313
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,400
- Cangcang, I…
- I know.

314
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
You've been bewitched by Xiao Qianqing.

315
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,400
What are you even talking about?

316
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
You're lying to me.

317
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,360
No…

318
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,240
We're talking about you.
How did this get turned on me?

319
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Look how flustered you are.

320
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,960
I hit the mark, didn't I?

321
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,240
- You do like him.
- Don't talk nonsense.

322
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,120
So what if you like him?
What's so hard about admitting it?

323
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,960
Cangcang,

324
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,520
I actually…

325
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,480
What are you doing here?

326
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,560
So my brother can come, but I can't?

327
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,200
Cangcang, why did you leave so suddenly?

328
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,960
Come back to the Capital with me.

329
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,400
You promised you would.

330
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,640
<i>It's harsh out here,</i>
<i>nothing like the palace.</i>

331
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,600
Why don't we head back a little earlier?

332
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,560
We?

333
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,760
You mean…

334
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,760
you and I going back
to the Capital together?

335
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
Xiao Huan,

336
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,080
stop coming after me.

337
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,200
You're the Empress of Great Qi,
head of Fenglai Pavilion.

338
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,800
How can someone like you
go back on her word?

339
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,320
Ten more li ahead,

340
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,640
and we'll reach Yanxia Lake.

341
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
We can take the waterway back.

342
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,640
I just feel there are things

343
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
I need to sort out in my head.

344
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
He's chased his wife a thousand li,

345
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,160
and you insist on getting in the way here.

346
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,880
They get to enjoy the scenery
on their way back,

347
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,240
while I have to deal
with all those old foxes.

348
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,080
How is that fair?

349
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,880
She's the Empress of Great Qi.

350
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,560
How could that be the same?

351
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,280
I'm warning you,

352
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,360
with that attitude,

353
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,160
watch they don't dump you halfway
and feed you to the wolves.

354
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm not scared.

355
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,760
I've still got you, don't I?

356
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,040
You won't have the heart to dump me.

357
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,720
I'll toss you in first!

358
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,320
Please don't hurt my child!

359
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,120
Zhong Lin!

360
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,880
Zhong Lin!

361
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,080
Zhong Lin!

362
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,920
What did you make her take?

363
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,280
You think we're idiots

364
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,440
who'd swallow your poison?

365
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,600
Say one more word

366
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,400
- and I'll stab her again!
- Wait!

367
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,160
Stop!

368
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,680
Eat it, now!

369
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,240
I thought it was something serious.

370
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Turns out it's just
some cheap soft-bone powder.

371
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,960
Hardly worth all this fuss.

372
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,640
Talk! What do you people actually want?

373
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,680
Send someone who can negotiate.

374
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,200
ZHU SHA,
BRANCH LEADER OF THE LINGBI SECT

375
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,840
Honestly,

376
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,280
none of you know how to treat a lady.

377
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,080
Such a pretty little thing,

378
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
how can you be so rough with her?

379
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,640
Who on earth are you?

380
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,240
Don't hurt her.

381
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,680
- If you want to talk, talk to me.
- Talk to you?

382
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,760
Sure. Come here.

383
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
Cangcang, don't come any closer…

384
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,240
This is Bone-Eating Ice, deadly poison.

385
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
So you're one of us.

386
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,160
No wonder
you know what Bone-Eating Ice is.

387
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,160
How funny.

388
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,000
Since when did the Lingbi Sect's assassins

389
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,080
grow so soft-hearted?

390
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,520
What are you talking about?

391
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,720
What Lingbi Sect assassin?

392
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,040
Looks like your friend

393
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,880
still doesn't know who you really are.

394
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,520
We've got two grown men right here.

395
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
Why are you bullying a girl?

396
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,440
If you've got guts, come at us!

397
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,360
Don't rush.

398
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,160
Here I am.

399
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,080
Heal her.

400
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,760
Otherwise, there's nothing to talk about.

401
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,040
Sir,

402
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,680
how did you know I wanted to talk to you?

403
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,600
If anything happens to her,

404
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,520
I can guarantee

405
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,400
that what you want will never be yours.

406
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,680
Oh, I'm so scared!

407
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,320
Treating her isn't out of the question.

408
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,520
This sir,

409
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,360
you were so fired up just now.

410
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,800
What, trying to play the hero?

411
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,360
And what if I am?

412
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,760
How about this:

413
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,960
if you stab yourself once,

414
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,160
I'll treat her wound.

415
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Xiao Qianqing,

416
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,360
don't listen to this madwoman…

417
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,680
Well?

418
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,600
If you don't,

419
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,000
Miss Zhong will die
from this Bone-Eating Ice.

420
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,080
Not deep enough.

421
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,760
Go deeper and the two ladies
will go to the VIP parlor.

422
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,960
There'll be food, drink,

423
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,880
medicine, and a warm brazier.

424
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,240
That's the spirit!

425
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,680
Take Miss Ling and Miss Zhong
to the VIP parlor.

426
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,600
Yes, Madam!

427
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,760
The drug we gave you
does more than just sap your strength

428
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,560
and block your inner force.

429
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,480
It also slows your bleeding.

430
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,160
You'll die very slowly,

431
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,160
and ever so beautifully.

432
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,200
What are you really after?

433
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,360
I thought you knew.

434
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,159
How would I know if you don't say?

435
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,520
Don't rush.

436
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,280
You can stay here
and slowly admire your brother's misery.

437
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,360
Cangcang…

438
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,719
there's something

439
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,760
I've never known how to say to you.

440
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,400
I…

441
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,080
You don't have to.

442
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,120
I already know.

443
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,000
I've actually suspected for a long time

444
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,680
that Master sent you to my side.

445
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,520
After his identity was exposed,

446
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,200
I started doubting who you were too.

447
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,680
But…

448
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,400
if the truth had really come out,

449
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
I wouldn't have known
how to face it either.

450
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,800
Cangcang,

451
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,680
I never meant to hide it from you.

452
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,160
You're the person I care about most.

453
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,560
I'd rather go to my death
than ever hurt you in the slightest.

454
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,840
I know.

455
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,720
That's why I trust you.
I won't hold it against you.

456
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,280
After everything we've been through,

457
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,320
I've finally realized

458
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,760
a lot of things
aren't simply black or white.

459
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,320
I know you must have had your reasons.

460
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,280
You've changed.

461
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,320
It's like you suddenly grew up.

462
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,880
Let's drop it.

463
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Our top priority now
is figuring out how to get out of here.

464
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,920
Those people are from the Lingbi Sect?

465
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
Right.

466
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,680
They know who we are,

467
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,520
and they know ordinary poisons

468
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,280
can't do anything to Xiao Huan,

469
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,160
so they hit us
with soft-bone powder right away.

470
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,800
Looks like they came well-prepared.

471
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,760
What is she after?

472
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,400
How's your wound?

473
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,600
I hate it
when you dodge the question like that.

474
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,960
Same.

475
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,440
I hate it when you keep badgering me.

476
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,520
I only got hurt because of you.

477
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
You clearly just wanted to play the hero.

478
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,520
What's that got to do with me?

479
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,320
Of course it has to do with you.

480
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
They were obviously coming for you.

481
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,280
If I'd known,
I should've wiped them all out.

482
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
What else do you know
about the Lingbi Sect?

483
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,080
Ever since Master Li Lu sent me to you,

484
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,400
I've barely had any contact with them.

485
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,600
I only heard
their saintess came out of seclusion.

486
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,680
And not long ago,

487
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,680
a Lingbi Sect Protector
suddenly came to me

488
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,760
and ordered me to kill Xiao Qianqing.

489
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,360
There was such a thing?

490
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,000
And Xiao Qianqing
pulled a disappearing act

491
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,760
and helped me get away.

492
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,880
But now that they've recognized me again,

493
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,400
they definitely won't let this go.

494
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,560
But this time,
I won't dance to their tune.

495
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,200
Their earlier attempt
to kill Xiao Qianqing

496
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,600
is surely not as simple as it seems.

497
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,600
And the woman today
doesn't seem to want him dead.

498
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,640
Then what does she want?

499
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,880
This operation

500
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,840
is to intercept and kill
the Emperor of Great Qi

501
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,280
and take back
the Lingbi Sect's sacred relic.

502
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
That's the Emperor of Great Qi!

503
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,120
And you dare set an ambush for him?

504
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,520
Don't forget:

505
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,320
if he doesn't die, you will.

506
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,600
I forgot to introduce myself.

507
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,760
I'm Zhu Sha,
branch leader of Shuyang chapter

508
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,880
of the Lingbi Sect.

509
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,920
As for me,

510
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,760
I love thinking up
new ways to torment people.

511
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,880
So should I try them out on you,

512
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,120
or on Ling Cangcang?

513
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,960
If you lay a finger on her,

514
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,320
I swear

515
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,080
you'll never get what you're after!

516
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,080
They say emperors are heartless.

517
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,240
But you'd turn out
to be such a lovesick fool!

518
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,480
I heard the Ghost King's token,
the Moon-Eclipse, is in your hands.

519
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,800
How about this: divorce Ling Cangcang,

520
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,720
and I'll marry you.

521
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
You be the Emperor,
I'll be the Ghost King.

522
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,760
We'll work together and rule the world.

523
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,920
My brother doesn't need to work
with some freakish witch like you.

524
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,040
Xiao Qianqing,

525
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,080
do you want Zhong Lin dead that badly?

526
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,240
Guards! Go tie Zhong Lin up!

527
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,480
Wait!

528
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,840
Miss…

529
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,240
Miss Zhu Sha, hold on.

530
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,280
Don't be hasty.

531
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,960
If he won't agree, you can have me.

532
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,000
I… I am younger than he is,
and a lot gentler.

533
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,760
We can work together.

534
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,840
Really?

535
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,880
Guards, open the cage.

536
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,040
But I like
the proud streak on you even more.

537
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,880
If you're willing
to spend one night with me,

538
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,840
I'll let them go.

539
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,640
- How about it?
- What's wrong with your taste?

540
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
He's got no sense of romance at all.

541
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,640
I'm different.

542
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,600
Guards,

543
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,240
- take him to my room.
- Yes, Madam!

544
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,800
You really are a stunning beauty.

545
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,680
No wonder the Emperor
fell so hard for you.

546
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,040
Cut the nonsense.

547
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,600
What exactly are you after?

548
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,360
There are so many lovesick ones
in this world.

549
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,000
Whether their love is real,

550
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,560
my Illusion-Butterfly Powder will tell.

551
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,680
Tell me,

552
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,520
for your sake,

553
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,640
will Xiao Huan hand over the Moon-Eclipse?

554
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,240
Cangcang, does it still hurt?

555
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,720
Let's think of a way to get out of here.

556
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,320
Your Majesty…

557
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,160
Cangcang, what's wrong?

558
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,000
Cangcang!

559
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,760
It's me, Xiao Huan!

560
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,440
She's inhaled
my Illusion-Butterfly Powder.

561
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,400
It traps people in illusions.

562
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,600
Her mind and the drug will tear at her,
driving her into agony

563
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,800
until her insides collapse and she dies.

564
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,880
How long do you think she can last?

565
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,360
Zhu Sha, how can you be so vicious?

566
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,240
You're only realizing that now?

567
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,040
You just want the Moon-Eclipse, don't you?
I can give it to you!

568
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,480
Right now, in her eyes,

569
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,440
you're a mortal enemy
she's fighting to the death.

570
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,080
Cangcang, it's me, Xiao Huan.

571
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,040
I don't believe you'd really kill me.
