ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL <i>MY QUEEN</i>
BY XIE LOUNAN

2
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
She doesn't remember anything.

3
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,280
She doesn't remember Li Hongqing.

4
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,760
Like this,

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,920
do you really think she'll ever be happy?

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Qianqing…

7
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,040
I remember now.

8
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,200
I wanted to go with you…

9
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
outside the palace.

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,120
We must never let Xiao Ying remember!

11
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,800
Madam, Xiao Ying has never seen you.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,640
No.

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,240
No…

14
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,280
He's so smart.

15
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,560
He's bound to pick up
on some clue about me.

16
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,600
We can't let Xiao Ying live.

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,640
She has to die!

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
Rest easy, Madam.

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,360
She may not make it through.

20
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,400
Xiao Ying couldn't kill him.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,720
Ling Xuefeng couldn't kill him.

22
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,040
Why does he always slip away?

23
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,360
Looks like I'll have to do it myself.

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,680
Ever since he seized that little witch,

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
Qianqing hasn't set
foot in Xuanguang Hall.

26
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,320
This son of mine would toss me aside

27
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,160
for some lowborn woman!

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,960
His Highness must
be busy with state affairs.

29
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760
Busy with what?

30
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,920
If he spared even half
a thought for proper duties,

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
I wouldn't have to worry like this.

32
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,040
These flowers need trimming.

33
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,760
You are right, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

35
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,440
This is Rest Incense I've prepared myself.

36
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,680
Your Majesty may
find it useful these days.

37
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,360
You've personally made incense for me?

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,000
If I remember right,

39
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,880
this is the first time in five years.

40
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,160
I was disrespectful before.

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,399
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
REST INCENSE

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
Don't say that.

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
Everyone in this palace knows

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,120
you are His Majesty's man

46
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,520
and that you are wary of Xuanguang Hall,

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,320
so you keep your distance.

48
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,520
I understand.

49
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,200
Prince of Yuzhang's loyalty to His Majesty
far surpasses mine.

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
I was narrow-minded before.

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
Preceptor Du, why would you say that?

52
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
His Highness has given
his all to assist His Majesty.

53
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,960
Now Great Qi stands secure,

54
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,240
and His Majesty
holds power firmly in hand.

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
Yet His Highness
chose to withdraw at his peak,

56
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,000
indifferent to rank and reward,
a true example to the realm.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,160
All of this
is thanks to Your Majesty's kindness

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
and wise guidance.

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,440
You may speak freely.

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,280
About His Highness stepping back,
what exactly did he do?

61
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,640
So Your Majesty truly didn't know?

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,560
Then I've overstepped
by speaking out of turn.

63
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,160
His Highness is so upright and selfless

64
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
that he's given both his royal seal
and his command token to His Majesty.

65
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,000
His loyalty is pure enough.

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm ashamed by comparison.

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,440
I shall take my leave.

68
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,920
Ask Qianqing to see me! At once!

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

70
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,640
So,

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,160
you handed over your royal seal
and your command token just like that?

72
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,720
You decided this on your own

73
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,240
and couldn't even be bothered to tell me?

74
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,800
Of course you would object.

75
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,440
But I've already thought it through.

76
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
As a prince,

77
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,160
you feel nothing for the throne.

78
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,720
And now, you've even handed over

79
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,640
your command token and seal?

80
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,000
If I don't lay these burdens down,

81
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,640
where else can I ever find true freedom?

82
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,000
Qianqing…

83
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,440
how many times have I told you?

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,800
Your brother, Xiao Huan,
is extremely calculating.

85
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,240
If you hand these over today,

86
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,080
tomorrow could be the day we die!

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
I've already made up my mind.

88
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,560
Beat me or punish me, whatever you wish.

89
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,240
You ungrateful son!

90
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,080
Do you know what it has
cost me to live to this day?

91
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
The late Emperor

92
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,160
lavished all his affection on
that shady woman of unknown origin.

93
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,560
He even made her empress.

94
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
When she died,

95
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,720
he made her sickly son crown prince.

96
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,320
Our Liu clan has served
loyally for three generations,

97
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
a house of high rank.

98
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,920
How am I any worse than her?

99
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,840
And you,

100
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,320
how are you any
worse than that sickly wretch?

101
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,520
What has gotten into you all?

102
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,080
Have you all gone mad?

103
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,520
Qianqing,

104
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,560
Xiao Huan is not your brother.

105
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,000
He's someone who could
take your life at any moment,

106
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
your enemy!

107
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,600
In all the prices you've paid,

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,040
does that include Ying?

109
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
You… You're talking nonsense again.

110
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,560
Deep down, we both know

111
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,120
what really happened with that fire
at Luling Palace!

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,480
You were so harsh on my imperial brother

113
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,520
that the palace servants
dared to abandon their posts,

114
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,520
and that led to the fire.

115
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,080
If not for you,
Ying would never have ended up like this!

116
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,559
How dare you!

117
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,000
Why did the late empress
suddenly die of a mysterious illness?

118
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,440
Why was her son born with cold poison?

119
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
Mother,

120
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,280
do you dare look into these things?

121
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,320
There is a limit to
this kind of wild talk!

122
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Mother,

123
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
do you love Ying?

124
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
And have you ever loved me?

125
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you think everything I've done
was to hurt you?

126
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,400
Maybe you did.

127
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,480
But the day comes

128
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
when we can no
longer be tools in your battles,

129
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
you'll stop loving us, don't you?

130
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,520
You…

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Mother, you've spent your whole life
trapped in this palace.

132
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,680
I don't want to repeat your fate.

133
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
This palace

134
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,760
is nothing but a gilded cage.

135
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,880
Have you ever truly been happy here?

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,280
Ying included.

137
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
She was completely innocent,

138
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,800
yet still got dragged in!

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,280
I've thought it through.

140
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,200
Once Ying recovers,

141
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll take her away from here at once,

142
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,720
back to Southern Chu.

143
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,240
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

144
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,480
Did you argue with your mother?
She hit you?

145
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,440
News sure travels fast with you.

146
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Zhong Lin…

147
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm in a bad mood, and my wound hurts.

148
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
When I was little, I got beaten a lot too.

149
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,960
And I was terribly afraid of pain.

150
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
After enough beatings,
I eventually got used to it.

151
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,200
This is my own special salve.

152
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,920
It works wonders!
It eases the pain right away.

153
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,000
Zhong Lin, thank you

154
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,840
for staying by my side
when I was at my lowest.

155
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,320
Don't worry.

156
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,160
I've already made up my mind.

157
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,600
I'll take you and Ying away from here.

158
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,320
We'll travel the world together,
free and unrestrained.

159
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,480
Travel the world, free and unrestrained…

160
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
All right.

161
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,320
We'll go together!

162
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,480
The Empress Dowager is here!

163
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,400
My dear Ying, what are you doing?

164
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Move aside! You're blocking my sun.

165
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,160
Ying, look at me.

166
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,400
Mother's here to see you.

167
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,760
Mother?

168
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,280
Does "Mother" mean my mom?

169
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,680
Yes.

170
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,040
You look so fierce.

171
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,080
I don't want you as my mother.

172
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,720
I like the fun, pretty Empress.

173
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,440
I want her to be my mother.

174
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,680
My brother likes her too.

175
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,560
She even promised to cure me.

176
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,720
I'll get better soon.

177
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,320
She wants to treat you?

178
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,120
- Hongqing…
- How could she cure anyone?

179
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,160
She definitely doesn't mean well.

180
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,840
You mustn't believe the Empress's lies.

181
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,080
Ying, do me a favor, will you?

182
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,480
Help me talk some sense into your brother.

183
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
Tell him to take back his royal seal.

184
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
All right?

185
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,120
Are you listening to me?

186
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,440
Help me persuade
your brother to take back his seal.

187
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Do you understand?

188
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,200
Do you or don't you?

189
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,040
Ying, I'm talking to you!

190
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,400
Do you understand? Listen to me!

191
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,400
Xiao Huan, save me!

192
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,720
Ying…

193
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,520
Mother, what did you give Father to drink?

194
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,840
What did you give Father to drink?

195
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,080
What are you talking about?

196
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Ying?

197
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,400
Your Majesty, time to take medicine.

198
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
You…

199
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,280
What did you give Father to drink?

200
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,200
Tell me… Ying…

201
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,800
has she remembered everything?

202
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,120
We really can't let her remember.

203
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
We can't let her remember!

204
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,040
Li…

205
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,840
Hong…

206
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
Qing…

207
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,880
Dear Hongqing…

208
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,319
I remember you now.

209
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Heavens above, you're finally awake!

210
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
Where am I?

211
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,800
This is Lujiao Village.

212
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
When we went up the mountain to chop wood,

213
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,880
we saw you hanging from a tree.

214
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
You were barely breathing.

215
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
So the two of us carried you back.

216
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,280
The village physician
said you wouldn't make it.

217
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,440
Didn't expect you to be this hard to kill!

218
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,080
Was I unconscious?

219
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,800
- Yeah.
- How long was I out?

220
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,120
About…

221
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
a full fifteen days!

222
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,680
That's right, fifteen days.

223
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,800
Don't get up! Just rest…

224
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,120
You just woke up.

225
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,440
Your body's still too weak.
What are you trying to do?

226
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Please take me to Fenglai Pavilion.

227
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,160
For saving my life,

228
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,520
I'll see that you're well rewarded.

229
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,400
But Li Hongqing is dead.

230
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,360
- Even if the flower blooms…
- Don't say that again!

231
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,320
there's no one left to protect you.

232
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,440
That day…

233
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,520
someone told me…

234
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,040
Hongqing was dead.

235
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,880
No one would take me to see the flowers.

236
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,400
He gave me a box…

237
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Inside was some incense…

238
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,600
Was it Gold Incense?

239
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,280
That scent was so familiar…

240
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,440
What did it smell like?

241
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,560
Medicine…

242
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
It was some medicinal incense…

243
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,560
It was some medicinal incense…

244
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,120
<i>Today, when Father</i>
<i>was struck by that arrow,</i>

245
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,840
he uttered some strange word.

246
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
NANRONG

247
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,600
<i>Is it really you?</i>

248
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,520
Your Majesty.

249
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
It's rare to see you so distracted.
What are you thinking about?

250
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,520
I was thinking that once all this is over,

251
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,200
I want to leave the palace with you
and roam the martial world again.

252
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,400
Sounds good.

253
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,800
Your Majesty's word is law.

254
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,040
Why don't you put it in writing as a vow?

255
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,320
All right.

256
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,520
Then for my empress, I'll write a vow.

257
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,000
BE OUR PROOF

258
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
"Cangcang and Chifan's vow:

259
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,000
to cross mountains and rivers,
and roam the martial world together.

260
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,320
This shall be our proof."

261
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,680
You must remember this, Your Majesty.

262
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
<i>Cangcang,</i>

263
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,680
<i>the one behind it all might really be her.</i>

264
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,800
<i>But her roots in the palace run deep.</i>

265
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,840
<i>If I move against her,</i>
<i>she'll strike back like mad.</i>

266
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,040
<i>Only by sending you away safely</i>
<i>can I risk everything.</i>

267
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,520
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

268
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,920
Your Majesty, Your Majesty the Empress,

269
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,040
there's news from Physician Li.

270
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,800
What news?

271
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
The man at Fayun Temple
is already improving.

272
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
He should wake up very soon.

273
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,800
Really?

274
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
That's wonderful!

275
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,800
Ling Xuefeng is about to wake up.
You should be by his side.

276
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,640
There's a thousand-year
lingzhi kept in the palace.

277
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,840
It can strengthen one's vital energy.

278
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,000
It's extremely effective for
patients who have just woken up.

279
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,960
Have Wufu bring it when you go.

280
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Then I'll go at once.

281
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,080
Cangcang…

282
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,120
What's wrong? Can't bear to leave me?

283
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah. I can't.

284
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,000
When I come back,

285
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
will you still remember your vow?

286
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I will.

287
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Of course I will.

288
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,960
Once we find the one behind it all,
you'd better keep your promise.

289
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,120
All right.

290
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,040
Then we'll leave the palace together,

291
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
wandering around
and roaming the martial world again.

292
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,720
Where did you get
this Golden Snake hairpin?

293
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,920
It's something my mother left me.

294
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,160
She said if I was ever in danger,

295
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,680
I could use this hairpin to
seek help from the Lingbi Sect.

296
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
The mighty Imperial Preceptor of Great Qi

297
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
would turn to the Lingbi Sect?

298
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,120
It seems your ambition is no small thing.

299
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,400
We rely on
the support of all you stewards,

300
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,880
so this is no more than you deserve.

301
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,680
Ms. Yan,

302
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,600
I'm old and plagued by illness.
I only wish to go home soon.

303
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,160
Such generous gifts,
I'm really not worthy of them.

304
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,200
Oh?

305
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,280
Compared with all the bribes

306
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,640
you've taken over the years,

307
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
these hardly count as anything.

308
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,200
Madam, Ms. Yan, I've been framed!

309
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,760
I've been framed…

310
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,200
Your crimes are
written out clearly right there.

311
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,840
Did you really think your little schemes

312
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,120
could ever fool the Madam?

313
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,760
Guards!

314
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,800
Spare me, Madam!

315
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,960
Spare me, Madam!

316
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,880
Du Tingxin, how dare you deal with
palace staff without permission?

317
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,840
Du Tingxin!

318
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,000
Du Tingxin!

319
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,120
Anyone else here have something to say?

320
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,560
From now on,

321
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,000
we will follow only you, Madam!

322
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,400
With absolute loyalty!

323
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,640
- With absolute loyalty!
- With absolute loyalty!

324
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,640
Eunuch Li…

325
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,360
You've served in the palace a long time.

326
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,480
Hearing that from you
puts my mind at ease.

327
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,080
We've been short-handed
all over the palace lately.

328
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,680
I've already chosen
new people to fill the gaps.

329
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,280
Appoint them one by one
according to what's written there.

330
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,520
Understood.

331
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,560
Before long,

332
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Madam,
you'll have both the harem and the court

333
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,960
in the palm of your hand.

334
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,880
Ying, remember:

335
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,160
After you and
your brother leave the palace,

336
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,800
give this jade pendant to him.

337
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,760
My brother's taking me out of the palace?

338
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,320
That's right.

339
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,440
I hope you can both stay safe.

340
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,640
Leaving this place
may be the best choice for you.

341
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,280
I just hope
all of this is just my suspicions.

342
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Suspicions?

343
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Suspicions about what?

344
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,200
Whether someone who grew up with me

345
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,400
is really the culprit.

346
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,160
The culprit behind that medicinal incense?

347
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,760
All right. Put this jade pendant away.

348
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,640
Your brother isn't easy to handle.

349
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,040
If I gave it to him myself,

350
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,080
he'd pester me with a hundred questions.

351
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,800
So I'm giving it to you instead.

352
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,400
If you ever run into any danger,

353
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,720
go to Fenglai Pavilion for money
or for people, as much as you like.

354
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,400
Ying,

355
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,760
everything that's happened
is already in the past.

356
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,520
I hope you and your brother
can both find happiness.

357
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm sorry…

358
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't know why,

359
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
but I suddenly wanted to say that to you.

360
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,280
Ying,

361
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,800
with your brother,

362
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,120
hurry and leave this cold, lifeless place.

363
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,080
I hope you will both be happy
and carefree.

364
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,560
And you?

365
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,880
Won't you cure me?

366
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,120
It hurts you too much. Let's stop.

367
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,720
Then what about Hongqing?

368
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm so close to remembering him.

369
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,800
I want the treatment…
I want the treatment…

370
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,760
I want to see Hongqing clearly!

371
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,160
I want the treatment…

372
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,760
I want the treatment!

373
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,480
Treat me now!

374
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,280
If you won't treat me, I'll treat myself!

375
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,560
Xiao Ying, calm down!

376
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,320
I want to see Hongqing clearly…

377
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,960
I want to see Hongqing clearly!

378
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,560
I want the treatment…

379
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,520
I want to see Hongqing clearly…

380
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,680
All right!

381
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,200
I'll treat you.

382
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Stop!

383
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,200
Your Majesty, how can you be so cruel?

384
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,200
Please spare our Ying.
Are you trying to kill her?

385
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
What are you talking about?

386
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,600
I saw it with my own eyes.

387
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,520
Stop torturing Ying.

388
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
Your Majesty, I beg you.

389
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,760
Please let Ying go.

390
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,200
Take it out on me.

391
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,080
Just stop tormenting her, please!

392
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,400
Ying, we won't treat you anymore.

393
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,239
You won't suffer like this anymore.

394
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,600
Come on. Let me help you over.

395
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,600
Let's go rest.

396
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,520
Ying?

397
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,719
- Ying?
- Mother…

398
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,239
it hurts so much…

399
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,639
What's wrong? Ying?

400
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,880
It hurts…

401
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
Ying, are you all right?

402
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,000
Ying.

403
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,360
Move aside! Don't touch her!

404
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,159
Are you all right, Ying?

405
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,760
Ying!

406
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Ying!

407
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,480
Ying!

408
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,400
- Ying!
- Ying!

409
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,240
- Ying!
- Ying, wake up!

410
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,600
Ying!

411
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,160
Ying, please wake up! Ying!

412
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,320
Ying!

413
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,600
Ying! Ying!

414
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Ying!

415
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,880
- Ying, wake up. Ying!
- Ying!

416
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,000
Ying!

417
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,600
Xiao Huan!

418
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,840
You killed my dear Ying!

419
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,720
Ying!

420
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,920
SHUTONG HALL

421
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,520
Ying.

422
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,720
Ying.

423
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,840
Wake up…

424
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,600
It's… it's me.

425
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,200
Ying.

426
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Look…

427
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,240
the flowers are about to bloom.

428
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,200
You said… they're called Blaze Blossom…

429
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,400
and they're dazzling.

430
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,680
You said when they bloomed,

431
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,320
you, Zhong Lin, and I

432
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
would return to Southern Chu.

433
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,440
Do you still remember all that?

434
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,040
I've already planned
to take you and Zhong Lin.

435
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,520
We'll leave this place together,

436
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,640
roam the martial world together,

437
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,360
and go find your dear Hongqing together.

438
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,480
We'll bring him along, all of us together.

439
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,600
Didn't you say you missed him so much?

440
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,800
Please wake up…

441
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Don't scare me like this…

442
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Ying.

443
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,800
- Xiao Qianqing…
- I'm begging you, snap out of it.

444
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,040
- Xiao Qianqing, wake up!
- I'm here…

445
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,920
- Ying is dead!
- I'm here… Don't touch me!

446
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,680
She's not dead…

447
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,800
Ying loves studying
strange little medicines.

448
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,440
This might…
might just be one she was trying out.

449
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,800
She's tricking us.

450
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,920
Ying… Ying is just playing a trick on us…

451
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
- Xiao Qianqing!
- Ying…

452
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,880
Wake up now!

453
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,280
It was Xiao Huan who killed her!

454
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,080
At last, I'm back.

455
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,440
CHANGHE GATE

456
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,960
Aren't you supposed to
be on duty at Wuying Hall?

457
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,880
Why are you standing guard here?

458
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,080
Your Highness?

459
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,480
What happened?

460
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,600
Where is the Princess?

461
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,880
Where did you go?

462
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,600
They all said you were dead.

463
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,240
You should've stayed dead.
What did you come back for now?

464
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,160
How could you die?

465
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,280
So, Princess Ying…

466
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,640
died to force out the Dual-Pupil insect.

467
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,960
To get her memories back,

468
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,320
she suffered pain no
ordinary person could bear.

469
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,480
I promised Princess Ying

470
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,920
I'd protect her for life…

471
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,560
You're both such hopeless fools.

472
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,960
Get out.

473
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,920
Get out of my sight!

474
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,600
Put her down.

475
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,840
What, do you think

476
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm the sort who fears death?
