3
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,296
I drove out
to the orphanage today.

4
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,757
I go every month, remember?

5
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,136
The children are so cute.

6
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,431
If I have a child, maybe I'll raise her
out there in the country.

7
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:47,686
Show her flowers and trees.
Plus, it's close to Seoul.

8
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,355
Hmm? The tow truck?

9
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,357
They said it'll take a while.

10
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,742
I love your voice.

11
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,663
It feels romantic
to hear your voice in the snow.

12
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,339
Hold on a moment.

13
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,302
Got a flat tire?

14
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,054
Yes, I called a tow truck.

15
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,391
Man:
In this snow, it could take a while.

16
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,227
Hold on. Let me take a look.

17
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,653
I said it's okay,
but he's looking at it.

18
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,783
Really?

19
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,660
Just wait for the tow truck.

20
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,705
Huh?

21
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,501
No, it's not hard
to change a flat tire.

22
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,885
But why bother
when a tow truck's coming?

23
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,429
Hold on a sec.

24
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,473
Status?

25
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,393
Okay, got it.

26
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,104
Hello? Ju-yeon?
I'd better get going.

27
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,026
Lock the doors
and just wait for the tow truck.

28
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,155
What?

29
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,993
Hold on.

30
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,922
Ahem...

31
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,260
J“ love is... j“

32
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,596
j“ sweet like... I

33
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,225
j“ a mother's... j“

34
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,353
tow truck's on its way.

35
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,606
Why does he bother?

36
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,654
Too many people here today.

37
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,910
Sorry to be working
on your birthday again.

38
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,831
I'll be home soon.

39
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,125
Mmm-hmm.

40
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,847
Your car's completely sunk.

41
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:33,018
Thank you,
but I'll just wait for the tow truck.

42
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,811
Thank you.

43
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,225
S tuden t safety vehicle

44
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,276
Why isn't he leaving?

45
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,947
Mister...

46
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,783
Mister...

47
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,870
Wait...

48
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:30,481
Your skin's so soft,
looks like it'll be easy.

49
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,450
Please don't kill me.

50
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,996
Why not?

51
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,917
I'm...

52
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,715
Pregnant.

53
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,726
Please, let me live.

54
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,816
Dong-su! Dong-su!

55
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,362
- What?
- Come here, quick!

56
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,332
Chief! Why'd you come here?

57
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,335
Stay at home.
We'll keep you posted.

58
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,755
What's going on?

59
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,507
What happened to my daughter?

60
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:11,512
Don't look!
Nothing's for sure yet.

61
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,088
- Detective Cho!
- What?

62
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,424
What's this?

63
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,720
Move it.

64
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,431
It looks like a head.

65
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,642
Flip it.

66
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,465
Cho:
Forensics! Come here, quick!

67
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,260
We found the head!

68
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,059
Look after chief jang!

69
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,441
Chief! Sir!

70
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,237
Ju-yeon! Ju-yeon!

71
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,325
Ju-yeon!

72
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,578
Ju-yeon!

73
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,190
Stop taking pictures!

74
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,109
You call yourselves humans?!
Block them off!

75
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:21,095
At least, heaven helped us.

76
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:26,308
Otherwise,
we might never have found her.

77
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,689
How ironic.

78
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:37,403
I was a police detective
for over 30 years...

79
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,115
And I couldn't even
protect my own daughter.

80
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,502
Stop smoking, sir.

81
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,676
I'm sorry.

82
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,473
Really.

83
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,687
I'm so sorry.

84
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,527
To you...

85
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,699
And to ju-yeon...

86
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,833
I'm so sorry.

87
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,865
Kim soo-hyun:
Forgive me, ju-yeon.

88
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,160
I wasn't there for you.

89
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,164
Always late...

90
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,583
Never there when you needed me.

91
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,671
But ju-yeon...

92
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,799
Ipromise you this.

93
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:34,470
I'll make him pay for your pain.

94
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,613
Soo-hyun...

95
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,368
For how long?

96
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,330
There's no rush.
Do you want one or two months off?

97
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,416
- All I need is two weeks, sir.
- Take more days.

98
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,378
No, I'll see you
in two weeks, sir.

99
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,633
That'd be good for us...

100
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,511
But are you sure?

101
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,357
Then I'll see to it.

102
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,027
I hope you recover
from your grief. Get some rest.

103
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,454
How could this happen?

104
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,957
Didn't he get engaged
just last month?

105
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,419
I don't believe this.

106
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,590
The capsule is equipped
with GPS and a microphone.

107
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,093
Cool, isn't it?

108
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,390
Good job.

109
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,891
Thanks.

110
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,060
Sure.

111
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,568
- Aren't you going back?
- Huh?

112
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,238
Anything else to tell me?

113
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,784
Right.

114
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,789
As you know, I snuck this out.

115
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,710
If something goes wrong,
you and I will...

116
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,337
Don't worry.

117
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,715
Nothing will go wrong.

118
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:22,229
It looks like the police...

119
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:26,358
Think these four
are the main suspects.

120
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:32,698
They've been accused
of similar crimes before.

121
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,620
- Hi, soo-hyun.
- Hi.

122
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,583
Did you have dinner already?

123
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,335
I'd better get going.

124
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,297
I brought
some groceries for dad.

125
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,428
I'll be going then.
Take care, sir.

126
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,222
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

127
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,994
Shit.

128
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,468
Ugh!

129
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,738
Quiet!

130
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,951
Remember this?

131
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,831
You really don't know?

132
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,507
Fine.

133
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,233
Sir.

134
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,737
What the hell is with him?
He's turning himself in?

135
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:20,991
Says he killed the girl found
at bangho creek two months ago.

136
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,911
And the missing shinchon girl case
a few years back.

137
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,164
All of a sudden,
he has a conscience?

138
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,375
What the hell?
Who did this? You bastards?

139
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,294
No, sir.

140
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,464
An ambulance came
so I ran up to see.

141
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,841
And this bastard
was practically dying.

142
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,052
What the heck happened?

143
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,305
Well, he didn't say anything yet.

144
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,558
What the hell happened
last night?

145
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,270
Help... me... please.

146
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,398
Help... me...

147
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,400
What's he saying?

148
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,696
Some bastard hammered his balls.

149
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:04,660
What? That's insane!

150
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,454
Who broke your balls?

151
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,026
Who are you?

152
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,954
What the hell!

153
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,257
The buses have stopped running.
Where are you headed?

154
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,843
Pardon me?

155
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,012
Where are you going?

156
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,724
- To sung-min apartments.
- Sung-min?

157
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,561
Well, it's kinda on the way.

158
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,438
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

159
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,565
It's okay, but thanks.

160
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,734
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

161
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,277
No, really. It's okay.

162
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:11,615
It's just down the road. Hop in.

163
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,834
It's fine.

164
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,466
You sure it's on your way?

165
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,137
Don't worry. Get in.

166
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,410
- What?
- Huh? Nothing.

167
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,335
Is this a school Van?

168
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:31,027
Ah... shit. Where'd I put it?

169
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,521
Why?

170
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,232
Huh?

171
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,402
Why do you look
like you stepped in shit?

172
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,240
Never seen a thing like this?

173
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,945
Who's there?

174
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,881
Why do you need this
for the insurance money?

175
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,094
I have to identify
the policy holder.

176
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,222
There are too many people
with the same name.

177
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,475
These are all old pictures.

178
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,239
Perhaps this one would do.

179
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:29,205
I'll ask a few more
standard questions.

180
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:33,084
Do you have additional
contact numbers for him?

181
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,380
I don't. But his son does.

182
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,801
Sang4non! Sang4non!

183
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,012
Where'd he go?

184
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:53,188
I think it was Yang-pyung
or chung-pyung...

185
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:58,735
Can you verify that this person is
the man I'm looking for?

186
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,493
Is this Mr. Jang kyung-chul?

187
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,373
It's kyung-chul alright.

188
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,251
But...

189
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,505
Is this a recent picture?

190
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:24,511
Why does he look so scary?

191
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,597
Insurance, my ass.

192
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,769
He doesn't give a shit
aboutanyone.

193
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:37,524
He abandoned
his parents and his son.

194
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,276
Like he'd really take out
a family insurance policy?

195
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,904
It doesn't make any sense!

196
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,449
- Don't talk like that!
- Am I wrong?

197
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,451
No use protecting him.

198
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:53,122
- Shut up! You old fool!
- You call that a "son"?

199
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,750
Shut up! Don't get me started!

200
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,920
How can you say that?

201
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,127
If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything!

202
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,757
Fuck!

203
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,306
By the way...

204
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:16,271
Doesn't the family get the money
if the policy holder dies?

205
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,049
Are you sang-won?

206
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,558
Do you know
where your dad lives?

207
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,938
Shit!

208
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,942
Why?

209
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,352
She's a really good singer.

210
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,437
- Maybe I can go.
- Of course you'll go.

211
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,856
My mom's gonna kill me.

212
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,361
Go straight home, girls. Okay?

213
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,530
Yes, ma'am.

214
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,702
- Please drive them straight home.
- Of course.

215
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,996
- Thank you.
- Sure.

216
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,079
Shit.

217
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,377
- Can I help you?
- Is jang kyung-chul here?

218
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:35,089
- Why? Is there a problem?
- We're the police. Where is he?

219
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,466
- He's driving the kids home.
- Shit.

220
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,635
Call his cell phone, now! Hurry!

221
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,607
Learning center -

222
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,658
Shit.

223
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,378
Kyung-chul:
I do not cry on me... I

224
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,557
I do not cry like a baby. I

225
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,311
let's see.

226
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,933
You have fair skin.

227
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,691
It's okay.

228
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,776
It'll be over quick.

229
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:08,743
I lost my damn job.

230
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,290
Looks like things are fucked up.

231
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,755
But...

232
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,799
Shit! Who says I can't like you?

233
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,511
What's wrong with that?

234
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,307
I can like you if I want.

235
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:35,561
Damn bitches in the world
are always against me.

236
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,898
I can! Can't I?

237
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,570
Shit.

238
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,700
It'll be over quickly.

239
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,953
I'll make it quick for you.

240
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,347
Jang kyung-chul.

241
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,916
What? You're alone?

242
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,298
Are you a cop?

243
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,856
Must be right.

244
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,449
The cops found me this quick?

245
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,369
You're shitting me.

246
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,584
Guess you don't know
who you're dealing with.

247
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,587
Damn cops.

248
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,131
What do you expect...

249
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,969
Anyway...

250
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,811
You son of a bitch!

251
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,064
Bastard!

252
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:19,191
What the hell?

253
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,529
The bastard's a complete psycho.

254
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,546
Shit!

255
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,350
Oh, fuck...

256
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:14,389
Don't know where you're headed,
but you can hop in.

257
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:18,185
You don't want a ride?
There won't be other cars.

258
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,899
Why are you
all the way out here alone?

259
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,780
You're pretty lucky, mister.
Catching a cab out here.

260
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,533
It's on the way
for the man in the back.

261
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,287
- You don't mind, right?
- Of course not.

262
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,057
It must've been hard
to get a cab here.

263
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:01,061
Cars hardly ever go by here.

264
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:06,441
I don't come here much.
Just for work.

265
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,363
You're really lucky, mister.

266
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,824
Did ya hear?

267
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:17,703
Strange things have been
happening around here.

268
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,998
So there aren't any
passengers out at nights.

269
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,458
But I have two tonight.

270
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:29,339
Looks like I'm lucky, too.
Right, mister?

271
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,808
Way out here in the dark night.

272
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,742
What, mister?

273
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,828
What's so funny?

274
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,872
Mister?

275
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,999
Yes?

276
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:09,588
You said we're all lucky, right?

277
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,800
Yeah, I did.

278
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,598
The way I see it...

279
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,685
I think you're damn unlucky.

280
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,982
Crazy bastards.

281
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:32,749
You're young. It'll heal fast.

282
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,460
And soccer...

283
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:39,214
Don't play so rough
that you break your wrists, okay?

284
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,426
Who plays soccer
with their wrists anyway?

285
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:47,138
Go easy, son. Got it?

286
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,897
Get going now.

287
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,569
Hey, shithead.

288
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,242
I ain't your son!

289
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:12,414
Shit. Watch the way you talk!

290
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,463
Take off your glasses!

291
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,801
Take 'em off!

292
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,807
Shit!

293
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,269
Come here, you! Come here!

294
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,105
Excuse me?

295
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,941
Please come and get
your prescription.

296
01:03:55,749 --> 01:04:00,003
Damn old folks always
talking down to people!

297
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,672
I'll rip your mouth off!

298
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,140
Watch yourself.

299
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,313
How old are you?

300
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,026
Twenty-two.

301
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:26,404
Nice and young.

302
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,032
Got a boyfriend?

303
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,618
Excuse me?

304
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:35,205
Bet you have many, huh?

305
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,668
Ah... no. I don't.

306
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,421
You fuckin' playing with me?

307
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,385
A pretty girl like you
without a boyfriend?

308
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,308
You don't know how to do it?

309
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,270
Excuse me?

310
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,898
If you don't, you don't.

311
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,058
Actually...

312
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:23,396
I was about to have
a good time last night.

313
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:27,984
But some bastard came
and ruined everything.

314
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:37,035
Let's make this easy.

315
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,273
Take it off.

316
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,651
What?

317
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,908
Strip.

318
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,330
Try and enjoy it.

319
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,584
So, take it off.

320
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:49,023
Strip before I cut up
your face, bitch!

321
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:57,115
Strip now, bitch!

322
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,002
That's it.

323
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,679
Take off your bra. Hurry.

324
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,153
Please...

325
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:33,920
Kyung-chul:
Good. Take off your skirt.

326
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,808
You son of a bitch!

327
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,561
Who the fuck are you?

328
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,598
You bastard!

329
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,493
Wait!

330
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,539
Stay here.
He'll need to be treated.

331
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,379
Don't act so weak.
This is just the beginning.

332
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,634
Remember...

333
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:29,762
Your nightmare's
only getting worse.

334
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,103
Close your eyes, miss!

335
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,522
Look away and plug your ears.

336
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,955
Son of a bitch!

337
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:53,364
Damn motherfucker!
You wanna die?

338
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:04,542
You wanna fight me, huh?

339
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,628
Damn son of a bitch!

340
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:10,923
Motherfucker.

341
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,259
Fine! Let's see
who's the bitch here!

342
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,720
You bastard!

343
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,336
What happened, sir?

344
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,674
Did you have an accident?

345
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,479
His car must've stalled.

346
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,373
Damn dogs.

347
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,250
Always going wild...

348
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:55,296
At the smell of blood.

349
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,372
Yes, sir.

350
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,751
Is everything okay?

351
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:41,425
Just worried that's all.

352
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:48,641
The police think
I'm chasing after jang.

353
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:53,771
The cops are after him
themselves as well.

354
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:57,066
I was thinking...

355
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:05,532
How about dropping it now?

356
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:09,203
- Sir...
- You've done enough.

357
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:13,749
- I want you to stop.
- But, sir...

358
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:28,264
Forget it.

359
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,350
Talk to you later.

360
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,729
It's me. Se-yeon.

361
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:41,735
- Soo-hyun.
- Hi, how are you?

362
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,779
Good. How are you?

363
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:47,741
Well, just busy
working on something.

364
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,370
Really? What kind of work?

365
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:55,374
You know what I do.

366
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:59,295
I'm asking about
what we don't know.

367
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,715
Dad gave you
the police files, right?

368
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,509
Soo-hyun?

369
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:09,930
I know how you feel,
but I hope you'll stop.

370
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,642
It won't bring her back.

371
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:21,358
Whatever you do to punish him,
things won't change.

372
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:25,821
Revenge is for movies.

373
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,990
That bastard's a psycho.

374
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:33,287
Sorry. I have nothing
to say to you.

375
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,040
How come?

376
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:38,542
We're practically family.

377
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,588
You know how I am these days?

378
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:48,218
I keep looking back,
thinking I'm being followed.

379
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,307
And you have nothing to say?

380
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:02,900
So, please.

381
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,695
This is pointless.
Please drop it.

382
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:11,200
Sorry, I'd better go.

383
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:15,704
And this is not pointless.

384
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,916
Soo-hyun!

385
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:16,890
Water!

386
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,059
Get me water!

387
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,621
Aren't you sick of it?

388
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,419
Try it. You can't get sick of it.

389
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,508
Once you taste this,

390
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,805
you can't eat any other meat.

391
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,433
Crazy bastard.

392
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:09,026
What did you just say?

393
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:18,368
Why you little...

394
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:23,457
Gone insane
from eating human flesh?

395
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:28,128
Wake up! I'm jang kyung-chul!

396
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:52,736
Yeah, I must be damn crazy.

397
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:56,073
This meat's so good,
I lost my mind.

398
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:05,123
Why do I cry when I get tense?

399
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:11,964
Crazy bastard.

400
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:21,139
Remember when we first met?

401
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:27,980
Trying to form a militant group
to fuck over the world!

402
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,236
Those were the days.

403
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,281
Ahem...
We weren't afraid of anything!

404
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:41,076
Cut the bullshit
and give me a cigarette.

405
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,572
Bet he's a family member
of a bitch you killed.

406
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,574
If not, he's some total maniac.

407
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,958
He's our kind.

408
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,920
He's enjoying the excitement
of the hunt.

409
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:41,595
Catching and letting go
of the prey.

410
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,347
He's playing the hunter.

411
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:46,642
He relishes torturing his prey.

412
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,896
Man...

413
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:54,566
I think you're screwed this time.

414
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,865
Tae-joo:
The bastard must've gone crazy

415
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,201
after losing his bitch.

416
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:09,706
You've created a monster.
How interesting.

417
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:32,020
Get some sleep.
We've got plenty of rooms.

418
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,273
You can sleep anywhere.

419
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:40,404
I'll go prep my next meal.

420
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:00,424
Damn bastards.

421
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:16,022
He's enjoying
the excitement of the hunt.

422
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:20,026
Catching and letting go
of the prey.

423
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,779
He relishes torturing his prey.

424
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,783
He's playing the hunter.

425
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:31,538
Your nightmare's
only getting worse.

426
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:45,218
Amusing...

427
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:59,357
Now...

428
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,693
I used up all the guts?

429
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,949
Not here, either?

430
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,285
Then...

431
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:33,016
Shit.

432
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:19,646
Come on.

433
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:26,152
Didn't you see your sister?

434
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:31,366
If you fight it,
it'll be more painful.

435
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:39,499
I'll end it quickly for ya.

436
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:46,673
So why be suspicious of us?

437
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,093
We didn't ask for money
or the house!

438
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,430
Couldn't let us in, huh?

439
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,682
I'm sorry.

440
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:58,184
I'm really sorry!

441
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:06,526
Should've apologized
a long time ago.

442
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:08,320
Huh?

443
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:11,364
Damn bitches.

444
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:15,577
Always acting up when it's too late.

445
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,121
Wait.

446
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:20,582
Hands, feet, then head, was it?

447
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:26,212
Close your eyes.
Better not to look.

448
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,276
Where the hell?

449
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,494
Oh...!

450
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,538
How'd you come in
without making a sound?

451
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:18,450
I'm... pregnant.

452
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:26,583
I was wondering about you.

453
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:30,128
You don't look like a monster.

454
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:34,549
Sick bastard.

455
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,703
Hands, feet, then head. Right?

456
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,540
Just like you did.

457
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:51,000
Nothing more, nothing less.

458
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:54,629
You sick psychos!

459
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:37,226
Argh!

460
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:54,494
Son of a bitch.

461
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:18,601
Why? Why? Why?

462
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:27,985
Why, why...

463
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,586
I'm actually relieved.

464
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:11,839
You had me
worried sick about you.

465
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:16,719
It's secret agent
Kim soo-hyun, right?

466
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:21,349
Want me to show you
what he's been up to?

467
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:29,982
Make him stop.

468
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:32,985
He can't become a monster
to fight the monster.

469
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:39,242
You know that's wrong.

470
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,079
Where is he now?

471
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:46,874
Your wounds are treated.
You'll be okay.

472
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:54,590
You and that bastard
were out for two days.

473
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,554
What happened?

474
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,933
Sir?

475
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,893
Hand the bastard over.

476
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:12,817
- I'm far from done.
- What are you going to do?

477
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,904
You know...

478
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:22,076
It feels like a huge rock
is pressing down on my chest.

479
01:41:23,953 --> 01:41:26,122
Big and heavy.

480
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:36,048
I promised ju-yeon that
I'd make him feel the same pain.

481
01:41:38,884 --> 01:41:41,053
It's not over.

482
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:45,808
Far from it.

483
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:51,647
Okay, no more questions.

484
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:54,025
By the way,
how's the capsule working?

485
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,777
Unless he has diarrhea...

486
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:07,038
Don't worry.
The bastard's completely out.

487
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:09,206
He'll be out for another day at least.

488
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:19,634
Sir?

489
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,219
You've changed a lot, you know?

490
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,691
Hello.

491
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:01,193
Pain killers, please.
With dexibuprofen.

492
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,488
Dexi what, sir?

493
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,533
- Just give me the strongest kind.
- Sure.

494
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:14,457
Where are you?
Guess you aren't around.

495
01:44:14,623 --> 01:44:17,585
Are you listening?

496
01:44:17,752 --> 01:44:20,337
Of course you are.

497
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:27,178
It's been a blast.
Totally unexpected fun.

498
01:44:31,432 --> 01:44:34,518
Want me to guess who you are?

499
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:38,773
Your bitch was ju-yeon?
From yeon-hee-dong, right?

500
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:42,693
You hear me?

501
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:45,654
But, you made a mistake.

502
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:49,909
You took me for granted.

503
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:53,871
You'll regret not killing me.

504
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,706
I'll get you soon.

505
01:44:55,873 --> 01:44:57,333
Hello, there.

506
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:02,296
Wait. I'll show you
what real pain is!

507
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,300
What are you doing!

508
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:08,344
Hey, you!

509
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,556
By the way...

510
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:16,352
Before she died, she said...

511
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:18,395
That she was pregnant.

512
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:22,066
Begged for her life.

513
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:27,363
Did you know?

514
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:40,626
Go! Go! Get here quick!
Or the man I left inside is dead!

515
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:45,297
Should keep close range
when hunting me.

516
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:16,055
What the hell!

517
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:31,005
Where have you gone?

518
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:59,033
Do we have to do all this
to save bastards like them?

519
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:04,955
Seeing scum like them
makes me sorry to be human.

520
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:07,458
Call me when they wake up.

521
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:17,301
What is it this time?

522
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:20,095
Yeah. What is it?

523
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,099
What?

524
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:27,770
Are you sure?

525
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:31,565
Okay.

526
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:35,235
Hey.

527
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:37,154
Jang kyung-chul
is turning himself in.

528
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:39,531
You made a damn mistake fool!

529
01:50:33,919 --> 01:50:35,629
Wake up.

530
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:48,767
I have a question.

531
01:50:48,934 --> 01:50:53,188
Where might our friend be?

532
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:03,615
Welcome to Seoul

533
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:09,454
you ticked off the wrong guy.

534
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:15,586
He always gets even.

535
01:51:15,752 --> 01:51:17,546
Know what that means?

536
01:51:22,718 --> 01:51:27,222
First your girl,
then her family.

537
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:36,481
Then he'll give himself up
to the cops.

538
01:51:39,818 --> 01:51:41,653
But...

539
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:46,200
Your woman didn't have it
all that bad.

540
01:51:47,868 --> 01:51:54,666
Unlike me, jang likes to give
pleasure before pain.

541
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:01,465
He gives pleasure first. Get it?

542
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:07,888
Funny?

543
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:11,725
Thafsfunny?

544
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:15,187
You think it's funny?

545
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:27,491
I'll give you
a permanent smiley face!

546
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:38,085
I traced jang's call.

547
01:52:38,252 --> 01:52:41,922
I was tapping the cops
investigating jang.

548
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:45,759
Jang just called them.
Said he'll turn himself in today.

549
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:51,723
He says he's doing something first.
What if he fucks up again?

550
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:54,601
- Where's he located?
- Yeon-hee-dong.

551
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:21,169
Parcel delivery!

552
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:44,359
Is this captain oh?

553
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:47,321
I'm Kim soo-hyun.

554
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:50,282
What?

555
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:53,910
What the hell have you done?

556
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:58,623
If something happens to him,
I'll kill you!

557
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,376
Got that, you bastard?

558
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:09,092
Send the closest men
to the chief's house now!

559
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:12,304
Turn the car around!

560
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:15,844
Not much resemblance.

561
01:56:16,011 --> 01:56:19,014
Ju-yeon must've
taken after her mom.

562
01:56:20,432 --> 01:56:21,933
Good thing
she doesn't look like you.

563
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:31,151
Why'd you come at me like that?
Old bastard!

564
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:34,237
You crazy? Huh?

565
01:56:36,531 --> 01:56:40,660
Wait a minute.
Where did I put it?

566
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:48,210
What should I do
to make that bastard flip?

567
01:56:48,376 --> 01:56:51,087
Will this do the trick? Like this?

568
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:55,759
And this! And this!

569
01:56:57,219 --> 01:57:00,180
Like this? Fuck.

570
01:57:57,696 --> 01:57:59,864
Dad?

571
01:58:01,366 --> 01:58:03,535
I'm home.

572
01:58:54,169 --> 01:58:56,546
- What's going on?
- Stay back.

573
01:58:56,713 --> 01:58:58,214
Back away, please!

574
01:58:58,381 --> 01:59:00,508
- Stay back.
- What happened?

575
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:02,844
You can't come in, sir.

576
01:59:09,434 --> 01:59:10,935
Who the hell?

577
01:59:13,438 --> 01:59:17,275
What is it? Step aside.

578
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:21,404
You're Kim soo-hyun?

579
01:59:26,534 --> 01:59:28,953
You stupid son of a bitch!

580
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:34,542
You know what you did?
How dare you come here!

581
01:59:34,709 --> 01:59:37,128
Damn piece of shit.

582
01:59:37,295 --> 01:59:40,423
Back off. Let go!

583
01:59:44,386 --> 01:59:47,097
Damn son of a bitch.

584
01:59:51,267 --> 01:59:54,688
Step aside. Move!

585
02:01:30,116 --> 02:01:31,159
Hello?

586
02:01:31,326 --> 02:01:33,453
Jang kyung-chul here.

587
02:01:34,537 --> 02:01:36,581
You bastard!

588
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:41,628
Where the hell are you?

589
02:01:41,795 --> 02:01:45,048
You didn't hurt se-yeon did you?

590
02:01:45,215 --> 02:01:48,301
You'll find out later.

591
02:01:52,889 --> 02:01:55,266
What?

592
02:02:02,482 --> 02:02:04,484
Take this.

593
02:02:20,166 --> 02:02:22,252
Hello?

594
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:34,222
So? How does it feel?

595
02:02:34,389 --> 02:02:39,394
You shouldn't have fucked with me!
You piece of shit!

596
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:43,189
Who do you think won?

597
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,817
You think you won? Or me?

598
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:16,115
Jang kyung-chul!

599
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:18,409
Sir! It's jang!

600
02:04:18,576 --> 02:04:20,620
Wait! Not now!

601
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:24,976
Search the car!

602
02:05:29,689 --> 02:05:31,482
What's that car?

603
02:05:34,193 --> 02:05:36,696
What the hell! Stop that car!

604
02:05:41,451 --> 02:05:42,577
Stop it now!

605
02:05:52,754 --> 02:05:54,380
Get him!

606
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:00,178
Catch him!

607
02:06:00,344 --> 02:06:01,763
Get him!

608
02:07:08,704 --> 02:07:11,040
Okay, you're right.

609
02:07:13,584 --> 02:07:15,795
I made a mistake.

610
02:07:22,176 --> 02:07:25,429
I underestimated you.

611
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:42,697
I'll treat you right from now on.

612
02:07:49,036 --> 02:07:51,080
You son of a bitch!

613
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:54,375
What the hell are you doing?

614
02:07:56,377 --> 02:07:59,714
Come on.
I'm just getting started.

615
02:08:03,759 --> 02:08:08,347
Kill me! You son of a bitch!

616
02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:10,308
Kill me, now!

617
02:08:10,474 --> 02:08:12,476
You son of a bitch!

618
02:08:12,643 --> 02:08:18,482
Hurry up and kill me!
You bastard!

619
02:08:18,649 --> 02:08:20,693
Kill me now!

620
02:08:28,868 --> 02:08:32,496
Not yet. It won't be long.

621
02:08:36,292 --> 02:08:40,379
If it was that easy,
I would've killed you already.

622
02:08:43,257 --> 02:08:46,886
I'll kill you at your most
painful moment.

623
02:08:48,471 --> 02:08:54,060
When you most tremble
in pain and fear,

624
02:08:54,227 --> 02:08:55,895
I'll kill you then!

625
02:08:59,857 --> 02:09:04,320
Because only that
will be real revenge.

626
02:09:05,947 --> 02:09:08,366
True revenge.

627
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,130
Let me live. Please?

628
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:25,925
Don't kill me.

629
02:09:26,092 --> 02:09:28,970
Please...

630
02:09:34,433 --> 02:09:37,061
Heard that many times,
haven't you?

631
02:09:37,228 --> 02:09:39,230
People begging for their lives.

632
02:09:44,193 --> 02:09:46,487
You enjoyed that, huh?

633
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:51,951
Don't kill me, please.

634
02:09:59,583 --> 02:10:03,838
I'll pay for my sins.

635
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:17,893
Let me go, please.

636
02:10:20,021 --> 02:10:24,775
Haven't you done enough?

637
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:28,362
Please, don't kill me.

638
02:10:47,715 --> 02:10:50,426
I'm so sorry.

639
02:11:02,688 --> 02:11:05,941
I beg you.

640
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:21,248
Are you scared?

641
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:29,715
Say it. You're scared?

642
02:11:35,179 --> 02:11:40,476
Do you realize now
what you've done?

643
02:12:03,707 --> 02:12:08,295
Stop fucking around with me!

644
02:12:08,462 --> 02:12:11,799
You son of a bitch!

645
02:12:16,971 --> 02:12:19,265
Hey.

646
02:12:19,432 --> 02:12:23,102
Cut the bullshit.

647
02:12:25,479 --> 02:12:28,274
You already lost.

648
02:12:31,068 --> 02:12:34,697
You think you got to me?

649
02:12:34,864 --> 02:12:37,032
Huh?

650
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:41,287
Fuck you.

651
02:12:43,664 --> 02:12:48,419
I don't know what pain is.

652
02:12:49,462 --> 02:12:51,589
Fear?

653
02:12:51,755 --> 02:12:54,049
Don't know that, either.

654
02:12:56,719 --> 02:13:02,308
There's nothing you can
get from me.

655
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:15,571
You already lost.

656
02:13:18,782 --> 02:13:20,951
Got that?

657
02:13:50,356 --> 02:13:52,525
I hope...

658
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:57,571
That you suffer
even after you die.

659
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:50,476
Son of a bitch! You hear me?

660
02:15:50,643 --> 02:15:58,525
You shit! It ain't over.
I'll live no matter what!

661
02:15:58,692 --> 02:16:02,237
You hear me, shnhead?

662
02:16:02,404 --> 02:16:05,699
I'm not scared!

663
02:16:09,161 --> 02:16:12,873
You think you can fuck with me?

664
02:16:20,422 --> 02:16:22,800
Dad?

665
02:16:23,884 --> 02:16:26,053
Dad?

666
02:16:30,641 --> 02:16:33,894
Don't open the door!

667
02:16:34,061 --> 02:16:36,313
Dad?

668
02:16:41,694 --> 02:16:44,321
Don't open the door!

669
02:16:44,488 --> 02:16:47,449
Sang-won! Don't come in!

670
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:50,119
Father:
What the hell is he saying?

671
02:16:52,579 --> 02:16:54,748
Don't open it!

672
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:58,794
It's stuck.

673
02:16:58,961 --> 02:17:02,339
No! Why the hell
are the old folks here?

674
02:17:02,506 --> 02:17:04,842
- Kyung-chul!
- Mom!

675
02:17:05,008 --> 02:17:06,488
- Are you in there?
- No, mom!

676
02:17:06,552 --> 02:17:13,767
Don't open the door!
Shit! Get away!

677
02:17:44,715 --> 02:17:46,967
Kyung-chul!
