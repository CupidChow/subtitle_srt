<i>Goats cried insanely
when 1 was born.</i>

5
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,747
A ghost was born
alongside me that day.

6
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,255
1999, Yeongwol,
Gangwon Province

7
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,884
It hid in my mother's womb and
came out 10 minutes before me.

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,971
It lived off eating my leg.

9
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,058
Good, almost there,
just a bit more!

10
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,893
Grab the leg!

11
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,312
- Push harder! Here it is!
- Good, stay calm.

12
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,146
Doctor, here you go.

13
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,106
Once more,
deep breaths.

14
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,070
This one's fine though.

15
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,114
Just her leg's weird.

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,576
Give me a towel.

17
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,578
Take the baby.

18
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,121
Tie the tube.

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,998
Give it here.

20
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,335
That will die soon.

21
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,211
It won't live long.

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,547
They all said,

23
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,552
they should've killed it
right away.

24
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,767
Mom died a week after
giving birth to us,

25
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,812
and dad died a month later
in a car accident,

26
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,066
my grandpa told me
when I was in middle school.

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,407
And, the doctor was wrong.

28
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,951
2014, Yeongwol,
Gangwon Province

29
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,162
2014, Yeongwol, Gangwon Province
It wasn't in a hurry to die.

30
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,832
Even until now.

31
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,490
Shit...

32
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,220
They moved here recently.

33
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,473
They're supposedly dog groomers.

34
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,686
They keep to themselves,
it's really strange.

35
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,689
When did they move here?

36
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,442
About a month ago?

37
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,281
When did the cows
start going nuts?

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,658
3 weeks ago.

39
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,550
Almost there,
that's the one!

40
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,638
Dogs bark insanely,
something is definitely off...

41
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,201
It feels colder here,
listen to that wind.

42
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,705
They won't come out.

43
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,708
The air here is...

44
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,210
very strange.

45
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,296
Let go of me.
What people say...

46
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,682
Boss, let's come back tomorrow.

47
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:54,312
A ghost lives with us.

48
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,946
O Lord!

49
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,323
Forgive our sins!

50
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,826
We beg of you!

51
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,667
Forgive us!

52
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,638
Come here for a bit.

53
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,350
Why?

54
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,311
Come here.

55
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,446
How's studying?

56
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,075
Got many friends?

57
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:57,876
I'm gonna try my best
to not move again.

58
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,088
You must hate it.

59
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,758
- Hate what?
- Your leg.

60
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,013
And your twin sister.

61
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,306
What about it?

62
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:22,943
Never registered her birth,
never taught her to talk...

63
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,319
<i>Stop it, 1 know.</i>

64
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,573
<i>Geum-hwa, 1 never thought
she'd still be alive.</i>

65
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,329
I'm scared,
even to this day...

66
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,625
The crying every night...

67
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,427
You hear that?

68
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,720
Yes.

69
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,307
Hymn #250, Glory to His Name.

70
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,642
Shit...

71
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,771
Listen carefully.

72
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,324
The cry, it can't be human...

73
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,014
Over here!

74
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,275
Sounds like a child crying.

75
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,947
Give me bush clover.

76
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,456
Princess.

77
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,839
We came to greet you.

78
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,594
Princess.

SVAHA: THE SIXTH FINGER

80
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,509
Evils in this world
aren't anything special.

81
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,553
They're frauds.

82
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:00,642
There're over 1,200 cases
involving false prophets,

83
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,644
and cults each year,

84
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,897
with over 50,000 victims.

85
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,276
Korea guarantees
religious freedom too much,

86
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:15,073
my lab is the only agency
that investigates the spiritual war.

87
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,784
Your interest will be
much appreciated.

88
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,537
- Thank you.
- Okay.

89
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:25,458
I'd like to thank Pastor Kim from
Seoul Theological Univ. for inviting me.

90
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,627
Last but not least...

91
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,673
faith.

<i>Far East Religion Research Donation

94
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:45,520
Can you feel Jesus as he
climbed up Golgotha alone?

95
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,149
Help us, pray for us.

96
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,485
We'll be light and salt
of the world.

97
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,406
- Park Woong-jae is a cultist!
- Cultist! Cultist!

98
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,951
- Quit the ministry!
- Quit! Quit!

99
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,538
- Stop the witch hunt!
- Stop! Stop!

100
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,456
Stop Park Woong-jae!

101
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,421
- Shut down Far East Lab!
- Shut down! Shut down!

102
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,716
- Stop human rights abuse!
- Stop! Stop!

103
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,719
Raise your hands!

104
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,637
Vow to our Lord!

105
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,764
There! It's Park!

106
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,435
- Where?
- Get him!

107
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:38,072
Eggs are in short supply,
why're they throwing food?

108
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,825
<i>1 told you to be careful.</i>

109
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,620
You shouldn't have
went after Agape Nunnery.

110
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,330
My Burberry...

111
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,125
Your popularity rises
by the day.

112
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,212
Sure, at least I got
female fans.

113
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,504
Bought a new coat again?

114

115
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,552

Devil Nuns Wearing Catholic Masks

Leave Judgment to Moses

118
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:30,583
Gas bill was $500 last month,
but we gotta vent the air...

119
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,045
Air purifiers are
popular nowadays...

120
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,048
Deaconess, did we get paid
from the Methodist Church?

121
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,260
If you write your article,
we could get paid.

122
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,763
Always making troubles,
then, all just slick talk...

123
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,810
- A pastor smoking all day long...
- Deaconess, give me a break.

124
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,687
He's got the nerve...

125
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,147
<i>1 need to go to Gangwon province.</i>

126
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,025
Because of Deer Mount?

127
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,695
Definitely not on a vacation.

128
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,988
Starting something else?

129
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,116
You should finish the article
on Children of Moses first...

130
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,286
Deaconess, one at a time.

131
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,122
The Order can't sue them anyway.

132
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,623
What about Agape Nunnery?

133
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,961
<i>1 finished that,
so send it to Catholic Monthly.</i>

134
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:16,963
The title is...

135
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,927
<i>'Cancer-curing Sisters of the Dark.</i>

136
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,932
End with a question mark,
not an exclamation.

137
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,767
It's a clickbait.

138
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,894
It's commercial.

139
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,856
Hurry back and finish
the columns...

140
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,648
Deaconess...

141
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:41,487
The thing about Buddhism is,
money is on another level.

142
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,700
How about winter in Thailand?
Separately.

143
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,703
And... the air purifier!

144
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,746
Amen.

145
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,289
- Air purifier!
- Amen.

146
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,499
- Air purifier!
- Amen!

147
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,189
Please look at this.

148
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,900
What kind of flower is this?

149
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,735
Lotus.

150
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,864
Yes, lotus is a noble flower.

151
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,533
It grows in the mud,

152
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,662
but it's a beautiful flower
that never gets stained.

153
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:36,918
The world is like mud.

154
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,464
It gets more and more
brutal and violent.

155
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,885
But our prayers and thoughts
will change this world.

156
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:53,935
We'll end today with a prayer for
last week's Jinju typhoon victims.

157
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,021
Heavenly General,
watch over us.

158
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,774
Thank you.

159
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,652
Take care,
see you tomorrow.

160
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,128
You should eat properly.

161
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,880
Give me the corporate card then.

162
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,258
Use your money and
expense it.

163
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,801
Talk the talk...

164
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,557
You sent nothing substantial,
that's all you got?

165
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,891
That's all.

166
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:39,856
But you must have something,
you're not a rookie.

167
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,899
The only weird thing is,

168
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,694
there's nothing weird.

169
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,907
What's their affiliation?
Donghak sect?

170
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,992
Nope.

171
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,952
Founding Father Dangun?

172
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:54,787
General Guan Yu?

173
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,249
Nothing like that,
it feels classical.

174
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,044
It's got esoteric Buddhism,
but it's clean.

175
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,629
No offerings,

176
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,966
they even give alms
for believers in need.

177
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,886
They did what?

178
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,639
Buddy, then it's networking!

179
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,433
- Pyramid network!
- It's nothing like that.

180
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:19,103
New religion is for adultery,
money laundering and pyramid.

181
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,731
If there was a flaw,

182
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,610
don't Buddhists worship
Buddha or Buddhist saints?

183
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,986
Right.

184
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:31,908
But they worship a General
at both places.

185
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,582
<i>No, 1 need something
more sensational.</i>

186
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,584
Something exuberant.

187
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:50,885
I'll bait the head monk,
so dig a little deeper.

188
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,637
Bring me a clickbait.

189
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,568
- Morning, sir.
- Yeah.

190
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,988
Why didn't you
answer my calls?

191
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,491
What's with the commotion
in the morning?

192
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,702
Hey! Don't touch that!

193
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,955
Secure the crime scene!

194
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,915
Out of the way,
captain's here.

195
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,005
A truck ran into it...

196
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,131
What's this?

197
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,635
It didn't rot,
but dried like a jerky.

198
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,305
The patch up job
doesn't look old.

199
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,351
Yes, I've made calls
to construction companies.

200
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,312
- It's small.
- Sir?

201
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,482
The hand is small.

202
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,235
Barely a middle schooler.

203
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,533
While looking into
Children of Moses HQ in Gangwon,

204
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,328
we found a new Buddhist sect
in the next building.

205
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:04,250
About 50 adherents
across 2 branches.

206
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,712
Most are teachers, nurses,
and civil servants...

207
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,046
Pastor.

208
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,925
There're more than 3,000
missions like that in Korea.

209
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,635
Don't you think you're...

210
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,262
One moment, please.

211
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,974
Do you know what
bothers me the most?

212
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,060
This so-called 'Deer Mount'

213
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,607
doesn't profit from
its adherents.

214
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,191
Why does that bother you?

215
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:34,113
Remember Japan's Aum cult?
The sarin gas terrorists.

216
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,699
Do you know what they
started as?

217
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,826
A yoga association.

218
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,164
They sponsored various
communities and in time,

219
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:47,001
its founder Asahara
piggybacked the Buddhism,

220
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,088
and declared himself
to be enlightened,

221
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,215
and look what happened.

222
00:18:54,175 --> 00:19:01,015
The end is near,
we must let everything go.

223
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,770
So many people died.

224
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,564
It's too late then!

225
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,360
If you don't restrain their misconducts
and contradictory doctrines,

226
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,365
they'll ruin the face of
Korean Buddhism Order...

227
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,163
Pastor Park,
that was insightful.

228
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:31,545
It sounds more like a mission
for social service than a new religion...

229
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,089
You might not be aware,

230
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,383
co-existence is
the root of Buddhism.

231
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,842
Sir!

232
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,970
I've been doing this
for over 10 years.

233
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,808
Protestants and Catholics are
paying attention to purification...

234
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,184
Listen to me.

235
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,896
It's hard to seek the truth
by Christian dichotomy.

236
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,189
If I may.

237
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:56,070
Remember the fraud in the news
who sold fake statues and tablets?

238
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,448
It wouldn't be bad
to be proactive.

239
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,665
Why does the Octopus
hate me so much?

240
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,876
Dude, you came off
as a salesman.

241
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,046
Hey now, don't say that.

242
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,133
He's the gatekeeper,
be good to him.

243
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,385
It's for a good cause.

244
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,177
Come on...

245
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,638
Send me the dossier
on the Deer Mount.

246
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:24,765
What for?

247
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,809
Let me ask you something.

248
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,270
What are 3 pillars of a religion?

249
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,688
Religious leader, faithful
and scripture.

250
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,154
If it's a new religion,
their scripture should exist.

251
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,198
If they use their own interpretation
or a disapproved scripture...

252
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:45,661
Then the leadership will have
proper justification to move in.

253
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,787
Bingo.

254
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,874
The compassion of Buddha.

255
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,351
A body was discovered
inside a concrete structure

256
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,353
in Yeongwol on the 18th.

257
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:16,317
The body is presumed to be
the missing girl from 2 years ago,

258
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,112
and the police will ID her
after an autopsy,

259
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,199
and they're investigating
local construction companies...

260
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,722
Cheol-jin, you're really late.

261
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,599
You should have dinner too.

262
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,184
Have a seat.

263
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,189
Why didn't you tell me
your friend was coming.

264
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,234
There's not much.

265
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,411
<i>1 knew you'd come.</i>

266
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,458
At least we got to meet,
it's been a while.

267
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,382
I'm a failure.

268
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,262
<i>1 gave up protecting Father
and hid out of fear.</i>

269
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,305
No, not at all,

270
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:35,062
but your mother's warm meal
must've made you weak.

271
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,069
I'm scared...

272
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,907
The dead children
visit me every night...

273
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,660
King Gwangmok, it's weird...

274
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,204
Something feels terribly wrong...

275
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,330
King Jiguk.

276
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,835
We are fighting the evil.

277
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,421
We're doing heaven's work.

278
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,092
You know there's no room
for fear and regret.

279
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,264
The other 2 kings
reached the nirvana.

280
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,224
<i>1 know.</i>

281
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,231
You must die.

282
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,318
They'll come after you soon.

283
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,910
Beast soaked in blood,
stop your tears.

284
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,996
Lift your head
and look at the light.

285
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,957
Kneel.

286
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,961
Wipe your tears
and seek Buddha's truth.

287
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:46,050
Pain is fruit of the faith,
it'll purify the blood,

288
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,886
and the blood
will light the world.

289
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,722
Do not be afraid,
beasts of the dark.

290
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,391
You will win over
the evil of the world.

291
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,312
You will trample the snakes
scurried by the light.

292
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,707
Red bean?

293
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,293
Yes, from the tunnel body.

294
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,130
So many came out of
her mouth and esophagus.

295
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,968
It's food, so it's not
out of ordinary.

296
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,260
The weird part is,

297
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:34,515
pieces of talisman
also came out.

298
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,518
<i>And 1 think...</i>

299
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,437
there were similar cases
some time ago.

300
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,612
We are innocent deers.

301
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:55,786
Evil that threatens the good
exists in this world.

302
00:24:56,662 --> 00:25:02,418
Mrs. Seo's mother died
of a car accident recently.

303
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:11,260
Mrs. Kim's husband
suffered tremendously too.

304
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:20,477
If the drunk driver
and the site manager

305
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:25,607
never came into this world,
the victims would still be alive.

306
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,487
Light and dark are
connected in this world.

307
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,198
Protectors of the light

308
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,369
feel brighter because of darkness.

309
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:42,041
Deer Mount's scripture prophesied

310
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,793
- protectors of light.
- Good, the scripture.

311
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:52,551
As you know, only 4 copies
of the sacred scripture exist.

312
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,696
Scripture, scripture...

313
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,325
Last pages of the scripture

314
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,747
prophecies 81 demons that'll be
born with vile spirit of this world.

315
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,624
81 demons.

316
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,504
Now we're getting somewhere.

317
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,848
You, stay here,
you two, follow me,

318
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,517
check everyone who comes out.

319
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,893
Let's move.

320
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,529
Afternoon, we're from
Yeongwol Police.

321
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,573
Is Mr. Kim Cheol-jin here?

322
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,825
What's going on?

323
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,536
We're looking for a suspect
of the tunnel case.

324
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,621
His name is Kim Cheol-jin.

325
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,499
His address is listed as here.

326
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,751
<i>1 think you got
the wrong address.</i>

327
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,087
This is a Buddhist sanctuary.

328
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,005
It does look like it.

329
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,135
Check IDs of everyone here,
and check inside too.

330
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,719
Please cooperate.

331
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,721
Actually, just check their IDs.

332
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>1 think it's a fake address.</i>

333
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,602
You idiot, isn't that obvious?
I knew it right away.

334
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,816
Yeah, what's up?

335
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,526
We're pulling out.

336
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,528
Dammit.

337
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,493
Allow me.

338
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,291
Who...

339
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,670
I'm investigating this mission,
Park Woong-jae.

340
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,425
<i>1 saw you on TV.</i>

341
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,886
You look better in person.

342
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,513
What brings you here?

343
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,098
- Well, I...
- Captain.

344
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,685
We got the address
of Kim Cheol-jin's mother.

345
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,562
- Sure this time?
- Yes.

346
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,939
Move out!

347
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,483
Good luck.

348
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,658
Kim Cheol-jin?

349
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,546
You must die.

350
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:39,509
And I'll continue your work.

351
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,745
This so-called 'Deer Mount'

352
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,164
doesn't exist only in
Taebaek and Jungsun.

353
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,624
There are others?

354
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,918
Jecheon, the same deer logo.

355
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,628
Indeed.

356
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,631
And this is Danyang,
same logo as well.

357
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,384
How did you know
there'd be more?

358
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:05,804
Because there has to be
2 more places.

359
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,476
Look at the altar painting
in the photo you sent.

360
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,646
And another from Jungsun.

361
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,731
So what?

362
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,065
These...

363
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,694
aren't generals.

364
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:26,074
They're called
'Four Heavenly Kings.'

365
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,077
- Kings?
- Yes.

366
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,081
The kings representing
the four cardinal directions.

367
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,001
Four guardians of Buddha.

368
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,086
You found 2 of them.

369
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,195
Let's start
with Taebaek's Deer Mount.

370
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,698
You'll see 2 servants below.

371
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,493
On the right is Gandharva,

372
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,496
and left is Pishacha.

373
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:16,625
And the blue-faced god
holding a pipa.

374
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,753
King Jiguk,
guardian of the east.

375
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,798
And Jungsun's King Damun.

376
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,759
Yaksha and Rakshasa as servants,

377
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,096
a pagoda in his left hand,
a spear in his right,

378
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,765
he guards the north.

379
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,352
If you look at this map,
the secret will be revealed.

380
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,272
King Jiguk in the east,
King Damun in the north,

381
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:45,737
and if we approximate,
we get 2 more cities.

382
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,989
- Jecheon in the west.
- King Gwangmok.

383
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,200
- Danyang in the south.
- King Jeungjang.

384
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,203
You are a genius!

385
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,705
The temple must be
serving brain food.

386
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,375
Knowledge is my food.

387
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,961
- By the way...
- Good, very good.

388
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,422
Did you ever see
a new religion...

389
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,965
that worships these kinds?

390
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,884
No, it's first for me.

391
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:21,648
The Four Heavenly Kings
are devas from India.

392
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,359
But they surrendered to Buddha.

393
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,321
They became gods
that hunt demons.

394
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,867
Devas that hunt demons...

395
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,330
Scripture, scripture...

396
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,015
Joseph!

397
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,653
- After you, pastor.
- You first!

398
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,075
Dammit...

399
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,001
Looks like it's occupied.

400
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,878
It's gotta be Kim Cheol-jin's.

401
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,963
Pastor!

402
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,052
King Jiguk's scripture, huh?

403
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,116
The suspect's coming up.

404
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,493
Wait for my signal.

405
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,946
Mother, listen very carefully.

406
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,951
What you see isn't everything.

407
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:25,999
I've been fighting evil
to protect this world.

408
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,461
Only the heaven will
recognize my work.

409
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,215
I've been a blessed son.

410
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,052
From the heaven...

411
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,470
Mother...

412
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,138
I'll...

413
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,306
The roof! The roof!

414
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,768
Get to the roof!
Move out!

415
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,145
- Hurry, come!
- Hold you tight.

416
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,153
Under Buddha's guidance...

417
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:55,987
We found him!

418
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,115
The beast will triumph
over the snakes.

419
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,994
The heaven will not forget
your hard work.

420
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:04,996
Kim Cheol-jin!

421
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,500
Look carefully,
with its wings,

422
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,797
- he beast...
- will be born again.

423
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,174
- Don't do it!
- Get down there!

424
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,060
The suspect jumped off.

425
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:57,048
Seoul Metro Police

426
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:05,515
Murder suspect commits suicide
by jumping with a noose

427
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,976
Here, the Kim Cheol-jin file.

428
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,353
Thank you, sis.

429
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,148
Stop asking me
for these favors.

430
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,399
<i>Personal Record
Am 1 your minion?</i>

431
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:18,570
<i>Already forgot how 1 helped
with Sion Group case?</i>

432
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,197
I help you plenty,
it's a give and take.

433
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,076
It's end of the year,
everyone's on the edge!

434
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,371
Hello?

435
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,541
Yeah, I'm out for a bit.

436
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,168
Criminal Record
I'll be back soon.

437
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,127
Criminal Record

438
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,628
Yangju Youth Detention?

439
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,632
Kim was a juvenile killer.

440
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:46,139
Gangwon Education Board

441
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,184
- Hello there.
- Afternoon.

442
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,742
It's what King Jiguk asked for.

443
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,287
They've been moving around
quite a bit.

444
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,290
This record should be
their most recent one.

445
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,167
Thank you, madame.

446
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,044
King Gwangmok.

447
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,340
I'm so honored to meet you.

448
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,934
Name: Lee Geum-hwa

449
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,342
East Seoul bus is arriving.

450
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,678
This bus is not a nonstop...

451
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:54,976
Cleansing the sins
with precious blood.

452
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,563
Lord, cleanse my sins.

453
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,191
Praise the Lord.

454
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,448
Random Chat
Be there soon, for real.

455
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,283
Gotta room.
Been to Seoul?

456
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,160
Just to Everland.

457
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,204
- That's not Seoul, retard.
- But I am a retard.

458
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,456
Selfie.

459
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,353
Why do you keep locking it?

460
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,481
I'm scared.

461
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,983
Did you feed it?

462
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,945
Did you?

463
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,947
- No.
- Do it now.

464
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,165
The King Jiguk scripture
you brought

465
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,500
consists of edited versions

466
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,462
of early sutras and tantra.

467
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,716
What's important is that
I've never seen this one before.

468
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,968
Look at this last scripture,

469
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,512
it's called Hangma sutra.

470
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,973
- Hangma?
- Yes.

471
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:43,644
It talks about demons fighting gods,
its like a prophecy.

472
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,357
More importantly, other sutras
are interpreted in a practical way,

473
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:52,111
but this Hangma remains symbolic.

474
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,740
Just like the bible's
Book of Revelation.

475
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,660
Ever heard of this Hangma?

476
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,411
Not at all.

477
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,455
You went undercover for months.

478
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,708
You can head home...

479
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,294
Is that make-up?

480
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,554
Deaconess, he's a monk...

481
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,099
Nah, they look good together.

482
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:28,272
The mournful beasts
will be born again with wings,

483
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:32,026
and trample the snakes
scurried by the light.

484
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,489
Beasts that protect the light.

485
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,616
Stars that trample the snakes.

486
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,494
Wipe your tears,
don't be afraid.

487
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,872
Grab the snake
sprouting from the girl.

488
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,877
Snake's eyes are beautiful,
its tongue sweet,

489
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:54,340
formidable beasts,
do not look at its eyes,

490
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,551
do not listen to it,

491
00:43:56,676 --> 00:44:01,472
only its blood
will cleanse you.

492
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,498
Mister...

493
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,422
Mister...

494
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,342
Na-han?

495
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,594
Na-han.

496
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,471
Wake up.

497
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:34,690
Under Buddha's guidance,
the beast will triumph over the snakes,

498
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,609
and be born again.

499
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:41,280
Buddha's bright light
will protect you.

500
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,576
Yup, it's the Four Kings.

501
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,619
Right!

502
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,704
Check this out.

503
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,873
This was a beast,

504
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,584
but after surrendering to Buddha...

505
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:58,464
It defeats evil and ascends
to become a Buddha.

506
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,093
These guys...

507
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,805
are hunting ghosts.

508
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,559
Hae-an, can you find out
who wrote this sutra?

509
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,021
If you look at the last page,
it says 'Master Kim.'

510
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,107
Master Kim?

511
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,985
Master Kim...

512
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,529
Ask Prof. Goo.

513
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,739
Prof. Goo? Who's that?

514
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,449
Google.

515
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:35,167
Deaconess, was that a joke?

516
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,130
You deserve a raise!

517
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,180
Master Kim, Buddhism...

518
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,100
Good, look at that,
already getting hits.

519
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,312
I°Tibetan Mahayana monk
Nechoongtenpa wants to meet

520
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,230
Dong Bang sect's
Kim Jae-seok.ix

521
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,024
Dong Bang sect?

522
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,235
Oh, that Kim Jae-seok.

523
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,779
He's famous even to us.

524
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,489
He still has massive followers.

525
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:09,660
Founder of Dong Bang
wrote the sutra?

526
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,539
There is an expert in that.

527
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,333
Who?

528
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,376
He's known as...

529
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,170
the Octopus.

530
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,882
He likes lavish gifts.

531
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:26,177
I'll call ahead,
so get him something nice.

532
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,429
Stupid Octopus!

533
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,599
He should be in the ocean,

534
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,642
not the mountain!

535
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,069
There are cars...

536
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,295
You brought rare gifts!

537
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,214
Very rare.

538
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,468
<i>1 know monks aren't
keen on expensive gifts.</i>

539
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,095
- Showing my sincerity.
- Thank you.

540
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,849
$6 worth of sincerity.

541
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,978
<i>1 talked to Hae-an briefly.</i>

542
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,438
Right.

543
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,524
Dong Bang sect's
Kim Jae-seok...

544
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,863
<i>1 should first tell you...</i>

545
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,912
Master Kim is the real deal.

546
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,332
Real deal?

547
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,919
In other words,
he became a god.

548
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,757
Conservative sects were
reluctant of him,

549
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,719
but Kim has reached
the Buddhahood.

550
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:58,436
This is the only photo of him,
in 1940s.

551
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:05,776
Even the esoteric Buddhists
of Japan looked up to him.

552
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,236
He was pro-Japan?

553
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,946
My story continues.

554
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,990
My apologies.

555
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,785
He even funded
our freedom fighters.

556
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:20,166
He brought back stolen
treasures from Japan later.

557
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:24,962
When the political climate
turned equivocal,

558
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,507
he focused on
religion and welfare.

559
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,760
His authority naturally expanded.

560
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,721
And that's Dong Bang sect.

561
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,847
Bingo.

562
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,477
Then in 1985,

563
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:44,273
Kim suddenly dismantled
the temple and vanished.

564
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,649
Why?

565
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,819
To write the sutra.

566
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,868
- Have you ever seen him?
- No.

567
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,246
Very few people
have seen him.

568
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:03,334
Only his direct disciples
had contact with him.

569
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,919
Could he still be alive?

570
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:06,170
Well...

571
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:12,384
Born in Yeongwol, Gangwon
in 1899, so he'd be...

572
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,762
116 years old.

573
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,555
He must have passed.

574
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,682
It's a shame...

575
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,059
Sir, here.

576
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,811
<i>1 saw.</i>

577
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:28,526
Kim Jae-seok sponsors
Yangju Youth Detention Center

578
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,074
<i>1 know, director.</i>

579
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,202
It's almost Christmas,
and getting cold too,

580
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,997
<i>1 suddenly thought
of your boys.</i>

581
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,542
Yes, I'll see you in a bit.

582
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,553
You don't really think
he's still alive?

583
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,973
He must be dead,
if he's a fake.

584
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,061
- By the way, Joseph.
- Yes?

585
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,356
- Aren't you curious?
- About what?

586
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:13,946
If there's a real deal
somewhere out there.

587
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:17,032
What are you talking about?
Our Lord is still alive.

588
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,660
Lord is alive...

589
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:33,090
A friend from seminary went to
South Africa with his wife as missionary.

590
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:39,513
They were so faithful,
always praying to our lord.

591
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,559
A few years later,
he came back alone.

592
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,060
Why?

593
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,607
His entire family
was shot to death.

594
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:56,071
Including his son,

595
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,203
and a baby daughter,
all slaughtered.

596
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:10,878
11-year old Muslim suspect
said to him,

597
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,426
Will of God.

598
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,183
<i>1 still don't get it.</i>

599
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:31,065
We're all suffering down here
like a bunch of ants.

600
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,402
What exactly is our Lord
doing up there?

601
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,158
<i>So 1 want to
meet Kim by proxy,</i>

602
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,286
since he's a god.

603
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,544
It's noisy here,
come inside.

604
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,587
Sure.

605
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:57,549
Religion research?

606
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,550
Far East Religion Research Park
Woong-jae Religion research?

607
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,468
Far East Religion Research
Park Woong-jae

608
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,055
What brings you here
with gifts for the boys?

609
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,684
We wanted to come
see them,

610
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,603
and thank you for your work.

611
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,438
You don't look it.

612
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,402
- Pastor.
- Yes?

613
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,196
In my 30 years here,

614
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,031
no one ever donates
without reason.

615
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,201
It's okay to state
your business.

616
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,163
Director, you don't
beat around the bush.

617
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,915
Dong Bang sect?

618
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,086
<i>1 heard you received
donations from them.</i>

619
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,381
Yes, that was about
20 years ago.

620
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,342
They built this Jae-seok Center.

621
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,804
By Jae-seok,

622
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,265
you mean Master Kim?

623
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,142
That's right.

624
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:54,481
He was once a scapegoat,
but he was a great man.

625
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,943
He thought of my boys
as his own.

626
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,237
Why did he?

627
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,197
Pardon?

628
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,033
No one ever donates
without reason.

629
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:16,253
Master Kim took
these 4 boys under his wings.

630
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,630
4 boys?

631
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,217
They all committed patricide.

632
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,262
It's hard to educate them...

633
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,097
So with the help of religion?

634
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:31,560
Surpassing that, Master Kim
adopted these boys.

635
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,480
All 4 of them?

636
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,150
One of them is Kim Cheol-jin?

637
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,234
Yes.

638
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,487
Isn't it wonderful?

639
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,114
He became a father
to look up to.

640
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:51,371
<i>Could 1 find out
who the other 3 are?</i>

641
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,011
Jung Na-han, Kim Cheol-jin,
Chae Tae-geun, Jeon Sang-bum.

642
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,931
They all appear in the scripture.

643
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,392
Hiding in a bright river,
listen, Chae.

644
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,894
You are a blood-covered beast.

645
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,982
The world will only see
the darkness in you.

646
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,359
Everything fits perfectly.

647
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,404
Bright river represents
the city of Gwangju.

648
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,363
And Chae.

649
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,490
Chae Tae-geun was born
in Gwangju.

650
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:13,912
Starry river is Sungju,
which is Jung Na-han.

651
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:18,166
Blue river is Chungju,
Kim Cheol-jin.

652
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,753
Thunderous river is Jinju,
hidden beast is

653
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,423
Jeon Sang-bum.

654
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,301
Everything is prophesied
in the scripture.

655
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,303
4 boys from detention,

656
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,556
and 3 of them are already dead.

657
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,932
What?

658
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:37,352
What do you mean by that?

659
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,230
Look.

660
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:45,402
Look at the halos on
Kings of North and South.

661
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,987
Halos...

662
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,532
Catholic martyrs are
drawn with halos.

663
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,075
<i>1 was curious about that.</i>

664
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,455
Why draw halos
only on these two?

665
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,041
They must be dead then.

666
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,713
They reached the nirvana
while out hunting.

667
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,549
No way...

668
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:11,053
Now, Kim Cheol-jin's dead,

669
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,349
so a halo on King Jiguk.

670
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:18,977
Then... he's the last one.

671
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,274
King Gwangmok of the East.

672
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,880
Seoul Metro Police

673
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,717
3 of the 4 offenders
really are dead.

674
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:23,889
Jeon died in a Yeongwol
maternity center fire.

675
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:28,393
A lot of mothers
and babies died too.

676
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,645
<i>1 heard Chae died in Canada.</i>

677
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,566
He was involved
in a robbery.

678
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:41,907
He killed Korean immigrant
mother and daughter and got caught.

679
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,410
He hung himself
in a Toronto jail.

680
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,580
What's the pattern?

681
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,125
What about the last survivor
Jung Na-han?

682
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,629
Jung Na-ham
born 1983...

683
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,631
<i>1 kind of remember it.</i>

684
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:02,761
Raised in red light district,
he killed his dad with bare hands.

685
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,097
He was a middle schooler.

686
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:10,560
A prostitute mom, pimp dad,
it's an obvious backstory.

687
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:17,609
There was a lot of debate
over what to do with him.

688
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,613
A pity case, really.

689
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,199
Screw that...

690
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:23,800
My baby white sheep,
sleep soundly in my arms.

691
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,176
It's a cold winter,

692
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:29,848
cold snowy wind.

693
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,603
- Stay out of my home.
- Stay out of my home.

694
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:41,901
- Away, dark nights.
- Away, dark nights.

695
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:47,824
- Stay away.
- Stay away.

696
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:59,127
Sleep soundly, my baby.
Do not cry, sleep well.

697
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:08,803
Stay out of my home...

698
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,129
King Gwangmok.

699
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,383
You look better in person.

700
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,417
Sacred Deer Mount

701
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,915
King Gwangmok is here.

702
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,921
Welcome.

703
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:23,813
They say deers live ever-young,
but why are they so weak?

704
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,776
Death isn't the end.

705
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,572
It'll be reincarnated
as a human.

706
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,950
Right.

707
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,496
But why do they die

708
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,248
with such sad eyes?

709
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:47,962
I saw it,
it definitely wasn't human.

710
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:51,466
Gwangmok, what we're chasing
may not look as such.

711
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,635
<i>1 know better than anyone.</i>

712
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:58,890
Snake's eyes are beautiful,
its tongue sweet,

713
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,519
grab the snake
sprouting from the girl.

714
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,107
Demon tried to seduce Buddha
with the vision of beautiful woman.

715
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,863
Do not be fooled,
the child is a snake.

716
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:38,513
Master, Gwangmok is here.

717
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,186
He's fading,
time is running out.

718
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:51,985
When the snake sheds
its first blood,

719
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:57,156
the light shall go out,
the world shall turn dark.

720
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,577
You must hurry.

721
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,704
You're the only one left.

722
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:08,126
Jung of Starry River, listen.

723
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,753
Gwangmok.

724
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,506
You are now Gwangmok.

725
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,801
King Gwangmok.

726
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:21,889
A brave king who fights
ghosts in the west.

727
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:36,571
You will become a star,
my star.

728
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:40,867
A star that will shine the world.

729
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,245
I'll protect you.

730
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,958
You'll uphold Dharma

731
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:53,671
and enlighten this
dark vile world.

732
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,401
He says he loves you.

733
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:23,993
Never said that to the disciple
who served him all this time.

734
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,038
Who are you?

735
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,332
How did you get in here?

736
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,710
This is a restricted area.

737
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,045
<i>1 just happen to...</i>

738
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,342
May I ask you to leave?

739
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,136
I'm so sorry.

740
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,475
Excuse me?

741
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,272
Will you jump the fence again?

742
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,776
Go out the front gate,
I'll open it for you.

743
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,155
Thank you...

744
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,141
Student Record

745
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,101
Lee Geum-hwa?

746
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:11,786
Hey!

747
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,217
Christ!

748
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:53,953
Pesticide

749
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,956
Listen to the full story!

750
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:01,711
Sir, this is no ordinary case,
there's something here!

751
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,337
It doesn't make any sense.

752
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:07,133
There's always a reason,
same with the Kim case too...

753
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,676
What reason?

754
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:14,765
Kim Cheol-jin is a killer
with a criminal record,

755
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,436
and the rest are
just ordinary citizens.

756
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:19,770
Wait!

757
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:24,692
An ordinary citizen keeps
an elephant in the house?

758
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:29,739
And hits my car on purpose
for tailgating him?

759
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,202
This is out of my jurisdiction,
call the local police.

760
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:41,459
<i>1 gotta know the reason,
please, captain!</i>

761
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:25,628
The beast'll trample the snakes
and conquest the war.

762
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:30,007
The number of 81 snakes
that threaten the eternal light...

763
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,677
Number of snakes,
eternal light...

764
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:36,389
Sir, the scripture keeps
mentioning the light...

765
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,350
The light represents
Maitreya in Buddhism,

766
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,895
or future Buddha,
a savior in Christianity.

767
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,775
4 kings protect the Maitreya
from the snake.

768
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:53,155
Then the snake is like
Satan in the bible.

769
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,660
The concept of evil
doesn't exist in Buddhism.

770
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,453
No way!

771
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,664
Remember the demon
that tried to tempt Buddha,

772
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,458
and asura and mara
in various scriptures too!

773
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,043
Of course not!

774
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,337
That's all Christian prejudice.

775
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:14,385
All of those represent
man's desire and obsession.

776
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,345
These would be
so-called evils.

777
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,388
Whatever, buddy.

778
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,849
I'll have to call you back.

779
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,018
We're busy here with
Christmas preparation.

780
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:25,229
It's not even your holiday!

781
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,441
It's one of our biggest
events of the year.

782
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:34,739
Every year, we invite Tibetan
Mahayana monk, Nechoongtenpa.

783
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,491
What for?

784
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:42,455
He's coming to greet
the cardinal.

785
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:47,251
But before that he'll have
a talk at our temple...

786
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,254
Oh my, he just arrived.

787
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,214
I'll call you back later.

788
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,389
Tibetan monk...

789
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:23,454
It is our honor to be here
in this Korean Buddhist Temple.

790
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,540
This is from the last
Google search.

791
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,084
It's from 1985.

792
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:29,460
Greatest Buddhist prophet.:

793
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,171
Then in 1985,

794
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:37,093
Kim suddenly dismantled
the temple and vanished.

795
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,429
That's it!

796
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:46,060
He began writing the scripture
after meeting Nechoongtenpa.

797
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:57,238
7-1-7-4-5-3-2...

798
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:00,074
Baldy, answer the phone!

799
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,786
That's correct.

800
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:13,504
<i>What 1 realize from the asceticism
is that pain changes as well.</i>

801
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:18,759
He realized that
even pain changes as well.

802
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:23,931
That is because there is this.

803
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,308
This exists thus that exists.

804
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,894
This is born,
and that is born.

805
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,730
This is born thus that is born.

806
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:36,527
That will be destroyed
as this is destroyed.

807
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,446
This ends thus that ends.

808
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:01,760
- To Seoul?
- Yes.

809
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:09,768
Don't worry.
This is my friend pastor Park.

810
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,770
He comes to see you.

811
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,439
What do you want?

812
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,941
Excuse me.
In urgent matters,

813
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:19,653
<i>1 need to know about
Kim, Jae-seok.</i>

814
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,573
Kim, Jae-seok...

815
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:50,851
It was nineteen eighty-five
when I met the master.

816
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,436
Master...?

817
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,898
He is... Maitreya.

818
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:57,608
Maitreya...

819
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:01,612
Maitreya... Incarnate...

820
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:10,996
who can advocate salvation for all people
as virtue triumphs over vice.

821
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:14,208
<i>1 saw.</i>

822
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:21,090
His beautiful twelve fingers
and his scent.

823
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:28,597
It's so lucky for Korea
that he is still alive here.

824
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,224
- Alive?
- He's dead.

825
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,935
No, he is alive.

826
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:37,022
He was born in 1899.
It's impossible.

827
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:42,444
Attaining Buddhahood means

828
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:47,157
the ultimate of virtue
in Mahayana Buddhism.

829
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:50,869
However, Tibet Buddhism

830
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:55,332
moved to Japan
and changed a lot.

831
01:19:55,332 --> 01:20:00,713
They believe becoming Buddha
means overcoming body.

832
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,840
Overcoming body?

833
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:07,761
The ultimate limitation of human.

834
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,723
Immortality.

835
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,685
Eternal life!

836
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:25,154
Then what does snake
mean in scriptures?

837
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:28,657
Snake...

838
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:38,500
The snake would be
the natural enemy of him.

839
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,627
Natural enemy...?

840
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:43,255
Thank you, thank you.

841
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:49,762
All the things are connected
to each other in this world.

842
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:54,683
When an earthworm
is born on a ground,

843
01:20:54,725 --> 01:21:00,064
a hawk to catch it
is raised above it.

844
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,743
<i>1 delivered the oracle.</i>

845
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,578
The oracle.

846
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:23,212
A natural enemy will be born in the spot
where the light once brought,

847
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:30,094
100 years from then.
And it will turn off the light.

848
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:39,019
One day...
On the day she will be bleeding.

849
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,731
And then, he will die.

850
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:58,831
So, what is the
number of the snakes?

851
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,750
- I don't know these numbers...
- It can't be!

852
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,546
- Look at it again!
- Numbers of snake...

853
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,674
Only Kim Jae-seok knows...

854
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:13,178
I don't know.
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

855
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:51,383
...evil doesn't exist
in Buddhism.

856
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,509
Master Kim is...

857
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:55,220
...man's desire and obsession.

858
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,472
He's the real.

859
01:22:56,847 --> 01:23:03,020
A natural enemy will be born
in the spot where he was born...

860
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,149
This is born thus
that is born.

861
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:10,944
This ends thus that ends.

862
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,965
Excitement is in the air.

863
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,596
Joseph.

864
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,183
Is Christmas a joyful day?

865
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,376
Of course it is.

866
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,378
Baby Jesus was born.

867
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,005
A thought came to me
every Christmas.

868
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:15,968
It's actually a very
mournful day.

869
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:17,970
What do you mean?

870
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,974
So many babies in Bethlehem
died because of him.

871
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:26,353
Upon hearing the prophecy
from the Magi

872
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:29,481
of a newborn King of the Jews,

873
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:32,818
Herod killed all the boys
in Bethlehem and its vicinity

874
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,945
who were two years old or under...

875
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:37,281
Gospel of Matthew, 2:16.

876
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,386
Mister.

877
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,263
By the way.

878
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,515
Snake's eyes are beautiful...

879
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,142
Its tongue sweet...

880
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,603
<i>1 don't care if 1 die...</i>

881
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,023
Can I at least know why?

882
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:14,067
<i>Why do 1 have to die?</i>

883
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:17,946
Jecheon to the west,
Taebaek to the east,

884
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,532
Jungsun to the north
and Danyang to the south.

885
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,659
So there was a pattern.

886
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,578
Kim Jae-seok's hometown...

887
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:26,580
Yeongwol.

888
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:30,417
A natural enemy will be born
where the light once brought.

889
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:33,587
Kim was born in Yeongwol,
in 1899?

890
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,005
And a 100 years later...

891
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,923
1999...

892
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:44,097
He believes someone from
Yeongwol will be born to harm him.

893
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:49,186
When the snake shed
its first blood...

894
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:51,480
Snake sprouting from the girl...

895
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,025
Killer of Yeongwol
Middle school girl...

896
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:00,030
Girls born in 1999,

897
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,824
in Yeongwol...

898
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,789
You were born evil.

899
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:14,127
Death is not the end,
it's a new beginning.

900
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:22,177
I'll pray that you'll be born
as Buddha in the next life.

901
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,059
What now?

902
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:31,937
Captain, just look up
Kim Cheol-jin's file!

903
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:35,399
Was his victim born
in 1999 in Yeongwol?

904
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,025
Listen buddy,
could you stop?

905
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:39,695
Please just take a look!

906
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,621
Kim's former cellmate

907
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,374
Jeon Sang-bum
died in a fire in 1999.

908
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:55,377
Chae Tae-geun committed suicide
in Canada after 2 murders.

909
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,672
Their victims were all girls

910
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,008
born in 1999 in Yeongwol.

911
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:09,933
They've been killing them
for 10 years to look like accidents.

912
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:15,480
They tracked down girls
who even immigrated abroad!

913
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,071
Wait, please.

914
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:24,906
<i>Then 1 have a favor.</i>

915
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:28,118
A ghost really
lives in my house.

916
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,330
She's my twin.

917
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,918
She was born with me,

918
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:40,714
so she must be evil too.

919
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,800
Kill her too.

920
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,428
So that she's born again.

921
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:49,765
As a human in the next life.

922
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,703
Detective Jo.

923
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,665
What grade would
the girls born in 1999 be?

924
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,293
Let's see,
My niece is in 7th grade...

925
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,170
So they'd be in 9th grade.

926
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:25,050
Find out how many 9th grade
Yeongwol girls there are.

927
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,177
There are 81 numbers.

928
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,179
Look.

929
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,974
99 and 2...

930
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:36,853
Pastor, this was ID number.

931
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,565
I thought it looked similar,

932
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,901
<i>but 1 wondered why
there are only 10-digits.</i>

933
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,112
Birth year,
gender number.

934
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,157
Without these,
there are 10 digits.

935
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:55,163
That's why the scripture
was completed in 2000.

936
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:59,334
After ID numbers of
everyone were verified.

937
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,671
Girls born in 1999
in Yeongwol.

938
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:06,258
81 girls, 81 demons.

939
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,302
3 high schools in total,

940
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,681
all 9th grade girls come to...

941
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:16,059
38, that's it?

942
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,186
8th grade?

943
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,772
8th grade girls...

944
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:22,107
87, sir.

945
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:24,359
7th grade?

946
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:26,945
79

947
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,531
$10,000 Reward
Missing Girl

948
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:59,227
Jehovah, O God.

949
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,356
Deliver me from mine enemies.

950
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:06,484
Defend me from them
that rise up against me.

951
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:10,488
Deliver me from
the workers of iniquity,

952
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:14,492
and save me from bloody men.

953
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:20,206
For, lo, they lie in wait
for my soul,

954
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:23,293
the mighty are
gathered against me,

955
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:29,799
not for my transgression,

956
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:32,844
nor for my sin, O Lord.

957
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:36,139
They run and prepare themselves,

958
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,434
without my fault.

959
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:42,520
O God...

960
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:51,363
Awake to help me and behold.

961
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,367
Hide not thy face far from me,

962
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:58,495
put not thy servant
away in anger.

963
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:02,499
Thou hast been my help,

964
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,877
leave me not,

965
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:09,381
neither forsake me

966
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:12,175
God of my salvation.

967
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:10,191
Why have you arrived now,
my child?

968
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:12,527
It took too long.

969
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:16,698
Who are you?

970
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,035
<i>1 am the one who weeps.</i>

971
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,205
I've been waiting for you.

972
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:30,962
Be haste,
too much blood has been shed.

973
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:53,234
Can you not see?
Do you not feel?

974
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,446
<i>1 am your bosom.</i>

975
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:00,241
Open your mind.

976
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,953
<i>1 will take you.</i>

977
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:40,073
Sleep soundly, my baby.

978
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:46,329
Sleep soundly in my arms.

979
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:52,418
Cold snowy wind,

980
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:58,216
stay out of my home.

981
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:04,305
Away, dark nights.

982
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:09,352
Stay out of my home.

983
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:15,692
- Sleep soundly, my baby.
- Stop...

984
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:22,949
Sleep soundly in my arms.

985
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:25,869
Stop!

986
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,842
What are you?

987
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:48,600
<i>1 am the one who weeps,
when blood is shed.</i>

988
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:52,937
What do you want?

989
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:21,716
Pastor...

990
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:26,638
How many do you think
they killed?

991
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:35,563
Look ahead,
it's Jung Na-han.

992
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:58,586
What did you do
to Lee Geum-hwa?!

993
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:00,463
Tell me! Jung Na-han!

994
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:05,468
You've been fooled by
Kim Jae-seok!

995
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,553
Do you know
what you're doing?!

996
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:11,349
How many innocent girls
have you killed?!

997
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:30,743
What do you want from me?

998
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:34,539
Seek the sign of the one
you call Father.

999
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:43,631
He is the snake.

1000
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:48,594
Kill him.

1001
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:02,900
No...

1002
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:07,905
Father is the light...

1003
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,411
He is the light...

1004
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,338
Father...

1005
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,716
Say something, Father.

1006
01:37:29,052 --> 01:37:30,261
Please?

1007
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:34,891
Can you hear me?

1008
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:42,023
Say something like before!

1009
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:53,576
I'm sorry, Father.

1010
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,711
What brings you here
at this hour?

1011
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:07,757
You'll spread germs.

1012
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:15,765
She had an unregistered
twin sister.

1013
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,935
It was as if she was
waiting for me.

1014
01:38:22,688 --> 01:38:25,733
So? You just came back?

1015
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:31,656
She told me to...

1016
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,118
seek the sign.

1017
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,036
What sign?

1018
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:45,628
The sixth finger...

1019
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,596
King Gwangmok.

1020
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:59,100
That's the snake's tongue,
you've been lured by it.

1021
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:03,855
<i>Come, 1 need to
show you something.</i>

1022
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:15,783
In ancient India, monks gifted
elephants to the king.

1023
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,208
Look at its eyes.

1024
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:26,669
What do you feel?

1025
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:30,631
It...

1026
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,136
looks cold.

1027
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:46,856
If its eyes look scary,
it means you are weak,

1028
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:49,692
the monks gifted
an elephant to the king,

1029
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,487
so that he can
stare at it everyday.

1030
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:57,283
It costed $90,000
including delivery.

1031
01:40:19,055 --> 01:40:21,557
Wait patiently
for your salvation.

1032
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:24,769
Why...

1033
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,356
Why are you not
afraid of the elephant?

1034
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,052
Kim Jae-seok.

1035
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:03,599
Have you really become a god?

1036
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:12,817
Aren't you the real deal?
Shouldn't you be god?

1037
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,196
You can't be here like this.

1038
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:10,041
I've found her.

1039
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,418
Don't go.

1040
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:15,421
It's dangerous.

1041
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:27,099
My dear Myung-hee,
you've grown old.

1042
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:07,264
Trumpet playing in heaven

1043
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:09,141
In the name of Jesus

1044
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:18,234
Playing the trumpet,
calling his name

1045
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:27,410
<i>1 hear his voice</i>

1046
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:29,120
<i>1 better enlist.</i>

1047
01:43:31,497 --> 01:43:32,623
Joseph!

1048
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:44,301
What's painful for you is that

1049
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:47,430
the one you called Father

1050
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,391
is just a hunk of meat!

1051
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:56,063
Only pitiful innocent children.

1052
01:43:57,148 --> 01:43:59,066
There never was a snake.

1053
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:04,864
No, I've met the one...

1054
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:10,161
It told me to kill him.

1055
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,485
Oh man, I'm so sorry!

1056
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,987
<i>1 don't believe this...</i>

1057
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:29,824
The road is so slippery.

1058
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:32,409
Are you okay?
Were you hurt?

1059
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,249
My apologies.

1060
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:41,210
So we meet again.

1061
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,003
Who are you?

1062
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:48,884
I'm Pastor Park,
I hunt down fakes.

1063
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:59,144
But looks like I got
the wrong target today.

1064
01:46:01,939 --> 01:46:04,316
It's okay,
just drive away.

1065
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:09,113
We gotta exchange numbers
for the insurance!

1066
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:10,197
Excuse me!

1067
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:14,618
Hey, Master Kim Jae-seok!

1068
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:25,045
Very few people
have seen him.

1069
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:29,091
Only his direct disciples
had contact with him.

1070
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:39,602
It's him.

1071
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:42,855
The light that doesn't die...

1072
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:45,316
Master...

1073
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:48,611
Or grow old...

1074
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:53,240
Kill me...

1075
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:03,459
You did well.

1076
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,424
You did your part.

1077
01:47:29,485 --> 01:47:35,991
<i>1 saw...
His eyes changed after my oracle.</i>

1078
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:42,456
The dragon became a snake.

1079
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:55,010
<i>1 smell blood.</i>

1080
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:02,101
What are you?

1081
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:06,438
Tell me...

1082
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:09,108
Don't talk nor move.

1083
01:48:10,776 --> 01:48:14,405
Your organs and lungs
are almost finished.

1084
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:26,208
Father was my disciple,
who dedicated his life to me.

1085
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:27,960
You lied to me...

1086
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:32,256
I am the light.

1087
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:36,510
You are the stars
that protect me.

1088
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:41,015
Do not feel sorrow
for what you did.

1089
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:43,058
Killing is patriotism
to a soldier.

1090
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:44,935
Shut your mouth!

1091
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:57,531
Time makes humans live
inconsequentially and die.

1092
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:05,122
But I've conquered time.

1093
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:09,460
<i>1 am the eternal light.</i>

1094
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,753
Bullshit!

1095
01:49:11,086 --> 01:49:16,467
I still have many things
to accomplish, I must live.

1096
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:21,680
I'm giving you a chance, beast.

1097
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:23,932
Worship me.

1098
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:36,612
No, you're just a predator
who wants to live.

1099
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:44,078
You shouldn't have...

1100
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:47,456
- The kids were innocent...
- You won't understand!

1101
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:49,750
They cry every night...

1102
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:53,253
Have you heard their cries?

1103
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,880
You won't understand!

1104
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,722
Even a hundred lives of yours
won't be enough.

1105
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:11,438
Mournful eyes shall
twist the neck of the snake.

1106
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:19,655
A hundred lives
aren't enough!

1107
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:28,413
Everything will turn
upside down.

1108
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:32,626
The earth becomes the sky,

1109
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:38,173
the sky becomes the earth.

1110
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:16,545
Wise one,
grab the snake's foot.

1111
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:28,599
<i>1 cannot die here
by your hands.</i>

1112
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:22,361
She will kill you.

1113
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:33,580
The snake will burn...

1114
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:53,600
in the end...

1115
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:58,689
Dharma shall be upheld.

1116
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:41,458
Yes, that's right.

1117
01:54:48,507 --> 01:54:52,594
A car flipped
and was lit on fire.

1118
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:10,487
<i>Yes, 1 understand,
please hurry.</i>

1119
01:56:55,133 --> 01:56:58,345
<i>Lee Geum-hwa is okay,
1 got a call from her family.</i>

1120
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:05,977
But she had an unregistered
twin sister at home.

1121
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:07,771
She's the one who died.

1122
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:32,546
Pastor?

1123
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:35,465
Yes?

1124
01:57:35,966 --> 01:57:38,969
What were his last words?

1125
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:42,973
Whose?

1126
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:45,725
Jung Na-han.

1127
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:48,395
What did he say to you?

1128
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,108
He said...

1129
01:57:57,404 --> 01:57:58,905
he was cold.

1130
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:12,460
Where are you?

1131
01:58:13,378 --> 01:58:15,505
Have you forsaken us?

1132
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:20,969
Why do you hide
your face and cry?

1133
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,887
Wake up.

1134
01:58:23,597 --> 01:58:26,391
Listen to our cries and despair.

1135
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:28,268
Get up.

1136
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:32,439
Save us from evil
with your benevolence,

1137
01:58:32,897 --> 01:58:35,150
and listen to our prayers.

1138
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:47,621
