1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,473
INCOMING CALL

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,726
YI-MANIAC

4
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,169
Hey!

5
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,841
How do you feel? Are you okay?

6
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,763
I'm so embarrassed
I don't think I can leave the CQ.

7
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,684
I don't think I'll ever be able to leave
this tiny room.

8
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,020
Why not?

9
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,065
What did you do now?

10
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,820
Santi.

11
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,280
I didn't see anything! I know nothing.

12
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,198
Nice, juicy muscles.

13
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,368
From now on, I'm lying low.

14
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,328
I'm going to keep my distance.

15
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,581
I'm going to keep a low profile,
make the IVF a success,

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,000
and go back as fast as I can.

17
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,714
YESTERDAY

18
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,648
Oh, my God!

19
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,903
Eve, only you can see it now.

20
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,450
Only you can see it!

21
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,711
…you were really going to die--

22
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,465
<i>The accident that could've ended with</i>
<i>just me dying almost killed two people.</i>

23
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,092
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

24
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,218
<i>Yeah.</i>

25
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,471
<i>Look, what did I do that was so wrong?</i>

26
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,224
<i>Even if I could go back,</i>
<i>I'd do the same thing.</i>

27
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,686
<i>Open up the hatch,</i>
<i>jump out like an idiot, and save you.</i>

28
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>Would I have been rewarded</i>

29
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>if I had let you die</i>
<i>while decompressing and suiting up?</i>

30
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,192
<i>What I did was good.</i>
<i>I did the right thing.</i>

31
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,111
<i>Give me a pat</i>
<i>and tell me I did the right thing.</i>

32
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,988
<i>Come on, just say thank you.</i>

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,327
Where did you get the alcohol?

34
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,079
Is it okay if I like you?

35
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,709
No?

36
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,133
- You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk at all.

37
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,473
Is that okay?

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,061
It's not okay.

39
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,480
Think about it before you answer.

40
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,566
I'll give you some time.

41
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,776
Hey!

42
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,986
I don't need time.

43
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,865
It's a question
that doesn't deserve consideration.

44
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,910
You come here drunk and talking nonsense.
Why should I answer that?

45
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,164
We both have partners.

46
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,207
Are you crazy?

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,252
Actually,
you've been acting crazy all day.

48
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,589
All day long, from the minute
you jumped out into space to save me.

49
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,635
And then you had a drink,
which is off-limits…

50
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,347
Are you crazy? Are you nuts?

51
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,189
Just shut your mouth and go to sleep.

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,109
Does it make you feel better
to dismiss this

53
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,069
as me just being a stupid drunk?

54
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,071
You can't even get drunk up here.

55
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,949
A few drops of alcohol
just made me a bit braver, is all.

56
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,325
Get out.

57
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,538
I'm going back down in a few days.

58
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,041
You won't be back for a year,
so I have to say this now.

59
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,338
I can't go back to Earth
pretending like nothing happened here.

60
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,758
I don't want to lie to myself.

61
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,388
Leave.

62
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,059
- Get out.
- Come on, wait a second.

63
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,061
- Get out! Now!
- Just wait.

64
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,313
Get out.

65
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,689
I said get out!

66
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,026
Come on, Commander.

67
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,694
Commander.

68
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,872
Hello?

69
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,628
Mr. Gong?

70
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,509
Mr. Gong, are you sleeping?

71
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,730
He really put a dent in it.

72
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,543
You scared me!

73
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,462
Why did you open the door?

74
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,174
Curious if I left?

75
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,094
No, I'm not curious.

76
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,642
What the hell?

77
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,976
What's with you?

78
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,062
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

79
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,647
Stop it, I'm serious!

80
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,273
I came in because you opened the door.

81
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,235
If you hadn't,
I wouldn't have been able to come in.

82
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,988
I'm not that bold or shameless.

83
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,198
Thank you.

84
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,244
It's because you were annoying me.

85
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,913
If you hadn't left,
I would have kicked you out.

86
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,040
It's nice

87
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,709
that you were curious.

88
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,133
Come on, do you know how hard it was

89
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,260
to work up the nerve to come and tell you?

90
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,680
It'd be so unfair to be kicked out
without finishing what I came to say.

91
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,765
I'm not expecting you
to answer on the spot.

92
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,435
I know how strange I'm acting.

93
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,938
As an ob-gyn,

94
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,232
I only see women
in the OR, exam room, and ER.

95
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm always in one of those places,
surrounded by pregnant women,

96
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,071
so I only see women as patients.

97
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:33,161
But this weightlessness
has done something to my heart.

98
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,288
You made me like this.

99
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,874
You slapped me silly
and made me like this.

100
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,168
You and zero gravity are responsible.

101
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,504
Let me slap some sense back into you.
Come here.

102
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,506
Whoa! I don't care how much I like you.

103
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,341
I'm not getting slapped again.

104
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,554
Listen carefully.

105
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,558
In four days, after you go back to Earth,

106
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,977
I'm never going to see you again. The end.

107
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,148
You know how strong alcohol is up here?

108
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,108
But you drank it anyway, and then, this.

109
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,027
You break into the commander's room,

110
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,571
and then go and hit on the commander.

111
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,409
This is unacceptable.

112
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm reporting this
to IOU Mission Control immediately.

113
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,663
Be prepared.

114
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,081
Go ahead, report it.

115
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,920
Then the whole world will find out
that the tourist likes the commander.

116
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,512
What will the crew think of me
if they find out about this?

117
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,266
"She's getting involved with a tourist
who's only here for a few days?"

118
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,688
The idea of me getting tangled up
with the fiancé of a wealthy heiress

119
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,023
is utterly mortifying.

120
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,358
It's appalling.

121
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,075
I'm going back to being a doctor

122
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,785
and cutting ties with MZ Group.

123
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,665
I'm not comfortable being part of MZ.
Plus, it doesn't suit me.

124
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm just a tourist
who's here for a few days,

125
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,170
so I get why it would be hard
for you to open up to me.

126
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,255
Plus, you're taken.

127
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,549
So, of course, right now it's impossible.

128
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,716
But,

129
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,847
a year from now,
if you find yourself alone,

130
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,392
think of me.

131
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,313
If you're with someone better than me,
then keep him.

132
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,649
But if I get lucky and you're stuck

133
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,901
with a bunch of losers, then…

134
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,823
maybe we can date.

135
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,200
I'll wait.

136
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,382
Don't do that either.

137
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,593
Who says you get to wait?

138
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,719
No thanks.

139
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,140
You absolutely cannot have
feelings for me.

140
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,559
This is an order.

141
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,478
"You absolutely cannot have
feelings for me."

142
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,355
Does an order like that exist in space?

143
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,567
You're not even in the same league
as the guys I know.

144
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,236
Am I so unattractive?

145
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,489
- That's correct.
- In what way?

146
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,866
- In every way.
- Every way?

147
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,200
Yes, in every way.

148
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,464
Fine.

149
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,593
I got it.

150
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,845
You don't look like you get it.

151
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,388
I'm not an idiot.

152
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,645
Get some rest.

153
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,274
Where did you get the alcohol?

154
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,570
- From the observation module?
- No.

155
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,280
- Did Santi give it to you?
- No.

156
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,078
After I report this to MCC,

157
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,789
I'm going to find the booze
and the culprit.

158
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,998
Understood?

159
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:06,916
No.

160
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,150
Santi!

161
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,404
Santi!

162
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,784
I'm so sorry.

163
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,788
You guys almost got caught
because of me. Sorry.

164
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,498
Oh, you mean the drinks?

165
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,793
I'm an expert at not getting caught.

166
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,512
Where is the drink?

167
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,313
Ta-da.

168
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,109
We don't have any experiments
going on right now.

169
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,237
So, nothing to cultivate,
and they keep it shut down.

170
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,781
Isn't this an incubator?

171
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,827
It is an alcohol storage for now.

172
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,664
Maybe other astronauts can use it.

173
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,666
Nah, why would they?

174
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,002
They probably forgot
I have this over here.

175
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,171
They have the same exact machines
on that side as on this side,

176
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,047
but those are way newer.

177
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,633
They would never come over here
to use the ones on this side.

178
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,135
Santi?

179
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,430
This bottle…

180
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,308
Let's hide it in a safer place.

181
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,976
A safer place?

182
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:49,894
Yes.

183
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,440
The commander first suspected you.

184
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,109
How about we hide it somewhere else?

185
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,197
Not the observation module
where you sleep, right?

186
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,617
Do you get what I'm saying?

187
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,662
I got you.

188
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,548
SEOUL, 4:27 A.M. ILS 7:27 P.M.

189
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,135
Change the water
and go to sleep, Seung-jun.

190
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,515
ILS needs to sleep so we can go home.

191
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,058
Please, let us get some rest.

192
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,060
Okay.

193
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,396
<i>I think I saw mold growing</i>
<i>on the Japanese mustard greens.</i>

194
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,607
Can you ask Mina to check it?
I can't reach her.

195
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,151
She's probably sleeping
because she's tired.

196
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,528
But it'll probably spread.

197
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,578
<i>You won't be satisfied</i>
<i>until you wake her up, will you, Si-won?</i>

198
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,789
<i>Yup.</i>

199
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,001
But how?

200
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,753
He saw it for a split second.

201
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,464
How did Mr. Gong know
that was Kang Kang-su's ticket?

202
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,802
The same thing is written
on a picture in Dr. Kang's bedroom.

203
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,263
"Stand by me"?

204
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,139
Oh, my God.

205
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,517
Do you know
how embarrassed I was as an astronaut

206
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,520
to be caught
like that in front of a tourist?

207
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:18,691
I want to crawl into the butthole
of one of Dr. Kang's fruit flies and hide.

208
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,736
First of all, calm down.

209
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,114
Calm down.

210
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,784
He told me I could keep it
and that he wouldn't tell Dr. Kang.

211
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,536
But how can I believe him, Dona?

212
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,040
On top of that,
he wants me to do him a favor.

213
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,420
He's letting me have 500 billion.
Just imagine what he'll ask for in return!

214
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,423
Well, it's not like
he would ask you to kill someone.

215
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,342
Just do whatever he asks!

216
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,888
I've only known him for four days.

217
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,475
He just went outside
without a spacewalk suit on

218
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,395
and jumped into space. He's nuts.

219
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,024
How am I supposed to know
what a lunatic like that is going to ask?

220
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,776
Damn it.

221
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:08,282
Dona, I'm so scared. I feel like Dr. Kang
is going to come for me any second.

222
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,117
I'm so anxious that I can't breathe.

223
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,328
Screw the 500 billion won,

224
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,705
even if you gave me a trillion won,
I can't.

225
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,709
I'm just going to give back
the lottery ticket.

226
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,835
Hey.

227
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,838
Wait. Hang on, Mina!

228
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,132
Mina, wait a minute. Mina!

229
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,802
So let's say we keep it.

230
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,223
We only have a month
to claim the winnings, right?

231
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,770
I'm not on the manifest to go back on
the G.O-10 when it leaves in a few days.

232
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,440
Only Santi, Kang Kang-su, and Gong Ryong
are scheduled to go back down.

233
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,942
How do we claim this money?

234
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:47,071
I'll alter your chart to show
that your hormones are out of whack.

235
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,406
They'll have to send you back first,

236
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,658
and I'll make it happen.

237
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,201
Are you out of your mind?

238
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,161
<i>Aren't you a doctor?</i>

239
00:15:54,244 --> 00:16:00,125
If we get caught,
we're both finished in this industry.

240
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,504
Dona, the money
is getting to your head. Oh, God.

241
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,303
Forget it.
There's no way we can claim this money.

242
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,351
I'm going to give it back.

243
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,019
Bye.

244
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,022
Hey, wait.

245
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,941
Mina!

246
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,543
Where the hell is it?

247
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,581
Dr. Kang, I have something to tell you.

248
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,055
Dr. Lee!

249
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,232
What are you two doing up
instead of sleeping?

250
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,109
Do you have a new pair of micro scissors?

251
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,819
Why?

252
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,071
Can't you just lend them to me?

253
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,740
Why do you always have to ask why?

254
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,408
I don't have any.

255
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,536
If you don't have any, then why ask why?

256
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,583
Dr. Kang, I have something to tell you.

257
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,960
Again with the gloves.

258
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,130
When you touch moldy greens,
they get covered in spores.

259
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,299
How many times have I told you
to use them once and discard them?

260
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,052
What if those spores
contaminate my fruit flies?

261
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,097
Proper disposal of gloves after use
is essential for scientists.

262
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,976
Why would you carry those around?
How much money do you think you're saving?

263
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,102
And my micro scissors.

264
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,896
You used them on your tomatoes,
and now they're damaged.

265
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,692
They don't work with precision anymore,
so I end up doing my work twice.

266
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,696
I didn't damage your scissors.

267
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,448
Did you think I wouldn't notice
if they were off by 0.00001 mm?

268
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,369
They've only been like that
since you used them.

269
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,622
I sterilized the gloves and--

270
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,874
What did you want to say?

271
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,129
Who the hell put this mouse food here?

272
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,964
Those damn mice eat like pigs.

273
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,215
Hey.

274
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,551
What were you going to say?

275
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,430
What?

276
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,058
Want me to buy you more gloves?
They cost nothing.

277
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,519
I'll get you an unlimited supply,

278
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,189
so how about we stop nagging about money?

279
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,107
You're a scientist. Gloves, seriously?

280
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,402
Were you born a jerk, Dr. Kang?

281
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,695
What did you say?

282
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,948
What, so a scientist asks, "Why?"
Is that such a bad thing?

283
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,619
Isn't "why" the word
that should be most frequently used

284
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,537
by a scientist?

285
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,956
Why are you bragging about being rich?

286
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,416
For the love of God, why?

287
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,376
Come on. Why are you two being like this?

288
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,462
That's what you wanted to tell me?

289
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,005
Yes!

290
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,506
No!

291
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,056
Yes!

292
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,022
Don't throw them in there.

293
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,816
The spores could fly around
and kill my fruit flies.

294
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,526
I told you, I sterilized them!

295
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,861
Dispose of them in your lab.

296
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,864
This trash bin is for public use.

297
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,408
I don't care how much money you have.

298
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,535
This trash bin doesn't belong to you.

299
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,913
It's for the whole planet, got it?

300
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,458
Even if I were drowning in debt,

301
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,834
this trash bin would be

302
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:58,048
public property for everyone on Earth,
including me, okay?

303
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,142
She's so damn loud.

304
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,437
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

305
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,733
<i>Why is my hand tingling?</i>

306
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,901
It feels like it's going numb.

307
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,529
- Tae-hui.
- Yeah?

308
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,115
Can I have this watch someday?

309
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,283
Why?

310
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,869
Isn't this supposed to be passed down
to the best student?

311
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,622
I'll wear it for a bit,
then pass it down to her.

312
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,792
Let go of my hand already.

313
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,003
You're so bossy.

314
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,088
Eve, what did you eat today?

315
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,174
What? I…

316
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,635
I… Well…

317
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,555
I don't remember.

318
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,765
What?

319
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,434
You don't remember
your last meal on Earth?

320
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,853
My mind is blank, Commander.

321
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,565
That's totally normal.

322
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,275
That's how I was on my first flight.

323
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,197
Eve, you worked really hard to get here.

324
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,865
Today, just sit back and enjoy.

325
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,452
Yes, Commander.

326
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,624
Here, take a look.

327
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,127
That space suit really suits you.

328
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,466
Beautiful, right? Don't you think?

329
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,426
Dong-a, please.

330
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,097
See? I mean it.

331
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,645
That idiot doesn't deserve this.

332
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,244
I thought you were going to call Eve.

333
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,329
She's not answering. Must be asleep.

334
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,127
When will you be done with the handover?

335
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,338
At this rate,
you'll be coming in every day.

336
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,507
I've been here for over three years.

337
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,552
I need time to say goodbye.

338
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,780
I really hate that you're leaving.

339
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,099
Hi, Ryong.

340
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,894
- Go-eun.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

341
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,355
I announced our engagement
without talking to you.

342
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,689
<i>It must've been a shock.</i>

343
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,567
I'm sorry.

344
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,031
I'm a lousy guy.

345
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,824
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

346
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,576
You're doing a great job.

347
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,288
<i>You managed to do the surgery,</i>
<i>and you're doing so well, so why?</i>

348
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,210
I'm the one who's sorry
Kang Kang-su stepped in and took over.

349
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,504
I'm too embarrassed to face you.

350
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,922
So, why would you say that?

351
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,050
I…

352
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,887
I'm not good enough for you.

353
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,722
That's not true.

354
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,768
It's not because of Kang Kang-su,
it's because of me.

355
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,315
I…

356
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,278
am not getting engaged to you.

357
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,658
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,329
I'm really sorry.

359
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,910
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

360
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,038
CLOSED FOR LUNCH TODAY

361
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,261
I can't do a good reading if I'm hungry.

362
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,388
Wait.

363
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,523
Have some water.

364
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,819
Unlucky, really unlucky.

365
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,906
This guy is really unlucky.

366
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,533
Is he really your son?

367
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,576
- Yes.
- Yes.

368
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,251
He is like a solitary pine tree

369
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,462
standing alone on a rock.

370
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,173
He has no luck with parents,

371
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,467
no luck with money,

372
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,219
and no luck with his career.

373
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,514
Forget that. Does he have luck with women?

374
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,725
You cut this out.

375
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,690
How did he meet someone like her?

376
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,027
Her lineage has brought her great fortune.

377
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,696
She has it all.

378
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,826
Wow, her face
has money written all over it.

379
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:29,124
Of all the faces I've seen,
hers is the most auspicious.

380
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,421
Okay, so her face is auspicious.

381
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,507
Are you saying they don't suit each other?

382
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,675
No.

383
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,593
They'll have a happy marriage.

384
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,847
He marries her,
and everything she has becomes his.

385
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,015
A match made in heaven.

386
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,309
A match that happens
once in a thousand years.

387
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,815
- Wow, a thousand years.
- It all becomes his.

388
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,941
Forget a hundred.

389
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,028
So what you're saying is,
they don't suit each other,

390
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,780
but they'll be happily married?

391
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,784
Are you saying our son will be respected
and get to call the shots?

392
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,703
He's already calling the shots.

393
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,163
She's more into him.

394
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,751
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

395
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,173
So, which of you is his mom?

396
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,178
You're the fortune teller. Take a guess.

397
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,982
That's easy.
Only one of you has had a baby.

398
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,908
Did you get through to the space station?

399
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,622
<i>I'm not good enough for you.</i>

400
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,624
I…

401
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,628
am not getting engaged to you.

402
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,091
What do you want to eat?

403
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,623
You go first.

404
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,083
Get in.

405
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,439
What floor?

406
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,529
You need to press the button.

407
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,699
Are you expecting me to press it?

408
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,993
I said, what floor?

409
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,881
I made a mistake yesterday. I'm sorry.

410
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:27,010
Ryong and I will spend the rest
of our lives trying to make it up to you.

411
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,469
Ryong feels the same way.

412
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,764
You liked Kang-su too.

413
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,184
You liked him, but now you hate his guts.

414
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,937
Over time, you'll hate Ryong too.

415
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,774
Ryong doesn't like you
as much as you like him.

416
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,903
- I know.
- You do?

417
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,821
What's wrong with you?

418
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,699
What could you possibly lack?
Are you missing a nostril?

419
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,326
Are you missing an eye?

420
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,746
Why isn't the daughter of Choi Jae-ryong
being showered with love?

421
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,289
Why is she clinging to a man?

422
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,709
You think I like Kang-su
because of his deep pockets?

423
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,837
It's because his feelings for you

424
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,132
are much deeper than Ryong's.

425
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:14,098
Kang-su stole the eggs and sperm
to bring Ryong down.

426
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,685
He's trying to show off,
but he's got nothing to show.

427
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,312
He's never going to pull it off.

428
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,616
- One last breath. Can the father help too?
- Yes.

429
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,951
Last one, breathe.

430
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:33,868
Breathe.

431
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,955
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

432
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,832
You're parents now.

433
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,877
Dr. Jeon.

434
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,214
Have you heard from Dr. Gong?
Is everything okay?

435
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,258
Oh, I meant to get in touch with you.

436
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,886
I had a lot of deliveries scheduled.

437
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,935
Ryong is fine,
and he successfully retrieved the eggs.

438
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,024
He pulled it off
without anyone catching on.

439
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,152
Then Dr. Gong
can work on the procedure too.

440
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,238
What a relief.

441
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,739
Have you had lunch?

442
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,827
I knew it, you haven't eaten again.
Let's grab lunch.

443
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,205
Ryong almost died trying to get them back.

444
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,624
He risked his life,
so you need to eat properly.

445
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,377
You're right. Let's go.

446
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:31,843
I hope Ryong succeeds
and brings Kang Kang-su down a peg.

447
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,761
I trust Dr. Gong.

448
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,388
I know he'll get the job done.

449
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,352
I need you to come with me.
Chairman Choi is asking for you.

450
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,315
RESTRICTED AREA

451
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,277
For it to be a pregnancy,
the fertilized egg must look like this.

452
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,196
I got a message saying that

453
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,324
six of the seven eggs
Dr. Kang worked on were fertilized.

454
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,911
Six of them are pregnancies?

455
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,996
Yes, sir.

456
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,207
We've never had a successful
fertilization here. Congratulations.

457
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:07,503
If the last one fertilizes too,
won't that make seven?

458
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,507
Kang-su's the man.

459
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,426
I knew he could pull it off.

460
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,056
See, Go-eun?
I told you Kang-su could do it.

461
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,435
Ryong couldn't do it
even after multiple attempts,

462
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,187
but Kang-su did it on his first try.

463
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,980
Do you still think you're right?

464
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,070
Hey, send me pictures of my grandchildren.

465
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,112
Pardon?

466
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,699
Forget those pictures
of other people's fertilized eggs.

467
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:42,038
I want pictures of my grandchildren.
The ones my son and my daughter-in-law

468
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,498
are going to have.

469
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,334
Oh, right.
I'll pass the request along to Dr. Kang.

470
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:51,339
Now, we freeze them,
ship them back to Earth,

471
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:56,260
and then implant them
in my daughter-in-law, correct?

472
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,099
So, it's all finished now, isn't it?
We're done, right?

473
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,186
How do you feel, Min-jeong?

474
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,315
Given that you were upset with me
for changing your primary doctor

475
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,983
without your consent,

476
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,778
I'm going to ask for your approval
in front of everyone.

477
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,696
You said you were the mother, right?

478
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,365
You said you were in charge?

479
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,659
You said you'd make the decisions?

480
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,537
So, what do you say?
Should we tell Kang-su to stop?

481
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,706
You decide.

482
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,251
Are you going to reject
what Kang-su has achieved?

483
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,753
Answer me.

484
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,676
If you say you want to continue, we will.

485
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,845
Otherwise, I'll tell him to stop.

486
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,682
Should we continue?

487
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,357
Have they developed into morulas?

488
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,651
Min-jeong.

489
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,404
Morulas?

490
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:00,283
Once a fertilized egg
has divided into 16 cells,

491
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,285
it is then called a morula.

492
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,871
At this stage,
it can implant in the uterus.

493
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,205
When does that happen?

494
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,666
It could happen as early as tonight.

495
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,507
What do you want to do?

496
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,719
Still going to insist on Ryong?

497
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,513
Should we turn off the incubator?

498
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,739
Thank you.

499
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,950
Father.

500
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,749
It's done.

501
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,002
Go-eun, it's over.

502
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,673
What time is it there? Isn't it morning?

503
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,807
GONG RYONG'S 5TH DAY

504
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,715
You're really not going to say anything?

505
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,426
You're not going to ask
to split the money or anything?

506
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,388
That's right.

507
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,684
You said, "No questions asked."

508
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,354
What is it you need my help with?

509
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,441
You don't want me to ask
or question you about it,

510
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,734
and just do as you say.

511
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,902
What on earth is it?

512
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,990
What, do you really
want me to kill someone?

513
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,913
I can't do it.

514
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,708
I'm going to turn myself in to Dr. Kang.

515
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,294
It's the opposite.

516
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,257
I want you to save someone,
the same way we saved that mouse.

517
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,345
Tell me what it is right now.

518
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,141
It's simple.

519
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,645
All you have to do is hold my legs.

520
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,946
What?

521
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,449
<i>Sueños húmedos,</i>

522
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,702
<i>cabalgata caliente…</i>

523
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,126
Dirty confessions.

524
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,587
Morning.

525
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,925
Yeah.

526
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,218
That sucks

527
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,349
having to do this every day,
every morning.

528
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,477
Yeah, I'm sick of it too, man.

529
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,979
I…

530
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,939
I miss my wife.

531
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,527
I miss my home.

532
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,035
You said you wanted to get
a new house, right?

533
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,373
Yeah. I mean, I want to.

534
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,627
Then you will need

535
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,797
money, right?

536
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:46,801
Yeah.

537
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,843
Yeah?

538
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,472
Okay.

539
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:35,266
KING OF MONEY

540
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,153
How's Male Mouse 1's mate
back on Earth doing?

541
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,364
His mate

542
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,034
is eating, sleeping, and playing well.
She's doing great.

543
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,079
Her coat shines.
She's also chubby and pretty.

544
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,082
Male Mouse 1
had the best appetite and libido

545
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,585
<i>of any mouse on Earth.</i>

546
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,129
He had the strongest sperm.
He was truly exceptional.

547
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,047
That's why he went to space.

548
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:12,011
I have no idea how he'll ever recover.

549
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,222
Where's Chief Kang?

550
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,016
She's not in yet.

551
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,267
Really?

552
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,324
Who could be calling?

553
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,790
<i>I wonder who it is.</i>

554
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,627
<i>Maybe it's something urgent.</i>

555
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,045
<i>Looks like they hung up.</i>

556
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,052
<i>Dong-a, hang on a second.</i>

557
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,096
<i>You can call them later.</i>

558
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,933
<i>That tickles!</i>

559
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,477
Stop it. Hang on. Time out.

560
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,111
I heard rumors that you were into Eve.

561
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,029
Did I hear wrong?

562
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,367
It's true?

563
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,286
No.

564
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,584
<i>I don't think Eve is interested in men.</i>

565
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,336
She doesn't seem to be dating anyone.

566
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,383
Applying to go away
for a year says it all.

567
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,763
Eve doesn't know much about men.

568
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,522
Cut it out.

569
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,901
Aren't you going to go to work?
Stop it, come on.

570
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,988
Come on, stop.

571
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,799
Where's the bottle of liquor?
Where did you hide it?

572
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,093
I don't know.

573
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,056
You're always lying.

574
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,977
Why do all men do that?

575
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,313
I have nothing more to say.

576
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,817
This liar is going to leave now.

577
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,527
They're worse than animals.

578
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,865
Men who betray women are absolute trash.

579
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,743
They're foul and repulsive.

580
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,621
They make me sick to my stomach.

581
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,331
What?

582
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,583
We've been here for how long?

583
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,710
When their partner is out of sight,

584
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,505
do men just toss aside
their faith, loyalty, and trust?

585
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,049
Are they just mammals
that throw everything away

586
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,760
when they take off their pants?

587
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,138
Do men just like any woman they meet?

588
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,432
Please stop.

589
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,061
I get it, okay?

590
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,979
Turning me down is one thing,

591
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,023
but aren't you being a little harsh?

592
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,901
Do you actually want to see me
die of embarrassment?

593
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,737
Should I show you how
to die in space from humiliation?

594
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,990
Being classified as a mammal alongside men

595
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,326
is absolutely mortifying for me.

596
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,036
That's all.

597
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,123
Yes, I am a mammal!

598
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,127
What?

599
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,672
What?

600
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,012
CHIEF KANG TAE-HUI

601
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,940
Seriously…

602
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,730
Hi.

603
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,940
<i>Hey, you called.</i>

604
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,108
<i>What's up?</i>

605
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,237
Is something wrong? Why did you call?

606
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,498
<i>I think there's booze onboard.</i>

607
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,790
At the space station?

608
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,334
Who's the culprit?

609
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:38,545
<i>Do you think Mr. Gong took it up there?</i>

610
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,505
<i>Is it soju?</i>

611
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,048
<i>Whisky? Cognac?</i>

612
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,467
Lee Seung-jun…

613
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,052
It's Santi, right?

614
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,096
I haven't found the bottle.
They're denying it.

615
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,058
When I wanted
to install a camera in every module,

616
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,019
they complained about their human rights.
Now I know why.

617
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,939
<i>Do whatever it takes</i>
<i>to find evidence, okay?</i>

618
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,108
<i>If you can't control them from the start,</i>
<i>the entire year will be hell.</i>

619
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,944
<i>If they conduct experiments in secret,</i>

620
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,196
disobey orders,
shift the blame onto others,

621
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,157
and ignore the manual,
it will quickly become chaos.

622
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,661
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>when I first took command,</i>

623
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,996
<i>I caught someone drinking alcohol</i>
<i>they had hidden.</i>

624
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,374
Sometimes, the experienced ones

625
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,001
think they have the right
to overstep boundaries.

626
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,338
<i>In cases like that, don't hesitate.</i>
<i>Report it immediately.</i>

627
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,465
After they were disciplined,
had their pay cut,

628
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,052
<i>and were passed over for promotions,</i>
<i>they fell in line real quick.</i>

629
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,680
<i>After that,</i>
<i>being commander was a piece of cake.</i>

630
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,225
Right.

631
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,435
They obviously hid it
in the observation module.

632
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,937
Search every inch of it.

633
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,022
I will.

634
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,835
What? Mammal?

635
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,087
What was that about?

636
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,199
DR. NA MIN-JEONG

637
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,285
Hi, Dr. Na.

638
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,955
<i>I have the eggs and sperm,</i>
<i>and I found an incubator.</i>

639
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,876
If I work on it tonight, they should be
morulas by the time I leave.

640
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,462
Don't worry.
You just take care of your health.

641
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,756
<i>Don't do it.</i>

642
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,507
What?

643
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,302
Dr. Kang Kang-su can take over.

644
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,931
What are you talking about?

645
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,559
I changed my mind.

646
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,519
If you get caught, you'll be in danger.

647
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,482
Don't worry about me. I can get this done.

648
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,816
<i>If you get caught,</i>

649
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,319
it could jeopardize Dr. Kang's work.

650
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,530
<i>I've got to go.</i>

651
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,325
Wait, Dr. Na?

652
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,258
DR. GONG RYONG

653
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,810
MISSED CALL

654
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,987
I want to go home.

655
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,296
Yes!

656
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,101
KANG KANG-SU

657
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,605
Hey, Kang-su.

658
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,857
Sir, this is going to make you happy.

659
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,485
All seven of them

660
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,571
have undergone cell division
and developed into morulas.

661
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,364
<i>They are ready to be implanted.</i>

662
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,950
It's done.

663
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,745
Now we just have to freeze them
and take them back to Earth.

664
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,830
Congratulations, sir.

665
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,209
Lee!

666
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,003
Yes, sir.

667
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,549
I want you to take a picture
of my grandchildren right now.

668
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,886
Take their picture
and send them to me immediately.

669
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:38,887
I'm sorry?

670
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,808
I have to be the first
to see my grandchildren.

671
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,518
Do it right now!

672
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,104
We did it. It's done.

673
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,191
Yes, sir. Please give me a second.

674
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:55,028
From one to seven,
don't leave a single one out.

675
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,238
Do it now!

676
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,325
- Gather everyone.
- Yes, sir.

677
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,539
- Sir.
- Chairman Choi, you're here.

678
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,584
Who wants some fried chicken?

679
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,473
The first one…

680
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,435
A son.

681
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,865
The second…

682
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,451
A daughter.

683
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,043
Where is Santi?

684
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,545
Is he in the observation module?

685
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,798
He's not there.

686
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,259
Then he's in the observation module.

687
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,387
You lie every time you open your mouth.

688
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,933
I told you, I drank it by myself.

689
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,896
He should be collecting
a sample right about now.

690
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,482
Let's see if I'm right.

691
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,952
The sixth is a daughter.

692
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,751
And the youngest is a son.

693
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,754
Santi!

694
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,673
Commander.

695
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,009
Santi.

696
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:08,263
Commander, I'm the only one
you need to punish.

697
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,015
Santi doesn't know anything, I swear.

698
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:11,808
He's done already?

699
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,104
Where is he?

700
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,982
Come on, Commander.

701
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,527
Sir, I finished taking their pictures.

702
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:26,197
I'm sending you pictures of all seven
of your grandchildren right now.

703
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,333
I did it.

704
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:42,255
I told you, Santi has no idea.
He's innocent.

705
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,299
Stop lying, and stop following me.

706
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,760
Is Santi here?

707
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,429
Santi? Why?

708
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,848
Dr. Kang, are you hiding Santi here?

709
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,186
Dr. Kang.

710
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,688
I think they were drinking together.

711
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,899
Wait.

712
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,817
These are the wrong settings.

713
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:06,237
It's set to 37 degrees, 5% oxygen.

714
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,825
Won't the fruit flies die from the heat?

715
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,914
I'm doing a cell comparison.

716
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:20,085
I'm simultaneously investigating
both damaged human genes

717
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,795
and aging fruit fly genes.

718
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:27,217
Wait, didn't we agree
to share that information last time?

719
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,219
Why are you looking for Santi here?

720
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,054
Isn't this…

721
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,689
What is that picture?

722
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,405
Isn't it obvious?

723
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,493
It's an image of a fruit fly embryo
undergoing cell division.

724
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,247
The scale indicates
a measurement of 0.2 mm.

725
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,583
At 0.2 mm,
that's more the size of a human embryo…

726
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,101
Is that a morula?

727
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,108
A morula?

728
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,278
- Why is there a morula--
- Commander.

729
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,008
Did you fertilize that here?

730
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,636
You've been lying to us,
pretending to work on fruit flies.

731
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,015
You set the incubator
to 37 degrees and 5% oxygen

732
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,601
to culture human cells?

733
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,732
Commander, wait a minute, that--

734
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,733
Let go of me.

735
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,276
Dr. Kang.

736
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:13,281
Until now, no human egg
has ever been sent into space.

737
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,492
Because it's forbidden.

738
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,995
It's wrong to experiment
on humans, correct?

739
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,957
You of all people know
what we do to mice and fruit flies.

740
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,168
How could you do this
with human sperm and eggs…

741
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,462
You know it's against space law,

742
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,924
so how could you perform an ICSI?

743
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,010
Dr. Kang, have you lost it?

744
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,181
Do you think this is no different
from our countless other experiments?

745
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,684
You know why this is banned.

746
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,437
How could you even think about

747
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,565
creating a human being at a space station?

748
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,108
Eve, calm down.

749
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,321
Open that door.

750
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,369
Are you crazy?

751
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,955
Open it now.

752
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,958
Open the incubator door this instant.

753
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,338
Open the incubator door
before I bust it open.

754
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,266
Open it before I blow the door off,
you bastard!

755
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,787
GUEST APPEARANCE BY BAIK JI-WON

756
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,973
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

757
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,643
<i>Just how did you bring the eggs</i>
<i>to the space station?</i>

758
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,605
- Did you get caught?
- I'm sorry.

759
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,899
<i>He's probably over his mate</i>
<i>back on Earth by now.</i>

760
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,071
<i>I have to succeed tonight, no matter what.</i>

761
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,616
Ryong will listen to you.

762
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,035
<i>We should give up.</i>

763
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,537
I'll turn a blind eye
to the lottery ticket,

764
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,582
<i>if you guys will turn a blind eye</i>
<i>to what I'm about to do.</i>

765
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,126
<i>Facing those risks</i>

766
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,128
is the fate this life-form was born with.

767
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,256
<i>This is all a result of my negligence.</i>

768
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,009
<i>I will take responsibility and step down.</i>

769
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:44,182
