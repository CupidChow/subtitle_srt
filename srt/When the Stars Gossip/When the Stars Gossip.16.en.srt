1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,294
<i>The baby's heart rate is too fast.</i>

3
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>Please get back to me as soon as possible.</i>

4
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,071
GONG RYONG

5
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,294
Mr. Gong?

6
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,507
The ultrasound.

7
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,552
What is this?

8
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,595
Why did you send it to Yi-man?

9
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,474
Is it okay for the baby's heart
to beat so fast?

10
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,230
The heartbeat of a fetus can be irregular.

11
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,815
<i>It's at 180 bpm now,</i>

12
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,025
<i>so it's fine</i>
<i>as long as it doesn't go higher.</i>

13
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,152
<i>Don't worry.</i>

14
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,155
I see.

15
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,242
Eve.

16
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,912
Is the baby…

17
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,918
From when we were in space.

18
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,130
You're the father.

19
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,829
I'll come to you.

20
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,753
Okay.

21
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,217
Get here soon. I miss you.

22
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,013
Okay.

23
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,089
Hey, are you smiling or crying?

24
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,309
You haven't paid the fine,

25
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,521
lost your medical license,

26
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,356
and got a two-year sentence.

27
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,568
Look, the IOU or the KSA

28
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,696
would never send you
to space again, so how…

29
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,577
I should go.

30
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,511
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

31
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,389
What is it? Is something going on?

32
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,017
<i>Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.</i>

33
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,935
<i>I only found out a few days ago myself.</i>

34
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,853
What is it?

35
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,734
I'm 12 weeks pregnant.

36
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,452
Wait, what are you talking about?

37
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,786
That's absurd.

38
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,955
<i>It's true.</i>

39
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,754
<i>The baby is healthy.</i>

40
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,092
Who's the father?

41
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,429
It's Mr. Gong Ryong.

42
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,848
It happened here.

43
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,401
The baby will die if I go back to Earth.

44
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,445
Please let me stay.

45
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,863
I'll have the baby here.

46
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,239
- Eve.
- Eve.

47
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,407
Are you insane?

48
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,660
You know you could die
trying to have the baby there!

49
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,330
No one has ever done that before,
not even the mice!

50
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,748
Do you have a death wish?

51
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,416
Chief.

52
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,877
Look, I want to live.

53
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,338
Dong-a,
I'm not trying to get myself killed.

54
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,466
I disposed of the morula.

55
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,468
If I give up this baby too,

56
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,179
I won't be able to live.

57
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,850
I still can't forgive my mother.

58
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,813
I tried, but I can't.
She did abandon me after all.

59
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,776
I'm not going to give up
on this baby's life or my own.

60
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,029
Because of this baby,

61
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,615
I really, desperately…

62
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,246
want to live a long, healthy life.
More than I ever did.

63
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,877
<i>Dr. Ma, Chief, Dong-a,</i>
<i>I need your help, okay?</i>

64
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,379
Help me.

65
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,590
You will stand by for departure as planned
and wait for further orders.

66
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>Chief!</i>

67
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>Chief!</i>

68
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,387
<i>- Eve.</i>
<i>- Eve.</i>

69
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,763
<i>What's wrong?</i>

70
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,932
Eve, what's wrong?

71
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,892
- Eve, are you in pain?
- What's the matter?

72
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,061
<i>Chief! Eve!</i>

73
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,521
Eun-su, get Dona in here now.

74
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,731
Where's Dona?

75
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,191
Eve, are you all right?

76
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,490
<i>How the hell did you miss</i>
<i>that she was pregnant?</i>

77
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,535
She got a check-up at MZ Medical Center
when she was back in Seoul,

78
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,496
and another one in Houston
right before the launch.

79
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,206
How did…

80
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,752
She was here for less than three weeks.

81
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,923
<i>It may not show up on tests for 21 days.</i>
<i>She probably didn't know.</i>

82
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,219
<i>Who would've thought…</i>
<i>Eve couldn't have seen this coming.</i>

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,639
What do we do now?

84
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,686
The mom will be safe
coming back down, right?

85
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,147
Yeah, I think so.

86
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,358
We have to bring her back, okay?

87
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,945
I'm not an ob-gyn.

88
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,366
First, we need to find an ob-gyn
who's familiar with zero gravity.

89
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,328
Where the hell
are we going to find a doctor like that?

90
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,663
An ob-gyn who knows about

91
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,500
pregnancy in zero gravity
and has been to the space station?

92
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,960
We won't find anyone like that
anywhere in the world!

93
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,649
<i>No, absolutely not. We can't do that.</i>

94
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,901
<i>But nobody else will be willing to go!</i>

95
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,905
<i>Even the tourist can only stay there</i>
<i>for seven to ten days at most.</i>

96
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,241
He'll have to skip the space training,
which means

97
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,702
he could lose his ability to walk
due to the aftereffects of zero gravity.

98
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,787
You know that.

99
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,084
There's only one person

100
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,629
who would be willing to risk their life.

101
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,215
The only fool who'd go knowing all this

102
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,800
is Mr. Gong Ryong.

103
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,931
NEW MESSAGE FROM LEE SEUNG-JUN

104
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,850
<i>Mr. Gong, Eve has abdominal pain.</i>

105
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,185
<i>Please check the ultrasound.</i>

106
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,107
We got Eve's ultrasound.

107
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,112
<i>Chief, Eve has been having abdominal pain.</i>

108
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>She even has some vaginal bleeding.</i>

109
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,615
<i>Take a look at her ultrasound.</i>

110
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,285
From this, I can't figure out the cause.

111
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,126
Eve's cervix appears to be short.

112
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,336
The lower part looks funnel-shaped.

113
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,589
I think it might be cervical incompetence,

114
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,841
but the ultrasound
wasn't done by a doctor.

115
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,843
To be sure,
I need a transvaginal ultrasound.

116
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,511
Let's have them do one right now.

117
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,972
No, that could put her in danger.

118
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,057
<i>We don't have much time!</i>

119
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,934
<i>- She's bleeding, Mr. Gong.</i>
- She's…

120
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,311
<i>She's bleeding?</i>

121
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,022
That means

122
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,983
her cervix is opening further
or something else is wrong.

123
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,695
A transvaginal ultrasound
must be done carefully.

124
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,032
Since the amniotic sac has descended,
rupturing it would be dangerous.

125
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,284
The fetus would also be at risk
if you touch it.

126
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,204
It'll result in a miscarriage,

127
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,832
and her bleeding will get worse.

128
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,584
She could get an infection
and go into shock.

129
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,960
Due to fluid loss in space,

130
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,212
minimal bleeding
can lead to hypovolemic shock.

131
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,339
She could die.

132
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>She's in no shape to return!</i>

133
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,342
<i>Even if she could,</i>

134
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,302
she'd never risk the baby's life.

135
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,803
Please don't let her die.

136
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,889
You idiots,
you think I'm trying to kill her?

137
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,726
She needs an ob-gyn

138
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,645
to figure out the exact cause

139
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,439
and stitch up her cervix
or do whatever it takes

140
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,899
to stop the bleeding.

141
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,068
You know
you can't do surgery in zero gravity.

142
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,778
You can do a McDonald cerclage.

143
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,071
A STITCH AROUND THE CERVIX

144
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,199
Chief, the only person
who's performed surgery in zero gravity

145
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,159
is Mr. Gong Ryong.

146
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,374
Chief.

147
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,918
Please let me go up there.

148
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,434
<i>I know the IOU</i>
<i>would never approve of this.</i>

149
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,272
I don't even have a medical license.

150
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
I still haven't paid the fine,

151
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,735
and I can't afford
to buy another space trip.

152
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,863
Please just sneak me onto the cargo ship
like a piece of baggage.

153
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,324
You'll be dead before you get there.

154
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,159
You hate me, don't you?

155
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,538
You think I deserve to die like that.

156
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,873
Put me on the ship with the mice.

157
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,209
With the fruit flies.

158
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,504
Please.

159
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,758
Please send me up there.

160
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,887
Please.

161
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,808
Please let me go and be by Eve's side.

162
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,103
I'm begging you. The two of them…

163
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,274
are my family now.

164
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,154
<i>He's the only doctor</i>
<i>who can help her here.</i>

165
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,822
<i>Please let him come!</i>

166
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,740
There's no time, Chief.

167
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,618
I'm begging you.

168
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,831
Please, I'm begging you.

169
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,632
We deeply regret for what happened.

170
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,134
There is no excuse.

171
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,928
And I also understand how ridiculous

172
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,389
it sounds to send a criminal
back to the space.

173
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,059
But before you brand him as a convict,

174
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,481
consider him as the only doctor
who can save a life up in space.

175
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,151
Give him a chance
to save our astronaut Eve.

176
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,988
If anyone can save life there,

177
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,032
it would be him.

178
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,208
Ryong!

179
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,375
Are you having lunch?

180
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,085
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.

181
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,170
Come sit.

182
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,137
- Mom.
- Yeah?

183
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,680
- Mom.
- What?

184
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,599
Mom!

185
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,059
What is it, silly?

186
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,311
I'm going somewhere far away.

187
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,521
Where?

188
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,563
For how long?

189
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,482
Well, I'll be back soon.

190
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,900
When is that?

191
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,401
I'll call you when I get there.

192
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,285
You ladies are really amazing.

193
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,788
You raised me, fed me,

194
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,414
and put me through school.

195
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,667
Wow, you're just so petty.

196
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,586
You made sure to skip over
the "giving birth" part.

197
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,964
- Geez.
- You could've thrown it in there.

198
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,344
Here.

199
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,515
Use this when you need it,
like when you're sick.

200
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,225
Please don't try to save money

201
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,477
and rely on painkillers
when you have issues.

202
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,895
What the heck are you saying?

203
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,314
Maybe he's talking all big
with an overdraft account.

204
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,317
TRANSACTION DETAILS

205
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,866
This is supposed to be your wedding fund.
Why are you giving it to us?

206
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,289
And for God's sake, stop drinking so much!

207
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,417
Hey, why are you being melodramatic
with all this stuff?

208
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,173
Thank you for being my mom.

209
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,928
I know it made your lives so much harder.

210
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,808
I love you.

211
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,270
You fool!

212
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,606
What are you… Where are you going?

213
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,316
How long will you be gone?

214
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,819
Come on, tell us.

215
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,615
Just get me some rice.

216
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,701
He wants rice.

217
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,454
- No, you can have mine. Here.
- Right, let's eat first.

218
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,705
Just half a bowl, okay?

219
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,874
- That's not enough. Here you go.
- Shush!

220
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,292
Hwa-ja, grill a mackerel!

221
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,878
- Get him some soup too.
- Right.

222
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,303
How's Eve?

223
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,305
Her bleeding won't stop,

224
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,932
and her cervix looks even shorter.

225
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,728
She's refusing to take painkillers
for the baby's sake,

226
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,271
so she's in more pain now.

227
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,899
<i>She might really have a miscarriage soon.</i>

228
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,735
<i>Her blood pressure is still rising.</i>

229
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,074
Okay, let's go. Hurry up.

230
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,450
What is your song request?

231
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,745
<i>Song request?</i>
<i>Are you fucking kidding me right now?</i>

232
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,288
Don't take that tone, asshole!

233
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,290
You have no right to say that!

234
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,752
You're lucky we're sending you to space
instead of jail.

235
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,170
Now, I'm not into this either.

236
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,048
But Eve is the only reason
we're doing this, motherfucker!

237
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,682
Liftoff.

238
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,392
Liftoff.

239
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,700
Hang in there, Eve.

240
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,576
He'll be here soon, okay?

241
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,954
He's coming.

242
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,721
- Dr. Lee.
- Go, hurry.

243
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,069
Thank you.

244
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,114
Eve.

245
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,367
There's no need to be scared.

246
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,162
You're okay.

247
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,764
You need a stitch.

248
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,392
You've been bleeding
because of cervical incompetence.

249
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,899
I brought the needle this time
for the anesthesia.

250
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,448
It's just stitching your cervix
to keep the fetus in place.

251
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,744
I'm closing it so it can support
the growing uterus. It's simple.

252
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,537
It's simple?

253
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,331
Yeah, it won't take long.

254
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,957
Are you sure about that?

255
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,753
You said that
when you stitched up my toes.

256
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,171
Liar.

257
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,841
You know that all doctors are liars.

258
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,886
Are you ready?

259
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,559
I'll start now, okay?

260
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,770
Let's get started.

261
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,492
I've been watching her overnight.

262
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,578
She no longer has any abdominal pain
or anesthesia-induced headache.

263
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,705
Her BP is good,
and the bleeding has stopped.

264
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,624
Everything looks good.

265
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,417
Good work.

266
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,378
- Is everyone at the station asleep?
- Yeah.

267
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,256
You two should go get some rest.

268
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,309
You made sure to give Mr. Gong
a clear warning, right?

269
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,562
Yeah.

270
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,262
Did you sleep okay?

271
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,556
Yes, Commander.

272
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,809
How are you feeling?

273
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,478
I'm not the commander anymore.

274
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,106
You'll always be my commander, all right?

275
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,775
Are you feeling okay?

276
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,194
Yeah, I feel much better.

277
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,614
I'm glad.

278
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,742
You and I

279
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,993
now have Byeol.

280
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,620
"Byeol"?

281
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,332
Yeah, that's our baby's name.

282
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,336
It means "star."
It was conceived here in space.

283
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,174
But you named
Public and Indecency's baby "Star."

284
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,635
You don't like the name?

285
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,846
I'm not sure.

286
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,641
Because they're fruit flies?

287
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,975
No.

288
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,060
Then what?

289
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,813
It's nothing.

290
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,527
Oh, when will I start
to feel the baby move?

291
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,696
From around 20 weeks.

292
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,323
- Twenty weeks?
- Yeah.

293
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,580
I thought about you here every day
while reading the obstetrics book,

294
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,709
wondering how you knew
I was going to need it.

295
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,381
The part you carved out to hide the liquor

296
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,677
happened to be about
14 to 15 weeks of pregnancy.

297
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,846
But by the 13th week,

298
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,642
a walking obstetrics book showed up

299
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,061
right in front of me.

300
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,611
Do you think

301
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,741
the day will come when I can have
a drop of that liquor after giving birth?

302
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,079
It'll come, right?

303
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,543
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

304
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,177
<i>You're not an astronaut.</i>

305
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,762
You need to be clear about that.

306
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,390
You'll be going into space
without proper training,

307
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,850
and because of zero gravity,

308
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,643
you may lose your ability to walk.

309
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,063
The longer you stay there, the more
blood flow increases to your eyes,

310
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,108
causing your retina to thicken.
That could lead to vision loss.

311
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,027
You cannot stay there for too long.

312
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,863
The longer you do,

313
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,781
the greater the risk for you.

314
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,659
Your job

315
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,620
is to come back with Eve straight away.

316
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,080
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

317
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:25,052
Seriously. I told them
to leave this unplugged for a while.

318
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,305
It's so hot.

319
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,974
I need to adjust the thermostat again.

320
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,605
Eve.

321
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,149
Aren't you hot? Is it just me?

322
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,784
I'm not hot.

323
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,661
Well, I am.

324
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,457
Listen, Mr. Tourist.

325
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,793
You should head back down now.

326
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,337
It's dangerous for you to stay here.

327
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,713
I'm fine now.

328
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,344
You'll be my doctor from Earth, right?

329
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,431
Just come back for the delivery, okay?

330
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,314
Come with me.

331
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,655
I'm here to take you back.

332
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,990
We can have a baby next time.

333
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,286
Once the mouse pregnancy
and birth are successful

334
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,748
and it's proven to be safe.
We can do it then.

335
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,419
We didn't think this through.

336
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,548
I'm taking you back with me.

337
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,858
They're ready for our emergency landing.

338
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,821
Come with me.

339
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,409
I can't believe you're saying this.

340
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,870
You can't stay here.

341
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,913
You know why.

342
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,041
So you want to kill your own baby?

343
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,673
What if something goes wrong?

344
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,384
What if you need a C-section?

345
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,805
The moment I cut you open,
your organs will spill and float around.

346
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,225
Because of surface tension,
your blood will stick to the instruments.

347
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,145
It'll spread all over the room.

348
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,898
I can't perform surgery
or a C-section here,

349
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,107
so there's nothing…

350
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,822
It's too dangerous for you.

351
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,994
Why do you keep assuming
it's going to go wrong?

352
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,039
If there's even a 5% chance you'll die…

353
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,335
No, even if it's just 1%,
I'm not putting you at risk.

354
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,841
If you're not going, I'm not going.

355
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,759
What?

356
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,761
I'm not leaving without you.

357
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,680
You can only stay here
for seven to ten days at most.

358
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,641
How would you keep working as a doctor

359
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,768
if you can't walk anymore or go blind?

360
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,603
So come with me.

361
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,104
And let our baby die?

362
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,446
You're not letting it die.

363
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,325
I am.

364
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,911
Think of it that way.

365
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,998
That's the same thing.
What are you saying?

366
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,545
A lot of people
have natural births on Earth.

367
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,923
Can't you just trust me?

368
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,549
Come on, we can have another baby.

369
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,718
That baby won't be the same as this one!

370
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,514
This baby is going to die!

371
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,058
For God's sake!

372
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,352
Stop…

373
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,481
Stop saying it's going to die.

374
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,650
Look, I…

375
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,612
I want to protect our baby too.

376
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,781
But…

377
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,077
I have to protect you first.
That's more important to me.

378
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,299
If you stay here any longer,

379
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,427
it'll be too dangerous to go back.

380
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,221
You need to come with me now.

381
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,519
You can keep an eye on me from Earth,

382
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,689
get your astronaut training,

383
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,400
and come back for the delivery.
Why can't we just do that?

384
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,698
Am I…

385
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,621
Am I still just a tourist to you?

386
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,334
How do you expect me
to just drop in for a week like a tourist

387
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,920
when my wife and baby
are fighting to survive?

388
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,302
You're telling me to just come
as your doctor to help with the delivery.

389
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,764
You're so damn stubborn, Commander.

390
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,517
I've never told anyone

391
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,561
that they should
give up on their babies until now.

392
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,356
It's our baby, and I…

393
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,152
hate to do this too.

394
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,992
Fine.

395
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,577
You can stay.

396
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,622
I'll stay with you.

397
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,666
Whatever happens,

398
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,877
let's see this through.

399
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,131
I'll be here for my wife and baby
every step of the way.

400
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,424
Are you out of your mind?

401
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,678
Both the baby and I will make it.

402
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,183
Why are you trying to ruin your life here?

403
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,519
Please just go back, okay?

404
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,770
No, listen to me. I…

405
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,608
You could die giving birth.
You're asking me to watch you die.

406
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,819
Would you leave if you were me?

407
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,662
Please go back, okay?

408
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,915
I'm not going anywhere without you.

409
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,627
If you're worried about my life,

410
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,255
you'll come with me.

411
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,125
Chief.

412
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,960
Eve agreed to return.

413
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:14,919
Really?

414
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,673
<i>The emergency landing site</i>
<i>is off the coast</i>

415
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,632

TO CHANGE ITS ORBIT FOR RE-ENTRY

420
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,113
<i>Santi, you've got the parachutes, right?</i>

421
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,907
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,492
<i>How's your headache, Eve?</i>

423
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,785
<i>Your BP is a bit high.</i>

424
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,914
Yeah, I'm fine.

425
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,290
<i>What about you, Mr. Gong?</i>

426
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,584
I'm good.

427
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,802
Is Ryong really coming back today?

428
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,679
Yeah, why would Yi-man lie to us?

429
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,556
Let's just clean the place quickly.

430
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,683
You do the bathroom. I'll do the kitchen.

431
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,101
Na-mi, open the windows.

432
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,771
Boy, where did he put the vacuum cleaner?

433
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,737
Keep an eye on Eve's vitals.

434
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,113
Yes, Chief.

435
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,741
All right.
You'll be back on Earth in eight hours.

436
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,159
- Copy.
- Copy.

437
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,244
Copy.

438
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,038
All right, then.
We're ready for your departure.

439
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,002
Go.

440
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,297
Initiating undocking sequence.

441
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,093
Unlocking, disengaging first lock.

442
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,932
<i>Undocking G.O-12,</i>

443
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,183
<i>T minus one minute.</i>

444
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,938
Disengaging second lock.

445
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,445
<i>Undocking completion, T minus 30 seconds.</i>

446
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,505
Eve, is everything okay?

447
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,598
Is their oxygen supply stable?
Their breathing seems uneven.

448
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,600
Their BP and pulse rates are all normal.

449
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,726
They're fine.

450
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,352
Okay.

451
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,354
G.O-12 has detached
from the space station.

452
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,826
We'll fire the engines
once you're 20 m away from the station.

453
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,164
What do we do?

454
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,749
Is it going to be okay?

455
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,252
It's okay, Eve.

456
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,380
Don't think about anything, okay?

457
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,477
Geez, how's he ever going to find
anything in this mess?

458
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,735

1988, CHRISTMAS EVE

465
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,434
You weren't abandoned
at Chuncheon Station, were you?

466
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,688
<i>It wasn't in a taxi, right?</i>

467
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,899
It wasn't in a taxi heading
to Chuncheon Station

468
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,194
on Christmas Eve,
the year the Olympics were held, was it?

469
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,116
1988, CHRISTMAS EVE

470
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,542
No, it wasn't.

471
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,624
<i>Eve's blood pressure</i>
<i>keeps going up, Chief.</i>

472
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,793
<i>What?</i>

473
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,976
Na-mi, what's wrong?

474
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,522
Why are you crying?

475
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,943
What kind of mother am I?

476
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,655
- Na-mi.
- Why are you crying, dummy?

477
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,743
Hwa-ja, I'm a complete idiot.

478
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,370
- Na-mi!
- What's the matter?

479
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,874
How could I not recognize her?

480
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,000
Na-mi.

481
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,463
<i>I don't deserve to be a mom.</i>

482
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,012
I'm sorry.

483
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,349
I'm sorry, my baby.

484
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,310
- Chief.
- What the hell happened?

485
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,812
She's never been like this.

486
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,360
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,611
Eve.

488
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,988
I'm sorry, my baby.

489
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,699
Eve, look at me.

490
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,868
<i>Her BP is too high.</i>

491
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,830
<i>She seems extremely anxious,</i>
<i>and her pulse is too fast.</i>

492
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,289
<i>Her blood vessels could burst.</i>

493
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,712
Eve, try to calm down.

494
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,091
<i>Guys, there's something wrong with Eve.</i>

495
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,676
Santi, take off her helmet.

496
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,386
Take her helmet off and check the pupils.

497
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,096
I'm on it. Hold on.

498
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,474
Eve, can you see me?

499
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,892
Eve! Look at me!

500
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,894
Look at me! Can you see me?

501
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,064
Her pupils are dilated!

502
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,566
Eve!

503
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,734
How many fingers am I holding up? Huh?

504
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,279
Eve! Can you see me?
How many fingers am I holding up?

505
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,697
Three.

506
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,906
Three?

507
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,200
<i>Double vision.</i>
<i>It might be cerebral hemorrhage.</i>

508
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,244
<i>She'll die at this rate.</i>

509
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,871
<i>- We need to stop.</i>
- Guys, we need to go back!

510
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,997
We need to go back!

511
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,582
Eve.

512
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,375
Now!

513
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:10,918
Now!

514
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,628
<i>Santi, steer back</i>
<i>to the station right now.</i>

515
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,921
<i>- She needs medication.</i>
<i>- Eve!</i>

516
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,423
You're okay.

517
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,757
<i>- Calm down.</i>
- You'll be okay.

518
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,759
<i>Eve.</i>

519
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,761
<i>Take deep breaths.</i>

520
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,649
3 MONTHS LATER

521
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,276
PASSENGER TERMINAL 2

522
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,260
Going somewhere?

523
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,304
It's none of your business.

524
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,848
I just got back to Seoul,
so where are you going?

525
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,683
Mr. Go.

526
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,060
Wait for me.

527
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,231
Can I go to the restroom? Excuse me.

528
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,982
Hey!

529
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,866
Don't you have anything better to do?
You have a job.

530
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,329
Is Ryong having a boy or a girl?

531
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,958
A boy or a girl?

532
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,043
How should I know?

533
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,671
We should try for a baby again, too.

534
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,178
Ryong will make it possible
for you to have kids.

535
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,597
Are you crazy?

536
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,726
Just you wait.

537
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,189
He will make it possible
for you to have kids.

538
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,360
Wow, he must be crazy.

539
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,906
Ms. Ji Hwa-ja, Jang Mi-hwa,
and Jeong Na-mi?

540
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,408
- Yes!
- Yes, we're here.

541
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,993
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

542
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,957
What are you all doing here together?

543
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,125
Is something wrong?

544
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,254
I hear she'll need a lot of blood
during delivery.

545
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,174
Send my blood up to the space station.

546
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,010
We're all type A.

547
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,554
- Send mine up there too.
- Mine too.

548
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,057
No, you guys are anemic. I can't.

549
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,809
No, Yi-man.

550
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,022
We don't drink anymore,
and we've quit smoking.

551
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,189
We have.

552
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,151
We want you to do it. We're scared.

553
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,279
Why are you scared?
It's nothing to be scared of.

554
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,991
Well, it'd make Ryong happy, though.

555
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,702
But you can't do it, Na-mi.

556
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,412
Why not?

557
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,290
Because if your blood enters Eve's body,

558
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:58,419
there's a chance the immune cells
in your blood could attack Eve's tissues.

559
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,714
The biological mother can't be a donor.

560
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,594
That's absurd.

561
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,263
Come on, how could that be?

562
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,932
I mean, why can't I…

563
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,476
Are you saying

564
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,356
I can't even do this one thing
for my daughter?

565
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,233
- Don't cry.
- Na-mi, don't do this again.

566
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,236
Hey, Ryong is going to come back soon

567
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,490
with his wife and baby, right?

568
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,533
You're really a mom now,

569
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,327
and we're all grandmas.

570
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,329
Once they're here, you can do anything.

571
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,622
Am I right?

572
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,248
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

573
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,584
That's right. Let's just think

574
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,129
that they're on
a really long honeymoon to space,

575
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,756
that they even made a baby there,

576
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,094
and they'll come back to us together,
all three of them.

577
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,721
- Right? Isn't that true?
- Yeah.

578
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,223
But still…

579
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,059
- Come on now. Stop crying.
- Come on.

580
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,771
ONE WEEK
BEFORE EVE'S DUE DATE

581
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,754
One, two, three, four,

582
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,674
five, six, seven, eight…

583
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,135
Good. A little more gently
in sync with the breathing.

584
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,011
- Okay.
- Santi, very good.

585
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,638
- Is the suction working well?
- Yes.

586
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:39,395
Okay, good. Let's try this one more time.

587
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,938
All right.

588
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,945
The baby's blood pressure
and heart are both good,

589
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,739
and there are no deformities
from the radiation so far.

590
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,118
It's growing well
with a very strong will to survive.

591
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,203
We're in the final stretch.

592
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,582
<i>We've also upgraded</i>
<i>the medical module system to ensure</i>

593
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,209
complete protection
from any space bacteria or viruses.

594
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,045
<i>You won't need to worry about infections</i>

595
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,881
<i>with any type of patients up here now.</i>

596
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,424
Good.

597
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,635
We've magnetized all surgical instruments
with Mr. Gong as well,

598
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,929
so they won't be floating around anymore.

599
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,474
Okay. What about bleeding control?

600
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,726
<i>Dr. Mina Lee will handle suction.</i>

601
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,519
Okay.

602
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,397
Mr. Gong has figured out
a steady surgical position.

603
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,151
Eve has been working out a lot as well,
so her bone density looks good too.

604
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,696
The X-ray machine was a no-go, right?

605
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,283
No, I don't think we can send up
either X-ray or MRI this time.

606
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,746
Surgical procedures could've been possible
if we had a little more time.

607
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,208
Her BP, bone density,
everything looks good.

608
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,627
She seems strong enough
to handle a natural birth.

609
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,545
She just can't break any bones.

610
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,382
Don't let her push too hard.

611
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,431
All right! She's been doing great.

612
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,183
She's going to do great, right?

613
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,106
- What?
- What's going on?

614
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,732
What's the problem?

615
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,858
Go check.

616
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,034
She still has a few more days to go!

617
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,042
Her BP is up by 10,
cardiac output increased by 10%.

618
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,462
Santi, give her an IV and antibiotics.

619
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,422
Will do.

620
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,226
Eve, you can scream if it hurts.
Don't hold back, okay?

621
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,945
<i>Keep breathing.</i>

622
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,788
You will

623
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,584
go back to Earth right after this, okay?

624
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,506
As soon as the baby is born,

625
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,134
you're leaving. Got it?

626
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,802
The contractions have started.

627
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,095
You never kept your word.

628
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,847
Once the baby is born,

629
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,559
you'll switch with another ob-gyn. Okay?

630
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,394
All right.

631
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,296
You're fully dilated.

632
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,341
When you feel the contraction,
hold your breath

633
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,176
and push, okay?

634
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,302
Let's try it.

635
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,638
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

636
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,139
Push!

637
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,731
Good.

638
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,900
You're doing great.

639
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,193
Suction.

640
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,319
Again.

641
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,906
Keep your head up as you push.
One, two, three.

642
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,157
Push!

643
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,957
- You left the humidifier on, right?
- Yeah.

644
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,419
- Be careful with her head.
- No, wait! Hold on.

645
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,548
Why is she coughing? What's wrong?

646
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,800
- She's coughing?
- I think so. Hang on.

647
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,677
Oh, she peed.

648
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,143
Good girl.

649
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,608
Eve, you need to feed her.

650
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,652
Just go get the formula. I'll feed her.

651
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,862
Can't you get it?

652
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,530
Come on, get up.

653
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,993
I'll go get your bottle.

654
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,290
I know, just hold on.

655
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,338
Byeol, when do you think
Mommy will be back?

656
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,340
- Come on, stand up.
- Hold your legs up.

657
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,509
Come on. Hold onto that.

658
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,970
Oh, I'm going to let go, okay?

659
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,306
Is she standing up?
I'm going to let go now.

660
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,393
Byeol!

661
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,703
With Daddy.

662
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,497
You want to come with Mommy to space?

663
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,880
Eve.

664
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,928
You're a mom now.

665
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,314
Great job, Eve.

666
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,656
Thank you all

667
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,951
for everything you've done for me.

668
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,124
You did great.

669
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,084
Get some rest.

670
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,507
Yes!

671
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,387
Oh, my God!

672
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,325
She's so tiny.

673
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,675
Look, guys.

674
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,470
Let's go get everything ready

675
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,805
and clean up the stuff.

676
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,015
Santi.

677
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,900
She's beautiful.

678
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,491
You should get some rest now, okay?
The baby needs to rest too.

679
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,335
What is it? Is something wrong?

680
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,419
No.

681
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,673
It's nothing. I'm fine.

682
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,677
Are you sure?

683
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,887
Yeah, I'm fine.

684
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,279
<i>Just don't break any bones.</i>

685
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,990
<i>If you break your pelvic bone,</i>
<i>that'll be it.</i>

686
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:13,927
You know…

687
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,681
I really want a drink.

688
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,934
What? Already?

689
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,853
I can't have one?

690
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,689
No, you should wait.

691
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,065
Come on, really?

692
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,112
Having a drink with you right now
would make me so happy.

693
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,114
Please?

694
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,284
Please?

695
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,205
Hold on a second.

696
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,631
Your blood pressure is normal,
and everything else looks good.

697
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,717
The contractions
are progressing well, and…

698
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,137
There's no sign of postpartum bleeding.

699
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:08,190
Listen, when will the pain meds wear off?

700
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,609
Soon.

701
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,070
Why? Do you feel nauseous?

702
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,283
Hey, come here.

703
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,219
You're a dad now.

704
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,389
Yeah.

705
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,978
You said you could never deliver
your own baby.

706
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,397
Congratulations.

707
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,241
Why do you look like that?

708
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,661
You look sad. Why?

709
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,623
No, I'm just overwhelmed.

710
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,375
All right.

711
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,586
I'll be right back, okay?

712
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,695
<i>If your pelvis breaks,</i>

713
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,947
<i>it'll tear your blood vessels</i>
<i>and cause bleeding.</i>

714
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,783
<i>They won't be able to operate.</i>

715
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,868
<i>It'll be the end.</i>

716
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,912
<i>So whatever you do, don't push too hard.</i>

717
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,430
She's beautiful.

718
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,433
Just one drop, okay?

719
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,614
No, forget it.

720
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,618
- I changed my mind.
- Hey, you can't take it away from me now.

721
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,370
What's the matter?

722
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,956
You should rest up
and eat something first.

723
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,749
You can have it after that, okay?

724
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,585
After that, it's all yours.

725
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,591
Fine.

726
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,351
Hey.

727
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,187
I'm getting a little sleepy.

728
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,523
Sure, go ahead and sleep.

729
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,692
It'll be good for you.

730
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,903
But I don't want to sleep.

731
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,990
I don't want to waste any time.

732
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,742
You're not wasting time.

733
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,788
Sleep is like the best medicine for you
right now. You need it.

734
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,967
But I don't want to.

735
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,446
Don't go anywhere, okay?

736
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:08,948
Okay.

737
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,702
You'll stay with me while I sleep, right?

738
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,120
Of course.

739
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,548
I miss you already.

740
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,343
Who? Me?

741
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:30,929
Or Byeol?

742
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,186
Both of you.

743
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,439
You can be with us all you want
once you get some sleep.

744
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,494
Thank you.

745
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,624
I should thank you.

746
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,461
1 YEAR LATER

747
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,004
MZ FERTILITY CLINIC
OPENING CEREMONY

748
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,173
PRESS CONFERENCE
FOR THE NEW SPACE FERTILITY CLINIC

749
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,186
At the space station,

750
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,646
an ob-gyn clinic is opening.

751
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,690
A space fertility clinic that will tackle

752
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,611
infertility in zero gravity,
which we couldn't do on Earth.

753
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,782
It's become a reality
with MZ Group's support and my efforts.

754
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,994
And our beloved Byeol,
the first to be born in space,

755
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,081
will be celebrating her first birthday

756
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,457
surrounded by all our love.

757
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:10,171
Her first birthday party will be held
in the space station's biological module,

758
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,006
and I'm inviting all of you…

759
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,551
Actually, I'm inviting
everyone on Earth to join us.

760
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,094
It's just that

761
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,388
you'll need to cover
your own travel expenses.

762
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,639
No discounts.

763
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,562
When will Byeol
be able to come down to Earth?

764
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:28,898
I think your question

765
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,360
will be better answered by those two,

766
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,696
since they'll be going
to the space station soon.

767
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,073
Chief Kang,

768
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:38,992
I wanted to ask you too.

769
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,494
When will the two of them be here?

770
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,083
It's been a year and seven months
since Mr. Gong Ryong left Earth.

771
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,961
It's the longest anyone
has ever been in space.

772
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,172
While other astronauts
have rotated in and out,

773
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,342
he has insisted on
staying on the space station

774
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,720
as both a doctor and a father.

775
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,431
This is because
Byeol has an underdeveloped heart

776
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,433
and low bone density and muscle mass,

777
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,478
since there's less strain on the heart
and less muscle use in zero gravity.

778
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,397
His persistence

779
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,024
has brought us closer to the moment

780
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,401
when he and Byeol
will finally step back on Earth.

781
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,028
Please support them until then.

782
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,615
Thank you, Chief Kang Tae-hui.

783
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,952
With the establishment
of the space fertility clinic,

784
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,204
a new era has begun

785
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,665
where anyone who wants to
have children can now do so.

786
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,753
Now, no one will ever be
unable to have children

787
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,505
because of Earth's environment,
their limitations,

788
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,674
health issues, or lack of money.

789
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,846
Mr. Gong will lead the way in space,
while I will lead on Earth.

790
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,807
He with his expertise,

791
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,310
and I with my money.

792
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,938
Together, we'll work
to protect the value of life.

793
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,567
How did you raise
one trillion won in funds?

794
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,943
Right, it's all my own money.

795
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,739
I made 500 billion purely by luck,

796
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,492
then invested it in stocks
and made another 500 billion.

797
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,369
CEO Choi Go-eun.

798
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,245
How about a clap?

799
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,184
I did something good. Give me some credit.

800
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:35,983
I love you.

801
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,278
Marry me.

802
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,075
I want to have

803
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,202
kids with you too.

804
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,342
Let's have children, everyone on Earth!

805
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,303
Otherwise, our planet is doomed!

806
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,596
When is the wedding?

807
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,140
Did you just propose to her?

808
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,474
Please tell us.

809
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,445
<i>What once seemed impossible,</i>

810
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,530
<i>mammalian pregnancy and childbirth…</i>

811
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,533
<i>The birth of Byeol has not only</i>
<i>solved the infertility issues</i>

812
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,535
<i>but also opened up</i>
<i>possibilities for humans…</i>

813
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,080
<i>Dr. Gong Ryong</i>
<i>still remains on the space station</i>

814
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,666
<i>to ensure the lives</i>
<i>that began in zero gravity</i>

815
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,253
<i>can live healthily on Earth,</i>
<i>overcoming the challenges of gravity.</i>

816
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,047
Abnormal sperm numbers 3, 5, and 9.

817
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,050
Their genetic defects
can be fixed in zero gravity.

818
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:47,054
Now, other desperate people
can have children as well.

819
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,766
<i>Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?</i>

820
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,559
<i>Take it easy. You have a child.</i>

821
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,145
When you have a kid, you'll see.

822
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,230
You never get tired.

823
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:25,843
Byeol.

824
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,602
Byeol.

825
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,940
Do you see that blue planet over there?

826
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,651
That's Mom and Dad's home.

827
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,199
Don't you want to go?

828
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,046
Mr. Gong, you have to go back now.

829
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,590
The damage to your organs,
eyes, and muscles

830
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,634
has all become fatal.

831
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,803
Zero gravity is threatening your life now.

832
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,930
You're at your limit.

833
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,182
You need to come with us.

834
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:18,062
Until I figure out how to get Byeol
on the spaceship,

835
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,814
I'm not leaving.

836
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,652
I'm going to find a way
to take her with me.

837
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,714
Byeol!

838
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,049
You're here!

839
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,804
Did you sleep well? Say, "Auntie."

840
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:52,847
Byeol.

841
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,766
- Who's that?
- Say, "Uncle."

842
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,393
No, you like me better, right?

843
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,020
"Uncle."

844
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,189
- Can you say, "Uncle"?
- You just burped, right?

845
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,150
Come on, people.

846
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,819
Her first word should be "mommy,"
not "auntie" or "uncle."

847
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:07,904
Am I right, Byeol?

848
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,739
Can you say, "Mommy"?

849
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,408
- Gotcha!
- Oh, that's a good girl.

850
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,910
I'm going to tickle you!

851
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,593
<i>After Byeol was born,</i>

852
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,930
<i>Eve stayed with us for one more day</i>
<i>before she passed.</i>

853
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,516
Byeol, come to Uncle.

854
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,812
Easy.

855
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,522
Oh, look at you.

856
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,154
Look at you.

857
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,781
Look at this, Byeol.

858
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,908
They're yellow.

859
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,785
They're beautiful, right?

860
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:57,536
Let's go see the rice.

861
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,915
<i>That day, she kissed Byeol's feet</i>

862
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,249
<i>at least a hundred times.</i>

863
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,878
<i>That day, she apologized</i>

864
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,131
<i>to everyone at MCC over and over again.</i>

865
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,343
<i>That day, she joked about</i>

866
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,973
<i>how I should die instead of her.</i>

867
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,646
<i>That one day with her</i>

868
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,482
<i>felt so long.</i>

869
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,653
<i>Eve did so much before she passed.</i>

870
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,782
<i>The space was both a womb</i>

871
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,159
<i>and a tomb for her.</i>

872
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,615
<i>Goodbye, Eve.</i>

873
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,410
<i>I'll see you again.</i>

874
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:46,645
<i>Dear Byeol.</i>

875
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,690
<i>Once you come to this vast space</i>

876
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:52,443
<i>with no beginning or end, you'll see.</i>

877
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,322
<i>Zinnias, lettuce,</i>

878
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,658
<i>mayflies, even humans.</i>

879
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,953
<i>Everything is weightless here.</i>

880
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,040
<i>All living beings are equal.</i>

881
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,170
<i>So do not carelessly step on</i>

882
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,755
<i>an earthworm in the backyard,</i>

883
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:16,175
<i>or weed the lawn.</i>

884
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,221
<i>They are</i>

885
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,767
<i>miracles made</i>
<i>by the spirits of the universe.</i>

886
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,646
<i>Every being is…</i>

887
