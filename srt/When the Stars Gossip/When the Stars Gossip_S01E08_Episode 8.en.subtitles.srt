1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,359
What?

3
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,655
No. Don't come out.

4
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,989
Stay there!

5
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,286
No, I deserve to die.

6
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,498
Please go back.

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,668
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

8
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,920
Go back, Eve!

9
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,172
Go back!

10
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,100
We're ready to go.
Commander, take your seat.

11
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm not leaving.

12
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,146
What?

13
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,022
I said, I'm not leaving.

14
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,527
If it were me trapped alone,

15
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,780
would you guys have left me behind?

16
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,616
If I were the tourist,
would you have abandoned me?

17
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,120
Being the commander doesn't mean
you have to throw your life away.

18
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,998
Are you saying it's okay for him to die?

19
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,417
Chief, would you have left me behind?

20
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,089
Dong-a, would you have abandoned
an untrained civilian?

21
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,257
No, right?

22
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,304
I have the most experience
with spacewalks,

23
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,389
so I should be the one to stay.

24
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,017
Reattach the hooks and open the hatch now.

25
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,394
I won't leave him alone here to die.

26
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,858
I'll find him and go back down with him
on a G.O ship.

27
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,819
I'm not throwing my life away.

28
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,031
I'll stick close to the station
and make my way over carefully.

29
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,450
Open the hatch!

30
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,207
This is Seoul.
We have visual on EV1, Camera 5.

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,669
EV1, don't rush it.
Just follow instructions.

32
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,005
We're looking for the safest route.

33
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,673
Copy.

34
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,721
This is EV1.

35
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,183
I'll make my way up
from the kitchen module to Adapter 1,

36
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,270
the storage module, then Airlock 2.

37
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,240
IOU.

38
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:04,327
Is there any other spot leaking oxygen
other than the storage module?

39
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,454
We cannot confirm that right at this time.

40
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,042
Are you saying
you don't know if the tourist is alive?

41
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,768
I've reached the storage module.

42
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,187
The target point is visible 15 m ahead.

43
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,233
There are a lot of sharp edges,
and the space debris will be back.

44
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,150
Be careful.

45
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,360
Copy.

46
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,362
Continuing on.

47
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,081
No.

48
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,042
No!

49
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,139
You're doing great.

50
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,224
You're almost there.

51
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,316
No.

52
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,944
What? Is it back already?

53
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,613
The debris cloud is approaching
faster than we thought.

54
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,531
It's speeding up.

55
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,704
Eve, hurry. The big ones are coming.

56
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,080
Okay.

57
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,337
Incoming!

58
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,839
Eve, watch out!

59
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,719
No.

60
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,861
Has her space suit been compromised?

61
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,446
No, not yet.

62
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,740
What?

63
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,700
What?

64
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,084
Eve, take cover!

65
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,933
When we're back on Earth
and standing on solid ground,

66
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,687
let's go out for meals,

67
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,565
movies and walks, just like everyone else.

68
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,484
If it rains, let's get wet

69
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,361
and let the wind blow us over.

70
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,906
Let's go on dates like they do on Earth.

71
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,077
When we get back, I'll be so good to you.

72
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,040
Once I set foot on solid ground,

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,710
I can be good to you too.

74
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,347
Don't look down!

75
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,266
Open your eyes and look straight ahead!

76
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,818
-Check the pressure in her suit.
-Okay.

77
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,159
There's no oxygen leak.
Her secondary tank's just been activated.

78
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,452
Okay. How are her vitals?

79
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,787
Her temperature and heart rate
are still normal.

80
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,165
But there's no time.
She has to get inside now.

81
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,167
Eve, are you all right? Can you hear me?

82
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,877
It's okay.

83
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,214
There should be some scratches
on your suit, but nothing critical.

84
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,944
This is EV1.

85
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,491
The cloud of debris is clearing.

86
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,784
It'll be back!

87
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,538
Copy. I'll move fast.

88
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,217
IOU.

89
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,470
Have you gotten hold of the tourist yet?

90
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,722
Negative. Not yet.

91
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,746
I'm here.

92
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,206
Right below the airlock hatch.

93
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,134
What the hell was the tourist doing
in the observation module?

94
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,469
How is he? Is he okay?

95
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,721
Stand by with the tourist, okay?

96
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,099
We'll confirm a safe time for your escape
on the G.O-4 and update you soon.

97
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,371
Airlock has been pressurized.

98
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,305
Eve!

99
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,060
I'm sorry.

100
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,271
It's… It's my fault.

101
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,649
It's all my fault.

102
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,745
I'm sorry.

103
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,088
Eve.

104
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,216
Out of your suit yet?

105
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,011
You should've just left.

106
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,058
Do you really mean that?

107
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,936
You should've gone without me.

108
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,189
I deserve it.

109
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,613
I'm sorry for not making it there in time,

110
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,366
for drinking behind your back,

111
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,369
for calling you a murderer,

112
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,705
for being here at all,
for having feelings for…

113
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,797
For everything. I'm sorry for everything.

114
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,091
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

115
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,439
You said you'd be good to me.

116
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,488
You said you wanted to…
You know, like they do on Earth.

117
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,579
Let's do that when we're back on Earth.

118
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,097
Eve, if you're out of your suit,
turn it around.

119
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,307
Turn the camera around.

120
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,490
Eve.

121
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,995
Can you hear me?

122
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,638
Did we lose connection again?

123
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,391
Eve?

124
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,643
The connection seems fine,
but I can't hear her.

125
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,232
I'm sure they're fine.

126
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,609
The connection is stable
and functioning properly.

127
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,321
They've probably entered an area
with intermittent communication loss.

128
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,239
I hope that's it.

129
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,950
-When will we have the escape time?
-Right.

130
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,036
Breaking news.

131
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,082
The Scorpion spacecraft made an emergency
escape after colliding with space debris

132
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,919
and is now heading to Earth with
astronauts from Spain and Korea onboard.

133
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,757
Fortunately, the Crew Scorpion
has a total capacity of six,

134
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,387
and it's assumed the entire crew was able
to evacuate from the space station.

135
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,224
Whether any astronauts remain
on the space station

136
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,268
has yet to be confirmed.

137
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,729
IOU and the Seoul Mission Control Center

138
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,231
have announced they will brief the media

139
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,692
on the emergency escape shortly.

140
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,278
-Whether the tourist…
-Mr. Go.

141
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,573
…is aboard the Scorpion
and returning a day early is unknown.

142
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,033
As soon as we know more…

143
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,996
Well…

144
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,083
I'm sure he's fine, what with
all the advanced technology we have.

145
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,835
Don't worry, okay?

146
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,172
You know Ryong.
I bet he's just lying there, relaxing…

147
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,632
No, wait. He zonks out fast.

148
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,885
He's probably snoring like this
on his way back here now.

149
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,556
-Should I go pick him up?
-Sorry?

150
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,933
Can I come?

151
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,267
I'll come too.

152
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,853
You really can't. You know that, right?

153
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,650
We have our own airline.

154
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,486
-Yes.
-Call and ask them to free up a plane.

155
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,154
I didn't see him off when he left.

156
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,451
You can't fly out right away,
and you'd never beat him there.

157
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,995
I don't need to beat him there.

158
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,206
He's not coming straight to Seoul, right?

159
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,293
You said he'd need a few days
to adjust to gravity at the hospital.

160
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,421
I can bring him back with me
on our plane after that.

161
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,425
What are you waiting for?
Go make the call.

162
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,886
But it takes time
to go through the procedures.

163
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,054
Make it happen.

164
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,015
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,647
I wonder if the egg
developed into a morula before he set off.

166
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,585
GONG RYONG'S 8TH DAY

167
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,754
MORULA FORMED

168
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,348
The G.O-4 set for their escape
is functional in all modules,

169
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,767
and the propulsion control system
is working fine.

170
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,269
Okay.

171
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,856
It's been in hibernation mode,
so make sure it's fully powered up.

172
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,567
The last step is the engine firing test.
Should we start?

173
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,902
The liquid oxygen levels are dropping.

174
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,780
It looks like there's a leak.

175
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,784
That means it could explode
when we fire up the engine.

176
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,996
The oxygen saturation isn't that high,
so it shouldn't be a problem.

177
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,581
We can start the engine.

178
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,458
-Zoom in on the spacecraft.
-Okay.

179
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,856
I don't see any leaks.

180
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,403
It's probably not showing up on camera.

181
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,530
If the leak isn't visible,

182
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,033
it should be fine to fire up the engine.

183
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,243
They can't avoid the debris
and return safely

184
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,496
unless we start the engine
and change the orbit.

185
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,580
Right.

186
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,124
I'm a little worried,

187
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,086
but we can't let them board
without testing it first.

188
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,632
This is the only way for them to evacuate.

189
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,512
Okay, start the test.

190
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,554
Yes, Chief.

191
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,932
Keep an eye on the liquid oxygen levels.

192
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,767
-Check the saturation again too.
-Okay.

193
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,936
They'll depart
as soon as the test is complete.

194
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,020
Got it.

195
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,407
They're doing the final test
on the spacecraft now.

196
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,909
We'll depart in an hour.

197
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,245
And in four hours, we'll be back on Earth.

198
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,064
You're not losing your mind
or anything, right?

199
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,289
You're not regretting it, are you?

200
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,092
Am I dreaming?

201
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,300
THE TRUTH IS, I CAME HERE
TO CREATE EMBRYOS…

202
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,897
Why does that damn oxygen tank
keep floating around? It's distracting.

203
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,114
Are you in love with Eve?

204
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,330
What? I was her mentor for five years.

205
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,502
I was yours for five years.

206
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,593
Crew Scorpion is entering the atmosphere.

207
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,514
Put the Scorpion on the main screen.

208
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,773
Scorpion has entered the atmosphere

209
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,733
and is expected to land in the open waters

210
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,152
off the coast of Florida
in 35 minutes as scheduled.

211
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,037
This is my first time riding Scorpion.

212
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,208
I hope it's as safe as a G.O vessel.

213
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,921
Scorpion?

214
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,756
-Was that an explosion?
-Mina.

215
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,008
Scorpion?

216
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,477
Seoul? What was that?

217
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,271
What was that?

218
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,189
What's going on?

219
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,524
Dona, what's happening?

220
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,403
An explosion?

221
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,908
The escape ship's engine module
blew up during testing.

222
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,327
Get G.O-4 on the screen.

223
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,495
Eve, are you all right?

224
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,705
Mr. Gong Ryong?

225
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,125
Are you okay?

226
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,294
I'm okay. Are you all right, Eve?

227
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,421
Close the airlock hatch first, Commander!

228
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,131
The engine module exploded.

229
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,866
The truth is,

230
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,119
I came here to create embryos
using the MZ Group heir's sperm

231
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,829
and his wife's eggs.

232
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,874
I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.

233
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,252
I fertilized them behind your back,

234
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,214
and the embryo is now in the incubator.

235
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,550
Please don't let it die.

236
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,726
The engine module gave out
during the test and blew apart.

237
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,773
The remote power controls
aren't responding,

238
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,984
and the undocking system is down.

239
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,364
It can't be detached from the station.

240
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,242
The vessel is useless now.

241
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,204
It won't get you back to Earth.

242
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,889
Eve.

243
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,852
What… What do we do now?

244
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,897
There's nothing we can do.

245
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,492
-Go get my future son-in-law and grandkid.
-This way.

246
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,369
Bring them both back safely.

247
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,331
Yes, Chairman.

248
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,213
The astronauts who escaped
have passed through the atmosphere.

249
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,890
-Hello, there. It's good to see you.
-Did you have lunch?

250
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,517
It's been a long time.

251
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,311
-Hello.
-Hey.

252
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,276
Eve, here's the situation.

253
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,279
G.O-4, the only escape ship
available to you,

254
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,906
is no longer an option.

255
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,744
Right now, there's no way for you

256
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,537
to get back to Earth.

257
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,332
How soon can you send a rescue ship?

258
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,250
I'll look into it right away.

259
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,504
In the meantime, check the station's power
and see how long you can hold up.

260
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,756
Copy.

261
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,084
Commander,
is there anything I can do to help?

262
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,686
Things are not looking good here.

263
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,438
It seems the solar array got fried

264
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,440
when the storage module was breached.

265
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,405
You've got to be kidding me.

266
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,284
We can no longer get power
from the solar panels,

267
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,036
so we'll have to rely on emergency power.

268
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,663
How long do you think it'll last?

269
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:27,794
Well, I'd say no more than two days.

270
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,757
Then you need to conserve power.
Switch all modules to emergency mode.

271
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,553
We'll keep communication open
until your space suit battery runs out.

272
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,013
Let's keep it to a minimum.

273
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,140
Got it.

274
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,058
I'll start by turning off the systems

275
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,477
that consume the most power,
except for life support.

276
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,898
We'll get to you in two days. We can.

277
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,358
We will.

278
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,030
The press is waiting.

279
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,994
You need to speak to them
before the Scorpion lands,

280
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,748
or they'll realize the commander
and the tourist couldn't evacuate.

281
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,792
We need to shape the story on our end.

282
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,431
Here she comes!

283
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,475
-Here she comes!
-Where?

284
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,228
What caused the emergency evacuation
from the space station?

285
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,522
Has everyone on the station
made it out safely?

286
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,608
When is the tourist coming back to Korea?

287
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,402
-Please give us an update.
-Could you give us the details?

288
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,197
When is the official…

289
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,331
It's become a morula.

290
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,415
Sixteen cells.

291
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,378
I just need to bring it back
and implant it.

292
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,107
Don't be scared, okay?

293
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,276
We can get through this.

294
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,521
We just need to hold out for two days
until they send the rescue ship.

295
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,527
If we keep the power usage to a minimum,
we should be able to make it.

296
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,200
But…

297
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,457
Once you turn off the dehumidifier,
condensation will start to form.

298
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,250
That could be dangerous.

299
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,212
So get here before we freeze to death.

300
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,112
I'll make sure to get you back to Earth.

301
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,624
Is there anything you need?

302
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,667
No, thank you.

303
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,715
We're ready to go.

304
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,969
Please turn off your tablet
and all other electronic devices.

305
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,388
Wait, look at this.

306
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,182
What is it?

307
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,227
The emergency evacuation
from the space station was due to debris

308
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,355
created by the collision
of a fuel tank with a low-orbit satellite.

309
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,441
Secondary impacts formed
a large cloud of debris,

310
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,026
which was so vast that

311
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,446
despite orbit adjustments,
it still intersected the station's path.

312
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,200
The escape ship has passed
through Earth's atmosphere

313
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,619
and is heading to the waters
off Florida's coast.

314
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,662
Ocean.

315
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,708
I feel terrible that we left them behind.

316
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,044
When will they launch the rescue ship?

317
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,214
How are the commander and the tourist?
Are they okay?

318
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,349
The spacecraft that has arrived on Earth
is carrying a total of four people.

319
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,227
The mission commander and the tourist

320
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,396
are currently still at the space station.

321
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,111
IOU and the Seoul Mission Control Center
are preparing a rescue ship

322
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,530
to evacuate the commander
and Mr. Gong Ryong

323
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,074
from the station as soon as possible.

324
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,870
Due to the damage caused
by the space debris,

325
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,332
-they were left stranded on the station.
-What is she saying, Dr. Jeon?

326
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,628
-They're in good health with no injuries.
-I don't…

327
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,255
-They're maintaining communication…
-I'm not sure.

328
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,174
…while awaiting the second evacuation.

329
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,970
We plan to bring them back to Earth
as quickly as possible.

330
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,016
When and where
will the rescue ship launch?

331
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,100
Who will board?

332
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,019
That'll be all.

333
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,652
I'm sorry.
We'll issue an official statement soon.

334
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,363
-I'm sorry. Excuse me.
-Could you tell us more now?

335
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,502
I'll go.

336
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,881
The available vessels are
at IOU Mission Control and in the States.

337
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,009
This isn't the time to get emotional.
Stay out of it.

338
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,597
You know it's going to take
at least a week for them to launch.

339
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,224
We can't wait that long.

340
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,684
Let me take our own vessel.

341
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,771
We don't have a vessel
that's completed a crewed flight.

342
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,358
The one we have
has never carried people into space.

343
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,235
You know we're just testing

344
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,988
the abort system and reentry
in two days with a manikin!

345
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,490
I'm saying, put me on it
instead of the manikin.

346
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,159
Isn't the manikin a stand-in
for a person anyway?

347
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,248
Just get out of here.

348
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,087
You're telling me to put you
on the test flight to see

349
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,964
if it's safe enough to carry people?

350
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:28,965
You're insane!

351
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,301
They only have two days' worth of power
left on the space station.

352
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,638
I'd rather die trying to reach them
than die from the stress of waiting.

353
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,806
You just won't quit!

354
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,266
I'm a pilot, all right?

355
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,935
A soldier who's prepared
to die in the air any day.

356
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,397
Are you going to let Eve die?
And send a rescue ship after she's dead?

357
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,734
In this kind of situation, you should say,
"Man up and be the manikin."

358
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,569
"You're a soldier. I'm your superior."

359
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,070
"This is an order, you fucker!"

360
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,363
"You want to go? Fine, go!"

361
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,823
Why can't you be like this?

362
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,536
You think you want to save Eve
and I don't?

363
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,290
You can't bring them back
if you don't make it there safely,

364
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,250
you stupid womanizer!

365
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,588
Have you ever seen
the manikin come back in one piece?

366
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,507
Who do you think you are?
You don't even work here!

367
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,927
I'm not quitting.

368
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,138
My resignation hasn't been processed yet.

369
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,890
You can just forget about it.

370
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,476
I won't stand for it

371
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,686
if anyone hesitates to save Eve's life.

372
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,980
Even if it's you.

373
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:46,501
GONG RYONG'S 9TH DAY

374
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,974
It's minus 20 degrees.

375
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,852
I found the thermal tents.

376
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,061
Let's wait it out in these.

377
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,735
-I'm going to go see if there's any food.
-Okay.

378
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,663
As you all know,
the ILS system has been severely damaged,

379
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,790
and we can't get
the automatic docking to work,

380
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,210
so the unmanned rescue ship is useless.

381
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,421
We need to send astronauts
on the rescue ship.

382
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,839
When can we do it?

383
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,759
We haven't even detached the engine
from the Scorpion yet.

384
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,344
It will take at least a week.

385
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,346
Bongani.

386
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,100
When is the earliest you can get
the G.O spaceship ready for launch?

387
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,232
The earliest I would be able to
get them ready would be five days.

388
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,110
Can you please move up three days?

389
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,989
Isn't the Maru ready to launch
in two days?

390
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,116
Has it done the return test yet?

391
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,080
This will be our first test with dummies.

392
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,292
We didn't even finish
an emergency escape test.

393
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,103
Water, guys.

394
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,818
Can I get a water, please?

395
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,487
Please.

396
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,031
Get me a bottle of water, you prick.

397
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,534
Hello?

398
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,704
Is there a Mr. Kang? Mr. Kang?

399
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,289
Just a moment.

400
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,124
Here. It's for you.

401
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,589
Hello? This is Kang Kang-su.

402
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,968
Why did you come back alone?
Why is Ryong still up there?

403
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,596
Why did you come back without him?
You bastard!

404
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,683
-Go-eun.
-You go back up there right now

405
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,476
and bring back Ryong!

406
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,727
All right.

407
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,313
All right, listen.

408
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,610
You have a plane in Houston, right?

409
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,991
WE ARE CLOSED

410
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,289
Hey.

411
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,463
Damn it.

412
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,102
For God's sake!
Stop crying like it's his funeral!

413
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,187
He's going to come back just fine!

414
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,565
Your eyes are made for seeing,

415
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,150
not for spilling damn tears.

416
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,484
Hey, come on.

417
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,822
Damn it.

418
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,411
That jerk.

419
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:15,227
EVE, GONG RYONG
STRANDED FOR 30 HOURS

420
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,647
This is the space station.

421
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,902
We're running out of emergency power.

422
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,740
Communication uses up the most power,

423
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,534
so if we keep charging the space suit,

424
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,371
the life support system will shut down.

425
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,375
I know we need to stay online for rescue,

426
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,586
but we won't survive without oxygen,
so for now…

427
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,132
I'll shut down everything

428
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,427
except the CO2 scrubbers
and oxygen generators.

429
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,056
This is probably our last transmission.

430
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,809
The tourist and I are holding on for now.

431
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,645
We won't give up hope until the end.

432
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,815
IOU is doing everything it can
to speed things up.

433
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,441
We'll be there in 24 hours.

434
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,735
Really?

435
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,445
Yeah.

436
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,575
We'll launch within 30 hours max.

437
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,169
I…

438
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
I mean, we…

439
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,679
Please don't give up on us, guys.

440
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,019
I'll see you back on Earth.

441
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,614
Commander.

442
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,782
Eve.

443
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,273
How about a drink?

444
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,775
By the time IOU gets there,
they'll both be dead.

445
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,276
Shut up.

446
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,072
The Maru is set for launch tomorrow.
Instead of the manikin--

447
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,406
I said, shut up.

448
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,574
What's your plan then?

449
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,410
Call Bongani
and tell him to get it done in 30 hours!

450
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,539
Even if he does,
they'll both be dead in 30 hours!

451
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,707
They'll suffocate to death
from the CO2 buildup

452
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,042
and lack of oxygen!

453
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,877
You know Eve. If she says two days,

454
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,380
it means they've got less than that!

455
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,965
What then?

456
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,342
You want to let Dong-a go like he says?

457
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,803
And tell yourselves,
"We did everything we could"?

458
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,181
If we do that,
all three of them will die, you idiots!

459
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,725
Damn it.

460
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,938
Shit.

461
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:53,279
OXYGEN REMAINING IN STATION: 28%

462
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:57,366
SURVIVAL TIME REMAINING:
APPROXIMATELY 20 HOURS

463
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,458
God, it's cold.

464
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,004
I'm cold.

465
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,394
You think rescue will come tomorrow?

466
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,734
Don't talk. Save your energy.

467
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,528
Will they come?

468
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,661
Why is time passing so slowly?

469
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,748
Well, don't you have your cell phone?

470
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,625
You can't go online,

471
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,795
but don't you have
some music or videos saved?

472
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,426
Where's my phone? I can't find it.

473
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,644
I guess it's somewhere over there.

474
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,979
I'm freezing.

475
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:09,897
Uh-huh.

476
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,650
"Uh-huh"?

477
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,526
Uh-huh.

478
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,155
Are formalities out the window now?

479
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,117
Let's just drop them.

480
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,579
We're going to die soon anyway,
so who cares?

481
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,792
Yeah.

482
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,211
You're right.

483
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,588
-Eve.
-Yeah?

484
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,467
Where's the liquor? Are you going
to drink it after you freeze to death?

485
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,887
I was saving it
for when we really need it.

486
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,932
When we really can't take it anymore,

487
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,976
and there's absolutely no choice.

488
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,145
We're going to die
if you save it any longer.

489
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,233
Stop saying we're going to die.

490
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,194
Come on, let's just drink it.

491
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,738
My feet have gone numb.

492
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,698
They've gone numb already?

493
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,866
Yeah.

494
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:04,993
Hang on.

495
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,124
Here.

496
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,967
Oh, geez.

497
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,601
How is it?

498
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,731
God, that's good.

499
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:36,900
Here.

500
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,705
-How is it?
-It burns.

501
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,415
Feels good, right?

502
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,757
Oh, that's nice.

503
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,307
I'd kill for a movie right now.

504
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,767
A movie would be great.

505
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:25,032
Let's go see one when we're back on Earth.

506
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,118
Together.

507
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,749
Together?

508
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,418
Yeah.

509
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,230
Eve.

510
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,023
Yeah?

511
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,404
Never mind.

512
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,115
What is it?

513
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,202
If I'm about to die,

514
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,829
can I be forgiven for anything?

515
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:17,167
What's the point of forgiveness?
Once you're dead, it's all over.

516
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:20,170
For some things,
you'd still want forgiveness.

517
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,675
Like what?

518
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,430
Like…

519
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,478
Nothing, never mind.

520
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,951
Let's get some rest now.

521
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,203
I should stretch my legs.

522
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,583
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

523
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,085
What's the matter?

524
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,630
I have a cramp. It's really bad.

525
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,800
What? You… You have a cramp?

526
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,884
Yeah.

527
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,511
Hold on a second.

528
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,141
-No, don't come out!
-No.

529
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,143
-Stay there!
-No.

530
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,604
Oh, it's bad.

531
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,813
Stay there!

532
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,398
No, don't! It's dangerous!

533
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,691
No, wait!

534
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,861
Which leg, the left one?

535
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:26,987
It hurts.

536
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,948
Where? Here?

537
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,116
Yeah.

538
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,495
Your leg is freezing.

539
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,498
Go back in.
It's not safe outside the tent. Go!

540
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,916
You'll put yourself in danger.

541
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,462
What?

542
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,757
Well, you said
it's not safe outside the tent.

543
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,344
Bad idea?

544
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,388
No.

545
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,491
Come here.

546
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,291
Isn't this a little better?

547
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,549
-You know…
-Yeah?

548
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,637
It'd actually be warmer if we were naked.

549
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,643
Are you okay with that?

550
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,646
We might actually die.

551
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,023
It's not a matter
of whether I'm okay with it.

552
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,867
-Can I have the liquor?
-Yeah.

553
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,954
Do you want some?

554
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,372
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

555
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,479
Get your arm out first.

556
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,202
Your body feels ice cold.

557
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,371
Yeah.

558
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,754
I'll warm you up.

559
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,048
Just hang on.
You'll feel warm in a minute.

560
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,133
Okay.

561
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:58,889
Are you warm?

562
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:02,642
Yeah.

563
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,855
You must be out of your mind.
You're the commander.

564
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,733
No.

565
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,320
This is the protocol, you know.

566
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:17,115
I'm just following protocol.

567
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,241
Seriously.

568
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,721
Commander.

569
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,806
Yeah?

570
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,685
The truth is…

571
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,402
The truth is,

572
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,365
I came here to create embryos
using the MZ Group heir's sperm

573
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,493
and his wife's eggs.

574
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:03,703
What?

575
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,957
I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.

576
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,167
They were my patients,

577
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,170
and the wife desperately wants a child.

578
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,511
While pretending to be a tourist…

579
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,682
I managed to fertilize an egg.

580
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,061
In my pocket outside

581
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,939
is an embryo with 16 cells.

582
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,026
A living being.

583
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,868
Here he comes!

584
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,536
He's here.

585
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,331
Stay back, please.

586
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,379
Hi. What's the current situation?

587
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,463
Can we have an update?

588
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:59,050
Can you tell us how you plan to bring back
the tourist from the space station?

589
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,636
-When is the official briefing?
-Can you please tell us?

590
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,555
-Tell us about your plan.
-Any updates?

591
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,973
How's the tourist? Is he okay?

592
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,851
-Why the silence?
-Please tell us.

593
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,352
Excuse me! Here!

594
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,358
Kill me if you want.

595
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,236
I deserve it.

596
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,834
I wonder if Santi

597
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,254
is with his wife now.

598
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,633
I've lied to you…

599
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:46,681
more than a hundred times because of this.

600
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,857
It's nice, isn't it?

601
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,485
What is?

602
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,163
That means three people might die here.

603
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,212
Did… Did you just say "people"?

604
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,885
I don't even have the energy
to be mad at you right now.

605
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,180
Why bother?

606
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,393
It's all pointless now.

607
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,863
Are you happy
that there are three of us dying?

608
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,410
Yeah.

609
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,914
I was worried
it might end up dying here alone.

610
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,335
But we're sharing the same fate,
so that's a little better.

611
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,098
Don't give up.

612
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:17,397
They'll still send a rescue ship
even if we die.

613
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,901
Maybe you can make them
take it back and implant it.

614
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,114
Write a will or something.

615
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,205
Eve.

616
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,128
It's our dying wish.

617
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,922
Maybe they'll do it.

618
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,935
I hope it's born healthy.

619
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,257
I'm happy even if I freeze to death.

620
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,487
Let's try the thing the mice couldn't do.

621
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,865
Even the mice couldn't do it,
so how can we?

622
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,618
Before we die.

623
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:45,837
GONG RYONG'S 10TH DAY

624
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,064
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

625
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,359
They're no longer getting oxygen.

626
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,236
If we don't send a rescue ship today,

627
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,114
we'll lose both the commander
and the tourist.

628
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,158
He's a complete idiot!

629
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,494
Please get them to launch

630
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,497
the rescue ship right away.

631
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,750
I will never let Ryong die.

632
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,793
We're going to launch the Maru
toward the ILS orbit.

633
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,795
We need international cooperation.

634
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,424
This is the fastest way to get to them.

635
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,800
Please let me go.

636
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,677
Even if you made it there,

637
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,763
it'd be a gamble
with all the systems down.

638
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,808
Worst-case scenario,
you might crash right into the station.

639
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,268
If you'll let me,

640
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,979
I want to go to rescue the commander
and the tourist too.

641
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:53,112
