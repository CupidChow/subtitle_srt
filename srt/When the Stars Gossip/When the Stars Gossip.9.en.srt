1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:48,006
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,968
Informing the ILS.
Code yellow, code yellow.

3
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,678
1,836 pieces of space debris

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,847
<i>have collided in succession,</i>
<i>forming a debris cloud.</i>

5
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,641
<i>We think the space debris</i>
<i>will pass through in 40 minutes.</i>

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,435
<i>Prepare to evacuate if necessary.</i>

7
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,772
<i>Pack only the essentials</i>
<i>and wait in the Crew Scorpion.</i>

8
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,524
Are you saying
we could go back to Earth today?

9
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,651
Mr. Tourist, collect your personal items,

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,154
<i>go to the Scorpion, and stay put.</i>

11
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,198
Is it a morula yet?

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,700
Forget it.

13
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,536
<i>Is there a hidden spot</i>
<i>to plug this in on the Scorpion?</i>

14
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>Code red, code red.</i>

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,919
<i>The debris will hit earlier than expected.</i>

16
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>Scorpion, switch to departure mode.</i>

17
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,135
<i>I saw him in the observation module.</i>

18
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,095
<i>We're ready to go.</i>
<i>Commander, take your seat.</i>

19
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,055
I'm not leaving.

20
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,015
I'm in here.

21
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,850
I said, I'm not leaving.

22
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,976
I'm in here.

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,187
Can't anybody hear me? I'm still here!

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,522
Open the hatch!

25
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,527
<i>I won't leave him alone here to die.</i>

26
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,280
<i>I'll find him and go back down with him</i>
<i>on a G.O ship.</i>

27
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>No!</i>

28
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,950
<i>Incoming!</i>

29
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,829
Go back, Eve!

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,413
<i>Eve, take cover!</i>

31
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,427
<i>When we're back on Earth</i>
<i>and standing on solid ground,</i>

32
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,388
<i>let's go on dates like they do on Earth.</i>

33
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,392
<i>They're doing the final test</i>
<i>on the spacecraft now.</i>

34
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,810
<i>We'll depart in an hour.</i>

35
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,815
<i>The engine module gave out</i>
<i>during the test and blew apart.</i>

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,192
It won't get you back to Earth.

37
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,281
<i>Eve. What… What do we do now?</i>

38
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,324
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,952
<i>We're running out of emergency power.</i>

40
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,872
<i>This is probably our last transmission.</i>

41
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,499
We'll launch within 30 hours max.

42
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,420
Please don't give up on us, guys.

43
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,549
<i>By the time IOU gets there,</i>
<i>they'll both be dead.</i>

44
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,218
<i>Call Bongani</i>
<i>and tell him to get it done in 30 hours!</i>

45
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,513
<i>Even if he does,</i>
<i>they'll both be dead in 30 hours!</i>

46
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,891
<i>They'll suffocate to death</i>
<i>from the CO2 buildup</i>

47
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,350
<i>and lack of oxygen!</i>

48
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,062
<i>You know Eve. If she says two days,</i>
<i>it means they've got less than that!</i>

49
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,064
GONG RYONG'S 9TH DAY

50
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,066
ILS 21:00, SEOUL 06:00

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,235
STRANDED FOR 40 HOURS

52
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,580
You said

53
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,374
the space station
would be passing over Seoul right now.

54
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,794
Yes, it's true

55
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,964
that it's passing over Seoul
right now, but…

56
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,758
But what?

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,846
If there was an issue with the power,

58
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,433
it's very likely that they haven't
been able to turn on the lights.

59
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,938
You need power to make oxygen.

60
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,314
Yes.

61
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,442
So it's currently orbiting
directly over Seoul,

62
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,944
but it's not visible or shining

63
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,404
because they can't turn on the lights.

64
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,367
And it might also be impossible
for them to generate oxygen?

65
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,494
Yes.

66
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,288
Are you even hearing yourself?

67
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,500
Are you saying there's a good chance

68
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,294
Ryong is dead because he has no oxygen
and can't breathe?

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,131
And that my future grandchild
might also suffer the same fate?

70
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,716
Is that what you're saying?

71
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,095
- Damn it.
- Sir!

72
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,640
Take a look at this.

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,476
The freezer is finally
sending out a signal,

74
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,603
and video is being transmitted.

75
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,563
The portable freezer must have exited

76
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,399
the signal interference zone.

77
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,569
So, they're still alive, right?

78
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,946
Yes.

79
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,410
You should take the elevator.

80
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,580
I'm too excited to wait for the elevator.

81
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,714
This is driving me crazy.

82
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,533
What's that?

83
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,953
That's a morula, sir.

84
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,956
The fertilized egg has divided
into at least 16 cells.

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,459
Remember the freezer
we gave to Gong Ryong?

86
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,252
He stored it properly in that freezer.

87
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,546
The freezer is sending

88
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,133
images of the morula in real time
via the satellite we launched.

89
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,676
What about Dr. Gong, Father?

90
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,391
Look, it's completely blocking
all of the unknown cosmic rays in space.

91
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,393
It cannot be physically altered.

92
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,896
In this state,
even Earth's atmosphere is no threat.

93
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,231
And its self-charging capacity
exceeds 30 days,

94
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,275
so all that's left is to bring it back.

95
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,111
Are you still unable
to reach Dr. Gong on his phone?

96
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:08,618
The freezer uses our private satellite
for discreet communication.

97
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,828
It operates on
a different system than a phone.

98
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,415
I will never

99
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,668
let Ryong die.

100
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,271
<i>And a one, two, three, four.</i>

101
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:43,152
<i>You're a guy who threw a stone</i>

102
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:48,032
<i>At the heart of an innocent girl</i>

103
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,827
<i>You, I'm talking about you</i>

104
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,913
Man, my moms are having a blast.

105
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,290
They must be so happy right now.

106
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,044
Hey, I want you to emcee my wedding.

107
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,713
It's a chaebol wedding.
You think I'm up for it?

108
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,925
I'm going to keep it small
and have the reception here,

109
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,387
not somewhere
that makes my moms self-conscious.

110
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,765
After I get married,
I'm going to keep my job as a doctor.

111
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,644
No matter how crazy things got
with me delivering babies every day,

112
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,479
coming here to have drinks with you

113
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,190
and seeing my moms
always relieved my stress.

114
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,984
Sounds good, you punk.

115
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,028
- Here, let me.
- Okay.

116
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,824
Don't you dare change
because you're marrying an heiress.

117
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,119
Let's keep hanging out
like we always have, okay?

118
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,287
What?

119
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,538
You better not ditch me.

120
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,207
Stop saying stupid things, you idiot.

121
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,836
Come back in one piece

122
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,088
or I'm taking your things.

123
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,007
You got it.

124
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,384
You can have it all. It's all yours.

125
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,387
- Is this what you want?
- What?

126
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,889
Are you happy?

127
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,770
Cheers.

128
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,196
They're here.

129
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,991
Everybody, step back, please.

130
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,413
What is the current situation?

131
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,123
Please explain what is going on.

132
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,835
What's the latest on getting the tourist
back from the space station?

133
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,754
When will the official briefing be held?

134
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,215
- Please tell us.
- Please give us a statement.

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,885
Can you give us a statement?

136
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,345
Is there a plan in place?

137
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,305
Is the tourist in good health?

138
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,850
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- Say something.

139
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,186
When will the rescue ship be launched?

140
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,355
- Please say something.
- Is the tourist okay?

141
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,439
Wait.

142
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,911
This area is restricted
to authorized personnel.

143
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,581
How could they come back down
and leave the tourist stranded up there?

144
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,542
Our commander is still up there.

145
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,753
To you people,
he's probably just some rich tourist,

146
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,837
but to me,

147
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,173
he's my fiancé.

148
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,676
The woman I want to marry
is also up there.

149
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,887
I'm going to go up there myself
and bring her back no matter what.

150
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,764
So go back home and wait.

151
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,890
No.

152
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,643
I want to talk to the person in charge.

153
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,649
James!

154
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,322
My family's future existence
depends on this.

155
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,077
You wouldn't understand because
you have loads of kids and grandkids.

156
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,872
But it would be the end of my family line.

157
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,750
Have I ever asked you for a favor before?

158
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,754
"James, my family's future existence
depends on this."

159
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,965
"You don't understand
how much it means to me

160
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,551
because you have
many children and grandchildren."

161
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,761
"It would be the end of my family line."

162
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,847
"Have I ever asked you any favor before?"

163
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,516
Please.

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,895
Please, can you pull some strings
to get the IOU

165
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,232
to launch the rescue ship right away?

166
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,485
You trade satellites,

167
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,487
so you must know somebody.

168
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:18,451
I'll pay whatever you ask!

169
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,537
"Please, can you pull some strings
at the IOU

170
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,998
to launch the rescue ship immediately?"

171
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,460
"You trade satellites,
so you must know somebody."

172
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,045
"I'll pay whatever you ask."

173
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,007
<i>A rescue ship launch would put</i>
<i>the pilots' lives at stake too.</i>

174
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,551
<i>It doesn't matter how much you pay.</i>

175
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,304
<i>Astronauts' lives cannot be bought.</i>

176
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,389
He said that

177
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,893
rushing the rescue ship launch
would put the pilots' lives at risk.

178
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,479
He said you can't buy
the astronauts' lives with money.

179
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,939
Then…

180
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,528
Then what about
my future son-in-law and my grand…

181
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,574
Huh?

182
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,493
Are you saying
we should let him die there?

183
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,704
Do you have any idea
how much you gouged me for

184
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,082
to launch our satellite?

185
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,169
You said we had to pay double
because it had to be kept secret.

186
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,296
Now you're saying
"we can't" and "give up"?

187
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,547
Screw that!

188
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,675
James!

189
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,051
You…

190
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:22,014
I know you ripped me off, you crook.

191
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,725
I knew what you were doing,
but I turned a blind eye.

192
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,103
I've never asked you for anything before.

193
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,939
And you can't do this for me, you bastard?

194
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,693
Interpret that word for word.

195
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,862
Interpret it!

196
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,031
Convey exactly how furious I am.

197
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,892
- Hang on.
- Please grab my shoes.

198
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,978
Oh, my slipper.

199
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,229
Hang on a moment, please.

200
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,897
My stomach hurts.

201
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,444
- We're almost there.
- Careful.

202
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,156
We'll leave as soon as we're ready.

203
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,332
Nobody knows we snuck out.

204
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,835
What if we get in trouble later?

205
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,589
We abandoned
the commander and the tourist.

206
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,132
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

207
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,968
Why? Do you want
to continue playing astronaut?

208
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,554
That's why we're going back.

209
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,598
We'll save them, even if it's just us.

210
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,601
You know, Dr. Kang,
we have a conscience too. And pride.

211
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,894
Why say it like that?

212
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,397
- Anything you need, sir?
- Yeah, hi.

213
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,900
Could you bring me
a bunch of waters, please?

214
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,067
- Okay.
- Yeah, thank you.

215
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,700
Guys, this Earth water is just so amazing.

216
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,826
Oh, my God.

217
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,538
I mean, so much better than that
purified piss we've been drinking, huh?

218
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,501
I mean, this is life!

219
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,836
I feel so alive.

220
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,962
Here you are.

221
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,175
This damn gravity
is making my body feel so heavy.

222
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,761
I already miss zero gravity.

223
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,472
When will we get used to gravity?

224
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,101
I'm so dizzy it's making me crazy.

225
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,106
Let me help.

226
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,363
You should put your seat belt on first.

227
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,908
Right.

228
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,008
You guys are to blame for all this.

229
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,428
What?

230
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,181
That's why you should've let
the tourist do it on his own.

231
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,141
Why did you help him?

232
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,562
All the while giving me the cold shoulder.

233
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,565
We're in this mess
because he risked his life

234
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,191
to bring that thing back.

235
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,277
Now, even the commander could die.

236
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,612
And what if they both die?

237
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,116
If they do,
are you guys going to take responsibility?

238
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,203
I knew something was off.
It's impossible without a microscope.

239
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,081
Since when
have the three of you been so tight?

240
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,374
Was I an outcast?

241
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,501
What do you mean?

242
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,586
Listen to this guy…

243
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,587
Oh, geez.

244
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,715
Are you okay?

245
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,924
What is it?

246
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,761
What are you accusing us
of helping him with?

247
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,347
You're pinning the blame
on the wrong people, Dr. Kang.

248
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,059
After we rescue the commander and tourist,
you guys are dead.

249
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,144
I'm…

250
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,230
going to make you all pay.

251
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,568
What, so are we
also going to be stripped of

252
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,738
our astronaut qualifications
or something like that?

253
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,866
That's not
what you're talking about, is it?

254
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,544
Oh, here.

255
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,018
Huh? Where is it?

256
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,480
Where did the manikin go?

257
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,775
The main module's control board

258
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,486
can be used to monitor the power
in the observation module.

259
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,738
So we're checking it every minute.

260
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,200
But even with
only essential life support running,

261
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,785
power is dangerously low.

262
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,995
If we don't send a rescue ship today,

263
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,791
we'll lose both the commander
and the tourist.

264
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,377
GONG RYONG'S 10TH DAY
ILS 00:00, SEOUL 09:00

265
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,004
Emergency oxygen status?

266
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,339
Because the cargo ship

267
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,967
was supposed to take more up in ten days,

268
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,385
even that's almost gone.

269
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,013
What's the latest from IOU
and Houston, Chief?

270
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,350
They hope to send a ship
by tomorrow evening.

271
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,061
I told you,
they have to send it by midnight today.

272
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,067
Hello?

273
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,130
The thief is here.

274
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,673
Security, come and get him.

275
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,097
Vibration test, sound pressure test,
erector test, wet test.

276
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,181
All passed.

277
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,018
I went to the assembly team
and engine team

278
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,228
and verified it with my own eyes.

279
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,565
We're ready.
I'm willing to stake my life on it.

280
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,568
How can he drive? He has no arms.

281
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,652
I…

282
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,155
can do a better job than him.

283
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,949
Please let me go.

284
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,661
Let him go, Chief.

285
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,663
We don't have any other options.
Let him go.

286
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,457
Han Si-won, really, you too?

287
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,792
The launch window won't even open,
and debris

288
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,794
is destabilizing ILS's attitude control.

289
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,255
The original launch window
is no longer viable.

290
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,759
You know it's going to take at least
a week to set a safe window.

291
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,428
Instead of wasting time on the negatives,

292
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:38,057
let's put our heads together
and figure out a way to get there.

293
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,601
I'll do whatever it takes
to reduce the time.

294
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,686
We don't have time, Chief.

295
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,022
Give up on the stable launch time.

296
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,085
OXYGEN REMAINING IN STATION: 13%

297
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,932
SURVIVAL TIME REMAINING:
APPROXIMATELY 10 HOURS

298
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,185
<i>Despite the circumstances,</i>
<i>the fertilized egg</i>

299
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,229
<i>has divided into a morula and is alive.</i>

300
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,064
We're getting signals from the freezer

301
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,817
<i>that it has survived</i>

302
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,486
the harsh conditions of space
and is safe and sound.

303
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,030
Gong Ryong is doing a good job.

304
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,158
But do we know how Ryong is doing?

305
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,497
Fine, keep the reports coming.

306
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,915
<i>Where are you? I'll come get--</i>

307
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,999
Damn it.

308
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,294
His life is more important.

309
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,006
What was he doing
that prevented him from escaping?

310
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,258
That dumbass!

311
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,760
He's a complete idiot!

312
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,888
It's standard procedure

313
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,432
that when a problem arises
on a ship or airplane,

314
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,519
tourists are safely evacuated first,

315
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,272
and the crew last.

316
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,023
Isn't that just common sense?

317
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,693
How could the crew
abandon the tourist and evacuate first,

318
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,237
resulting in a situation

319
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,199
where he is left stranded
with just the commander?

320
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,743
How is it acceptable that his family

321
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,289
had to find out about the accident
from the news?

322
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,709
When is the rescue ship going up there?

323
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,545
We are formulating a plan as we speak.

324
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,049
I don't want some vague answer like that.

325
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,137
It's seven o'clock right now.

326
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:47,644
Tell me right now the exact time
the rescue ship is going to leave.

327
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,944
Could they die?

328
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,578
You have to trust us.

329
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:08,081
We're going to do everything we can
to ensure that doesn't happen.

330
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm going to watch with my own eyes
as the rescue ship goes up there,

331
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,386
reaches the station, and rescues him.

332
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,181
I'm also going to bring his mothers here.

333
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,892
Because it could be goodbye.

334
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,606
Assuming a successful first launch,

335
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,442
it will take seven days
for the Maru to dock with ILS.

336
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,028
Is there any way
to shorten seven days to one?

337
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,948
What if we maintain thrust longer
at the beginning?

338
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,034
In reality, reaching an altitude
of 200 km above Earth

339
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,327
only takes ten minutes.

340
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,038
But it takes a full seven days
to climb any higher.

341
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:52,709
Why not simply boost it
to 400 km right off the bat?

342
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,671
Then we only have to go
another 50 km to get to the station.

343
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,673
If we look at the OpsCon,

344
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,133
it'll take more than 3 days
to cover those 50 km.

345
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,093
It's too late.

346
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,011
We can reach the station in two hours.

347
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,929
Is that possible?

348
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,306
Normally we launch the Maru
at a lower altitude.

349
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,224
Instead,

350
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,852
when the station

351
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,605
passes over South Korea,

352
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,857
we'll launch the Maru directly at it

353
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,070
at the same angle as the station's orbit,
as if we're aiming directly at it.

354
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,156
Upon entering orbit,

355
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,703
we can get the Maru close to
the station's keepout area in one shot.

356
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,329
SAFETY ZONE AROUND SPACECRAFT

357
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,374
After that,
we can start the rendezvous and dock.

358
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,086
So, it continues
toward the station without stopping.

359
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,671
It may be possible. Your thoughts?

360
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,964
Isn't it too dangerous?

361
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,010
If we push too hard and it's too fast,
it could veer into space.

362
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,638
Worst-case scenario,
you might crash right into the station.

363
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,474
We don't know exactly
what the mass properties

364
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,767
of the Maru are.

365
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,562
We don't understand
how the Maru will react

366
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,564
to specific forces in space.

367
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,732
We also

368
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,402
haven't calculated how much the thrusters
accelerate in space per second.

369
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,320
It's reckless.

370
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,238
Even the CTV, which is a cargo ship,

371
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,157
still takes four days to ascend.

372
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,367
There's a reason for that.

373
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,370
Considering we're transporting people,
a collision

374
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,707
would be catastrophic
for both the station and the rescue ship.

375
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,251
We have to find a safer way.

376
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,631
There are too many variables,
and we haven't tried this before.

377
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,260
While all that is true,
this is the fastest way to get to them.

378
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,430
Since we've had to scrap
all our original plans,

379
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,767
it will be our first time for everything.
The whole thing is a gamble.

380
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,893
There's another issue.

381
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,103
Even if you made it there,

382
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,606
their systems are down,
so we have to dock manually.

383
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,692
The odds of you docking alone
without help are slim.

384
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,403
If we at least had communication,

385
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,948
Eve could use the robot arm
from the tech module to secure the Maru

386
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,992
and dock it.

387
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,787
A robot arm was made
for delivery to Spain.

388
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,289
Isn't it at Hwasin Aerospace?

389
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,541
And it's compatible with the Maru.

390
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,045
Okay then,
if the station's robot arm can't help,

391
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:04,216
we can attach two robot arms
to the Maru and use them

392
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,176
to grab on to the station for docking.

393
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,385
Let's do it.

394
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,347
Let's get the okay from Spain and Hwasin
and take the arms, okay?

395
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,933
The Spanish company is private,
so I doubt they'll agree.

396
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:13,975
Call Santi.

397
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,603
The penalty is going to cost us a fortune.

398
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,396
Can we release the funds immediately?

399
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,107
Is he on the line?

400
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,317
What's taking so long?
Isn't he in Houston now?

401
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,321
07:50 P.M.
IN THE SKIES OVER NEW ORLEANS, USA

402
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,993
Is it Bongani? Is it?

403
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,372
Put him on speaker and…

404
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,041
And tell him we're on our way
to Florida right now.

405
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,418
If the rescue ship is ready,
we will get on it.

406
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,628
And that will be faster.

407
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,130
Okay.

408
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,259
Bongani?

409
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,344
Hey, Santi, this is Chief Kang.

410
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,223
Can you connect me
with the Spanish aerospace company?

411
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,058
The one that's supposed to get
the robot arms.

412
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,268
Of course.

413
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,061
Why? Why, Chief Kang?

414
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,604
We will lift off from Seoul today.

415
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,441
We will attach the robot arms
and manually dock to the station.

416
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,777
What? I'm coming with.

417
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,988
- I'm going too.
- I'm going to go too.

418
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,157
We were going to leave from Florida.

419
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,033
If you'll let me,

420
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,411
I want to go to rescue the commander
and the tourist too.

421
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,163
- Dr. Kang.
- Yes?

422
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,707
The robot arms are really expensive.

423
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,513
I'll buy them.

424
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,557
<i>We also have to pay a penalty.</i>

425
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,350
It's a drop in the bucket for me.

426
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,060
KING OF MONEY

427
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,146
Thanks for giving me
a chance to spend money.

428
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,939
Thank you, Chief.

429
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,150
How much would it cost?

430
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,319
Do not negotiate the price.

431
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,321
Double the price? Triple?

432
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,615
Tell them I will pay

433
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,867
whatever penalty fee they ask for, okay?

434
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,785
Okay.

435
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,995
<i>Santi, we're in a hurry.</i>

436
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,288
We need to get them ASAP.

437
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,582
You're talking
about the latest model, right?

438
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,752
<i>Anything to save</i>
<i>the commander and tourist.</i>

439
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,838
<i>I'll make it happen.</i>

440
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,090
- <i>We'll head to Seoul.</i>
- Okay.

441
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,761
Han Si-won,
find me a launch window for this mission.

442
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,678
Let's go.

443
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,555
And, Dong-a, go get ready to leave.

444
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,473
Okay.

445
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,647
Let's get ready to open.

446
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,611
You guys make the <i>jeon.</i>

447
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,656
How can you think of opening
on a day like this?

448
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,868
If we don't at least open,
I think I might go out of my mind.

449
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,122
Fine. Let's open for business.

450
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,964
This is messed up, seriously.

451
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,391
Let's serve noodles as well.

452
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,771
What's with this?

453
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,481
Damn this stupid thing.

454
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,652
You're built like a brick house,
but you can't even do that?

455
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,153
Press harder.

456
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,576
Screw this damn lighter!

457
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,413
And this damn gas stove
that's like a pile of space debris!

458
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,090
Where is it?

459
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,681
Hwa-ja, don't! Not the water!

460
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,391
Hwa-ja! Stop!

461
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,939
Hwa-ja!

462
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,192
I can't believe this.

463
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,156
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

464
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,616
Isn't that a fire?

465
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,035
Shouldn't we call 911?

466
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,746
What's going on?

467
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,122
This is Flavors of the…

468
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,250
Holy shit, we're screwed!

469
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,252
I'll do it!

470
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,390
- Oh, no!
- I can't believe this.

471
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,895
Oh, my God.

472
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,566
You have a severe second-degree burn.

473
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,818
You'll need to come every day

474
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,655
and have surgery
to remove the damaged tissue.

475
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,535
Why did you go there by yourself?

476
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,621
Give me back the car keys.

477
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,498
How are Ryong's mothers?

478
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,542
I saw their results. They're all fine.

479
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,884
It looks like she's done.

480
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,178
- Should we go in?
- Yes.

481
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,398
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

482
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,443
It was my hand that dropped the colander.
It should be my wrist that's hurt.

483
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,279
I feel terrible that someone like you
got hurt instead of me.

484
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,989
If Ryong finds out,

485
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,617
he'll be so mad at us.

486
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,579
Mothers,

487
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,749
come with me to see Ryong.

488
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,753
That's what I went there to tell you.

489
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,338
What?

490
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,425
MCC is going to send up a rescue ship.

491
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,179
Our Ryong is alive, right?

492
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,474
Of course he is. He has to be. He will be.

493
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,020
So come with me
so we can send Ryong some positive vibes.

494
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,651
Let's just have one of us go.

495
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,154
If the people there find out

496
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,574
that he has three mothers,
it would look so bad for him.

497
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,535
I'm the oldest, so I'll go.

498
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,288
That's a bad idea. You have a short fuse.

499
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,290
We need to think of Ryong's reputation.

500
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,167
I'm the prettiest, so I'll go.

501
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,586
You're a crybaby, so also not a good idea.

502
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,379
I'm the calmest, so I'll go.

503
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,341
The rescue ship
is about to leave for the ILS.

504
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,634
It's Chief Kang.

505
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,140
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,770
We're going to launch the Maru
toward the ILS orbit.

507
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,190
According to our calculations,
it will work if we launch toward Taiwan.

508
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,735
And it will fly over the Hong Kong
and Taiwan airspace on the way.

509
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,653
We need international cooperation.

510
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,197
<i>Okay. Don't worry.</i>

511
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,306
We took out the chairs, any excess items,
and pretty much all the equipment.

512
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,016
We even took out the toilet.

513
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,103
I think this is the first time
it's been emptied out to lose weight.

514
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,648
It's probably really light right now.

515
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,944
Hell, I should starve myself too.

516
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,821
Don't drink water, lose weight,

517
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,989
urinate and defecate everything out.

518
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,243
I might as well
shave my head too while I'm at it.

519
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,540
Keep your emotions in check.

520
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,667
Promise me.

521
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,254
Do everything by the book.
Follow the instructions in the manual.

522
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,048
If there's a problem,
follow the MCC's orders.

523
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,218
Don't you dare try to wing it.

524
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,428
The minute you try to improvise,

525
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,431
your chances of dying increase.
So promise me.

526
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,353
I promise.

527
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,607
If you die, it's all over.

528
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,859
You can't save Eve.

529
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,407
Geez, stop with your nagging.

530
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,373
Tae-hui.

531
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,878
I love Eve.

532
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,015
I'm really sorry.

533
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,275
Come back in one piece.
You can apologize to me then.

534
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,905
You were just going to sneak off anyway.

535
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,913
Here, take this, you punk.

536
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,387
Bring them back no matter what.

537
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,973
You better…

538
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,019
come back alive too. I'll be waiting.

539
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,810
GONG RYONG'S 10TH DAY

540
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,979
ILS 8:30, SEOUL 17:30

541
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,189
STRANDED FOR 50 HOURS

542
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,403
08:40 P.M.
20 MINUTES TO THE MARU LAUNCH

543
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,034
Yeah, we're here.

544
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,341
Those little…

545
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,554
- Hurry up, you guys.
- Dona looks like she's going to kill us.

546
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,690
Over here.

547
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,110
After floating around
like Superman for months,

548
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,862
you think gravity's a joke?

549
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,407
Are you trying to get yourselves killed
running around like that?

550
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,117
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

551
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,954
- Slowly.
- Hurry and get them inside.

552
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,831
Are you crazy?

553
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,273
One minute to Maru launch.

554
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,816
Park Dong-a.

555
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,278
This is going to be
the fastest spacecraft you've been on.

556
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,613
You have to get through it.

557
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,572
Copy.

558
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,533
Stop worrying. Just get me
as close as you can to the ILS.

559
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,286
<i>In 12 minutes, I'll be safely in space.</i>

560
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,705
Be careful.

561
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,499
Good luck.

562
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,792
Ten seconds to launch.

563
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,710
Ten,

564
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,045
nine,

565
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,296
eight,

566
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,298
seven, six,

567
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,883
five,

568
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,176
four,

569
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,178
three, two,

570
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,013
one, zero.

571
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,515
- Liftoff.
- Liftoff.

572
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,496
Starting pitch maneuver at 300 m.

573
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,456
PITCH MANEUVER:
ADJUSTING SPACECRAFT'S NOSE

574
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,125
UP OR DOWN TO CHANGE TRAJECTORY

575
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,219
Altitude 6.8 km, speed 1,839 km per hour.

576
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,304
The spacecraft
has reached supersonic speed.

577
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,474
It has reached max q.

578
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,226
POINT OF MAXIMUM AERODYNAMIC PRESSURE

579
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,104
<i>Altitude 11 km, speed 2,187 km per hour.</i>

580
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,528
What's going on?

581
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,905
There's too much vibration!

582
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,074
Maybe the robot arms are throwing it off.

583
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,580
Come on.

584
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,924
Altitude 59 km.
First-stage separation confirmed.

585
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,683
- What's that?
- What is it?

586
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,476
Wasn't the first stage separation
a success?

587
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,899
The life support system
on ILS has shut down.

588
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,151
The oxygen generator is off
and there's no power.

589
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,277
They're no longer…

590
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,155
getting oxygen.

591
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,751
Eve.

592
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,128
Oh, God, Ryong.

593
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,105
Faster!

594
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,317
We have to go faster!

595
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,361
<i>Fairing separation.</i>

596
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,453
We lost one of the robot arms.

597
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,704
Shit, already?

598
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,623
Is this going to mess up the whole plan?

599
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,500
<i>One arm will be enough.</i>

600
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,128
You can manage with one arm?

601
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,547
At least we have one.
I've done it without before.

602
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:45,012
Altitude 400 km. The spacecraft
is rapidly climbing to the target.

603
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,615
Current speed is 31,300 km per hour.

604
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,567
<i>Approaching within</i>
<i>a 2 km radius of the station.</i>

605
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,947
Extending robot arm.

606
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,261
Farther, just a little farther.

607
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,515
Approaching within 200 m
of ILS's keepout area.

608
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,267
I know you can do it.

609
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,235
Now! Grab it!

610
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,245
Got it!

611
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,512
It's too much for one arm.
The robot arm won't hold!

612
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,056
The Maru will be flung out of orbit.

613
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,100
I'm going to connect the docking probe.

614
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,851
I have to dock right away.

615
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,446
<i>The soft capture latch</i>
<i>has grabbed the probe tip.</i>

616
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,614
<i>Hard capture confirmed.</i>

617
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,200
All eight hooks are engaged.

618
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,077
Docking confirmed.

619
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,297
<i>Once repressurized,</i>
<i>I'll enter the station.</i>

620
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,482
Oh, my God.

621
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,947
CO2 levels inside the station

622
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,866
are 2,010.

623
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,997
Eve, just hold on a little longer.

624
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,466
To stay alive, they'd be
in the observation module.

625
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,550
<i>Hurry.</i>

626
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,268
Opening the observation module hatch.

627
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,794
<i>It's a portable oxygen tank.</i>

628
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,561
Ryong.

629
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,521
Ryong.

630
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,440
- Ryong…
<i>- Mr. Gong.</i>

631
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,067
Mr. Gong?

632
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,032
<i>Is he alive?</i>

633
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,201
Yes, he's alive.

634
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,411
Ryong.

635
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,872
Do you see Eve? What about Eve?

636
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,458
Is there another tent?
Shine the light to the left.

637
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,897
What's that pink…

638
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,788
I found her.

639
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,541
Eve, hold on a little longer.

640
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,044
It's okay now. You made it.

641
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,422
Just hang on a little longer, Eve.

642
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,540
Good job!

643
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,377
They did good.

644
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,337
They both did good.

645
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,173
You have to do that to survive.

646
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,384
You have to stick together like that.

647
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,761
Is that right?

648
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,514
Should they have frozen to death alone?

649
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,308
That position is standard procedure.

650
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,768
Right.

651
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,522
What are you doing?
Snap out of it, Dong-a!

652
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,357
Oh, right.

653
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,443
Eve!

654
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,445
Eve, are you okay?

655
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,326
She's alive. She made it.

656
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,120
Eve, can you see me?

657
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,212
I can't tell if they're conscious or not.

658
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,673
<i>They're hypothermic.</i>
<i>Hurry and get them to the Maru.</i>

659
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,781
Eve.

660
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,701
Are you awake? Are you okay?

661
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,038
Dong-a.

662
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,123
Yeah.

663
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,417
How did you get here?

664
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,419
Thank you.

665
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,422
Thank you for staying alive, Eve.

666
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,136
Let's go home.

667
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,806
It's time to go home.

668
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,141
Don't worry about a thing.

669
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,143
It won't be long now.

670
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:22,905
Mr. Gong.

671
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,203
You're going to be fine now.

672
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,831
<i>Your fiancée has been</i>
<i>worried sick about you.</i>

673
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,502
<i>She and your mother</i>
<i>are watching from the MCC.</i>

674
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,632
Mom.

675
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,344
<i>Ryong, are you okay?</i>

676
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,471
Mom.

677
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,098
<i>Go-eun's here.</i>

678
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,977
Go-eun.

679
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,812
I miss you, Ryong.

680
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,650
We're going to be…

681
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,195
together again soon.

682
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,282
I love you.

683
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,008
Their safe return is our top priority.

684
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,510
The suits aren't the right size,

685
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,429
and the seats haven't been
customized to their bodies.

686
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,350
To withstand the vibrations at reentry,
we have to time the departure exactly.

687
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,685
Calculate the deorbit burn.

688
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,978
Okay.

689
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,396
ENGINE FIRING FOR REENTRY

690
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,608
To avoid shock during reentry,

691
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,652
ensure they've had enough oxygen therapy.

692
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,954
<i>Undocking complete.</i>

693
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,582
<i>In eight hours, the closest approach</i>
<i>to South Korean waters</i>

694
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,418
will be at 09 hours,
12 minutes and 45 seconds.

695
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,337
It will then initiate its final burn
to begin reentry.

696
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,758
<i>All right, let's meet</i>
<i>on Earth tomorrow, everyone.</i>

697
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,762
See you then.

698
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,056
Stay safe.

699
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,935
<i>The Maru has just begun to slow down</i>

700
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,770
<i>and adjust its orbit.</i>

701
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,315
<i>It will soon reenter Earth's atmosphere.</i>

702
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:25,277
<i>It is expected to land</i>
<i>300 km south of Mara Island.</i>

703
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,780
<i>We'll be there</i>
<i>to cover every emotional moment</i>

704
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,116
<i>as these astronauts and the tourist</i>

705
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,577
<i>make their dramatic return to Earth.</i>

706
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,872
<i>However, the Maru</i>
<i>has not completed a return test,</i>

707
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,041
<i>so they're still not out of the woods.</i>

708
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,002
Now comes the most dangerous part.

709
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,588
Yes, that's correct.
Before entering the atmosphere,

710
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,757
the trunk needs to be detached.

711
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,926
This allows the thick heat shield
on the bottom of the spacecraft

712
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,554
to tilt downward
at a 30-degree angle for reentry.

713
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,432
As you can see on the screen,
it must descend in that position

714
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,518
<i>to withstand the 1600-degree Celsius heat</i>

715
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,687
<i>and incredible speed of Mach 25.</i>

716
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,314
- Oh, God.
- Why is it so hot?

717
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:06,318
<i>Once it slows down to 500 km per hour,</i>
<i>they can deploy the parachute.</i>

718
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,862
<i>- If for any reason…</i>
- The parachute has to open.

719
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:12,658
<i>If it isn't positioned correctly as it</i>
<i>enters the atmosphere, it won't be able</i>

720
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,867
<i>to slow down…</i>

721
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,161
What do those idiots know?

722
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,664
Why are they spewing
all that gloom and doom?

723
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,624
<i>Let's take a look at the images again.</i>

724
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,795
<i>Trunk separation confirmed.</i>

725
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,755
<i>The impact from the explosion was mild.</i>

726
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:30,300
Eve, Mr. Gong, you guys handling it okay?

727
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,260
Yes.

728
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,220
Yes.

729
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,722
<i>The Maru is entering the atmosphere.</i>
<i>Prepare for impact.</i>

730
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,078
The Maru has appeared on radar.

731
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,377
Isn't it coming in too fast?

732
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,005
What does that mean?

733
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,090
Oh, it's nothing.

734
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,266
Ryong!

735
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,602
What's going on?

736
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,940
Look outside!

737
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,822
What's happening?

738
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,198
<i>Holy hell!</i>

739
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,201
The trunk is still attached.

740
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,898
Ryong.

741
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,859
My baby.

742
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,195
What was that trunk separation
confirmation about?

743
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,864
The Maru's control system malfunctioned.

744
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,908
That's why it didn't detect it.

745
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,206
My chest…

746
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,457
It's too hot.

747
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,003
If we don't slow down,

748
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,713
we'll overheat from the friction!

749
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,256
Let's deploy the parachute!

750
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,966
Deploy it and slow this thing down!

751
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,719
<i>It will incinerate at this speed</i>
<i>if you deploy it now.</i>

752
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,304
You want to bring home corpses?

753
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,889
Just hold on a little longer!

754
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,724
The trunk will burn off soon.

755
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,310
We're going to die from the heat!

756
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,020
I'm deploying the parachute!

757
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,607
The trunk has separated!

758
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,371
What happened to them?

759
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,373
Ryong?

760
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:49,791
Are they on radar?

761
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,501
I can't believe this.

762
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,294
<i>This is the Maru</i>

763
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,505
<i>reporting.</i>

764
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,008
The time is 10:14:19.

765
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,722
Commander Eve,

766
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,684
tourist Gong Ryong…

767
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,896
and pilot Park Dong-a

768
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,816
have all

769
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,861
safely returned.

770
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,158
Way to go, Park Dong-a.

771
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,536
You did it, Commander.

772
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,038
You made it, Gong Ryong.

773
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,002
Thank you!

774
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,185
Thank you.

775
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,147
Thanks to you,
I've experienced both heaven and hell.

776
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,733
I'm Park Dong-a.

777
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,121
Do either of you feel nauseous?

778
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,916
No, I'm okay…

779
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,841
It's okay, puke it all out.

780
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,301
We're on Earth.

781
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,429
It's okay to puke, you know?

782
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,641
Throw up everything you ate in space!

783
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,227
Puke your guts out! Empty it all out!

784
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,605
While you're at it,
empty out every crevice in your body!

785
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,650
This is Earth, people.

786
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,068
It's okay to puke.

787
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,862
We're on Earth.

788
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,407
We're alive!

789
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,142
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

790
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,439
<i>How did you two manage to withstand</i>
<i>the cold of space until the very end?</i>

791
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,026
Don't get it confused.
You're with Choi Go-eun.

792
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,779
<i>And Eve is with me.</i>

793
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,782
<i>They will investigate the accident.</i>

794
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,075
Chairman Choi!

795
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,702
You did good.

796
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,870
You did great, Ryong.

797
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,080
<i>I saw you two</i>
<i>right before you were rescued.</i>

798
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:39,998
Did you kiss?

799
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,917
<i>Who the hell are you to make Go-eun cry?</i>

800
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,127
<i>What about her feelings?</i>

801
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,172
Go-eun, don't waste your time
on an opportunist like me.

802
