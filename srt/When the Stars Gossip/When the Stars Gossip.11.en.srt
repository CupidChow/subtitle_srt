NATIONAL CENTER
FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

3
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,304
<i>There's no information available</i>
<i>on your biological parents.</i>

4
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,391
<i>1988, Christmas Eve.</i>

5
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,353
<i>You were found in a taxi</i>
<i>near Chuncheon Station.</i>

6
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>The police couldn't identify your parents</i>
<i>when you were brought in.</i>

7
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,275
<i>Even after, there is no record</i>

8
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,570
<i>of your biological parents</i>
<i>trying to find you.</i>

9
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,366
<i>I'm sorry I can't give you better news.</i>

10
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,195
Anything worth a read?

11
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,990
SPACE, CRISIS, RESCUE, RETURN

12
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,435
- Ryong.
- Yeah?

13
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,187
Can you grant us one wish?

14
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,981
What is it?

15
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,484
Don't ever leave Earth again.

16
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,195
Don't go to space or anywhere like that.

17
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,992
It's not a place you can go
whenever you feel like it.

18
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,744
Still…

19
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,787
Okay, fine.

20
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,333
While you were at that station,
we were so freaked out

21
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,294
about you dying in space
that we lost our minds

22
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,713
and almost burned the place down
getting ready.

23
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,798
Didn't you see the bandage
on Ms. Choi's arm?

24
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,968
She got injured trying to save us, Ryong.

25
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,804
She didn't tell you?

26
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,642
I guess not.

27
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,227
My goodness.

28
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,438
You should properly thank her.

29
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,689
You will, right?

30
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,107
Yes, I will.

31
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,446
Ryong.

32
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,075
When you get married, forget about us.

33
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,493
Live happily, just you two.

34
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,582
Tell Ms. Choi she doesn't
have a mother-in-law.

35
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,626
Got it?

36
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,295
I'm sleepy.

37
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,885
Why are you hitting him?
He barely made it back alive.

38
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,762
Do you know why I hit you?

39
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,099
I think you know why.

40
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,935
I don't know.

41
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,145
You're turning your back to us
because you know.

42
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,689
I said I don't know.

43
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,900
You'd better listen to me carefully.

44
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,778
If you take your pants off
for anyone but Ms. Choi,

45
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,280
I'll kill you myself.

46
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,823
Ryong took his pants off?

47
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,741
Somewhere else? Why did he do that?

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,660
Alone?

49
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,496
Did you see him take his pants off?

50
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,707
Hey!

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,624
He's still--

52
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:56,421
You can take everything else off,
but you better keep your pants on.

53
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:00,174
No matter how badly,
how desperately you want to take them off,

54
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,427
if you don't take them off
in the wrong place,

55
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,263
you can achieve great things.

56
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,390
Understand what I'm saying?

57
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,808
Answer me.

58
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,644
- Aren't you going to answer me?
- Damn it.

59
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,729
Do you know how old I am?

60
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,522
So what? What about your age?

61
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,066
Forget it.

62
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,069
See? You have nothing to say.

63
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,029
Whatever.

64
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,197
Unbelievable.

65
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,159
What was that all about?

66
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,535
- Damn it.
- Geez.

67
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,372
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

68
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,011
<i>You asked about my plans</i>
<i>after I get discharged.</i>

69
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,598
I want to be done with you.
That's my plan.

70
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,831
We were about to die,

71
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,420
and we said to each other,

72
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,506
"Let's date."

73
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,093
Now that

74
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,138
we're here on Earth,
there's plenty of oxygen and hot food.

75
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,308
Now that we're in a position

76
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,477
to do whatever we want,

77
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,271
you're going to end it?

78
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,485
You want to end it?

79
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,695
Why?

80
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,657
Now that you're back here,

81
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,994
are you ashamed
that you slept with a guy like me?

82
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,958
As commander, you want to be successful
and move up in the world.

83
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,503
Are you embarrassed you had sex
with a tourist on your first assignment?

84
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,925
Is offering a plausible excuse
supposed to be a final act of kindness?

85
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,845
"He's not the kind of guy
I'd date on Earth."

86
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,433
"He'd only hold me back.
I should get rid of him."

87
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,106
So, one last time.

88
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,236
You're ashamed

89
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,533
of what we did. Is that it?

90
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,174
Let's just say that I am.

91
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,970
It was just a one-night stand.

92
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,026
Okay, let's end it.

93
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,695
Fine.

94
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,534
You know what? I'm sick of you too.

95
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,457
If I had died up there,

96
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,212
I would've died happy,
thinking we loved each other.

97
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,385
You're basically saying,
"Eat this and get lost."

98
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,473
Say something.

99
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,860
I'm never going to eat
cup noodles ever again.

100
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,127
No, don't think about it.

101
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,547
That was the only way to end it.

102
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,934
MZ MEDICAL CENTER OB-GYN
DR. GONG RYONG, ROOM 3

103
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,937
Lee Mina.

104
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,938
Yes?

105
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,314
I'll be right back.

106
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,032
Come in.

107
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,165
He's a real doctor.

108
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,085
Didn't you go to Dr. Jeon
for outpatient care?

109
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,295
Yi-man was disappointed.

110
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:51,549
Yes, but Eve still goes to Dr. Jeon.

111
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,801
I told her to change doctors,
but she said no.

112
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,222
She's also waiting outside.

113
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,436
Having my period was a pain in the butt,
so I started taking medication

114
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,812
about three months ago,

115
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,314
but I've been getting headaches.

116
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,068
Medications don't work the same way
in space as they do on Earth.

117
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,153
Be careful.

118
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,197
If your estradiol level is 90,

119
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,160
it's almost back to normal,
so just wait a little bit longer.

120
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,911
Okay.

121
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,917
But what brings you here, Seung-jun?

122
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,294
It's not like you're married.

123
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,505
Thank you, Ryong.

124
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,634
I washed it for you.

125
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,553
Thank you.

126
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,598
How did the lottery ticket
end up with you?

127
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,642
We thought for sure Dr. Kang had it.

128
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,686
We thought it wasn't meant to be,
so we had given up on it.

129
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,855
We feel terrible for coming down first.

130
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,441
We're just thankful
you both made it back alive.

131
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,818
I can't believe
the ticket made it in one piece too.

132
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,403
I'm still in a state of shock.

133
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,529
It's amazing.

134
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,865
So,

135
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,911
what happens to the things we left behind?

136
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,748
In a few days, the IOU will head up there
and conduct a thorough search.

137
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,377
Why do you ask?

138
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,967
I lost my phone and looked all over
the airlock for it, but it wasn't there.

139
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,096
It would be bad if someone saw it.

140
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,015
I'm not sure if
it got sucked into the engine explosion

141
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,392
or if it flew into space.

142
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,062
Do you think the IOU will find my phone?

143
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,940
It's a mess there.
They can't find something that small.

144
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,066
You think?

145
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,944
It took a year to find the lottery ticket.

146
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,406
If it's stuck somewhere in space,
it will be impossible to find.

147
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,449
I lived there for a year,
so I'm quite sure.

148
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,370
We're going up next,
so we'll find it and send it to you.

149
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,956
Please, I would really appreciate it.

150
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,750
When did you say
you last had some spotting?

151
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,252
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday?

152
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,879
- A lot?
- No, just a little.

153
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,842
But I've never experienced this before.

154
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,554
I have a slight fever,
and my breasts feel heavy.

155
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,140
I also feel a dull pain
that comes and goes.

156
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,355
Gravity adaptation seems to cause symptoms
that mimic early pregnancy.

157
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,023
I'm not pregnant.

158
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,152
Of course not.
I'm not saying you're pregnant.

159
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,280
It's just that there was nothing
out of the ordinary in the results.

160
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,823
And your period?

161
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,202
Well, I sometimes skip a month.
I'm pretty irregular.

162
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,871
Okay.

163
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,666
We did one last time,
but how about we do another ultrasound?

164
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,834
Okay.

165
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,173
I examined you just in case
there was a problem with your uterus.

166
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,761
But as you can see,
there's nothing abnormal.

167
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,930
Thank you, Doctor.

168
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,101
You're probably under a lot of stress
from what you've gone through

169
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,813
at the space station and
are now undergoing gravity adjustment.

170
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,773
So, you should eat whatever you want,

171
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,443
get a lot of sleep,
and spend time with good people.

172
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,237
- Then you'll feel better in no time.
- Okay.

173
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,115
When did you say you were going back up?

174
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,243
In about two weeks,
but that could be pushed back a few days.

175
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,747
If you have any questions
after you go back up, feel free to ask.

176
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,749
Thank you.

177
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,626
EXAMINATION ROOM 3

178
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,882
- Hello.
- Hi.

179
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,509
Are you feeling okay?

180
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,428
How's the new medication working out?

181
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,161
Are you crying again?

182
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,791
Who's crying?

183
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,876
I refuse to cry.

184
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,255
I won't use tears to win him back.

185
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,217
Then what will you use?

186
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:33,455
If it's too tough,
you can bow just 7 or 21 times.

187
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,712
Even 108 prostrations
aren't enough for you.

188
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,756
You need to bow 1,080 times.

189
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:48,304
The number 108
represents the 108 sufferings

190
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,141
that afflict humans
across the past, present, and future.

191
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,811
If you've come to pray
for Choi Dong-hun's peaceful rebirth

192
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,563
and forget your agony,

193
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,733
as well as let go
of all your worldly attachments,

194
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,862
then performing 108 prostrations
is a way to release those burdens

195
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,697
according to the Buddha's teachings.

196
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>Aspiration for rebirth in the Pure Land</i>

197
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,424
<i>I bow to Amitabha Buddha</i>

198
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,678
<i>Who resides in the Pure Land</i>

199
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,432
<i>And guides sentient beings</i>

200
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:38,479
<i>I aspire to be reborn in that world</i>

201
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:44,109
<i>Please look upon me</i>
<i>With your compassion and mercy</i>

202
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,674
Did you know
this was an arranged introduction?

203
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,343
Do you know who I am?

204
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:15,015
I came knowing that you were
the MZ Group chairman's only daughter.

205
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,314
I've only heard bad things about you.

206
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,151
I've heard all sorts of rumors.

207
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,778
SECRETARY GO

208
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,665
I hate leaving things unfinished.

209
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,168
If I do 108 prostrations,

210
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,881
all of my 108 agonies
are supposed to go away.

211
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,717
So even if I destroy my knees,

212
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,303
I want to do all 108.

213
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,393
I don't want to hear
a strange man breathing,

214
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,190
and my own heavy breathing even less so.

215
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,028
Isn't it nice?

216
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,115
You're being rude to the Buddha.

217
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,743
Either answer it or turn it off.

218
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,499
Buddha, you're always listening
to people chanting prayers.

219
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,667
Isn't this music a nice change?

220
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,258
I think it's nice.

221
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,011
Turn it off before one of the monks comes.

222
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,472
The Buddha says he likes it.

223
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,849
What?

224
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,315
The Buddha is smiling.

225
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,985
He's angry.

226
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,864
He looks angry to me.

227
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,797
Then let's just say he's angry with you

228
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,967
but smiling at me.

229
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,805
Do you like that song?

230
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,936
That ringtone

231
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,065
is a song my brother used to sing to me.

232
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,447
It's my first time at a temple.

233
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,367
To be honest,
I've been interested in you for a while.

234
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,621
"She's the pretty daughter
of the MZ Group chairman."

235
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,457
"Totally my style."
That's all I used to think.

236
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,542
Your brother's shoes.

237
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,381
The huge shoes you had to fill
must've been a burden, but you did it.

238
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,467
In fact, it blew me away how well you did.

239
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,511
I kept thinking about you.

240
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,723
I wanted to meet you.

241
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,187
So, this going to space thing.

242
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,606
Why do you keep going back and forth?

243
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,815
To show off?

244
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,073
Do you see that up there?

245
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,699
What?

246
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,244
Look at my fingertip.

247
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,288
Do you see that star at my fingertip?

248
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,416
See that big square over there?

249
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,336
- That's Pegasus.
- Yes.

250
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,296
Do you see Aquarius below it?

251
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,258
To the left is Cetus, the Whale,

252
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,176
and above it is Pisces.

253
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,302
That's Aries.

254
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,807
And that thing above Aries
that looks like a person

255
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,394
is the void left by your brother.

256
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,618
Can I fill the void he left?

257
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,706
The song he used to sing to you.

258
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,292
I'll sing it for you.

259
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,217
Come on, let's go.

260
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,305
Above Aries

261
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,265
is Perseus.

262
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,019
Who do you think you're fooling?

263
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:52,978
"Fill the void"?

264
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,271
Let's go.

265
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,289
Is that kosher?

266
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,874
Well, it is in the manual.

267
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,975
Hello?

268
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,810
<i>Mr. Gong?</i>

269
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,229
What time do you finish today?

270
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,316
Can you come here after work?
I have a favor to ask.

271
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,527
I'll be there by seven.

272
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,530
Okay.

273
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,372
- I'm back.
- Okay.

274
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,959
- You're eating some, right?
- Yeah.

275
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,465
By the way,
should we just leave that as is?

276
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,424
What do you mean?

277
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,344
I mean, when they start
the accident investigation,

278
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,721
we have to submit all this to the IOU.

279
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,015
That's a little…

280
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,935
That's a little what?

281
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,481
What I mean is, it's…

282
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,524
It looks like

283
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,026
the two of them had sex.

284
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,662
I'm not saying they did have sex.

285
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,622
Just that it looks like it.

286
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,584
Stop playing word games.

287
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,420
Even mice, the most prolific breeders
of all mammals,

288
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,172
couldn't manage to do it.

289
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,967
There's no way humans could have had sex.

290
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,802
But their expressions…

291
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,140
That's the expression
of someone who's just had sex.

292
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,187
Do you… sleep like that?

293
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,981
There's something weird about it.

294
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,358
When we saw them for the first time,

295
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,903
everyone here was stunned.
It was like we were struck by lightning.

296
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,031
Honestly, we all thought
it was a bit strange.

297
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,659
I hate to say this,

298
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,454
but if male and female mummies
were discovered in that state,

299
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,040
I bet archaeologists

300
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,127
would report that they had discovered
the mummies of lovers.

301
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,212
Hey, they were running out of oxygen.

302
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,174
They were going to
either live or die together.

303
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,384
Even enemies would feel a connection.

304
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,303
Should they have faced away
from each other

305
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:36,391
and looked disgusted while facing
the prospect of freezing to death?

306
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,144
It's because the commander
acted out of character.

307
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,438
Think about the commander we know.

308
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,941
I get that she stripped down
to save him according to the manual.

309
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,486
But then she would've held him tightly
like a soldier would.

310
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,323
But look.

311
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,868
She's nestled in his arms.

312
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,662
This…

313
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,373
This is really weird.

314
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,293
You better keep your mouth shut.

315
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,587
In the IOU,
sex between astronauts is taboo.

316
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,050
No human has ever attempted
to have sex in space.

317
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,095
What's wrong with trying?

318
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,397
Dong-a.

319
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,523
You're already here.

320
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,109
- I ordered for you.
- Good, thanks.

321
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,948
It's a beautiful day.

322
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,617
- I know, it's really nice.
- Yeah.

323
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,535
Can't believe I'm on Earth.

324
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,710
You're heading back to space soon.

325
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,256
Why don't you reconsider?

326
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,298
It's too soon.

327
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,760
I left in the middle of a mission.
I need to get back and finish.

328
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,639
Santi and the IOU team
will handle the repairs.

329
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,682
Right.

330
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,735
Stay with me a bit longer.

331
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,529
Come to Houston with me.

332
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,658
Relax for a while.
You could go back up in a year or two.

333
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,495
It feels like I ran off
without finishing my work.

334
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,788
How could I relax?

335
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,375
And…

336
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,712
I'm not staying with you.

337
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,673
I keep thinking about Chief Kang.

338
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,972
You will forever be my mentor and hero.

339
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,558
The greatest astronaut I know.

340
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,227
So don't hang your head like that.

341
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,815
- Eve--
- Just treat me like a valued colleague.

342
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,819
That way I can always respect
and root for you.

343
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,197
You risked your life to save us.
I will never, ever forget that.

344
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:02,203
I don't care about being a hero,
getting your respect, or any of that.

345
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,208
That thing with Chief Kang
was just a mistake.

346
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,044
Chief Kang is amazing.

347
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,797
She has more experience with men
and is way more popular.

348
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,633
You've always had feelings for her.

349
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,510
She just wasn't interested at the time.

350
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,095
It's not like I didn't know.

351
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,638
Let's be honest here.

352
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,725
You're pushing me away
because you're interested in another guy.

353
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,393
Chief Kang is just an excuse.

354
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,232
You and the tourist, right?

355
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,196
That bastard.

356
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,740
Can we just end this cordially?

357
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,992
With dignity.

358
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,371
We work in the same industry,
so our paths will always cross.

359
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,750
So with civility and dignity,
accept that it was just one mistake.

360
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:53,505
Can't you just look the other way?

361
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,966
You can't because you like some other guy.

362
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,968
Just be honest with yourself.

363
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,809
Fine.

364
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,272
Right.

365
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,819
The only way to end this
is to become sworn enemies.

366
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,196
That's how a breakup should be.

367
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,781
Okay.

368
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,617
From now on, we'll be enemies.

369
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,795
Did you enjoy being there at the end,
just the two of you?

370
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,088
Did you?

371
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,100
You fucking idiot.

372
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,072
How is your health?

373
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,199
I'm fine now.

374
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,579
By the way, we're having dinner
with the crew tomorrow.

375
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,665
You should come.
You're part of the family.

376
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,917
Is that the favor you wanted to ask?

377
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,420
Hang on, I'll explain when she comes.

378
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,547
Is someone else coming?

379
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,091
Come in.

380
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,645
You're not going to say hi to each other?

381
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,689
She told me not to acknowledge her.

382
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,024
Really?

383
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,442
Why did you say that?

384
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,653
Did you two have a fight?

385
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,448
Did Mr. Gong do something wrong?

386
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,784
No, I didn't do anything wrong.

387
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,120
Then why are you acting like that?
You two faced death together.

388
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,873
If you're mad at each other, talk it out.

389
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,795
Now, I need a minute-by-minute account
of everything that happened

390
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,048
in the last three days
when it was just the two of you.

391
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,383
I'll need separate reports
from each of you.

392
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,802
Make sure you submit one.

393
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,263
The astronauts leaving
for the space station investigation

394
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,432
would like to take your reports with them.

395
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,102
They said it was necessary
to conduct a more efficient investigation.

396
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,687
It's mandatory.

397
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,441
You're the only ones who know
what happened inside the station.

398
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,320
It's to prevent accidents like this
from happening again.

399
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,197
You're the only ones who came back alive.

400
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,492
We have to record everything
for the safety of those who go after you.

401
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,451
Any questions?

402
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,161
Go ahead.

403
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,663
Can't the commander write it alone?

404
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,084
Weren't you alone for quite a while
before the commander went out

405
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,752
to rescue you?

406
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,504
Who's going to record that?

407
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,092
It doesn't matter
if everyone's memory is different.

408
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,845
We can glean a lot from both perspectives.

409
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,558
We need to hear it from both the tourist's
and the commander's point of view.

410
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,684
Understood.

411
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:57,397
Of course, it will be painful to recount
every minute of something

412
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,275
that nearly killed you,
but it's something you have to do.

413
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,361
That's part of your duty as a tourist.

414
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,738
Write everything truthfully,
exactly as it happened.

415
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,366
Don't change or leave anything out. Okay?

416
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,703
Write everything exactly as it happened?

417
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,079
That's without question.

418
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:18,501
Write everything truthfully,
exactly as it happened, minute-by-minute.

419
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,504
Okay.

420
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,683
Make sure you leave
those three parts out, okay?

421
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,435
Leave them out and send it to me.

422
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,271
Then I'll clean up those parts

423
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,774
and write some lie
to fill in whatever is missing.

424
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,942
Got it?

425
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,112
What three parts exactly?

426
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,619
As if you don't know.

427
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,703
I don't know.

428
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,457
Now, who was it that wanted to deny
what happened up there?

429
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,083
I thought it was over.

430
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,919
I don't remember anything.

431
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,422
Are you really going to be like this?

432
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,049
This is work.

433
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,968
This document is going to be
a part of space history.

434
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,929
Now, listen to me carefully, Mr. Gong.

435
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,597
You need to write this properly

436
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,017
with a sense of responsibility and duty
so it helps future astronauts.

437
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,143
Got it?

438
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,811
Oh, I'm so scared.

439
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,190
Fine.

440
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,249
What did Mr. Gong say?

441
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,295
Didn't you go to the OB-GYN
to get your results?

442
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,048
Yeah, he said everything's fine.

443
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,885
So did you keep his legs still?

444
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,554
What?

445
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,182
Why did he want you to hold his legs?

446
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,102
He gave the ticket back
because you did it, right?

447
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,606
I didn't do anything. He just…

448
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,651
He didn't ask me to do anything.

449
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,445
He just gave it to you?

450
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,530
Yes.

451
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,867
He was trying to run some tests
for his project,

452
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,536
and the debris hit.

453
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,329
So he couldn't do it, that's all.

454
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,212
Hey, instead of going home,
let's go eat something expensive.

455
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,964
We're rich now.

456
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,280
<i>Make sure you leave</i>
<i>those three parts out, okay?</i>

457
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,597
Damn it.

458
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,464
EVE

459
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,054
Hello?

460
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,597
Are you writing it?

461
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,600
You said it was a part of space history.

462
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,772
I get the part about leaving out
the kissing and having sex,

463
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,899
but what's the other thing?

464
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,402
Like I said,
just don't think about those parts.

465
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,989
Don't I at least need to know what it is
so I can leave it out?

466
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,699
I'm hanging up.

467
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,955
How the hell
am I supposed to know what to do?

468
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:46,894
I was in the observation module.

469
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,940
Because I hid the morula in the incubator…

470
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,191
EVE

471
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,657
Okay, the part when you were alone
in the observation module at the end.

472
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,867
What did you write for that?

473
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,743
<i>You hid the morula in the incubator.</i>

474
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,330
You were late because you dawdled
while trying to unplug the incubator.

475
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,374
<i>You're not going to write that, are you?</i>

476
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,211
I wrote that the bathroom door
was broken and wouldn't open,

477
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,423
so I struggled with it,
which is why I was late.

478
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,009
Santi knows that the door
was always getting stuck.

479
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,011
No, no, you can't write it like that.

480
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,888
I already told Chief Kang

481
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,141
that you were late
because you were trying to get the camera.

482
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,643
How am I supposed to know

483
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,437
whether you lied or not?

484
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,025
You know, you didn't exactly
explain things to me nicely and patiently.

485
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,111
You threatened to end things
before we were even discharged.

486
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,572
Why should I have to do this

487
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,700
<i>with someone who is ashamed</i>
<i>to have been with me?</i>

488
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,786
Okay. So this is
what we're going to write.

489
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,623
Write down everything I say.
"The camera was"--

490
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,208
Yeah, I'll write what I want.

491
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,408
Is this your hideout?

492
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,206
Have some decency.
Does this look like your house?

493
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,584
Why do you go around
dressed like you own the place?

494
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,920
Back to your old nagging ways?

495
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,383
It's before seven. It's not like
there's anyone here to see me.

496
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,676
Why are you staying here?

497
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,512
I thought that maybe
you'd be here these days.

498
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,057
You sometimes stay here
on the top floor instead of at home.

499
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,476
Looked like you were renovating.

500
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,728
Building a love nest?

501
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,276
I came here because
my dad was getting on my nerves.

502
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,236
Now I can't stay
because you're getting on my nerves.

503
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,363
I know you like the back of my hand.

504
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,531
Whatever.

505
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,911
I have something to ask.

506
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,996
Ask away.

507
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,375
What happened up there
between the commander and Ryong?

508
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,382
That's a question for him.

509
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,177
Even if they work out, you have no chance.

510
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,309
Whether Ryong and Eve end up together,

511
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,437
or you and Ryong end up together,
it's all the same to me.

512
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,732
I only have eyes for you.

513
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,445
There aren't many men
who could stick it out by your side.

514
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,992
There are very few people in the world
who could give you what you want.

515
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,369
Find someone like that,
not a jerk like Ryong,

516
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,454
and I'll let you go.

517
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,124
Go back up and get some sleep.

518
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,129
If the boss works too hard,
everyone else will slack off.

519
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,173
Your skin looks terrible.

520
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,231
Damn it.

521
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:44,882
ACCIDENT REPORT
GONG RYONG

522
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,143
EVE

523
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,120
<i>How much have you written?</i>

524
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,622
<i>I'm hard at work…</i>

525
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,170
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU WRITTEN?

526
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,634
Okay, then I'll let Chairman Choi know

527
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,386
he is free to do as he pleases.

528
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,974
Goodbye.

529
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:46,527
Okay, one, ten, hundred, thousand,
ten thousand, hundred thousand, million.

530
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,821
Ten million.

531
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,240
One hundred million!

532
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,034
He gave us this money to buy one outfit?

533
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,661
Hwa-ja, that's 100 million won.

534
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,539
Is he telling us to wear
a 100-million-won outfit to meet him?

535
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:03,335
The chairman must have finally
taken a liking to our Ryong.

536
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,253
Yeah.

537
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,550
One hundred million!

538
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,054
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

539
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,806
If you're done, send it to me first.

540
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,725
I'll revise it and submit it.

541
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,143
<i>I'm busy right now.</i>

542
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,728
Huh? Why?

543
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,188
<i>I'm birthing a baby.</i>

544
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,564
Oh, that's not…

545
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,203
You're here.

546
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,122
Happy to be back in Seoul?

547
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,750
I know it was tough
getting here from Florida.

548
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,920
Since this is home,
it should be easy to adjust, right?

549
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,381
Female Mouse 3 ate a ton
as soon as she got here.

550
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,592
What a good girl.

551
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,178
There's no other mouse like Male Mouse 1.

552
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,976
What do you think about
taking him back with you?

553
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,686
Huh?

554
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,730
Let's take a look.

555
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,569
No can do.

556
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,532
It's too dangerous for him to go up.

557
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,117
We'll have to find another male.

558
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,620
Why is the stitching crooked?

559
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,958
What? It's not crooked.
This is perfectly acceptable.

560
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,213
Any way you look at it, it's crooked.
How can you say that this is fine?

561
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,799
Can you stitch like this?
In zero gravity no less?

562
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,677
What's with you?

563
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,680
Didn't you always get on my case
about my stitching being uneven?

564
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,889
I can't believe you.

565
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:42,893
This is outstanding.
Not even I could do that.

566
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,563
Dr. Lee probably couldn't stitch it
this well either.

567
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,190
Hey, who would
sew up a mouse like this anyway?

568
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,695
Our professor once said,

569
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,781
"You can learn a lot about someone
by how they stitch."

570
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,077
He said you shouldn't date
someone like that.

571
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,454
Dr. Ma,

572
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,416
you need to date a guy like this.

573
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,815
That's Mr. Gong's car.

574
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,317
How do you know?

575
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,485
The MZ Medical Center logo is on it.

576
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,529
Since when were you so observant?

577
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,157
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

578
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,117
- Hello.
- Welcome.

579
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,577
- Hello.
- Hi.

580
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,661
Hello.

581
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,169
Excuse me.

582
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,671
I ordered more drinks ages ago.
What's the hold-up?

583
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,841
Whoa, Dr. Kang, you're quite the drinker.

584
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,009
Let me pour you a drink.

585
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,972
- Thanks.
- For what, you jerk?

586
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,391
- For keeping your mouth shut.
- It's not always shut.

587
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:09,355
You didn't go around blabbing, which means
you're not as big of an ass as I thought.

588
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,731
Thanks.

589
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,650
You're all nuts.
We both performed an ICSI,

590
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,319
but they only help one guy
and screw the other--

591
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,945
What are you talking about?

592
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,074
So, when do you think
they'll discipline you?

593
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,493
Geez, Dr. Ma,

594
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,120
does it bother you that I'm here?

595
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,331
They haven't fired me yet.
Give me some napkins.

596
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,582
Stop it, you guys.

597
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,668
Dr. Ma, because Dr. Kang
bought the robot arms,

598
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,836
we were able to dock successfully.

599
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,505
Exactly, so let's drink.

600
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,256
Let's all have a drink together.

601
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,803
It's all thanks to everyone here
that I was able to make it back alive.

602
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,096
- Thank you.
- Applause!

603
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,681
Thanks, everyone.

604
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,640
Cheers!

605
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,601
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

606
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,269
Cheers!

607
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,979
- I need napkins.
- You're so sloppy.

608
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,691
Why do you feel the need
to sit here with us?

609
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,735
- Let me pour you a drink, Chief.
- Thank you.

610
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:01,115
Thank you for rescuing our Ryong.

611
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,199
- Would you like more meat?
- No.

612
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,367
- Would you?
- No, thank you.

613
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,452
- Oh no, you're out of kimchi.
- It's okay.

614
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,453
Thank you.

615
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,331
I didn't know about you two.

616
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,958
You're not that kind of person.

617
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,504
Don't concern yourself with it.
My feelings for him are gone.

618
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,631
Don't worry about me.
He's just a subordinate.

619
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,386
Let's drink till we drop.

620
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,223
Cheers.

621
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,727
How cute.

622
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,271
No, it's okay.

623
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,815
- What you do think of my buddy Yi-man?
- Stop it.

624
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,150
Why are you doing this?

625
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,737
Yi-man already has
his sights set on someone.

626
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,656
- Who?
- Who? Me?

627
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,032
I know who it is.

628
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,033
Who?

629
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,828
This was destined to be ours.

630
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,331
But Kang-su knows! We helped Fantasia.

631
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,209
What if he reports us or something?

632
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,714
Should we just return the lottery ticket
for his silence?

633
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:02,134
I mean, the winning prize is 500 billion,

634
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,512
and maybe he would share some of it
for us giving it back,

635
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,016
like a gratuity, 10% or something?

636
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,227
Hi.

637
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,979
What did Dr. Kang say?

638
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,733
Mom, we need more food here.

639
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,775
Coming.

640
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,736
Dr. Kang is going to give me
a heart attack.

641
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,405
Here you go.

642
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,409
It was only a few days, but it looks like
you're close to our Ryong.

643
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,535
Yes, of course.

644
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,204
- Please watch out for him.
- Okay.

645
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,121
- Hi!
- Hi.

646
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,414
Thank you.

647
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,668
Dr. Kang won't say anything.

648
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:42,007
He would never do anything that would
cause trouble for the girl he likes.

649
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,301
Okay.

650
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,180
No problem.

651
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,890
No problem.

652
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,434
I'm going to go to the bathroom. Santi.

653
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,106
Dr. Kang is leaving.

654
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,323
I hope you all have a nice life.

655
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,619
I'm grateful for what you did,
but you can't avoid punishment.

656
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,788
Yes, I'm fully prepared for it.

657
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,748
- Bill, please.
- Sure.

658
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,458
- It's okay.
- But she…

659
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,584
Just go.

660
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,295
Have a nice evening.

661
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,341
Hello.

662
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,719
Did you finish it?
It's due tomorrow morning.

663
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,098
Yes, I've been working very hard on it.

664
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:36,979
Mr. Gong.

665
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,191
You're interested in Eve, aren't you?

666
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,365
When I saw you two up there,
you looked like a couple.

667
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,908
Park Dong-a, shut up.

668
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,118
Why?

669
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:55,581
Come on, this tourist spends
a grand total of ten days in space,

670
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:59,001
and now he's trying to ruin
the commander's career.

671
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,629
Nobody has ever talked trash about Eve,

672
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,174
but thanks to you, people are gossiping
about her behind her back.

673
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,551
What the hell, are you drunk?

674
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,845
Hey, Han Si-won.
Get him out of here. He's drunk.

675
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,806
Why are you always on my back, Chief?

676
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,057
Listen, you jerk.

677
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,184
Si-won, I'm totally fine.

678
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,853
It's okay.

679
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:26,236
You have no idea
what Eve went through to get here.

680
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,739
Until she became commander,

681
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,409
she never once dated anyone,
and she put love on the back burner.

682
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,620
It took ten years

683
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,914
for Eve to open up to me.

684
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,584
Who the hell do you think you are?

685
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,295
You're engaged, yet you come along
and mess with her heart

686
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,047
and ruin her reputation.

687
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,424
Why?

688
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,845
Why did you have to create
a messy situation

689
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:56,058
where you had to be butt naked
in a sleeping bag together to survive?

690
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,684
Enough!

691
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,561
You're crossing the line.

692
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,068
Ryong, go back to your table, okay?

693
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,867
I was just joking.

694
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,422
You're right.

695
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,636
I'm nothing but a stupid tourist
who was up there for a mere ten days,

696
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,097
but I hit on the commander.

697
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,139
What did you say?

698
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,474
The commander is someone

699
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,977
who is filled with love,
who valued even the lives

700
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,814
of a single fruit fly or mouse.

701
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,320
She risked her life to save me.

702
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,407
She was like a sexy Wonder Woman.

703
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,329
How could I not love her?

704
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,418
Ryong.

705
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,837
Dong-a, what are you doing?

706
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,756
Let me go! Leave me alone, don't touch me.

707
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,259
I'm fine.

708
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,221
I deserved that.

709
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:23,812
I did something that deserves punishment.

710
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,108
But…

711
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,779
it was just me.

712
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,658
She didn't feel the same way.

713
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,036
It was all me.

714
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,834
I was the only one who felt that way.
The commander didn't even bat an eye.

715
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,422
When we were in that bag
butt naked, trying to survive,

716
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,299
I had other thoughts.

717
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,426
But the commander
was just trying to survive.

718
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,680
Her only thought was keeping me alive.

719
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,433
That situation must have been

720
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,810
so awful for her.

721
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,854
But Eve…

722
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,818
never wavered once as the commander.

723
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:19,075
As commander, not once
did she cross the line with the tourist.

724
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,790
Not once did she give me a chance
or encourage me in any way.

725
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,542
And even though she hated me,

726
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,796
she gritted her teeth
and shared her body to keep me warm.

727
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,633
I'm the lunatic, okay?

728
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,137
I'm the crazy bastard!

729
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,685
I'm sorry.

730
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,772
I'm so sorry.

731
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,219
I just spoke with
the tax accountant in Houston.

732
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,720
He said to come straight to the bank.

733
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,765
Well, I guess we should get going then,
since it expires soon.

734
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:24,891
Yeah.

735
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,063
About this…

736
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,773
Yeah, what about it?

737
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,901
He would never know it was his
if it's gone.

738
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,196
I bet he doesn't even remember
the numbers.

739
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,115
He doesn't even know
that he lost the ticket.

740
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,534
So let's just erase it.

741
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,412
The bank might take a photo
of the winning ticket.

742
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,956
And without this "Stand by me,"

743
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,292
Kang Kang-su
will never find out if he saw it.

744
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,546
Yeah, but look.
It's already in really bad shape.

745
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,966
What if we rip it or something
trying to erase this?

746
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,759
I think it's too risky.

747
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,469
- Yeah, I know.
- What's this?

748
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,823
Why would you carry it around, you idiot!

749
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,286
Give me my money!

750
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,705
Please, please, please! Calm down!

751
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,749
Where are you going? Come here!

752
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,877
Get over here!

753
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,015
What are you doing here?

754
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,645
Just write what I tell you to write.

755
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,438
We don't have time.

756
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:00,362
All I remember about the last three days
is kissing and having sex.

757
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,280
What is it you want me to write?

758
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,910
You're going to edit it
and write what you want anyway,

759
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,954
so just write it yourself.

760
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,957
- Let's go to KSA and write it together.
- Forget it.

761
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,626
Until I went out on the spacewalk,
you were in there alone.

762
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,795
Ryong.

763
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:20,006
Are you going to keep making me suffer
because I said we should end it?

764
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:24,094
Then what are you going to do?
It's due tomorrow.

765
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:29,140
You're either being difficult on purpose,
spiteful, or just plain dumb.

766
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,141
For God's sake.

767
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,896
Stop being so short-sighted.

768
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,440
Are you even qualified to be a doctor?

769
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,568
Then come in and we'll write it.

770
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,364
Let's go and write it at KSA.

771
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,324
Why? Are you scared to come in with me?

772
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,701
Why would I be scared?

773
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,540
Just write whatever you want.

774
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:57,002
I won't complain. Go.

775
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,194
Are you an animal?
That's all you can remember?

776
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,363
Yeah, I'm an animal.

777
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,616
That's all I can remember.

778
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,829
Either take off your shoes and come in,

779
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,581
or keep your shoes on and leave.

780
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,292
Why are you so indecisive?

781
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,211
Why are you only indecisive with me?

782
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,463
Am I someone you can just walk all over?

783
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,217
Why can't you call a spade a spade?

784
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,011
You're always so clear and decisive
with everyone else,

785
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,805
so why aren't you like that with me?

786
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,099
With me, it doesn't matter.

787
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,017
Am I that insignificant to you?

788
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,482
Get out.

789
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,036
I think of you all day long.

790
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,539
I can't stand
how good those three days were.

791
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,166
It's true.

792
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,877
Ever since you stitched up my toes,

793
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,672
you got under my skin.

794
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,468
Since the day we operated on the mouse,

795
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,637
it's true, I've felt butterflies.

796
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:17,559
When you jumped out
the spacecraft window like a crazy person

797
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,186
to save me,

798
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,730
I started falling for you like mad.

799
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,818
Remember when you came to my CQ drunk
and asked if you could like me?

800
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,194
Fine, I admit

801
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,029
I almost said yes then.

802
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,158
Do you think

803
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,869
if it was someone other than you,
that as commander

804
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,830
I would've jumped into space
because they were left alone?

805
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:41,374
Do you think I'm that righteous
and ambitious,

806
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,835
that I'm someone
with an overwhelming sense of duty?

807
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,421
I'm not.

808
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,173
The three parts?

809
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:51,217
Yeah, kissing and having sex,
and loving each other.

810
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,969
Yes, that's what I was referring to.

811
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,557
That day when
we were sharing the oxygen tank

812
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,935
and our body heat as we faced death,

813
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,896
talking about Earth.

814
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,066
That's love, isn't it?

815
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,945
Fine, write it all down.

816
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,907
Just write all of it and submit it.

817
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,075
Sure, we should do that.

818
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,660
You think you're so smart, you jerk.

819
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,206
I've gone crazy, haven't I?

820
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,166
I'm the crazy one, right?

821
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:26,336
It was my first command.
I must have lost my mind.

822
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,047
- Right?
- So what? What's your point?

823
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,298
I hate you!

824
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,549
You!

825
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,147
Fine, the whole thing is a lie.

826
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,241
Take your shoes off.

827
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,058
Let's write it.

828
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,785
Let's write it quickly.

829
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,294
You came in on your own.

830
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,045
There's no leaving now.

831
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,840
Okay.

832
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,556
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

833
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,893
<i>Don't meet the tourist personally anymore.</i>

834
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,271
If everyone is against it,
there's probably a good reason.

835
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,774
<i>Was Ryong the ringleader?</i>

836
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,652
This guy is turning
taking my things into a hobby.

837
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,237
- Do you really want to start something?
- You asshole.

838
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,156
<i>You're going down with me.</i>

839
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,450
Do you have another woman?

840
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,118
<i>Ryong is actually</i>

841
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,162
<i>quite materialistic.</i>

842
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,831
<i>This is where we part ways.</i>

843
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,917
We weren't allowed to meet, ever.

844
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,127
<i>I'm leaving for space in a few days.</i>

845
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,547
SPACE, CRISIS, RESCUE, RETURN

846
01:01:56,295 --> 01:02:01,300
