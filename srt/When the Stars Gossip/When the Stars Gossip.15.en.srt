1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:48,006
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,434
Think about what the IOU wanted
to achieve with Santi's sperm.

3
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,106
We could explain that the sperm
of MZ Group heir was also misshappen

4
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,651
and try to convince them
that it's a scientific achievement

5
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,653
for solving infertility, Chief.

6
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,363
You want to try to have
this illegal experiment

7
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,159
recognized as a scientific achievement?

8
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,620
You want to gamble the future
of the Korea Space Agency

9
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,747
on a morula
that may or may not become life?

10
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,041
It could be
an opportunity for both, Chief.

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,375
The tourist

12
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,503
performed the ICSI,

13
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,922
smuggled the embryo into Earth,

14
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,882
and attempted to implant it.

15
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,677
He could face penalties in the hundreds
of billions for that alone.

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,347
Add the bribery of the astronauts
including the commander,

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,973
and the charges become more serious.

18
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,811
He'll lose his medical license
and face criminal charges.

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,104
He'll end up in prison!

20
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,777
Fine.

21
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,739
If you really can't give it up,
go ahead and gamble.

22
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,327
Your colleagues, your beloved tourist,
and the KSA.

23
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,497
If you decide to risk it all
as the commander,

24
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,875
I'll do as you say.

25
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,217
What's it going to be?

26
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,470
What should I tell the IOU?

27
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,225
Tell me.

28
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,270
Say something!

29
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
Over here, Ms. Choi.

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,861
Hey, why won't you pick up your phone?

31
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,072
You have to go to the MCC now!

32
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,366
Ryong,

33
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,869
the morula, they're…

34
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,849
- Is table four ready?
- Yes.

35
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,976
- Okay, let's hurry it up.
- Yes.

36
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,894
Mr. Kang.

37
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,104
Get everyone out of here.

38
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,981
I'm sorry, but we need you to step out.

39
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,816
Everyone, please leave the kitchen.

40
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,944
You need to go to the MCC first!

41
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,204
Did you get rid of the portable freezer?

42
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,873
And the link to the freezer is off?

43
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,999
The legal team did.

44
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,711
Thankfully, Mr. Ryong told them
that the confiscated morula

45
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,171
was fertilized here on Earth.

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,089
Oh, geez.

47
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,973
Come on! You need to go there now!

48
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,019
CHIEF KANG

49
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,983
Hello?

50
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,028
Get over here.

51
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,912
Go and do whatever it takes
to get Ryong out of there.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,375
Tell them the morula was fertilized here
and get it back. Okay?

53
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,337
They'll both survive this, right?

54
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,300
The morula that should
never have ended up on Earth

55
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,761
was confiscated at MZ Medical Center
right before the transplant.

56
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,847
The IOU would be appalled.

57
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,476
If this gets out, your dad is finished,
so pull yourself together.

58
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,565
We have to side with the MCC on this.

59
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,944
That's the only way we'll survive.

60
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,028
Do you understand?

61
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,414
Commander.

62
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,251
Commander.

63
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,670
You'll give it back, right?

64
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,223
You haven't changed your mind, right?

65
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,309
We felt the same way about it.

66
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,019
You…

67
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,605
haven't changed your mind, right?

68
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,284
You're just a tourist.

69
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,456
I'm the commander who needs to protect
the space station and the space agency.

70
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,004
As per space experiment
ethics regulations…

71
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,423
I'm discarding it.

72
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,553
Don't forgive me.

73
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,530
Dr. Kang had already performed
an illegal experiment up there.

74
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,201
The eggs and sperm I failed to destroy
were used to create a new morula.

75
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,327
But when I found out,

76
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,372
I was afraid that it would jeopardize
my status as commander,

77
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,793
so I couldn't report it to the IOU or KSA.

78
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,839
Even after I came down,

79
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,177
I intentionally left it out
of my report on the tourist.

80
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,183
It was an unacceptable, cowardly act
from a commander.

81
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,230
I only thought about myself.

82
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,818
I've brought shame
to the KSA and Expedition 3.

83
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,034
The other members
don't know anything, Chief.

84
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,079
I don't deserve to be the commander.

85
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,540
Please dismiss me

86
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,000
and let me take full responsibility.

87
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,977
I'll dispose of it now.

88
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,817
Chief.

89
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,071
Please report to the IOU that
I disposed of the morula at the station.

90
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,409
The morula never made it down to Earth.

91
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,496
It was thrown away in a shredder,
and that's why the investigation team

92
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,415
couldn't find it.

93
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,537
Open the door!

94
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,624
Open this door!

95
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,335
Eve!

96
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,669
Don't do it!

97
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,881
Don't do it, Eve!

98
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,357
Don't do it, please!

99
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,025
Don't do it!

100
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,778
Please, damn it!

101
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,656
Don't do it!

102
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,705
<i>It survived the unknown rays…</i>

103
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,334
<i>and radiation.</i>

104
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,879
<i>It made it this far…</i>

105
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>against all odds.</i>

106
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,179
<i>Why?</i>

107
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,266
<i>Why does it have to die</i>
<i>in the hands of humans?</i>

108
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,892
<i>Don't do it.</i>

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,019
<i>Don't do it!</i>

110
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,274
<i>Don't do it, you bastards!</i>

111
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,151
<i>Who is this code of ethics for?</i>

112
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,697
<i>Tell me, for whom</i>
<i>does this code of ethics exist?</i>

113
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,824
<i>The mother wants it.</i>

114
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,868
The mother wants her baby!

115
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,769
I…

116
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,064
am going to save you no matter what.

117
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,399
BIOMEDICAL WASTE

118
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,562
Let's say this morula
was disposed of at the station.

119
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:57,151
You showed me the note on your phone,

120
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,403
confessed, reflected on your actions,

121
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,155
and together, we agreed

122
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,033
to dispose of it up there.

123
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,204
That was why
we left that part out of our reports.

124
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,501
It never made it back down to Earth.

125
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,004
If they find out
you brought it down to Earth,

126
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,506
it will land you a heavier sentence.

127
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,384
Even if they have their suspicions,

128
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,262
KSA and MCC want to believe

129
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,891
that you secretly smuggled the eggs
up to the space station

130
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,478
without telling MZ or the egg's owner
to marry the MZ chairman's daughter.

131
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,442
And they want to believe
that you alone prepped

132
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:44,198
the microscope and performed ICSI
when you were at the radio wave dead zone.

133
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,327
The official explanation will be

134
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,329
that the morula confiscated
from MZ Medical Center

135
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,208
was fertilized here on Earth
as per your statement.

136
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,796
You have to stand trial.

137
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,966
You can't avoid punishment,
so be prepared.

138
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,261
Did you…

139
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,058
Did you…

140
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,480
really do it?

141
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,446
Did you do it?

142
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,050
Don't touch it!

143
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,765
You must remember…

144
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,478
the morula was disposed of at the station.

145
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,522
That's the only way you'll survive.

146
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,692
You have to protect yourself too.

147
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,113
You're not doing this for me.

148
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,825
Are you saying that you disposed of it
because of me?

149
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,913
Since you've already disposed of seven,

150
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,706
getting rid of one more

151
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,250
was nothing, wasn't it?

152
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,380
Now that you've disposed of
all eight of them,

153
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,132
are you happy now?

154
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,137
When you…

155
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,933
disposed of it…

156
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,981
you've killed me too.

157
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,664
You got rid of it to save yourself!

158
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,877
You people disposed of it
to save yourselves!

159
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,547
Am I wrong?

160
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,428
You're right.

161
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,805
I…

162
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,601
I was wrong about you.

163
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,440
Don't forget what you did…

164
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,111
for the rest of your life.

165
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,283
Because I won't forget this too.

166
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm sorry, Commander. We…

167
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,696
It's all because of that
damn lottery ticket.

168
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,533
It would have been impossible
if he worked on it alone.

169
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,704
We created this mess
because we were blinded by money.

170
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,958
What's gonna happen to him?

171
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,275
Isn't it the same as yours?

172
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,318
Do you have proof?

173
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,112
- It's the same, right?
- Why?

174
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,072
You took my suit.
Now you want my underwear?

175
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,577
Weren't you all in a hurry
to shred the evidence at the station?

176
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,080
There's no point
in expanding the investigation to MZ.

177
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,624
Do you think they would have left
any evidence behind?

178
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,546
You're going to pin
all the blame on Mr. Gong?

179
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,633
And the morula?

180
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,302
When they were alone up there,

181
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,096
Eve disposed of it when she found out.

182
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,349
Is that how it is?

183
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,811
I thought the one confiscated today
was fertilized by Ryong on Earth.

184
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,062
Am I wrong?

185
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,025
You're not, of course.

186
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,821
Then we won't investigate MZ Group.

187
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,657
Because the survival
of the KSA is on the line.

188
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,745
That also applies to you.

189
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,007
So it's just Ryong who's screwed.

190
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,179
Don't ever let me see
either of your faces again.

191
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,702
Let's go see Dr. Na.

192
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,583
I'll break it to them.

193
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,960
Let's just go.

194
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,256
Do you think you'll be welcome there?

195
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,802
They'll skin you alive
and make a carpet out of you.

196
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,888
There's no morula.

197
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,431
Shut your mouth.

198
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,809
They already cut you loose.

199
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,812
They only treated you well
when you had the morula.

200
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,982
The chairman treats
even a person like me like vermin.

201
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,734
It's over.

202
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,117
You're the only one
who will end up losing.

203
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,579
They've already made you
look like an asshole here.

204
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,001
If you show up empty-handed,
those people won't care what you say.

205
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,309
What…

206
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,812
is this?

207
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,984
Did you bring a dead one?

208
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,695
Did you?

209
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,240
Answer me.

210
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,118
Answer me, you bastard.

211
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,995
You promised to make me a grandchild.

212
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,418
I'm sorry.

213
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,628
Sorry? You're sorry?

214
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,046
Answer me,

215
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,506
before I rip your mouth apart.

216
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,384
You better choose your words wisely,
you useless piece of shit!

217
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,969
You worthless idiot.

218
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,929
- Sorry?
- Please, dad.

219
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,604
MZ MEDICAL CENTER

220
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,739
I'll get you a lawyer.

221
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,450
Don't worry about the fine.

222
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,749
Ryong, you shouldn't be driving right now.
Let me drive.

223
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,125
Go-eun…

224
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,006
you should be
with Dr. Na and the chairman.

225
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,510
Don't do anything for me.

226
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,098
I don't deserve anything from you.

227
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,878
<i>I'm revoking your commander status.</i>

228
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,299
Ma Eun-su will take over
the mouse experiments.

229
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,805
Your dismissal will depend on
the IOU's decision.

230
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,483
I'm disappointed in you.

231
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,154
You better behave yourself.

232
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,364
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,286
<i>Come back down after three months.</i>

234
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,873
<i>Make amends for leaving it out</i>
<i>of the IOU report, then quit.</i>

235
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,501
<i>Go up with Park Dong-a</i>
<i>and finish the repairs on the station.</i>

236
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,795
<i>It was damaged on our watch,</i>

237
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,130
<i>so we should finish the job.</i>

238
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,557
It's amazing you got a permission for her
to go back up

239
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,310
when she has a disciplinary committee
waiting for her.

240
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,978
How did you do it?

241
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,067
They were all set on firing her.
How did you stop them?

242
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,530
It's the right thing.

243
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,701
She needs to say her good-byes
to the stars.

244
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,454
I'm sure Eve is grateful

245
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,749
that you stuck your neck out for her.

246
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,877
You need to get lost too.

247
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,430
TO EVE KIM

248
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,776
STRANDED ASTRONAUTS RETURN…

249
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,672
TWO MONTHS LATER

250
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,059
Santi, this is EV1. Get me closer.

251
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,978
10-4, stand by.

252
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,689
Drawing nigh.

253
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,067
Getting you closer there.

254
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,110
Okay.

255
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,323
<i>Thank God this was the extent of it.</i>

256
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,076
If the hole was any bigger,
the station would have exploded.

257
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,301
All right,

258
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,760
we've finished drilling.

259
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,807
EV2, covering the exterior O-ring patch.

260
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,240
Dr. Lee, start fastening it on the inside.

261
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,251
I'm going to seal the gap with silicone.

262
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,229
We're done injecting the silicone.
Turn it now, Eve.

263
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,051
EV2, we've finished repairs
on the damaged hole.

264
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,053
Dr. Lee,

265
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,764
start checking for any leakage
in the storage module.

266
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,974
I'll start after one hour.

267
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,185
<i>If there aren't any leaks,</i>

268
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:11,356
we can finally open
the sealed observation module tomorrow.

269
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,149
<i>Nice!</i>

270
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,861
I missed my CQ. My bathroom!

271
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,657
Great job fixing the station.
Good job, both of you.

272
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,701
<i>How about you put your money</i>
<i>where your mouth is</i>

273
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,912
<i>and when Santi and I return</i>
<i>to Earth in two days,</i>

274
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,831
you give us a big fat raise, huh?

275
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,750
And make sure to give Eve
a generous severance.

276
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,045
Eve.

277
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,339
Next month when you come down,
you should get a medical check.

278
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,967
You've had a fever lately,
and you've lost a lot of weight.

279
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,635
<i>Why do you keep losing weight?</i>

280
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,221
Even now, your temperature is a bit high.

281
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,599
You went up too soon without proper rest.

282
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,935
I'll do that, Dona.

283
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:53,231
I really hope nothing more
will happen to the station.

284
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,776
Let's keep it this way, intact,
without any major problems.

285
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,194
COURT

286
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,945
I will declare the sentence now.

287
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,863
DEFENDANT

288
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,617
This case represents
a truly heinous crime.

289
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,203
One where the defendant preyed upon
the desperate hopes

290
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,831
of an infertile couple
who longed for a child,

291
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,043
and who had placed
their trust in him for years.

292
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,421
It was a grossly immoral act

293
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,716
where an ob-gyn,
whose primary duty is to respect life,

294
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,511
took the lead
in violating the bioethics law.

295
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,722
Given the grave nature of this crime,

296
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,434
the medical association has already
revoked the defendant's license

297
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:16,523
and the International Space Agency
has imposed a 140 billion won penalty

298
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,401
for significantly damaging the reputation
of our country's space program.

299
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,820
Therefore,

300
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:27,867
pursuant to Articles 66, 67,
and 68 of the Bioethics and Safety Act,

301
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,661
the Court rules as follows.

302
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,207
The Court orders
that the defendant, Gong Ryong,

303
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,876
is sentenced to two years in prison.

304
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,464
However, the sentence
will be suspended for four years,

305
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,092
beginning on the date
this judgment becomes final.

306
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,890
Oh, my God.

307
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,226
He can't be a doctor anymore
and two years in prison?

308
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,270
Is our Ryong going to prison?

309
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,604
- Is he?
- No.

310
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,357
He's going to prison
and what's this suspended sentence thing?

311
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,568
Why four years?
What is he supposed to do now?

312
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,736
No, he's not going to prison.

313
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,863
We should be relieved.

314
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,990
- Relieved?
- How is that a relief?

315
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,577
MZ Group has announced that Gong Ryong
and MZ Electronic CEO, Choi Go-eun,

316
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,161
have called off their engagement.

317
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,664
Gong Ryong was found guilty
of violating Bioethics and Safety Act,

318
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,834
had his medical license revoked
and was sentenced to two years in prison

319
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,838
with a four year suspended sentence.
He was fined 140 billion won.

320
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,673
It seems that Choi Go-eun,

321
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,468
<i>who had up until recently openly expressed</i>
<i>her affection for Gong Ryong</i>

322
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,388
<i>in front of the whole world,</i>
<i>could no longer turn a blind eye</i>

323
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,390
<i>to her fiancé's unethical actions.</i>

324
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:36,102
<i>After spending 70 billion won</i>
<i>to send Gong Ryong into space,</i>

325
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,856
<i>accusations that they knew of and condoned</i>
<i>Gong Ryong's illegal experiments</i>

326
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,400
<i>seem to be waning</i>
<i>in the wake of this recent breakup.</i>

327
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,069
You no longer have to worry.

328
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,447
Mr. Ryong will be the only one
held accountable.

329
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,950
Aren't you sorry
for what you did to Ryong?

330
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,662
We made Ryong out to be

331
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,084
a shameless doctor,
just so we could save ourselves.

332
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,795
Not just as a doctor,

333
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,508
you completely ruined a man's life.

334
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,511
Do you think I don't know?

335
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,809
That bastard cheated on you up there.

336
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,938
It's true, isn't it?

337
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,596
GO-EUN

338
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,395
I heard the news all the way in Houston
while I was collecting my winnings.

339
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,773
Two years in prison and 140 billion won.

340
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,653
I really wanted to see you
as I was leaving the airport.

341
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,240
As soon as Eve comes back
from finishing the repairs,

342
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,533
she'll be fired.

343
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,662
If she was fired right away,

344
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,625
Chief Kang was worried that IOU
might get a whiff of something,

345
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,377
so she pushed it back three months.

346
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,424
She gave Eve a ton of work
and managed to fool them.

347
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,011
You have to admit, Chief Kang is very sly,
like a fox. Don't you think?

348
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,096
How annoying.

349
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,268
Maybe I should recruit her for my company
after she retires.

350
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,232
Serves Eve right for getting fired.

351
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,819
Bet you're upset though, right?

352
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,949
I hope it works out with Eve.

353
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,869
That way I can reap the benefits.

354
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,415
I'm going to give it
another shot with Go-eun.

355
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,047
- Hey.
- Leave.

356
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,263
I have the prize money in my bank account.

357
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,308
Want me to pay the fine?

358
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,270
When Eve comes back down,
try to make it work.

359
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,272
Damn!

360
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,025
Hey.

361
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,863
Listen, don't stay here
and live like this.

362
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,157
Go to the US and
get your medical license again.

363
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,494
You're more than capable of doing that.

364
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,330
When Eve comes down,
she'll stay in the US.

365
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,544
You should pay for the drinks you had…

366
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,051
How much is the bill?

367
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,389
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN,
SEA, AND SKY

368
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,900
This anger is burning me up inside.

369
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,905
Hwa-ja, I'm so mad, I could die.

370
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,323
That goes for me too.

371
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,828
We'll do it. Go home.

372
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,418
I told you to get out of the kitchen.

373
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,795
Why would you wash the dishes?

374
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,256
If you want to do nothing,
at least read a book.

375
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,133
Hurry, get out.

376
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,050
You little brat.

377
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,846
Are you disobeying us
because we're not your biological mothers?

378
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,181
Are you ignoring us?

379
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,349
Cat got your tongue?

380
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,019
Do you plan on staying silent forever?

381
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,354
Don't you have a lot you want to say?

382
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,733
Listen, you little shit!

383
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,318
Take off those rubber gloves!

384
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,942
Take it easy, okay?

385
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,652
How can Dr. Ma take it easy?

386
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,029
She's going up soon,
and it's her first time.

387
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,739
I'm going to have babies too.

388
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,991
Is that right?

389
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,620
Pregnancy and childbirth
aren't the same thing.

390
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,248
Even if you're not pregnant up there,
you lose calcium,

391
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,499
which weakens your bones.

392
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,210
But imagine having a baby inside you,

393
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:20,089
the baby will relentlessly suck
the female's calcium and nutrients

394
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,632
from her bones.

395
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,052
And when the mother pushes during birth,
her pelvic bone could break.

396
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,264
The moment her bones
break inside her body…

397
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,265
it's game over.

398
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,933
The mother will die giving birth.

399
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,645
You know you can't perform
proper surgeries in zero gravity, right?

400
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,148
A C-section is absolutely impossible.

401
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,233
It has to be a natural birth,
no matter what.

402
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,694
Why are you trying to
put a damper on things?

403
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,739
So does that mean humanity
can only live on Earth?

404
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,825
Don't forget we already did heart surgery
on a mouse.

405
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,786
We just started on mice,
don't get carried away.

406
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,538
There's still a long way to go.

407
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,998
It's going to be one hurdle after another.

408
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,755
Whatever.

409
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,595
Good job. You did good.

410
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,637
Isn't she beautiful?

411
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,766
Good job.

412
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,812
Good job, everyone.

413
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,439
- Good job.
- Nice work.

414
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,608
DELIVERY ROOM

415
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,241
NEW MESSAGE FROM EVE KIM

416
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,332
EVE KIM

417
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,541
Wait a second.

418
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,630
What is this?

419
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,926
I'm sorry, but could you
take a look at it first, Doctor?

420
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,096
Is it what I think it is?

421
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,139
I'm sorry?

422
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,517
<i>Does it look okay?</i>

423
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,978
Is this really a baby?

424
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,438
What is?

425
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,070
Yes, it's a 12-week-old fetus,
about 5.4 centimeters.

426
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,210
I'm scared to death
we're going to get caught.

427
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,878
It's not like we are committing a crime.

428
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,633
What would people in Seoul say
if they found out we were secretly dating?

429
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,094
Let's go see the stars.

430
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,016
<i>The baby's arms and legs</i>
<i>are moving a lot, which is good.</i>

431
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,309
<i>Amniotic fluid level is also fine.</i>

432
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,227
Really?

433
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,478
Hurry, get out of here.

434
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:44,400
Could you tell me if the baby's organs
are developing normally?

435
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,236
Is there no sign of deformity?

436
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:48,946
No.

437
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,243
The brain is symmetrical
and shaped like a butterfly.

438
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,120
The lower body and both legs…

439
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:00,124
Let's see, the knees,
calf bones, and tibia

440
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,001
are all developing normally.

441
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,420
The placenta looks good too.

442
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,923
Normally, when a fetus
is about 5 centimeters,

443
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,051
it has a heart, stomach, kidneys,
and all the other organs,

444
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,096
<i>but they're just not visible</i>
<i>on the ultrasound.</i>

445
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,267
The cervix seems a bit short, though.

446
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,939
But, Commander,

447
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,319
this doesn't look like
it was taken by a professional.

448
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,696
Who took this ultrasound?

449
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,701
<i>Who is the mother?</i>

450
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,833
Please, don't tell anyone.
I'm begging you.

451
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,133
Of course. I am, after all, a doctor.

452
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,177
What can I do to help?

453
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,805
Can I ask you one more thing?

454
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,641
<i>Yes, anything.</i>

455
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,728
When passing through
the Earth's atmosphere,

456
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,941
the crew experiences a force of 4G.

457
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,487
Can a fetus withstand a force of 4G?

458
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,411
Commander…

459
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,707
even though the baby

460
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,336
is in the mother's womb
and is being protected by her womb,

461
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,463
a force of 4G

462
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,884
could cause a sudden change
in the mother's blood pressure,

463
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,429
potentially cutting off
the baby's oxygen supply temporarily.

464
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,139
<i>So, in other words…</i>

465
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,354
Yes, the baby could die.

466
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,649
<i>The chances of it dying are high,</i>
<i>Commander.</i>

467
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:27,896
Dr. Gong.

468
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,567
I'm leaving.

469
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,281
I'm going to continue my studies
in the place I was going to live

470
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,824
after I got pregnant.

471
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,037
Come with me.

472
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,624
You should
continue your studies too, Dr. Gong.

473
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,085
What would be the point?

474
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,381
I'm sick of it all.
It would be useless anyway.

475
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,514
I'm sorry.

476
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,560
I'm the one who's sorry.

477
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,067
I can't sleep at night because
I feel like I ruined your life, Dr. Gong.

478
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,737
Please take some time
to think about it then come.

479
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,197
I'll set everything up.

480
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,991
I'm not using the chairman's money.

481
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:31,418
Dr. Gong, in my eyes,
there's no other ob-gyn like you.

482
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,338
You're the best.

483
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,053
I'm not confident
delivering babies anymore.

484
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,099
It was a terrifying and frightening thing.

485
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,517
I had no fear back then.

486
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,063
Now, I feel like

487
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,025
every baby I deliver is going to die.

488
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,830
- Eve.
- Eve.

489
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
Eve.

490
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,260
What are you going to do?

491
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,350
Aren't you scared?

492
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,523
Of course, I'm scared.

493
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,028
Does the father know?

494
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,825
I'm going to have to tell him.

495
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,662
Who is it?

496
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,837
It happened when Gong Ryong and I
were left here alone.

497
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,589
Here?

498
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,762
Of all places,
I can't believe it was here.

499
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,057
Isn't this kid amazing?

500
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,443
When he finds out,
he's going to be shocked too.

501
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,865
Will he hate the baby too…

502
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,078
since he's disappointed in me?

503
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,967
If I decide to go back to Earth,

504
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,594
will this baby understand me?

505
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,806
It probably already knows
I'm having these doubts.

506
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,891
What should I do?

507
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,856
When I wake up tomorrow morning,

508
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,692
I just wish we're both back on Earth.

509
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,534
Why are you being so foolish
when you already know the answer?

510
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,537
You have to go back down.

511
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,083
How could this baby have come
to someone like me?

512
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,418
What does it see in me
that makes it trust me

513
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,005
so completely,
depending on me for everything?

514
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,719
It's so heartbreaking it makes me angry.

515
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:49,575
EVE

516
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:05,591
EVE

517
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,653
JEON YI-MAN

518
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,365
I can't believe this. Come on already!

519
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,241
<i>The person you called is…</i>

520
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,875
Pick up the phone.
Please pick up the phone.

521
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,257
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

522
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,260
Hwa-ja, the assorted <i>jeon</i> is ready.
Table five.

523
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,387
Got it, table five.

524
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,139
You little brat.

525
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,100
Have you given up on life?

526
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,478
I heard this place has amazing <i>jeon</i>.

527
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,271
Oh, it's here. Oh, that's a lot.

528
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,898
Wow, it looks good.

529
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,193
Come on, let's dig in.

530
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,323
EVE

531
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,786
Stop getting in the way
and go change the music.

532
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,835
- Can we get some water here?
- I'll get you more water.

533
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,378
Come on, answer.

534
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,588
Ryong, answer the phone. Please, answer!

535
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,594
Come on, pick up.

536
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,894
- Dr. Jeon, we're ready for you.
- Oh, yes.

537
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,521
Got it, I'll be right there.

538
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,649
<i>The person you called is…</i>

539
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,276
You're driving me crazy, come on.

540
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,204
JEON YI-MAN

541
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,547
JEON YI-MAN

542
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,134
Oxygen supply and power in all modules

543
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,762
are now functioning normally.

544
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,973
The station is safer and better
than it was before the accident.

545
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,057
You did a good job.

546
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,269
How's your health?

547
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,313
<i>It's good.</i>

548
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,440
Time to get ready to head down.

549
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,697
Let me know if there's anything else
I need to take up with me, Eve.

550
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,824
<i>No, there's nothing.</i>

551
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,494
Now all that's left is to pack.

552
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,621
Are you all packed?

553
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,337
Well? Did you pack everything?

554
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,319
There's nothing more to consider.
You're going down, Eve.

555
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,030
Let's go pack.

556
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,115
I'll pack everything.

557
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,083
This is between the three of us.
This never happened.

558
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,918
The baby won't make it anyway.

559
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,046
I don't want this to get out and ruin Eve.

560
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,841
If I have to, I'll use force

561
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,051
to get you on the spacecraft.

562
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,053
We have to go down.

563
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,641
We're all going down.

564
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,146
Are you worried I'll die up here?

565
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,609
Are you?

566
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,824
Yes.

567
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,493
Yes.

568
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,917
I'm scared you're going to die.

569
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,342
I'm not going to die.

570
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,827
Why is it beating so fast?

571
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,338
Hey, Ryong!

572
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,141
Where did you go this early?

573
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,186
Also, answer your phone, damn it!

574
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:39,109
Are you in touch with the commander?

575
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,904
She's not a commander anymore.

576
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,074
Did you sleep with her?

577
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,789
Did you sleep with her here in Seoul?

578
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,961
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?

579
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,880
Then whose baby…

580
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,340
This is driving me nuts.

581
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,052
If it's been 12 weeks,
it's right around that time.

582
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,014
Or did she sleep with someone else?

583
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,057
- Get out.
- What?

584
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,392
Get out.

585
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,685
Hang on a second.

586
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,064
Holy shit!

587
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:24,070
I don't know much
about zero-gravity, okay?

588
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,407
Although you feel uncomfortable,
he knows better than I do.

589
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,784
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say a word.

590
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,874
Answer it! Answer the phone!

591
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,178
EVE KIM

592
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,395
- Hey.
- What?

593
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,356
Why does this woman keep calling you?

594
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,860
What, since I'm not picking up,
she's calling every guy she knows?

595
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,282
Am I the only loser
who still has feelings for her

596
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,327
that I can't even answer her calls?

597
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,537
Why are you asking me

598
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,248
whether she slept with me
or some other guy?

599
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,291
Damn it.

600
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,012
NEW MESSAGE FROM EVE KIM

601
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,973
<i>The baby's heart rate is too fast.</i>

602
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,017
<i>Please get back to me as soon as possible.</i>

603
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,873
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

604
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,459
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

605
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,002
It's been three months.

606
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,173
- We should try for a baby again, too.
- Are you crazy?

607
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,674
Wow, he must be crazy.

608
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,386
<i>I still can't forgive my mother.</i>

609
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,346
<i>I refuse to give up on my life</i>

610
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,223
and the life of my baby.

611
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,434
There's only one person

612
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,311
<i>who would be willing to risk their life.</i>

613
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,814
<i>Please let me go and be by Eve's side.</i>

614
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,816
Please, I'm begging you.

615
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:03,289
