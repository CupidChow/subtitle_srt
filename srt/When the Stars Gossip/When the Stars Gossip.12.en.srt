1
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,174
TAXI STOP

2
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,342
Ugh, I feel sick.

3
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,188
It wasn't ours to begin with.

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,066
We will be punished for our greed.

5
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,320
What do we do now?

6
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,281
There you go again.

7
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,200
Now is not the time to be sulking!

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,953
Actually…

9
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,165
we did just find something
that he had misplaced.

10
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,251
At the minimum he should share
a percentage with us.

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,420
How can you just sit there
after he snatched

12
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,297
it back? Does that make sense to you?

13
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,177
We'll go ask Doctor Kang for our cut.

14
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,763
It's his fault for losing
it in the first place.

15
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,765
We just helped him locate it.

16
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,226
Isn't that right?

17
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,313
So, what are you still doing here?
Go negotiate with Doctor Kang?

18
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,190
Huh?

19
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:47,690
Huh?

20
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,192
Aren't you the one that
squandered our fortune?

21
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,610
'Cause with taxes removed,

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,656
we could've pocketed somewhere around
eighty-three billion a piece

23
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,326
if you hadn't gone and lost it.
Is that what you're telling me?

24
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,704
I feel like you should be the one…

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,582
to try and recover some of the
cash we're losing at least.

26
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,792
You caused this.

27
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,596
They said he's staying at this hotel.

28
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,784
You don't have to go.

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,743
Really. I got this.

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,454
It's not worth the effort on your part.
I'll be the one to beg him,

31
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,374
or, if he throws me out the window,
I'll be the one to take the fall.

32
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,458
You should probably…

33
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:49,961
head back.

34
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,006
I don't want to have to see my sister.

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,678
I'm so angry at myself, so I can imagine

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,722
you guys are mad.

37
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,266
Sorry that Dona can be such a…

38
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,059
bully sometimes.

39
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,983
Remember when she hit me in the head?

40
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,318
I'm still sore.

41
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,070
I hope there isn't a lump.

42
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,842
You walked in willingly.

43
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,803
You can't leave now.

44
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,820
Ryong.

45
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,073
It's me and this guy Ggong.

46
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,992
Where are you?

47
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,421
Ryong.

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
Just one second.

49
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,706
- We going over the report.
- Yeah, reports, uh…

50
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,999
let's write our own reports.

51
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,210
Just send me a copy of
yours when you're done.

52
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,091
I

53
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,303
want to talk with the commander.

54
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,513
Take this, will you?

55
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,641
What?

56
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,310
You can tell me.

57
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,604
Yeah, um…

58
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,147
sure. Where?

59
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,929
I apologize.

60
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,100
You ought to take off, Commander.

61
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,063
Let's just go home, alright?

62
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah, sure.

63
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,820
No.

64
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,075
Don't go.

65
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,332
Okay.

66
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,210
Can you handle your liquor?

67
00:06:59,293 --> 00:06:59,877
Sure, I like it.

68
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,380
- Are you good at drinking?
- I'm pretty good.

69
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,506
Then let's play a drinking game.

70
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,007
What, like whoever drinks the most

71
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,343
- gets Gong Ryong?
- How'd you guess?

72
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,618
You better slow down.

73
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,375
I'm so embarrassed.

74
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,592
If this is the way you're
starting things off,

75
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,759
then I'm not gonna drink.

76
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,307
Well, excuse me, bitch…

77
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,434
but, fuck that shit.

78
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,312
So, now we're cursing?

79
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,027
I also have…

80
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,112
horrible things to say…

81
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,449
just as soon as I'm drunk enough for that.

82
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,077
You should go curse at Gong Ryong.

83
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,706
He's the one that had the change of heart.

84
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,798
Weren't you the one who made Ryong…

85
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,967
be unfaithful?

86
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,888
Now, bottoms up.

87
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,450
I guess you are a bit of a drinker.

88
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,787
I'll take another.

89
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,455
Why?

90
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,915
You had four already.

91
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,542
Oh, was it?

92
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,849
Looks like we're even now.

93
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,604
Yeah, hi there.

94
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,649
Another bottle over here.

95
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,909
I wanted to talk to you sober, originally.

96
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,122
But I can't now.

97
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,802
I do want to thank you, though…

98
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,388
for saving Ryong.

99
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,391
Let's at least get that out of the way.

100
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,604
It all happened because
I fell for Gong Ryong.

101
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,107
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,737
I did make an effort to
stop that from happening,

103
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,071
but it didn't work.

104
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,576
And I truly apologize.

105
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,500
All the shiny new things

106
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,628
you can find in this hotel…

107
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,340
that's all that Ryong really
wants from me, you know.

108
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,842
He likes what I have to offer.

109
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,596
And Ryong wanted me so much,

110
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,307
that he even risked his
life to go into space.

111
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,434
And the Space Fertility Clinic…

112
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,144
he was promised by my father…

113
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,272
He won't want to give up on that.

114
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,359
You know

115
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,569
he's quite materialistic.

116
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,322
He's not compatible with
a hard-working astronaut.

117
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,448
He's just still in that…

118
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,784
early stage where he thinks
you're interesting.

119
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,160
It'll pass in a little while.

120
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,162
It'll pass in a little while, huh?

121
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,540
God, do you really think I'm so boring?

122
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,917
When you first met

123
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,961
he was MZ Group's future son-in-law

124
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,089
who spent seventy billion won

125
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,132
just to get into space.

126
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,301
But

127
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,844
that's not what I saw.

128
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,265
I saw a doctor driving around in his
junk car, tired of being broke.

129
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,939
I saw Ryong working his ass off so he
could to climb to the top of the ranks.

130
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,402
So, the compassion I have for that man…

131
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,239
You don't have any idea.

132
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,326
Never mind all that.

133
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,121
I want to know if you actually
think I'm boring.

134
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,001
Well, that's great.

135
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,802
Even if I drink every bottle in this bar,

136
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,639
you still aren't going to let Ryong go.

137
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,308
Yeah, well, not if I drink 'em first. So…

138
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,024
GONG RYONG

139
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:23,951
RYONG

140
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,214
Why is nobody picking up? Gosh.

141
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,800
Open up!

142
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,052
You're mine.

143
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,680
Hey Ryong.

144
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,141
You're back. Are you okay?

145
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,851
- Ugh, you reek of alcohol.
- Move.

146
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,312
Eve, are you okay?

147
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,148
Gosh, Ryong,
did you have so much to say that you

148
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,817
had to call her over here with me?
Seriously, you're…

149
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,986
you're so lucky you have
so many girls you can call.

150
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,695
Wait, uh

151
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,071
Hey

152
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,990
Hey, snap out of it,
Eve, hey! Are you okay?

153
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,618
- Don't touch me!
- Ah, seriously! Don't you

154
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,244
dare raise your voice at us.

155
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,371
Hey,

156
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,332
- are you okay?
- Just a second.

157
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,002
Eve, are you okay?

158
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:15,961
Huh?

159
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,004
Hey!

160
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,131
- Wait, no, what? Don't lie there.
- I should lie down too.

161
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,090
Right here.

162
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,717
- Oh, geez.
- But

163
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,514
why do you have to lay there?

164
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,432
If there's something you want to say,

165
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,060
say it while we're both here.

166
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,438
Yeah, that's why we came back here
together. So go ahead. Say what you need

167
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,773
- to say.
- Yeah, go ahead.

168
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,399
Say it.

169
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,819
What, so you're sleeping here tonight?

170
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,445
Yeah, I'm going to sleep.

171
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,405
Hey, I'll take you home. Come on.

172
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,283
- Who?
- Her?

173
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,413
What, are you suggesting I
sleep with the both of you?

174
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,915
Either that, or get out.

175
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,544
Just leave, then.

176
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,881
You've got to be kidding me…

177
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,051
This bed is cold.

178
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,594
I'm cold.

179
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,221
You are?

180
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,807
So cold.

181
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,101
Freezing.

182
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,857
There. Better?

183
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,234
Oh, that's great.

184
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,820
Ahhh, now it's warm.

185
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:24,947
Ah, so nice.

186
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:26,824
Good.

187
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,075
So good.

188
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,172
Now, she's not even answering her phone?
Where is she?

189
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,301
DONA

190
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,665
Is it the winning number for the two four
five three dash zero three lottery?

191
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,458
It is.

192
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,419
- May I ask what took you so long?
- Can I come claim the prize now?

193
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,337
Yes, of course.

194
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,047
I mean, it's a King's ransom.

195
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,382
We've been wondering where the winner was.

196
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,059
Okay. Thank you.

197
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,634
- So, what's happening here is…
- We just came for

198
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,469
breakfast. It's not what you think.

199
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,390
I don't care if you two slept together
or you hooked up or whatever.

200
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,934
Are you just going to stand there?

201
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,150
I didn't say you could sit.

202
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,541
I'm very sorry, Doctor Kang.

203
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,168
Guys, if anyone saw you,
I would seem like a huge jerk.

204
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,004
What are you doing on your knees?

205
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,130
Doctor Kang…

206
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
You know I'm as timid as a bird.

207
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,466
Hmm?

208
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,801
So, at first,

209
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,720
when I found the lottery ticket,

210
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,722
I wanted to find out who's it was.

211
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,182
And I really wanted to
return it to you, Doctor Kang.

212
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,267
Who was the mastermind?

213
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,272
Who convinced you to take my money?

214
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,486
I hate my life.

215
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,032
I swear I wanted to return it to you.

216
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,327
But they said, why bother returning it,
'cause it would be like…

217
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,497
like emptying a bottle of
water into the Han River.

218
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,999
Which is crazy, you know…

219
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,043
That awful metaphor
actually worked on me!

220
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,127
Yes, but who said it?

221
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:32,885
Was it you?

222
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,303
What?

223
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,472
I didn't say it.

224
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,432
Did Santi say, "we should become thieves?"

225
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,349
No.

226
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,773
It was Gong Ryong.

227
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,524
Absolutely not.

228
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:48,650
No way.

229
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,985
Gong Ryong, he…

230
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,570
hasn't done anything wrong.

231
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,824
The three of us had already said,
no matter what, we have to give it back.

232
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,201
We were all in agreement.

233
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,660
Then, when you were sleeping,

234
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,496
we left it floating right
in front of your face,

235
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,998
That way there was no way
you could have missed it.

236
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
We hovered it in front of you and left.

237
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,417
And that's it.

238
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,627
Period…

239
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:07,961
All right, doc?

240
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,798
But, I mean, Gong Ryong

241
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,884
he manages to find it in all that madness,
then he

242
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,095
comes back and just gives it to us.

243
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,263
I remember thinking…

244
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,264
is this fate?

245
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,894
How could it land in my hands again?
I mean, I really considered keeping it,

246
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,062
but I would return it.

247
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,356
I didn't want. I needed to.

248
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,192
We knew it was nearly a year old.

249
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,985
And that we could be completely
overreacting…

250
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,154
over a scrap of paper that's
past its due date.

251
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,449
So we wanted to check to see if it was
a valid ticket, so we called Houston.

252
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,784
We thought we should check.

253
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,870
And that's what we were discussing
in the bathroom. Alright?

254
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,001
It's the truth.

255
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,587
So you're saying

256
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,841
it was Gong Ryong who said,
"You'd be stupid to return it."

257
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,970
And instead of returning it to me after
he found it at the space station,

258
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,847
he returned it to you guys,
knowing it was mine.

259
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,598
Is that what you're saying he did?

260
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,485
That little punk keeps stealing my things.

261
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,414
You know Go-eun's right there,

262
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,791
so how could that boy get
a crush on the commander?

263
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,128
Oh, do you think we should bring her
here and talk some sense into her?

264
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,504
Huh? What do you think?

265
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,132
That Commander chick,
or whatever the hell she is…

266
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:35,883
I could take her.

267
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,093
Jeeze. Hey, hey, hey! Turn that off.

268
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,136
Oh,

269
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,222
let's not beat around the bush and just
get them here to ask them what's been

270
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,265
going on.

271
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,435
We don't know if Ryong has a
crush or if she seduced him.

272
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,019
You're right.

273
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,064
That day when I went to see them,

274
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,274
not only were they naked,

275
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,401
they were sharing a sleeping bag.

276
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,485
Naked?

277
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,237
- B… both of them?
- What?

278
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,280
Are you positive?

279
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,615
And you're just now saying?

280
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:00,908
Why didn't we hear
about this sooner, huh?

281
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,659
Why wouldn't you
share something like that?

282
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,994
Oh, jeeze!

283
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,038
SON

284
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,379
What's up?

285
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,424
Uh, so we were thinking about
the girl who saved you.

286
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,676
We'd like to make her
a meal to say thanks.

287
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,094
Could you bring her around?

288
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,597
You think I don't know what you're up to?

289
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,973
What is it you think we're up to?

290
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,392
I'm busy.

291
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,353
I'm out getting my homework checked.

292
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,354
Hey, you ungrateful brat!

293
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,607
If you knew how we felt,
you wouldn't have gotten so wasted

294
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,692
and said all those mean things that night!

295
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,443
I, just…

296
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,279
I'm conflicted and I think the
Commander is conflicted as well.

297
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,114
We don't need you adding to this mess.

298
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,576
Things are already so complicated,
so just back off!

299
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:45,911
Hey.

300
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,205
We're just trying to
make her a home cooked

301
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,082
meal, alright? Can you bring her?

302
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,208
Can you do that?

303
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,501
Moms…

304
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,379
how do you think you'd feel
if your boyfriend's ex…

305
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,007
talked about stuff to you that
happened when they were dating?

306
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,092
I know I'd feel like shit.

307
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,761
No guy should allow that to
happen in the first place.

308
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,513
That was the beginning of the end.

309
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,642
- Did you do that?
- Did you do that?

310
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,560
- Gotta go.
- Hey!

311
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,395
- What the hell?
- That little brat.

312
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,312
Later.

313
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,948
Right. Thank you for the report.

314
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,200
Gong Ryong,

315
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,954
so you ended up isolated when trying to
retrieve a camera cable you'd forgotten.

316
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,164
Yeah, see,
there was a dozen camera cables from

317
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,792
various countries,
not just ours, all tangled up.

318
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,794
So, grabbing mine was no easy task.

319
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,296
No matter

320
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,256
how well you organize them,
cables have a mind of their

321
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,382
own in microgravity.

322
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,177
Once in the sleeping bag,
you followed the survival

323
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,305
guidelines step by step,
according to the manual.

324
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,848
Yes.

325
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,683
Okay, so,

326
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,020
why didn't you remove your socks?
You risked getting frost bite.

327
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:54,855
Oh,

328
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,940
well… about the socks…

329
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,236
About the…

330
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,487
the socks…

331
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,365
I mean, as you know…

332
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,952
trying to put on socks in zero
gravity is quite difficult.

333
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,830
So even though we change
clothes every day,

334
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,291
we usually wear socks
for a few day in a row.

335
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,877
He was struggling, so we gave up on it.

336
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,670
I see.

337
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,216
I appreciate the detail with
which you wrote your report.

338
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,345
It'll be a great help to us.

339
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,804
Is that everything?

340
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,100
You made an incredible journey,
traveling to the brink of death.

341
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,436
One we'll never forget either.

342
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,776
But, this is where our journey ends.

343
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,487
You're free to leave.

344
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,910
Uh, Commander I still
need to speak with you.

345
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,664
Got it. I'll go.

346
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,602
With last night's team dinner serving as
the break up party for Expedition three,

347
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,063
you should stop seeing
the tourist in private.

348
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,691
It may have just been him liking you,
but it's not a good look for a commander.

349
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,484
People will talk.

350
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,195
They've already started
saying things downstairs.

351
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,990
You have many more competitors,
that would bring you down

352
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,494
to take your seat, than you do supporters.
You realize that, right?

353
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,871
You've worked so hard to
get to where you are.

354
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,916
I don't want to see your name
ruined over something trivial.

355
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,378
Do you think

356
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,338
I'm meddling in your personal life?

357
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,506
You know, like…

358
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,590
overstepping?

359
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,511
No, we're good.

360
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,848
Just,
whatever you do, don't see him. All right?

361
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,269
Anything else to say?

362
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,855
No.

363
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,029
So, have you given up on unrequited love?

364
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,658
Yeah, it's not for me, you know?

365
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,285
No, of course.

366
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,161
That's great news.

367
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,456
You know, mice…

368
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,001
haven't had sex in space,
let alone conceived or given birth,

369
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,378
and they're the most common
mammal in existence.

370
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,756
Gong Ryong,
I mean, aren't you an obstetrician?

371
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,049
Yeah.

372
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,509
So, what do you think is…

373
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,512
the most critical thing to consider
in conceiving life in that situation?

374
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,015
Why do you think mammals
aren't able to have sex?

375
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,148
- Yeah, let's do it together.
- Okay.

376
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,777
Actually, there's a pair of mice…

377
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,489
that might've already achieved that.

378
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,532
Really?

379
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,742
You just weren't

380
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,577
aware at the time.

381
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,624
You know when mice copulate,

382
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,959
there's a vaginal plug that
stays lodged an entire day.

383
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,504
So we can always check to see
if mice have done the deed.

384
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,506
Then we would know for sure.

385
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:08,882
It would be obvious.

386
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,801
Oh, but there are those that
don't make it obvious.

387
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,053
The sneaky ones.

388
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,888
They pretend that they didn't do it.

389
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,849
Plus, there are those who…
well, they're secretly in love.

390
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,558
What?

391
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,310
You're not serious, are you?

392
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,729
The sneaky ones.

393
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,441
They pretend they didn't do it.

394
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,278
- They're secretly in love.
- They're secretly in love.

395
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,745
I'll be joining Eve on this trip.

396
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,584
What are you saying?

397
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,254
It's where our astronauts have to live,

398
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,006
of course I should go to repair
the damaged station.

399
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,175
I sent the IOU a formal request.

400
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:58,306
The question is:
will the IOU accept a last minute request?

401
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,477
I don't care if you're going to repair
your relationship as colleagues or not,

402
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,479
as long as your missions are achieved.

403
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,113
Oh, Park Dong-a,

404
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,032
you and I still need to fill
out an incident report.

405
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,953
They want a detailed report on the Maru
rescue process, and ways to improve it.

406
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,038
Eve, you'll be included, too.

407
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,165
So from now on the three of us

408
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,001
will always be together.

409
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,421
So I better not see either of
you leaving work before me.

410
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,348
All right.

411
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,731
Don't stress, all right?

412
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,400
I won't take your Commander position here.

413
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,363
I can't take a younger colleague's
position, even if I do join you.

414
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,658
It'll take three months just
to restore the station, and…

415
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,869
you'll be occupying that space.

416
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,911
And I'll fix it.

417
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,497
That's the only thing I'll be doing,

418
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,375
so stop looking at me like that.

419
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,260
You find anything?

420
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,303
You made it, huh?

421
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,264
Let's begin.

422
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,727
Through that window over there
on the tourist's side,

423
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,521
we saw sparks ignite from
an undetached trunk.

424
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,690
The material should've burned
up and disappeared

425
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,025
before we entered the atmosphere,

426
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,443
so why would it be there still?

427
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,365
I was also concerned seeing how slowly
the trunk was burning, I mean…

428
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,784
the parachutes almost caught fire.

429
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,536
Has the trunk's material been changed?

430
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,830
The parachutes were acting
strangely as well.

431
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,794
Let's look at each aspect on its own.

432
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,303
Hey,

433
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,849
the three of us in here reminds me of the
old days. Come on, sit, here Dong-a.

434
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,269
You're right, you know?

435
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,606
Taking care of you was a
lot for me to handle then.

436
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,235
Tell me, Dong-a,

437
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,654
who did you like back in those days?

438
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:19,823
I wonder.

439
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,867
We'll forgive you if you answer honestly.
Who was it?

440
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,246
Seriously, ladies…

441
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,834
I was another woman entirely, Chief.

442
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,836
- There were others, you know.
- Oh yeah, there were

443
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,878
plenty of others, sure.

444
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,923
- You're really struggling here.
- Oh, come on now, Eve.

445
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,632
Chief.

446
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,467
- Such a sleazy dude.
- Hey, come on…

447
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,261
You were pretty sleazy from the start,
she's right.

448
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,387
You ladies are driving me crazy.

449
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,432
Is this the real reason you wanted
us three to work as a team on this?

450
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,100
And we're gonna destroy you, Dong-a.

451
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,643
This is only the beginning.

452
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,980
Oh, Chief.

453
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,607
Why don't you just apply for Station
repair duties this round?

454
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,192
You were an engineer first.

455
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,319
The three of us should go up as a team,
I think.

456
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,113
Do you think?

457
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,156
Honestly,

458
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,700
I was thinking about all the constant
meetings and all the reports and how it

459
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,160
just doesn't suit me at all.

460
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,079
What's the word?

461
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,789
We gonna go?

462
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,040
What do you say? You in?

463
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,251
Dong-a?

464
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,462
- Uh… hello?
- Can I join you guys?

465
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,838
Huh? What do you think?

466
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,559
- I'll see you later.
- Yes, have a good night, Doctor.

467
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,537
Eve! What, uh…

468
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,080
what're you doing here?

469
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,208
Uh, I actually just, well, uh…

470
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,045
- I just got a call from Jeon Yi-man…
- And what did he want?

471
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,130
Well, he reached out and asked me to come.

472
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,133
How's it going?

473
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,802
Welcome, come on in!

474
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,471
Wow. Already taking orders, huh?

475
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:08,973
Hello there.

476
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,475
Eve, look…

477
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,060
get in the car. Hurry.

478
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,853
Come on, get in the car! Right here!

479
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,562
What?!

480
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,105
Come on in!

481
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,651
Hey, no, come on! They'll eat you alive!
Get in! Hurry! Now, hurry up!

482
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,152
Will you hurry up and get in?

483
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,782
Ugh, damn it!

484
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,283
No, wait!

485
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,791
Yi-man's call probably alarmed you,
didn't it?

486
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,419
You should go get some
beer and just relax!

487
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,379
No, I'm not drinking.

488
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,214
Who said it's for you?

489
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,508
Did you expect us not
to offer her a drink?

490
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,637
Uh, I just have a meeting to be at
shortly so just one beer I think, just

491
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,638
- one.
- Okay, then…

492
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,181
- If you say so, hon'.
- Yeah, just one is fine.

493
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,016
- So responsible.
- Maybe we'll change your mind…

494
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,017
It's okay, yeah.

495
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,937
Don't any of you say weird stuff okay?

496
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,146
Like what?

497
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,276
- Thank you, dear, for saving our son.
- Oh…

498
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,443
Thank you.

499
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,362
And listen, you know how guys are.

500
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,947
They go on a little vacation, and…

501
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,991
land in an unfamiliar place…

502
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,117
and, you know, men,

503
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,162
they're animals and they start to feel a
kind of way when they meet someone new…

504
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,039
They lose their minds sometimes!

505
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,417
And mistakes will happen
from time to time.

506
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,210
Right?

507
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,753
Aren't you forgetting…

508
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,964
glasses. We can't drink from the bottles.

509
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,341
Glasses, go on.

510
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,012
- Jeeze.
- Such a brat.

511
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,514
Think about it, he…

512
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,101
he went all the way to space just before
he was supposed to get married,

513
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,229
I'm sure he was afraid and
had a lapse of judgment.

514
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,273
So please don't dwell on it. Alright?

515
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,526
Compared to women,
men are all quite dim-witted.

516
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,487
He may appear to look totally normal,

517
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,406
and calls himself a doctor

518
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,950
and yet, he still hasn't fully matured,

519
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,036
- making him less than ideal.
- What the?

520
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,162
- No,
- You were badmouthing me, weren't you?

521
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:54,913
We weren't.

522
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,541
Hey, hey, Ryong, your captain here is
impressive! As a fellow woman, I gotta say

523
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,126
- it!
- And I'd think you'd have high

524
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,003
standards and plenty of suitors to choose

525
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,463
from, right?

526
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,173
Oh, and I bet there's lots of guys
who want you, and you don't know it.

527
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,092
Heck, I'd be willing to bet there are at
least fifteen guys out there like Ryong.

528
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,135
Plenty, I'm sure.

529
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,849
So, what do you like to eat?

530
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,684
- What would you like?
- We'll make it special.

531
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,102
We heard you're going up soon.

532
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:18,728
Yeah…

533
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,438
actually, I eat
whatever's on my plate. So…

534
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,230
Nice.

535
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,691
- Well, we want it to be special.
- C'mon, why even ask? Just

536
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,984
cook everything you've got!

537
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,403
May I ask how old you are?

538
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,905
I'm 37, ma'am.

539
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,115
Your parents, what do they do?

540
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,951
They… they're still alive, right?

541
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,161
Actually, they passed away.

542
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,454
Oh, goodness.

543
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,791
Oh, but how you've turned
out is just amazing.

544
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,710
I bet they'd be proud,
if they were still around.

545
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,296
So, where are you from?

546
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,508
Well, I don't know where I came
from originally. I was adopted…

547
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,968
shortly after birth, in the US.

548
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,346
- I had adoptive parents growing up.
- Your biological parents…

549
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,264
left you as a little girl?

550
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,475
Oh, my gosh. How old were you?

551
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,353
You don't need to ask such
personal questions.

552
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,525
I was told it happened

553
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,276
on Christmas Eve.

554
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,070
Oh, well that's just sad.

555
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,822
It must've been chilly out.

556
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,950
Wait, is--

557
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,868
is that where you get your name, Eve?

558
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,370
Yes.

559
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,498
And that's why I hate Christmas
Eve more than anything.

560
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,874
Thank you for the meal.

561
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,001
- And,
- I don't like Christmas

562
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,043
- either. I'm with you.
- the good company.

563
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,044
Hey, Ryong, take a break, would you?

564
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,462
Why? I wanna have a drink, too.

565
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,505
Cheers.

566
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,298
Cheers.

567
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,759
The tofu is so good today.

568
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,808
Ah, I shouldn't have
had anything to drink.

569
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,936
Can I come with you in the taxi?

570
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,438
Bad idea.

571
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,355
Chief Kang said…

572
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,566
we better not be hanging out together.

573
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,067
Just to the front of the building?

574
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,111
No, we could get caught.

575
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,573
I'll never live it down if they
realize that I'm the sneaky rat.

576
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,324
Would you get canned?

577
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,993
Who knows?

578
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,499
Eve.

579
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,794
Do you regret what we did?

580
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,508
I don't know.

581
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:13,843
You don't know?

582
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,972
Wait, weren't you completely unbothered by
whether or not you'd live in that moment?

583
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,432
That's right. I almost forgot.

584
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,729
As the Commander, and you as the tourist,
up in space, or on Earth,

585
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,107
if there was gravity or there wasn't…
I forgot about everything else.

586
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,025
All gone.

587
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,739
Was I that good?

588
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,285
What? I'm an incredible mammal, aren't I?

589
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,625
Has the Maru been salvaged?

590
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,878
Yes, we took it back to
the MCC storage today.

591
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,965
I will investigate Maru with Commander
Eve and Pilot Dong-a Park and report

592
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,011
the errors and improvement of liftoff
and landing process of Maru.

593
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,098
Including trunk separation failure
during the rescue mission.

594
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,390
Please hurry up.

595
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,519
The investigation team in
Florida is ready to launch.

596
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,128
OBOK PUBLIC SAUNA

597
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:31,754
Hello.

598
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,173
Thank you.

599
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,633
I've never done this before.

600
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,051
So what do I do up there?

601
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,595
Uh, just look at all the people
and use your intuition.

602
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,097
So, copy them?

603
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,308
Going up there means you'll only get
to clean yourself like a cat for one

604
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,685
whole year, right?

605
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,186
- That's true.
- That's not bathing,

606
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,146
it's licking.

607
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,231
You're right. It's just licking.

608
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,859
- Indeed.
- You've got this.

609
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:53,943
So, take it all?

610
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,111
- Okay.
- Yeah.

611
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:55,695
Alright.

612
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,320
Good luck!

613
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,331
- How'd it go?
- Ah, I'm so

614
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,791
embarrassed, everyone was naked.

615
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,754
Do you remember how cold
it was for us that night?

616
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,590
No, I still

617
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,383
can't remember.

618
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:18,801
Ah,

619
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,887
- I'm hungry.
- So am I.

620
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,096
Too bad I don't know the area.

621
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,057
Let's just walk into whatever place
smells the best around here.

622
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:25,766
Okay.

623
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,145
Oh, look, there's another tray coming out.

624
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,986
- What?
- Oh, here it comes.

625
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,532
It's like you haven't eaten
for a week at least.

626
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,701
EVERYONE'S BAKERY

627
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,454
The station truly had no smell at all.

628
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:47,580
It was…

629
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,873
so dreary.

630
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,708
Wait,
is this… the smell of the loaves of bread?

631
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,043
Or is it the baguettes?

632
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,379
Is it a requirement that the food at
the Station has to be so scentless

633
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,214
and tasteless?

634
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,925
Gosh,
how can someone live a year like that?

635
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,011
I was only there,
what, ten days and I couldn't believe

636
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,012
how much I missed Earth.

637
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,099
I've never been up there
more than three months,

638
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,101
but according to some of the others,

639
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,603
apparently you start missing

640
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,813
the sound of birds after three months.

641
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,858
And at around the six month mark

642
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,652
people begin to crave

643
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,987
the simple sound of rain, like crazy.

644
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,742
It's become pretty common now to
take up recordings of nature.

645
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,578
But, honestly,

646
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,289
all I want is to grab this smell

647
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,499
to take with me.

648
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,504
And the feeling of sinking into the
hot bath at the end of the day…

649
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,589
I wouldn't mind taking that feeling

650
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,799
along with me.

651
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,634
And sounds of the neighborhood

652
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,970
that you might hear, just like…

653
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,264
I don't know, waiting for bread.

654
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:48,933
That'd be nice.

655
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,231
You know,

656
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,484
it's not that it's nice
'cause we're on Earth.

657
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,194
It's nice 'cause you're here with me.

658
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,196
Oh, is that so?

659
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,824
Well, who knew?

660
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,123
You know you almost died.

661
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,583
Does that scare you going back?

662
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,962
I've never really been afraid of death.

663
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,589
It doesn't really matter when I die,
I just…

664
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,508
I want to die while I'm happy.

665
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,844
Who wants to live beyond that?

666
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,887
Can I be honest with you?

667
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,389
That day,

668
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,891
had I died in that tent

669
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,727
I don't think I would've…

670
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,980
been particularly upset,
or angry about it.

671
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,734
I wouldn't have died alone.

672
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,904
All right.

673
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,574
There are much worse ways to go…

674
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,202
than dying holding your favorite person.

675
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,415
My whole life I've been lonely,

676
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,208
but I remember thinking…

677
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,585
this is nice.

678
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,463
I remember thinking…

679
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,716
I'll do whatever it takes to stay alive,

680
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,010
or keep you alive,

681
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,471
so together, we could eat bread

682
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,306
and have a bath in warm water,

683
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,683
and date like normal people on Earth.

684
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,268
And, who knows, maybe one day,

685
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,144
we could get married,

686
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,979
and have lots of kids.

687
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,899
We'd have around three children, hmm?

688
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,693
We definitely won't die
by some kind of accident.

689
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,572
We'll live nice healthy lives until
we're a hundred years old.

690
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,201
And when you die,
I'd die the very next day.

691
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,412
I'd live at least one day after you,

692
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,123
so your heart wouldn't
have to break for me.

693
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,544
That's what I prayed would
happen for me and you.

694
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,880
That's what I hoped would be the case.

695
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,632
I just…

696
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,010
I couldn't handle the
thought of dying there…

697
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,138
I refused to die up there with you.

698
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,440
So, what else did you imagine

699
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,234
if our relationship grew?

700
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,239
You mean when it grows.

701
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,200
- What, how, how many children, huh?
- No, if our relationship grows

702
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,118
Huh?

703
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,329
- How many kids are we having?
- Oh, I don't know.

704
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,040
Huh?

705
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,875
Not in your wildest dreams, buddy.

706
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:22,962
They're open

707
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,088
Let's go.

708
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,005
C'mon

709
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,812
FATHER

710
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,357
Yes, Father?

711
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,652
What the hell have you been doing with
your time for MZ to change their

712
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,486
primary bank?

713
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,447
They've switched to our biggest rivals.

714
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,907
Get over there and make
things right again!

715
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,009
Chairman Choi.

716
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,513
Don't you think this is a little unfair?

717
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,307
What?

718
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,808
I beg of you…

719
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,852
bring your business back to our bank.

720
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:20,978
Go-eun is my woman.

721
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,189
And I want you to give her back, too.

722
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,858
After you told me to
give up and surrender?

723
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,443
Seriously?

724
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,196
No one should have the balls
to tell me when to surrender.

725
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,739
You give up, okay?

726
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,866
You liked me.

727
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,036
You'll never be satisfied
with a jerk like Ryong.

728
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,663
Ryong is the one that doesn't
know when to quit.

729
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,333
He didn't give up when there was
no ovary and in that situation

730
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,000
when you said

731
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,169
giving up was the only answer,

732
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,921
the boy didn't give up, did he?

733
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,839
You've lost to him.

734
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,676
He was on the brink of freezing to death,
and he still didn't give up.

735
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,762
Couldn't you be more like that man?

736
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,140
Ryong's an asshole involved
with another woman.

737
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,560
Look at you, buddy.

738
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,480
Ryong has given up sir, on Go-eun.

739
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,778
You, phone Ryong.

740
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,709
You

741
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,753
Are you a cheater?

742
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,880
Huh?

743
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,007
I…

744
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,929
continue to value even your damn
worn socks as family treasures.

745
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,472
Now answer me.

746
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,349
Did you cheat on her?

747
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,352
'Cause if that's the case,

748
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,398
I don't care if you risked your
life to form that morula

749
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,233
I won't let you go near it.

750
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,193
I'll kick you out of the medical center

751
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,736
and put an end to your little

752
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,988
space clinic.

753
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,781
I'll make damn sure

754
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,533
you don't work on Earth either!

755
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,036
Chairman,

756
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,246
I wanted us to chat.

757
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:03,789
So,

758
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,624
- the thing of it is, is--
- Dad.

759
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,423
Let me guess,
you're taking Kang-su's word,

760
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,966
and suspecting Ryong?

761
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,009
Are you kidding?

762
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,263
Are the two of you still scheming even
after your little ice cream incident?

763
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,391
And what exactly was it this time
that made you want to blindside us?

764
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,101
'Cause, for your information…

765
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,478
Ryong and I wouldn't…

766
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,690
have any issues to speak of,
if that terror

767
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,150
Kang-su would leave us alone.

768
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,819
That jerk just makes me so

769
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,324
Do you know how apologetic to Ryong I am,
because of that!

770
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,119
You know at the hotel he's staying
in the room right next to ours?

771
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,289
Everyday he goes out and spreads rumors
that my ex-boyfriend is in the room

772
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,206
right next door.

773
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,667
He makes me out to be like I'm crazy!

774
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,711
Hey, don't you think you're
being a bit harsh?

775
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,545
What?

776
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,212
Is it true?

777
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,631
Yup,

778
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,798
he's in the adjacent room.

779
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,510
Do you have even the slightest clue
of how foul and clingy this guy is?

780
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,637
Who's foul?

781
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,431
How have I ever been foul to you?

782
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,849
And, look…

783
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:07,061
how he just waltzes around
the hotel in his pajamas.

784
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,021
Earlier in the lobby,
there were people on their hands

785
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,898
and knees in front of him.
Something about money.

786
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,608
Did you take money off of those people?

787
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,318
Wow, that's low, even for you.

788
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,529
As if the entire universe
revolves around you.

789
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,407
I'm not what he likes,

790
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,326
he likes your company

791
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,245
using his bank as our primary lender.

792
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,706
Do you even know why I ended it?

793
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,250
I'm embarrassed to say it.

794
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,755
It's because he calls himself
an astronaut yet in reality…

795
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,632
he's completely obsessed with fruit flies,

796
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,717
and attending fruit fly conferences

797
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,178
At parties, he actually raises money to

798
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,680
fund fruit fly research.

799
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,391
He wouldn't even come to
bed until after midnight.

800
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,477
He'd spend all of the time
he had for me sleeping.

801
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,229
Honestly, I only ever saw him in bed.

802
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,982
He'd be up at dawn and spend every
waking moment with fruit flies.

803
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,485
You said you give me attention
when you came to bed,

804
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,404
and you would just go to sleep instead!

805
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,823
How is it possible you still
haven't won a Nobel,

806
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,200
yet you'd rather waste your
time trying to break us up?

807
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,493
Oh yeah!

808
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,704
The one thing you can't do at the station,

809
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,164
that your fruit flies can't
do with you is sleep!

810
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,291
He only came here to sleep with me,
all right?

811
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,460
Stop, Go-eun.

812
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,922
It's all right, chairman, really.

813
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,511
And how dare you bring up my older brother
when you don't even know what it takes

814
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,470
to be one.

815
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,684
He's just trying to make
trouble where he can…

816
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,769
because I have someone else now.

817
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,146
His ego has been damaged.

818
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,064
Dad, please.

819
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,109
I'm not even as important
to this guy as a fruit fly!

820
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,820
Do you really still want me to
end up with a jerk like that?

821
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,405
Huh? Answer!

822
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,117
I can't work out the reason you would
even still wanna deal with this fruit

823
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,201
fly mega-jerk!

824
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,619
Hey.

825
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:48,871
Get out.

826
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,330
But… Chairman…

827
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,376
That Ryong asshole turned
his back on her already.

828
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,211
Ryong.

829
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:57,880
Shall we have lunch?

830
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,881
Sir, no, please…

831
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,009
Hey, I need you to make sure…

832
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,802
this fruit fly…

833
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,263
isn't allowed to come back here.

834
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,826
I'll tell him when it's the right time.

835
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,536
I still don't want to give you up.

836
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,538
Please, give my pride a break.

837
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:33,999
Okay, sure.

838
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,213
Are you insane?

839
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:39,838
Yo!

840
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,089
Damn it! Are you--

841
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,091
You just blindsided me again!

842
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,553
Damn!

843
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,559
Shit!

844
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,061
Next time just hit me!

845
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,354
Okay?

846
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,564
- Why attack my sweet girl? Jeeze!
- You think I'm the only one in

847
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,441
trouble at the disciplinary hearing?

848
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,693
I'm not going down alone.

849
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,655
Say that again to me, man.

850
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,907
You thought you were in the clear?

851
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,117
What, you heard about that?

852
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,577
Huh?

853
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:11,912
- You took it from those guys?
- Hey. Hey,

854
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:12,830
hey.

855
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,583
You took my money and my girl away.
You're the one who's basically a thug.

856
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,001
Okay.

857
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,046
If I get a harsher punishment
and owe hundreds

858
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,923
of billions in fines, thanks to you,

859
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,927
I'll be able to pay for them all.
So thanks a whole lot, man!

860
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,346
You asshole, do you
really want to start with me?

861
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:29,888
Seriously, hey!

862
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,515
- Hey, yourself, jerk!
- Hey, hey,

863
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,391
hey.

864
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,309
Hey.

865
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,230
You didn't implant Doctor Na
yet with the morula, did you?

866
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,607
Shithead! Hey!

867
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,067
Fuck you, asshole!

868
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,695
You better learn to filter what you say!

869
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,571
Can you honestly…

870
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,116
not separate your love life from creating
and destroying other lives?

871
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,451
All you do is
blindside everyone you know!

872
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,912
Hey, what are you doing? Doctor,
please, this just makes Miss Choi's

873
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,663
position harder.

874
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,832
- Damn it.
- Uh… please, stop this.

875
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,625
What does a thieving asshole like
you care if you're blindsided, huh?!

876
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,418
What?

877
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,671
- You're not worth better, you deserve it.
- No, sir, please!

878
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,886
Go-eun.

879
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,852
Using energy to hit you isn't worth it.

880
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,400
You guys proud?

881
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,652
You think you did well here?

882
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,369
A hearing…

883
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,998
to discipline Kang Kang-su will
be called in the next day.

884
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,960
The Inspector General is coming to
preside, so Commander, not just you,

885
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,296
but the entire Expedition
Three team should be there.

886
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,924
Okay, Chief.

887
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,969
Kang Kang-su stealing donated
eggs and conducting

888
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,638
that study using Santi's sperm,

889
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,849
was a deceptive act carried
out in contempt

890
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,768
of his fellow astronauts, also the KSA.

891
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,521
This thing will end Kang Kang-su's career
so cooperate with the Inspector and

892
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,606
answer the questions.

893
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,735
How did nobody else know that eggs were
implanted in the incubator up there?

894
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,112
We can only see if it's
been switched on or off.

895
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:15,285
And there's no way to know
what the contents are,

896
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,621
so we were waiting until we
got the crews report on it.

897
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,664
Han Si-won,

898
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,999
let's go to the main office
before we leave tonight.

899
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,877
I have something I'd like to
submit to the Inspection team.

900
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,878
Yes, ma'am.

901
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,215
Let's go have dinner together.

902
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,386
I can't, I still have work.

903
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,230
We all warned you, you know, Eve.

904
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:44,940
What do you mean?

905
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,441
You know the answer.

906
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,614
I just wanted to have dinner
and get things wrapped up.

907
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,992
I want to get done and get out of here.

908
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,827
Hey. Are you seriously ignoring me?

909
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,626
You don't have to be with me,
but the tourist isn't

910
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,752
appropriate as a match.

911
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,255
When you got everyone you know
telling you to avoid something,

912
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,423
there's a good reason.

913
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,011
Is this advice or a warning, Dong-a?

914
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,346
Seriously?

915
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,224
I'm running out of time here.

916
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,476
In a few days, I'm leaving Earth.

917
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,603
All of my time is precious right now.

918
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,441
Having to leave the person I like…

919
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,028
to go up to space makes every day…
just feel like I have…

920
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,113
some kind of set date of expiration.

921
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,657
Days are slipping away and I'm going nuts.

922
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,455
Did you have sex with him?

923
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,585
When was it?

924
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,840
After I risked it all to save you?

925
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,384
When you were…

926
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,179
completely naked and alone in the tent?

927
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:00,515
Yeah.

928
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,809
There's no way.

929
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,354
Oh.

930
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,108
Y'know, we're…

931
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,235
- really alike, you and I.
- Oh, don't make up

932
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,653
nonsense. You did it there?

933
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,488
Up in zero-g? No.

934
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:15,614
We did.

935
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,950
And you really expect I'll believe that
asshole managed that and even mice can't

936
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:19,618
do it?

937
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:20,702
Uh-huh.

938
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,079
Wow.

939
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,540
Wow. I didn't think you could
ever lie to me. Ouch.

940
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,626
Eve,

941
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,419
you… you've lost it, you…

942
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,587
You're crazy! You are!

943
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,423
Hey, where are you going? We were talking!

944
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,345
Why wouldn't you tell Doctor Ma,
then, huh?

945
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,388
You know,
the one who loses sleep obsessing

946
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,599
over how to get mice,
the representative mammal, to do it? Huh?

947
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,935
Why not go ahead and make
your partner's life easier?

948
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,813
Why just tell this crazy lie to me? Huh?

949
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,775
You and I are not the same.

950
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,903
'Cause I can play the bad guy.
And you can't pull that off,

951
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,113
can you?

952
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:58,990
I know you can't.

953
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,158
You didn't.

954
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,582
That's true.

955
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,626
It's true.

956
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:12,712
You lost.

957
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,214
We were first.

958
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,175
Aren't we just incredible?

959
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:21,972
Keep up the hard work,

960
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,473
you guys. Okay?

961
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,292
Chief.

962
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,793
We're running late.

963
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,271
I'm on my way out.

964
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,397
Just wait a moment.

965
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,445
I'M ON MY WAY OUT. JUST WAIT A MOMENT.

966
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,412
Do you have an umbrella?

967
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,434
- Chief.
- Yes?

968
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,436
Can you drop me back at the
center on your way home?

969
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,646
Just finish it tomorrow.

970
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,731
The flight team wants it by tonight.

971
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,274
Take a taxi, then.

972
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,570
But, it's raining. Or,
you could just loan me the company car.

973
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,989
You want my purse, too?

974
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,157
What did you say?

975
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,452
Why don't we stop for dinner first,
so I don't have to eat alone.

976
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,872
The flight team is waiting on me.
What did the general say?

977
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,708
Well, it's tense as we expected.

978
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:23,927
Huh?

979
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,764
Isn't that the Commander over there?

980
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:28,682
Huh?

981
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,185
Looks like she doesn't have an umbrella.

982
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,771
We can't let her get a cold, when
she's flying so soon. Call her over.

983
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,689
Okay.

984
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,669
Gosh, aren't you cold?

985
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,630
You didn't have to bother. It's so close.

986
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,675
Yeah, you still should've borrowed
an umbrella. Why get rained on?

987
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,052
- There was no one left to borrow one from.
- Oh?

988
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,263
Did everyone quit because they hate me?

989
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,349
Wait.

990
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,351
- What's that? What happened to your neck?
- Huh?

991
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,894
Who did this to you?

992
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,147
- What, you mean that?
- Huh?

993
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:17,939
Oh, that's nothing.

994
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,484
- What? Yeah right, it's nothing!
- What? I don't get it!

995
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,862
Hey… so,

996
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,700
what happened to the commander who warned
me not to like her under any circumstance?

997
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,869
Hey, at least I didn't
call you a murderer.

998
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,913
And what happened to the guy
who wouldn't care if I died?

999
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,915
I left him in space.

1000
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,213
Ah, I do love the sound of rain.

1001
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,798
Wrong again.

1002
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,676
It's not the sound of rain
that's so delightful.

1003
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,095
The reason the rain's
delightful is because

1004
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,722
you and me are in it together.

1005
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,390
Fine.

1006
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,156
It all started back then. Right. Yes,

1007
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,115
Yes, that's right.

1008
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,533
It started then.

1009
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,119
Dong-a put his life on
the line to go up there.

1010
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,373
Honestly,

1011
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,583
we all sensed something was off,
didn't we?

1012
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,586
Could surviving together like that have
ignited something between them when

1013
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,629
they arrived back on Earth?

1014
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,505
Hey, Han Si-won.

1015
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,674
Zoom in to that thing behind
the sleeping bag.

1016
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,675
Sleeping bag?

1017
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,468
Yeah, hurry.

1018
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,597
Right.

1019
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,851
- Keep going, go on, go on.
- More?

1020
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:37,519
Yes.

1021
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:40,605
Isn't

1022
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,440
that the incubator behind there?

1023
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,066
Incubator?

1024
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,820
- Was there an incubator there?
- I mean… that's what it looks like.

1025
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,156
It's too dark to really see.
Give me a sec.

1026
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,084
It is.

1027
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,919
It's an incubator.

1028
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,047
We stopped using that one when we switched
to the one in the observation module.

1029
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,467
But it looks like it was switched on
right before the space debris hit.

1030
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,220
From here, there's no way to know

1031
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,389
what it was used for,
and communications were

1032
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,642
cut after the debris incident so
we have no records we could check.

1033
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,601
So, who used it?

1034
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,241
At this rate,
all hell could break loose at tomorrow's

1035
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,076
disciplinary hearing.

1036
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,580
Tell me who was over that way at
the start of the debris incident.

1037
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,497
Right.

1038
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,895
So, on top of the seven morulae,
they had more fertilized eggs?

1039
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,025
Get Kang-su and the tourist
up here right now.

1040
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,485
Why the tourist?

1041
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:09,777
Well,

1042
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,698
because the tourist was loitering there
the whole time. So get him right now!

1043
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,388
Are you two working together?

1044
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,676
Name, Kang Kang-su.

1045
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,470
Your astronaut qualifications
are permanently revoked.

1046
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,138
Traitors.

1047
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,600
We may have lost our child,

1048
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,269
but I wanted to do everything I
could to keep the morula alive.

1049
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,104
We're not on the same
side, we're enemies.

1050
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:08,813
That's enough!

1051
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,316
I can't believe a single
word you say anymore.

1052
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,609
She doesn't have any family

1053
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,278
so would it be so bad for there to be just

1054
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:18,072
one person here on Earth who
is on her side no matter what?

1055
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:18,990
I think we've got one!

1056
