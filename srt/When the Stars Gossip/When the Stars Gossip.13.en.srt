00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,769
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

4
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,645
Drink up. It's on me today.

HWAYANG HAIR SALON

00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,180
Good evening.

9
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,808
Hard to catch a cab
on Christmas Eve, isn't it?

10
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,147
Please head toward Chuncheon Station
and stop the cab when it hits 2,000 won.

11
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,107
Two thousand won?

12
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,067
Yes.

13
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,151
Sure.

DRAFT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,347
- Thank you.
- Of course, thank you.

16
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,182
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

17
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,771
<i>It may not be a snowy Christmas Eve,</i>

18
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,732
<i>but the sky is filled with shining stars.</i>

19
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,279
<i>When you gaze up at the stars,</i>
<i>thoughts of the things you long for arise.</i>

20
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>In the end, this longing brings us back</i>
<i>to the things we cherish most.</i>

21
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,664
<i>Tonight, "A Night of Counting the Stars"</i>
<i>by the poet, Yun Dong-ju, comes to mind.</i>

22
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,001
<i>A star for memories</i>

23
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>A star for love</i>

24
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,714
<i>A star for loneliness</i>

25
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,966
What the… What is this baby doing here?

26
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,718
<i>A star for yearning</i>

27
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,470
<i>A star for poetry</i>

28
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,141
<i>And a star for Mother</i>

29
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,435
<i>Mother</i>

30
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,521
<i>Mother</i>

31
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,650
<i>I am trying to call out</i>
<i>A beautiful word for each star</i>

32
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,624
JUSTICE, POLICE

33
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,751
She left the baby in the back of your cab?

34
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,668
Yes.

35
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,962
Do you recall anything specific
about the passenger?

36
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,132
Let me think…

37
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,304
She smelled like perm solution,
the kind women use.

38
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,058
That's right. I picked her up
in front of a hair salon.

39
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,274
My goodness. She abandoned her baby
on Christmas Eve

40
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,943
without even putting socks on it.

41
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,527
Oh, dear.

42
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,158
The baby is sleeping.

43
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:03,910
It's sleeping.

44
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,495
Hush now, go to sleep.

45
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,914
Look, the baby is sleeping.

46
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,429
You two are in cahoots, aren't you?

47
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,227
Besides the seven morulas we found,
there were more fertilized eggs, right?

48
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,646
That's why Dr. Kang
went to the observation module

49
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,232
even though
there was debris flying everywhere.

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,109
As for you, the camera was an excuse.

51
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,903
You were guarding the incubator
while waiting for Dr. Kang.

52
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,741
I'd never team up with this jerk.

53
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,826
We're not in cahoots. We're enemies.

54
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,872
What are you guys doing here at this hour?

55
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,874
How many eggs did you take up there?

56
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,959
Ten?

57
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,252
Twenty?

58
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,422
Look at the CCTV footage.

59
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,305
You were going back and forth
to collect the remaining fertilized eggs.

60
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,309
You took whatever was in the incubator
in the observation module

61
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,561
and got on the escape ship, right?

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,397
When nobody knew where the tourist was,

63
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,025
you were the only one who said
he was in the observation module.

64
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,860
You two met in there, right?

65
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,780
The story about unplugging
the camera cable was a cover.

66
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,157
When Dr. Kang took the eggs
out of the incubator,

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,575
why didn't you say anything?

68
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,537
That's because you two
are working together.

69
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,207
That's why you kept your mouths shut.

70
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,959
So there was another incubator
in the observation module.

71
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,880
It was on for 40 hours,
but we had no clue.

72
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,928
If you take fertilized eggs
out of the incubator,

73
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,429
they die.

74
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,100
If it was turned on for 40 hours
as per the records,

75
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,768
then they weren't morulas yet,

76
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,770
which means they were fertilized eggs.

77
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,523
So he would've had to bring back
the whole incubator.

78
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,734
You'd have to bring it to the escape ship
and secretly hook it up.

79
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,819
But look.

80
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,695
Take a look!

81
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,615
When I came back to the main module,
I was empty-handed.

82
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,909
That's right. Your suspicion is wrong.

83
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,579
Dr. Kang simply came
to take me to the escape ship.

84
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,165
Let me tell you as an ob-gyn.

85
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,836
If it was on for 40 hours, it would be
pointless even if they were brought back.

86
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,878
Shut your mouth.

87
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,464
I can't believe a word you say anymore.

88
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,425
Now I have to go back
and review the report you wrote.

89
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,265
Chief, Gong Ryong is right.

90
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,185
If the remaining fertilized eggs
were in that incubator,

91
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,605
someone determined to bring them down

92
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,483
wouldn't have acted like
Dr. Kang on the CCTV.

93
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,361
He would have moved
the entire incubator to the Scorpion

94
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,071
to keep it plugged in.

95
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,615
If he had just taken them out
and put them in his pocket,

96
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,576
it wouldn't have taken long
for them to die.

97
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,661
What they're saying is right.

98
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,372
He didn't have the incubator strapped on,

99
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,124
and he was moving effortlessly.

100
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,960
He didn't bring back anything.

101
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,338
If there were fertilized eggs in there,

102
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,842
he would've had to bring
the entire incubator with him.

103
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,695
Thanks, Kang.

104
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,994
We're on the same team now.

105
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,829
I wasn't helping you.

106
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,210
We're on the same side now.

107
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,252
It wasn't for you.

108
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,754
There's no turning back now.

109
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,130
I said it wasn't for you.

110
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,801
See you!

111
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:35,932
Check to see

112
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,352
if either Kang-su or the tourist
declared anything odd before they went up.

113
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,436
Yes, Chief.

114
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,617
GONG RYONG

115
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,843
Thank you.

116
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,350
Is it serious?

117
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,271
How serious are you about it?

118
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,691
- What do you mean?
- Your feelings for Eve.

119
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,073
CALLS, GONG RYONG

120
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,706
Don't let Eve struggle
through the storm you created.

121
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,419
I hope you don't think
an umbrella will protect her from it.

122
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,465
It was tough for her to grow up in
an American family and become a commander.

123
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,218
She had to wait a long time for her shot.

124
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,638
I don't find you trustworthy at all.

125
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,017
Please, I'm asking you
not to make things confusing for Eve.

126
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,271
I admit

127
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,358
that I'm not a very trustworthy guy.

128
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,443
I agree.

129
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,739
And I don't have much
except for this umbrella.

130
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,159
She's going up in a few days,

131
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,205
and I won't be able to see her
for a year, or maybe longer.

132
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,084
She doesn't have any family…

133
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,714
so wouldn't it be nice if she had…

134
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,552
at least one person back here on Earth
who had her back?

135
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,516
Won't you give me a chance?

136
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,569

And…

140
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,651

143
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,675
This is driving me crazy.
Why isn't anyone answering?

144
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,567
It's okay. Let me take a look.

145
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,880
Hi, Eve.

146
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,549
I think she's pregnant.

147
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,428
Really?

148
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,224
Where are you?

149
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,309
Are you in the lab?

150
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,728
What about the ultrasound?
Did you do an ultrasound?

151
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,355
No, not yet. I'm going to do it now.

152
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,108
Okay. First, take a deep breath.

153
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,819
Is it okay if I go there?
I'll head over there right now.

154
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,781
Then can you drop by my place
and grab some hair removal cream?

155
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,075
Bring it just in case.

156
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,078
I'll get the anesthesia
and ultrasound ready.

157
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,955
Okay, got it.

158
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,837
Where is it?

159
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,618
NATIONAL CENTER
FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

160
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,872
If any space debris comes at us,

161
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,626
we load the mice onto the cargo ship
following the one-mouse-per-cage rule.

162
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,838
From the moment we arrived in Florida
until the other day when we got to Seoul,

163
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,590
it was one mouse per cage.

164
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,343
In Seoul, she's had zero contact
with a male mouse.

165
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,762
They were only together at the station.

166
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,265
<i>No, we can do a DNA test here.</i>

167
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,100
<i>In three hours,</i>
<i>we'll know who the father is.</i>

168
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,726
<i>But I'm absolutely sure.</i>

169
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,522
<i>When we cut the power to move them</i>
<i>and the camera was off,</i>

170
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,649
in that short window
while we were prepping the cages,

171
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,485
that's when they did it.

172
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,698
<i>Well, you know how mice are more sensitive</i>
<i>than humans in a crisis or disaster.</i>

173
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,701
<i>They must have felt threatened</i>
<i>because of the space debris,</i>

174
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,911
<i>which turbocharged</i>
<i>their reproductive instinct.</i>

175
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,289
<i>But we still don't know for sure, not yet.</i>

176
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,042
<i>She built a nest to prepare to give birth,</i>

177
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,836
<i>and her stomach is protruding, but…</i>

178
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,173
I mean, how awesome would it be
if she was pregnant? Please.

179
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,467
- Eve.
- Did you find it?

180
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,052
Okay, that's it.

181
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,849
A round belly and a nest
must mean she's pregnant, no?

182
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,933
There…

183
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,146
Sometimes mice build nests
just to have a place to live.

184
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,108
Okay, let's have a look.

185
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,878
It's quadruplets.

186
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,966
A mammal has gotten pregnant in space.

187
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,472
I guess we weren't the only sneaky ones
doing it in secret.

188
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,267
Do you see that?

189
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,813
I'll need to do a detailed examination,
but they're developing just like on Earth.

190
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,358
They're only a centimeter,
but everything is all there.

191
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,277
Let's check if their hearts are normal.

192
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,612
- Okay.
- Check the blood flow rate.

193
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,364
Switching to doppler.

194
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,502
Congratulations, Eve.

195
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,343
Congratulations, Female Mouse 3.
You're a mom now.

196
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,304
That's right.

197
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,350
Us too?

198
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,144
No.

199
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,355
I had a checkup with Dr. Jeon.

200
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,483
Over 90% of the time,
mice become pregnant after mating.

201
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,402
They're super fertile.

202
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,071
They can have ten pups at once.

203
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,698
Four is the minimum, actually.

204
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,666
What's wrong?

205
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,169
It's just…

206
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,842
Now you're going to have a family.

207
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,599
And so will I.

208
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:13,323
Now, we're going to make it possible
for humans to have sex,

209
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,701
get pregnant, have babies, and raise them

210
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,119
in space.

211
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,580
This is just the beginning.

212
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,541
Definitely.

213
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,418
Okay.

214
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,006
Congratulations.

215
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,968
I still can't believe it.

216
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:38,057
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

217
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,404
Congrats, Eve!

218
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,740
Your wish has finally come true!
It's happening.

219
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,366
Yeah.

220
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,035
Let's give them nicknames.

221
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,536
Yes, so they'll be healthy.

222
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,871
What should we call them, Eve?

223
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,122
How about we name them after planets?

224
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,084
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn.
Let's choose grand names!

225
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,878
How about Big, Strong, Tough, and Lucky?

226
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,672
To live a long life,
don't they use rough names like

227
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,009
Dog Poop, Cow Poop,
Horse Poop, or Mouse Poop?

228
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,053
What are you guys doing? What's going on?

229
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,430
She's pregnant.

230
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,182
Eve did it.

231
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,267
- What?
- Eve's pregnant?

232
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,022
No, the mouse is pregnant.
It's been 13 and a half days.

233
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,816
No, not "Ma Eun-su," the mouse.

234
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,111
- Oh right, the mouse.
- I see.

235
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,656
She's the first mammal to have sex
and get pregnant in space, Chief!

236
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,075
With four pups!
And without genetic defects.

237
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,702
She's pregnant with four pups!
Can you believe it?

238
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,162
My goodness!

239
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,705
Is it true, Eve?

240
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,375
This is totally unexpected.
Congratulations, Eve.

241
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,380
You're sure she got pregnant
at the station, in zero gravity, right?

242
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,464
Yes.

243
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,926
Who should I be reporting this to?

244
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,761
Where should I brag about this?

245
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,765
That 2-million-won mouse
is now worth 20 billion won!

246
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,351
But how come
you're just finding out about it now?

247
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,397
If you don't check the mouse
within 24 hours of mating,

248
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,065
the copulatory plug disappears.

249
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,775
And even on days 13 and 14,

250
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,319
it's hard to tell
just by touching her belly.

251
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,030
They're only one centimeter,
but they'll keep thriving from now on.

252
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
One centimeter?

253
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,617
When is the due date?

254
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,953
It's around 21 days.

255
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,204
Will they be born here?

256
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,790
No way.
They should be born at the station.

257
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,833
Is that possible?

258
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,751
They could die.

259
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,546
They were created in space,
so we should run the tests there.

260
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,881
Why would we do it here?

261
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,550
When leaving Earth,
it's 4G inside the spacecraft.

262
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,551
Can they survive it?

263
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,554
There has been a case of a pregnant mouse
going up to space.

264
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,348
That's different.
It got pregnant on Earth.

265
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,517
This is the first time
it's happened in space.

266
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,311
The starting point is different.

267
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,272
But the pregnant mouse
came back safely, didn't it?

268
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,608
Listen, you idiot.
Are you really a mouse expert?

269
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,984
That was during the early stages.

270
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,528
Now, the babies are fully developed.

271
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,407
Even if they are in the mother's womb,
while passing through Earth's atmosphere,

272
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,867
with extreme 4G pressure,

273
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,369
the mother's blood pressure
will change rapidly,

274
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,372
and the babies might not
receive oxygen for a while.

275
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,166
They might make it if it's 4G.

276
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,877
- Right, Eve?
- Eve?

277
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,295
Is that right, Eve?

278
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:19,009
If the oxygen supply to the blood
is cut off under 4G of pressure,

279
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,929
whether they will survive or die

280
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,848
is honestly yet to be known
because this is a first.

281
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,058
That's right.

282
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,561
It's the first time. We should try it!

283
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,773
Let's not take them. It's too dangerous.

284
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,024
Exactly! It's dangerous.

285
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,152
Eve, this isn't the time
to be sentimental.

286
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,988
We're scientists, remember?

287
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,950
Calm down.

288
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,870
So now that we know it's possible
to successfully mate and get pregnant,

289
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,165
let's just observe her here
until she gives birth.

290
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,377
I think we need to research
and compare the changes that occur

291
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,173
when a mammal becomes pregnant
in zero gravity versus in gravity.

292
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,095
It would be best to attempt
giving birth in space at a later time.

293
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,806
If she successfully gives birth,

294
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,183
that mouse's value
will become two trillion won.

295
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,104
It could unlock new possibilities and hope
for human survival beyond Earth.

296
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,898
We have to go all-in.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

297
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,941
Go all-in?

298
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,527
What if they die on the way up?

299
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,195
It doesn't matter if they die?

300
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,323
Nobody here wants them to die.

301
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,243
They survived 4G on the way down.

302
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,830
Hey, nobody wants to see them survive
more than I do.

303
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,665
She's a week away from giving birth.

304
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,710
She'll be at full term
when she goes up to space with me.

305
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,753
In human terms,

306
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,923
it's like putting a woman
who's nine months into a spacecraft.

307
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,717
Yet you want to bet on this situation?

308
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,469
Does it surprise you that I'm mad?

309
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,888
Come on.
We don't know anything about it yet.

310
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,474
- Just send it up, regardless!
- How could you say "regardless"?

311
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,892
You know what?

312
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,854
Today, can't we just be happy
and celebrate instead of arguing?

313
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,606
How could you say that as a scientist?
Do you have any idea…

314
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,566
Time for champagne.

315
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,692
Yeah! Champagne!

316
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,152
We stayed up all night…

317
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,361
I've already told you.

318
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,449
It survived on the way down
because it was still in the early stages.

319
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,474
It landed on her.

320
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,901
You guys are thrilled
that I'm getting fired, aren't you?

321
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,911
The disciplinary hearing will start soon.
Let's get ready.

322
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,037
Everybody topped up?

323
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,996
- Yes.
- Yes.

324
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,959
Here's to a safe delivery!

325
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,003
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

326
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,298
A toast to Eve, for successfully
getting the mouse pregnant.

327
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,383
- To Eve!
- To Eve!

328
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:14,351
For something different today,
I'd like two iced Americanos, please.

329
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,435
Sure.

330
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,567
<i>There's no information available</i>
<i>on your biological parents.</i>

331
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,570
<i>1988, Christmas Eve.</i>

332
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,323
<i>You were found in a taxi</i>
<i>near Chuncheon Station.</i>

333
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:32,077
<i>The police couldn't identify your parents</i>
<i>when you were brought in.</i>

334
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,913
<i>Even after, there is no record</i>
<i>of your biological parents</i>

335
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,914
<i>trying to find you.</i>

336
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:36,832
What is that?

337
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,378
Which one's mine?

338
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,380
They're the same.

339
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,382
But…

340
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,425
Just drink it.

341
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,010
How can you be so clueless?

342
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,685
Oh man, the delivery room
was bursting at the seams.

343
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,314
Well, I guess it's a good thing
because we have serious population issues.

344
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,482
Hey.

345
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,109
What?

346
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,652
How do you register a marriage?

347
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,783
You must've done it before.

348
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,037
Look at you. Are you getting married?

349
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,292
Let's go. You need an MRI.

350
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,627
Your brain isn't functioning properly
right now.

351
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,381
Do I have to get the papers
from the district office or something?

352
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,049
Are you insane?

353
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,134
With who?

354
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,678
Did your commander say she'd marry you?

355
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,349
Isn't she going back up to space
in a few days?

356
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,519
She'll be gone for a year and you want…

357
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:44,566
All you did was study back in school
and now you decide to be Mr. Drama?

358
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,692
This is too much drama.

359
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,904
Why are you in such a rush?

360
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,868
Look,

361
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,330
you need two witnesses,
and the process is…

362
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,915
It's about becoming a family, dude.

363
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,708
Think carefully.

364
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,878
It's not the same as dating, man.

365
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,797
So, you'll be one witness and…

366
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,882
Me and?

367
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,469
I'm all you've got, right?
Your moms would be totally against it.

368
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,554
And you know what?

369
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,431
I won't sign as a witness either.

370
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,557
At least not right now.

371
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,145
This is the reality of this thing
you guys call love.

372
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,813
No witnesses to support you.

373
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,107
Do I have to have witnesses?

374
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,986
Take it up with the district office.

375
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,239
What would a witness know anyway?

376
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,994
You're acting strange.

377
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,039
First off, it's weird to ask me,
given I'm divorced.

378
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,751
Hey, witness.

379
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,300
I haven't even had a sip.

380
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,052
Could I get this to go, please?

381
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,136
Sure.

382
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,980
Seriously, congratulations!

383
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,815
I can't believe she managed to…

384
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,798
Name, Kang Kang-su.

385
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,260
Under the International
Institute of Space United,

386
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,430
due to violations of the experimental
ethics regulations of the KSA,

387
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,266
your status as an astronaut
has been permanently revoked.

388
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,977
You can no longer apply
to be an astronaut,

389
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,772
and you are prohibited from visiting
the space station even as a civilian.

390
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,360
You are also permanently excluded
from the space fruit fly project.

391
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,406
Do you have any objections?

392
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,125
No objections?

393
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,717
I have a lot of objections.

394
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,968
Kang Kang-su.

395
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,139
Are you trying to make trouble
for everyone as you leave?

396
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,059
Do you think they're enjoying
watching you get punished?

397
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,979
Thanks to Eve's swift disposal
of your contraband

398
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,190
and your colleagues' active cooperation

399
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,567
in handling the situation
with professionalism,

400
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,070
we've managed to keep this
from escalating, understand?

401
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:40,658
If you had brought that down to Earth,
you wouldn't be sitting there right now.

402
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,118
You'd be sitting in jail.

403
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,164
Because of you, the KSA
almost became a global embarrassment.

404
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,874
Are you resentful or what?

405
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,462
You should be thankful to your colleagues
for preventing that.

406
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,592
Sure.

407
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,221
Dr. Kang Kang-su,

408
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,683
surrender all your astronaut credentials
and lab access cards.

409
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,372
This is everything.

410
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,921
Hand in that suit too.

411
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,529
Has any other astronaut given as much
to fruit fly research as me?

412
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,080
It seems you're all celebrating
a mouse getting pregnant in zero gravity.

413
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,043
When mouse research in space

414
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,379
was just starting in the '70s,
the fruit flies

415
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,591
had already been getting pregnant

416
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,843
and producing offspring
for multiple generations.

417
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,014
Fruit flies beat you by 50 years,
and yet this is a cause for celebration?

418
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,027
Being an astronaut ruined my relationship…

419
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:45,200
and I lost my child too, but I remained
dedicated to fruit fly research.

420
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,328
So, I'm going to take this suit with me.

421
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,705
Chief.

422
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,001
I like this suit.
It was custom-made to fit me perfectly.

423
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,004
It's not like anyone else can wear it.

424
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,384
You're here to return that suit.

425
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,054
I'll buy it. How much do you want for it?

426
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,181
Are you kidding me?
Do you know where you are?

427
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,850
Take it off.

428
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,872
Traitors.

429
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,012
I don't need this damn suit!

430
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,768
You know,

431
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,523
I was going to quit this stupid
astronaut job before I got fired anyway.

432
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,989
Face reality, guys.

433
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,700
Being an astronaut

434
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,827
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

435
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,580
No need to be nervous.

436
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,917
Don't worry, if you get fired,
my dad will hire you.

437
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,065
Hi.

438
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,318
Hey, so I was wondering…

439
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,612
What happened to that new life?

440
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,322
What?

441
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,448
<i>Did it get back safely?</i>

442
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,410
No.

443
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,121
Is it alive?

444
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,624
You don't need to know.

445
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,711
Is it dead?

446
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,171
<i>It's best if you don't know.</i>

447
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,967
Knowing might put you in danger.
You could get hurt.

448
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,179
<i>Just forget about it.</i>
<i>It's all in the past.</i>

449
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,139
So it's dead.

450
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,933
How are our fruit flies?

451
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,521
Well, Indecency is dead.

452
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,730
What?

453
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,358
What happened?

454
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,193
Old age.

455
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,779
Right.

456
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,532
<i>It lived for 50 days,</i>
<i>so it lived a long life.</i>

457
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,201
As for Public and Star,

458
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,287
they've been stuck to a banana stem
all day and won't let go.

459
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,836
You've already given it a name?
Is it male?

460
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,088
- <i>Yes.</i>
- You named him without running it by me?

461
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,091
He's "Star"
because he wasn't born on Earth.

462
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,259
I see.

463
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,721
How are the mice?

464
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,975
I'm going to eat, sleep,
and stay with them until they're born.

465
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,228
It's all so new,
I feel like I'm treading on eggshells.

466
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,148
<i>This reminds me of the first baby</i>
<i>I brought into this world.</i>

467
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,651
We also brought Star
into the world together.

468
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,738
Don't hesitate to call
if you need me again.

469
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,866
Okay.

470
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,292
So it did come down.

471
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,715
It's alive.

472
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,140
We're both going to make it happen.

473
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,488
Relax.

474
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,531
You're all done.

475
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,123
Everything looks good
with the uterine lining.

476
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,001
We can do the implantation in secret

477
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,754
after the clinic closes
and everyone's gone.

478
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,509
Do you think I can handle it?

479
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,969
Better than anyone else I know.

480
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,307
Your uterus hasn't had
any problems to date.

481
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,267
Just think happy thoughts.

482
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,604
Thank you, Dr. Gong.

483
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,607
You won't need anesthesia.

484
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,609
It'll only take five minutes.
Quick, right?

485
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,031
After the procedure, you should lie down
and rest for two hours.

486
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,407
Then, you'll be discharged.

487
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,745
It will be at 8 p.m.,

488
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,873
the day after tomorrow.

489
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,252
It's set for the day after tomorrow,
in the evening.

490
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,505
Make sure security is tight.

491
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,548
Yes, sir.

492
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,466
I'll put the legal team on standby.

493
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,387
Dad.

494
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,556
What is it?

495
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,770
After Ryong finishes the IVF,

496
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,024
Min-jeong and I are going to leave.

497
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,362
We'll return when the baby is born.

498
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,368
Yes, that's a good idea.

499
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,037
Enjoy your honeymoon for a year.

500
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,584
I'll feel better knowing
that Ryong is by Min-jeong's side.

501
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,961
Ryong needs to continue his work here.

502
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,005
What about Ryong's life?

503
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,673
What do you mean?

504
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,051
Many patients should have

505
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,388
the opportunity to be treated
by a doctor like Ryong.

506
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,893
Plus, if he's always by Min-jeong's side,
people will think something's up.

507
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,270
It'll be a headache
if people get suspicious.

508
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,607
You think so?

509
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,150
Once the embryo is implanted,

510
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,194
we don't necessarily need Ryong.

511
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,530
We'll come back when the child is older,
and I can get married then.

512
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,657
But you were so eager to get married.

513
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,369
Now that Ryong has come back

514
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,414
after successfully completing the IVF,

515
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,294
I'm starting to get bored of him.

516
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,380
Are you serious?

517
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,759
Of course, I'm bored.
What does he have going for him?

518
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,096
Even still, isn't that a bit much?

519
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,599
Where's your loyalty?

520
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,101
You may be my daughter,
but you're acting like a brat.

521
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,186
Come on,

522
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,232
he risked his life
and went all the way to space for you.

523
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,358
Exactly.

524
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,319
That's a lot to deal with,

525
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,864
and I don't like
how he's so dependent on me.

526
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,994
It sucks, actually.

527
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,415
The reports you submitted with the tourist
were delivered.

528
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,750
Once they arrive,

529
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,961
they'll use them
to examine the module in detail.

530
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,089
I'd like you to be ready
to lend a hand when they call.

531
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,924
Okay.

532
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,175
<i>Ignition.</i>

533
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,969
<i>Launch command for ignition.</i>

534
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,347
<i>First stage.</i>

535
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,516
The station looks like it's in bad shape.

536
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,767
I know.

537
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,145
They're bringing back detailed footage
of the parts that need repair,

538
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,899
so your team should be fully prepared
to go up and restore it.

539
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,942
Yes.

540
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,944
<i>Liftoff!</i>

541
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,112
<i>Liftoff.</i>

542
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,451
Man, how could they possibly
want to go up there already?

543
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,254
When will they be back?

544
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,880
The day after tomorrow.

545
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,555
What?

546
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,433
You're a go for the mission.

547
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,602
Don't make things weird up there.

548
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,604
Your job is to bring the ILS back to life.

549
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,899
Eve is the commander,
and you're just in charge of repairs.

550
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,777
This is what you applied for, understand?

551
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,696
Eve is your commanding officer.

552
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,490
Aye, aye, Captain.

553
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,099
<i>The truth is,</i>

554
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,685
<i>I came here to create embryos</i>
<i>using the MZ Group heir's sperm</i>

555
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,063
<i>and his wife's eggs.</i>

556
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,899
<i>I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.</i>

557
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,486
<i>I fertilized them behind your back,</i>

558
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,572
<i>and the embryo is now in the incubator.</i>

559
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,825
<i>Please don't let it die.</i>

560
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,835
There was a disciplinary hearing,

561
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,630
and since Kang Kang-su
didn't say anything about the morula,

562
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:47,551
he was the only one to lose
his astronaut qualifications and be fired.

563
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,890
How would you feel about
thanking him for that?

564
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,850
Just leave it alone.

565
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,311
Have you forgotten that he's rude
and a backstabber?

566
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,820
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

567
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,774
This isn't your house.

568
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,402
What time is it now?

569
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,033
Right, it's nighttime.

570
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,036
It's night, indeed.

571
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,416
It's nighttime again.

572
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,335
I came to see you at night, Go-eun.

573
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,632
I'm sorry. I'll come during the day.

574
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,219
I'm not

575
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,222
a guy who only comes to see you at night.

576
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,601
I'll come back during the day.

577
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,978
Bye.

578
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,605
Unbelievable.

579
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,281
Why can't you find your key card?

580
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,582
What's this?

581
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,044
What's this doing in here?

582
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,466
Why is this in your wallet?

583
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,596
We are over.

584
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,990
I have to pee.

585
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,618
I'm going to pee my pants.

586
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,873
I have to pee.

587
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,502
I think I'm going to pee my pants.
I have to pee.

588
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,352
I heard you got fired today.

589
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,774
Serves you right.

590
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,618
We lost our baby…

591
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,875
but I really wanted to save the morula.

592
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,089
Even though it was a morula
that Gong Ryong created…

593
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,720
I wanted to protect it.

594
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,621

00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,595
What brings you all the way out here?

597
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,477
I wasn't able to go home last night,
so I'm a bit of a mess.

598
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,270
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

599
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,772
Have you had breakfast?

600
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,150
Not yet, I've been too busy to eat.

601
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,988
I thought you might like
a home-cooked meal.

602
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,364
Eat it while it's hot.

603
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,035
Wow,

604
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,786
this already smells amazing.

605
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,122
May I open it?

606
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,290
Yes, of course.

607
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,293
It's so warm.

608
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,762
I've never had a meal like this
cooked for me before.

609
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,181
It looks delicious.

610
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,850
Thank you. It looks great.

611
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,647
Wow, it looks delicious.

612
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,400
May I ask you something?

613
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,069
By all means.

614
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,368
You said you were abandoned
on Christmas Eve.

615
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:11,703
That's right.

616
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,583
You weren't abandoned
at Chuncheon Station, were you?

617
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,216
It wasn't in a taxi, was it?

618
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,139
It wasn't in a taxi heading
to Chuncheon Station

619
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,768
on Christmas Eve
the year the Olympics were held, was it?

620
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,913
No, it wasn't.

621
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,337
Right, of course not.

622
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,882
I'm sorry.

623
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,096
I too abandoned my child

624
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,807
on Christmas Eve.

625
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,854
I didn't want to have the baby.

626
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,274
Even though he died young,

627
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,526
I can't forgive that bastard.

628
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,404
Having that child ruined my life.

629
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:31,116
It ruined my life as a woman.

630
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,287
I had to work in a bar to make money…

631
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,665
but my breasts leaked

632
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,002
because they were full of milk.

633
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,465
It made me want to die.

634
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,010
I wanted to live, actually.

635
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,805
But until Ryong came into my life,

636
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:58,894
all I could think about every single day
was how I wanted to die.

637
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,484
Even though I wanted to do
whatever I could to survive.

638
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,948
Not once have I thought of myself
as that child's mother.

639
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,619
Not once have I looked for it.
I've never wanted to.

640
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,374
That's because…

641
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:26,713
when I think about that child,
my sins feel a million times worse.

642
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,591
Even though I'm the victim here.

643
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,235
Your mother…

644
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,364
I'm sure someone like me
can't even compare to your mother.

645
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,491
She's probably very educated,

646
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,702
beautiful,

647
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,206
and a truly amazing person.

648
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,670
She must have had no choice.

649
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,756
It must have been a circumstance
that was beyond her control,

650
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,176
which is why she did what she did.

651
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,182
Right.

652
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,771
To me, Ryong is the only child I have.

653
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,859
He knows nothing about this.

654
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531
I would like to keep it that way.

655
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:41,955
Yes, ma'am.

656

THE PROBABILITY OF MATERNITY:
99.999%

658
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,956
Eve!

659
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,876
- Female Mouse 3 is bleeding.
- What?

660
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,627
There was blood there before…

661
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,921
Hurry! Hurry up!
Take a look at the ultrasound!

662
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,801
I'm told Female Mouse 3 isn't moving.

663
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,428
What about the babies?

664
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,931
Their umbilical veins have narrowed.

665
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,642
It's hypoxia.

666
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,229
The narrowing of the umbilical veins
is restricting blood flow.

667
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,815
The mother's decreased respiratory rate
is depriving the babies of oxygen.

668
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,276
Have you checked the diameter
of her uterine artery?

669
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,324
- Eve.
- One of their hearts has stopped beating.

670
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,658
- No!
- What?

671
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,535
Will they all die if one of them dies?

672
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,870
Eve…

673
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,706
All of their hearts have stopped beating.

674
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,673
And the mother?

675
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,969
- What about the mother?
- Pardon?

676
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,263
Oh, right.

677
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,270
The mother is also going to die soon.

678
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:56,858
Get out of the way.

679
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,193
I'll do it.

680
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,527
What can you do? Move.

681
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,946
I have to euthanize her.

682
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,072
It's my job.

683
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,573
We're not euthanizing her!

684
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,326
I'm going to save her. I can do it.

685
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,244
Eve, let's go.

686
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,163
So you save her, then you take her home?

687
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,666
Please, let me do the surgery.

688
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,459
I'm going to open her up.

689
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,419
I'm going to save at least one of them.

690
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,254
I won't let them all die!

691
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,423
Maybe the mother wants to live.

692
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,550
I wanted to live, actually.

693
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,721
Okay, we won't euthanize her.
Come on, let's go.

694
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,556
Please, just let me do the surgery.

695
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,266
Get ready!

696
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,315
<i>Even though I wanted to do</i>
<i>whatever I could to survive.</i>

697
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,819
Damn it.

698
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,309
What is it?

699
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,895
<i>I feel like I got a load off my chest,</i>

700
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:20,108
but I'm starting to think
I may have been overly focused on myself.

701
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,193
Maybe you should go see your captain.

702
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,988
Come on, why did you go there?

703
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,033
I just wanted to take her some breakfast.

704
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,869
You did? What's the occasion?

705
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,704
Whatever, hurry up and go see her.

706
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,456
<i>Fine.</i>

707
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,834
He must really like her.

708
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,537
What's wrong? Why do you look so tired?

709
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,746
Were you up all night?

710
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,165
No, that's not it.

711
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,045
Take a look at this.

712
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,172
What is it?

713
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,306
Look.

714
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,270
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

715
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,314
Yi-man didn't want to be a witness,
but I forced him.

716
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,733
Oh, but Dr. Na was more than happy to.

717
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,779
You and I are the same.

718
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,826
Since I'm registered under my late mom,

719
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,536
mine is also blank.

720
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,998
But I'm forever grateful
to the three moms who raised me.

721
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,509
What's wrong? Is it too much for you?

722
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,267
- Well…
- This isn't a proposal.

723
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,686
I'm not suggesting we rush into marriage.

724
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,025
Just hang on to it,
and look at it when you feel sad

725
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,652
about the fact
that you don't have a family.

726
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,615
And I would like it even better

727
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,117
if you mailed it to
Seongdeungpo-gu Office, 361-1,

728
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:19,078
Danghwa-dong 6-ga, Seongdeungpo-gu, Seoul

729
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,330
from space.

730
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,833
Unbelievable.

731
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,007
Feel free to throw it away.

732
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,723
What makes family so special anyway?

733
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,725
If you love each other, that's family.

734
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,776
Don't cry alone anymore.

735
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,784
Okay.

736
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,897
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

737
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,275
<i>I just want to know</i>

738
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,235
<i>why she abandoned me.</i>

739
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,363
<i>You think you can wear me down with this</i>

740
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,407
and make me share
the lottery winnings with you?

741
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,117
<i>Tonight.</i>

742
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,829
As the commander,
I'm not sure if I should let this happen.

743
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,623
<i>What if she saw this note?</i>

744
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,626
What if she chose not to report this
to me or the IOU?

745
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,044
<i>She's an accomplice.</i>

746
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,337
<i>You've never even seen it.</i>

747
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,755
Those are the facts.

748
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,341
We need to seize it
and punish him before that happens.

749
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,427
<i>Your colleagues, your beloved tourist</i>…

750
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,595
<i>He'll end up in prison!</i>

751
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:06,102
