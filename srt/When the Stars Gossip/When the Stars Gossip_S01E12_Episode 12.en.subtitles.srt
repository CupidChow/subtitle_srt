1
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,718
I can't believe this.

3
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,644
YOUR ROYAL CHOICE,
COME ALONG WITH ROYAL BANK

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,605
It wasn't ours to begin with.

5
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,107
We will be punished for our greed.

6
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,320
Now what?

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,200
Stop it. This is not the time
to be blubbering.

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,582
Come on. He's the one who lost it,
and we found it for him.

9
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,335
So he should give us a cut.

10
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,172
Are we just going to sit here
and let him take it from us?

11
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,177
Let's go ask Dr. Kang for a cut.

12
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,721
It was partly his fault for losing it.

13
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,182
All we did was find it for him.

14
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,313
What are you doing?
Go negotiate with Dr. Kang right now!

15
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,690
-What?
-"What?"

16
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,651
Wasn't it you who squandered it, Dr. Lee?

17
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,027
After taxes,

18
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,948
the four of us could've gotten
83.75 billion won each.

19
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,742
But you blew it all for us,
didn't you, Dr. Lee?

20
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,704
If you screwed up,

21
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,792
you should take responsibility
and get some of it back, don't you think?

22
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,596
I heard he's staying at this hotel.

23
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,743
Forget it. I'll go by myself.

24
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,413
Don't get involved.
Whether I have to kneel or beg

25
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,416
or let him throw me out the window,
I'll handle it alone.

26
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,584
Dr. Lee,

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,961
go home.

28
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,006
I don't want to be with my sister.

29
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,802
I'm so angry at myself,

30
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,722
I can only imagine
how angry everyone else is.

31
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,976
I'm sorry my sister was so harsh.

32
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,902
My head is still ringing from being hit.

33
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,487
Is there a welt?

34
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,968
You came in on your own.

35
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,803
There's no leaving now.

36
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,597
Okay.

37
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,237
Ryong.

38
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,992
I brought Ggong. Open the door.

39
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,004
Ryong.

40
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,299
Hang on.

41
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,455
We're working on a rep--

42
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,999
Let's work on it separately.

43
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,626
When you're done, send it to me first.

44
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,091
I…

45
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,428
have something I want to say to you.

46
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,513
Can you hold your liquor?

47
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,726
Say it to me. Why--

48
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,147
Fine. Where should we go?

49
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,304
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,100
Just go, Commander.

51
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,146
Let's go home.

52
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,149
Okay.

53
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,986
No.

54
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,492
Don't leave.

55
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,541
Okay.

56
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,836
-Can you hold your liquor?
-I like to drink.

57
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,671
-But can you hold it?
-I like it.

58
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,005
Then, let's make a bet.

59
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,259
So what, the person
who drinks the most gets Ryong?

60
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,343
How did you know?

61
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,618
Slow down.

62
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,584
How mortifying.

63
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,841
Is the bet on?

64
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,177
I'm not joining in.

65
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,350
You're so fucking annoying.

66
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,312
Did you just swear?

67
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,571
There's a lot worse where that came from,

68
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,407
but I'm not drunk enough to say it yet.

69
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,161
You should go and swear at Ryong.

70
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,289
He's the one who had a change of heart.

71
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,798
Weren't you the one who turned Ryong

72
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,967
into a traitor?

73
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,305
Drink.

74
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,824
You can really drink.

75
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,787
Pour me another one.

76
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,289
-Why?
-You've had four drinks.

77
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,542
I have?

78
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,891
Now we're even.

79
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,604
Excuse me.

80
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,649
Can I have another bottle?

81
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,076
I was hoping to have a sober conversation.

82
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,122
So much for that.

83
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,052
Thank you

84
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,388
for saving my Ryong.

85
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,141
I wanted to thank you in person.

86
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,395
This all happened because I like Ryong.

87
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,149
I'm sorry.

88
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,737
I tried really hard not to like him,

89
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,322
but I couldn't help it.

90
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,993
I'm really sorry.

91
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,628
All of the shiny things below this hotel

92
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,340
are things Ryong wants from me.

93
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,258
That's why he likes me.

94
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,263
In order to get me,

95
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,432
Ryong risked his life and went to space.

96
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,227
He won't give up
the space fertility clinic

97
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,688
my dad promised him.

98
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,569
Ryong is actually quite materialistic.

99
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,238
A hardworking astronaut doesn't suit him.

100
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,825
You're just a novelty, something new,

101
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,202
but he'll get bored soon.

102
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,037
He'll get bored soon?

103
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,999
Do I look like a boring woman to you?

104
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,961
You saw Ryong as someone
who paid 70 billion won to go to space,

105
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:15,132
the future son-in-law
of the chairman of MZ Group.

106
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,969
But I saw Ryong
when he was driving a lemon,

107
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,265
when he was a doctor living in poverty.

108
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,939
I saw Ryong when he was
desperately trying to get to the top.

109
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,443
You don't understand the compassion…

110
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,656
I feel for that man.

111
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,868
I couldn't care less about that.

112
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,704
Do I look like a boring woman to you?

113
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,001
This won't do.

114
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,760
If I drink every drop of alcohol
in this place,

115
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,097
will you give me Ryong?

116
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,392
I have a feeling
I'm going to be drinking all of it.

117
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,276
GONG RYONG

118
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,411
RYONG

119
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,214
Why aren't they answering?
It's driving me nuts.

120
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,509
Open the door.

121
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,094
You're mine.

122
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,722
Ryong.

123
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,017
Are you okay? You stink of booze.

124
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,729
Eve, are you okay?

125
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:56,775
Did you really have so much to say
that you had to call both of us?

126
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,986
It must be nice
to have so many women to call.

127
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,154
Come on.

128
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,948
Come on, sober up. Are you okay?

129
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,408
Don't touch me.

130
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,661
You have no right to say anything.

131
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,789
-Are you okay?
-Give me a minute.

132
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,669
Eve, are you okay?

133
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,963
Hey, why are you lying there?

134
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,508
-I need to lie down too.
-What?

135
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,514
Don't lie there.

136
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:31,060
If you have something to say,
say it in front of us.

137
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,605
That's why we came back together.
Say what you have to say.

138
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,982
That's right. Say it.

139
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,318
Are you going to sleep here?

140
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,445
-Yes.
-Then I'm going to sleep here too.

141
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,865
I'll take you home. Let's go.

142
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,617
-Who?
-Me?

143
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,372
Should the three of us sleep here then?

144
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,832
-You leave then.
-Yeah.

145
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,419
You can leave.

146
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,589
This is too stressful.

147
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,970
I'm cold.

148
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,346
No.

149
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,848
I'm cold.

150
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,065
Sleep.

151
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,317
This is nice.

152
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,820
It's so warm.

153
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,072
This is nice.

154
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,825
So nice.

155
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,006
Where is this girl?
Why isn't she answering the phone?

156
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,677
DONA

157
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,165
Is it the winning number
for the 2,456th lottery?

158
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,834
It is. May I ask what took you so long?

159
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,461
Can I claim the prize now?

160
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,005
Yes, of course.
I mean it's a king's ransom.

161
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,215
We were wondering where the winner was.

162
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,058
The doors are closing.

163
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,351
Okay, thank you.

164
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,258
We…

165
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,427
We went to the buffet.
It's not what you think.

166
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,306
I don't care if you just slept
or copulated.

167
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,934
Are you going to stand here all day?

168
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,234
I didn't say you could sit.

169
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,541
We're sorry, Dr. Kang.

170
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,168
I'm probably coming across
as a real jerk right now.

171
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,461
Why are you kneeling?

172
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,088
Dr. Kang.

173
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,924
You know what a scaredy-cat I am.

174
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,722
The minute I picked up the lottery ticket,
I was going to find out whose it was,

175
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,433
and I swear,
I was going to return it to them.

176
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,851
Whose idea was it?

177
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,313
Who told you to steal my money?

178
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,528
He's so hopeless.

179
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,073
I was going to give it back. I promise.

180
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,242
"Why would you give it back?"

181
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,327
"If you give it back to Dr. Kang,

182
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,122
it'll be like pouring a bottle of water
into the Han River."

183
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,500
"You're crazy. If you give it back to him,
you're an idiot."

184
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,127
Like I said, who was it?

185
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,510
-Was it you, Dr. Lee?
-Me?

186
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,638
It wasn't me.

187
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,432
Was it Santi who made you thieves?

188
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,558
No.

189
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,773
Was Ryong the ringleader?

190
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,525
No, no.

191
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,528
Mr. Gong did nothing wrong.

192
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,197
I swear on my honor as an astronaut,

193
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,949
the three of us wanted to return it.

194
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,036
The three of us discussed it,
and while you were sleeping,

195
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,624
we put it right in front of your face
so you couldn't miss it, and then we left.

196
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,084
That's all.

197
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,961
That's the most important thing, Dr. Kang.

198
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,256
But incredibly,
in the middle of that chaos,

199
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,093
Ryong was lucky enough to find it,
and when he came back,

200
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,385
he gave it to us.

201
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,264
As soon as I held it,
I thought, "Is this fate?"

202
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,726
"Why is it back in my possession?"
Of course, I was tempted.

203
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,771
I was, but I said, "Let's give it back."

204
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,773
"We have to give it back."

205
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,109
It was nearly a year old.

206
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,154
We thought we might be overreacting
over a worthless piece of paper.

207
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,366
The plan was to call Houston
to check if the ticket was still valid,

208
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,575
and then return it.

209
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,286
That's what the phone call
in the bathroom was about.

210
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,418
That's the truth.

211
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,004
So from the beginning,

212
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,841
it was Ryong who said,
"Give it back? Are you an idiot?"

213
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,970
And the bastard
who picked it up at the ILS

214
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,598
and gave it to you three and not me,
knowing full well whose it was, was Ryong.

215
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,694
That guy is turning
taking my things into a hobby.

216
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,414
He already has Ms. Choi.

217
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,749
Why the hell would he have
a crush on someone?

218
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,128
Shouldn't we go get her
and teach her a lesson?

219
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,421
Should we torment her?

220
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,631
So the commander or captain
or whatever leaves?

221
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,008
Take that!

222
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,551
Hey, turn it off.

223
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,929
Let's not dance around the issue
and just bring them here

224
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,723
so we can get to the bottom of it.

225
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,934
How are we supposed to know
if it's one-sided or if she seduced him?

226
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
You're right.

227
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,064
When I was there that day,

228
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,774
they were both in a sleeping bag

229
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,276
without any underwear on.

230
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,569
Underwear…

231
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,779
-Both without any underwear on?
-What?

232
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,780
Really?

233
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,117
-Why are you telling us that now?
-Why are you telling us that now?

234
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,119
Damn it.

235
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,379
What is it?

236
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,466
She saved your life.
We want to show our gratitude.

237
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,469
Bring that girl by
so we can feed her a home-cooked meal.

238
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,888
I know what you all are up to.

239
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,973
What are we up to?

240
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,228
I'm busy.
I came to get my homework reviewed.

241
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,354
Listen, you brat.

242
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,607
If you knew us so well and how we feel,
you wouldn't have said that crap

243
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,192
after drinking yesterday!

244
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,652
Come on, I…

245
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,238
I'm feeling conflicted as it is.
I don't need your nagging.

246
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,114
I'm sure the same goes for the commander.

247
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,160
Things are already complicated enough,
so stay out of it.

248
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:50,123
Listen! We're going to make her
a home-cooked meal. You better bring her.

249
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,209
-Got it?
-Mom.

250
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,379
How would you feel if your boyfriend's ex

251
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,423
told you all about their relationship?

252
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,133
I'd be totally put off.

253
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,470
You shouldn't let that happen
in the first place if you're a man.

254
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,554
It would be over.

255
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,642
-Was that about you?
-Was that about you?

256
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,601
I'm hanging up.

257
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,519
-Hey!
-What'd he say?

258
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,770
-You punk.
-Hang up.

259
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,156
Thank you for your reports.

260
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,868
Ryong, you were trying to remove
the cable for the camera you took

261
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,120
and got trapped alone.

262
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,208
It wasn't just ours. Dozens of cables from
various countries were tangled together.

263
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,794
So it wasn't easy to just remove mine.

264
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,380
No matter how well
you organize the cables,

265
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,798
they go wild in microgravity.

266
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,971
Once you were in the sleeping bag,
you followed the guidelines for survival.

267
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,889
Yes.

268
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,310
But why didn't you take off your socks,
Mr. Gong?

269
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,020
Your feet could've gotten frostbite.

270
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,817
Oh, my socks…

271
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,487
Well, you know, socks are…

272
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,949
Chief, as you're aware,

273
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:10,203
it isn't easy to bend over and put on
or take off your socks in zero gravity.

274
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,289
That's why we wear the same pair of socks

275
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,875
for days in a row
even though we change clothes daily.

276
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,793
It was too hard, so we gave up.

277
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,087
Fair enough.

278
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,300
Anyway, thanks for working so hard
to write such detailed reports.

279
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,345
It's going to be a big help.

280
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,221
Are we finished?

281
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,851
You've had an incredible journey,
teetering on the brink of life and death.

282
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,352
We won't forget it either.

283
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,356
Right.

284
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,776
This is where we part ways.

285
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,903
You can leave now.

286
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,910
Eve and I have more things to discuss.

287
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,289
I'll be going then.

288
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,098
Goodbye.

289
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,602
Since we had the wrap-up party
for Expedition 3 yesterday,

290
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,479
don't meet the tourist personally anymore.

291
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,483
I know he said it was one-sided,
but it's not a good look.

292
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,609
People will talk.

293
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,611
People are already gossiping.

294
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,157
Have you forgotten that there are
more people who want you to fail

295
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,786
and take your position
than there are who support you?

296
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,871
You worked so hard to get here.

297
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,165
I don't want this
to tarnish your reputation.

298
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,506
Does it feel like
I'm interfering in your personal life?

299
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,590
Did I go too far?

300
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,511
No.

301
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,848
Don't ever see him again. Got it?

302
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,769
You're not answering.

303
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,980
Okay.

304
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,446
Have you given up
on your unrequited love?

305
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,075
I'm not going to do that anymore.

306
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,161
That's good.
You've come to your senses.

307
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,581
By the way…

308
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,751
The prime example of a mammal,
the mouse, hasn't had sex in space yet,

309
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,378
or gotten pregnant or given birth.

310
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,756
You're an ob-gyn, aren't you?

311
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,467
-Huh?
-In microgravity,

312
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,512
what do you think is the most
crucial factor for life to be born?

313
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,764
Why can't mammals have sex up there?

314
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,606
Let's do it together.

315
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,195
A pretty little mouse

316
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,488
might have already done it.

317
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,577
-What?
-You just didn't see it.

318
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,665
When mice mate,

319
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,002
the copulatory plug remains for 24 hours.

320
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,420
That's how we can check.

321
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,923
There's no way we'd miss it
if a mouse were to mate.

322
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,299
We could tell.

323
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,801
But sometimes there are mice
where we can't tell.

324
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,679
The sneaky ones,
the ones who pretend they didn't do it.

325
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,932
The ones secretly in love.

326
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,559
Huh? What's wrong with you, Commander?

327
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,104
The sneaky ones.

328
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,399
The ones who pretend they didn't do it.

329
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,152
-The ones secretly in love.
-The ones secretly in love.

330
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,787
I'm going to go up with Eve this time.

331
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,584
What?

332
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,254
That's where Eve is going to stay,

333
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,006
so I need to repair the damaged station.

334
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,175
The IOU has my request.

335
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,723
I don't know if the IOU
will approve such a last-minute request.

336
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,477
Whether you two go up there
and reconcile as colleagues, I don't care.

337
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,063
As long as the mission is a success,
I'm okay with it.

338
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,280
By the way, Park Dong-a,

339
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,949
you and I also have to write a report.

340
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,953
On the Maru rescue and return process,
and any issues or improvements needed.

341
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,163
This includes you too, Eve.

342
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,001
So from now on,
the three of us are in this together.

343
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,461
Don't even think about
leaving before me today.

344
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,473
Let's take a look.

345
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,358
Don't worry. I'm not going to steal
your position as commander.

346
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,363
Even if I go, you're the commander.
I won't take a junior colleague's job.

347
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,658
It's going to take three months
to restore the station.

348
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,368
You're going to be staying there.

349
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,911
I'm going to fix it.

350
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,539
And once it's done, I'm leaving.

351
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,791
So don't look at me like that.

352
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,344
Did you find something?

353
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,845
-Oh, you're here.
-Yeah.

354
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,264
Let's get started.

355
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,186
From the window by the tourist's seat,

356
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,521
I saw flames from the undetached trunk.

357
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,025
The material should've disintegrated
before we entered the atmosphere.

358
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,860
Why was it still there?

359
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,907
I was shocked
at how slowly the trunk burned.

360
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,784
The parachute almost went up in flames.

361
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,994
Has the trunk material changed?

362
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,789
The parachute wasn't
functioning properly either.

363
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,668
Let's look into it one by one.

364
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,389
You know,
being here reminds me of the old days.

365
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,306
Dong-a, sit down.

366
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,311
Yeah, it does.

367
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,648
Man, it was tough
watching out for you guys.

368
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,654
Dong-a, who did you like back then?

369
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,240
Yeah, tell us.

370
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,867
I'll forgive you if you're honest.
Who was it?

371
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,496
You ladies, seriously.

372
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,876
It was another woman, Chief.
There were others, you know.

373
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,130
-There were so many.
-He can't answer.

374
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,632
Enough already, Eve. Chief.

375
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:41,261
-You slimy bastard.
-He was slimy from the beginning.

376
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,387
Come on. Lay off.

377
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,931
Was this why you wanted us
to work on this together?

378
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,142
Yes, we're going to make you squirm.

379
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,768
We're just getting started.

380
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,021
-Chief.
-Yeah?

381
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,566
You should just apply
for the station repair mission.

382
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,192
You used to be an engineer.

383
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,903
You should come up to space with us
so we can all hang out.

384
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,113
Should I?

385
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,158
I was starting to get sick
of all the meetings and reports.

386
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,076
It doesn't suit my temperament.

387
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,289
Dong-a, should we all go up together?

388
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,457
What do you think?

389
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,376
Hey, Dong-a.

390
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,003
Dong-a?

391
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,588
What do you say? Is it okay?

392
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,975
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night, Doctor.

393
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,941
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

394
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,705
Eve, what are you doing here?

395
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,627
I got a call from Jeon Yi-man
out of the blue.

396
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,045
What did Yi-man want?

397
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,713
He called and told me to come.

398
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,426
You're here! Welcome!

399
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,471
Wow, she's so obedient.

400
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,973
Oh, hello.

401
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,060
Eve! Get in the car. Hurry!

402
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,937
Hurry up! You don't want to be here!

403
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,523
-What should I do?
-Get over here.

404
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,983
They'll eat you alive!
Hurry up and get in!

405
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,236
Hurry! Come on.

406
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,283
For God's sake. No!

407
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,916
You must have been surprised
when Yi-man called.

408
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,419
Go and get some beer.

409
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,379
I'm not drinking.

410
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,508
Who said it's for you?
Can't we treat the captain to a drink?

411
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,886
I have a meeting right after.

412
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,181
Just one beer then.
I'll just have one beer.

413
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,309
One beer is fine.

414
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,937
Don't say anything strange.

415
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,146
Don't be silly.

416
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,443
-Thank you for rescuing our son.
-Thank you.

417
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,404
You know how men are.

418
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,032
When they go on trips, or somewhere new,
or visit unfamiliar places,

419
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,118
or meet new women,

420
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,662
they get all restless

421
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,291
and sometimes lose their minds
and make mistakes.

422
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,001
You know how it is.

423
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,964
You idiot, you didn't bring any glasses.
We can't chug from the bottle.

424
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,924
Go get some glasses.

425
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,345
That fool.

426
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:34,183
That idiot went off to space
when he was about to get married,

427
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:38,229
so I'm sure he got scared
and had a brief lapse of judgment.

428
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,690
Please don't hold it against him, Captain.

429
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,985
You know how men aren't all there
compared to women.

430
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,030
That fool may look fine on the outside,

431
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,990
and even though he's a doctor,

432
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,910
he's still really immature
and not the greatest of guys.

433
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,994
What did you say?

434
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,913
You're bad-mouthing me, aren't you?

435
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:59,083
Hey, even as women,
we can see how amazing the captain is.

436
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,545
I bet she's got high standards
and has tons of men after her.

437
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,048
I bet there are lots of men
secretly crushing on her.

438
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,092
There's probably at least
a dozen idiots like Ryong.

439
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,552
Tons, I'm sure.

440
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,600
What do you like?
What can we make for you?

441
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,684
Do you want anything?

442
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,977
I heard you're going up soon.

443
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,813
I eat everything.

444
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,649
Is there something you're craving?

445
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,984
Stop asking. Just make her everything.

446
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,863
-How old are you?
-I'm 37.

447
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,909
What do your parents do?
Are they both alive?

448
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,161
No, they passed away.

449
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,996
Oh, dear.

450
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,208
You turned out so well though.

451
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,835
They would have been so proud
if they were here.

452
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,338
Where were you born?

453
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,382
I don't really know.

454
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,426
I was adopted to the US
right after I was born

455
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,553
and raised by my adoptive parents.

456
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,264
They abandoned their daughter? A newborn?

457
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,475
Oh my… When?

458
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,353
Why are you asking that kind of thing?

459
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,694
I was told it was on Christmas Eve.

460
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,070
How terrible.

461
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,239
It must have been so cold.

462
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,368
Is that why your name is Eve?

463
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,707
That's why I hate Christmas Eve the most.

464
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,376
-This looks good. Thank you.
-I hate Christmas too.

465
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,169
You sit this one out.

466
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,504
Why? I want to drink too.

467
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,634
The tofu is good today.

468
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,434
Man, I shouldn't have had
anything to drink.

469
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,020
Can't I go with you?

470
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,396
No.

471
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,566
Chief Kang said that
we weren't allowed to meet, ever.

472
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,484
Just to the front of the MCC.

473
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,570
What if we get caught?

474
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,864
If they find out I'm the mouse,
they'll kill me.

475
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,323
Very scary.

476
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,908
Would they fire you?

477
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,993
Who knows?

478
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,708
Eve.

479
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,667
What?

480
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,336
Do you regret
being the first mammal to do it?

481
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,508
I don't know.

482
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,843
You don't know?

483
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,972
Didn't you stop thinking about
whether you'd live or die in that moment?

484
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,849
Yeah, I forgot all about it.

485
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,436
Whether I was the commander
or the tourist,

486
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,773
in space or on Earth,
with gravity or zero gravity,

487
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,442
I forgot it all in that moment.

488
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,739
I was good, wasn't I?

489
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,494
I'm a pretty amazing mammal, aren't I?

490
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,792
Has the Maru been salvaged?

491
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,878
Yes, we took it back
to the MCC storage today.

492
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,715
I will investigate Maru
with Commander Eve and Pilot Dong-a Park

493
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:57,011
and report the errors and improvement of
the liftoff and landing process of Maru,

494
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,098
including trunk separation failure
during the rescue mission.

495
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,808
Please hurry up.

496
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,519
The investigation team in Florida
is ready to launch.

497
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,003
OBOK SAUNA

498
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,171
Hello.

499
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,173
Thank you.

500
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,051
I've never done this before.
What do I do when I get inside?

501
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,595
Just follow what everybody else is doing.

502
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,389
Just follow what they do?

503
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,682
After you go up,

504
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:46,185
you won't be able to have a proper shower
for a whole year, right?

505
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,146
-True.
-That’s not a shower. It's a wipe-down.

506
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,648
You're right. It's just wiping down.

507
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,859
You'll be okay, right?

508
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,111
Take it all off? Okay, okay.

509
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,445
You can do it.

510
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,323
MEN'S SAUNA, WOMEN'S SAUNA

511
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,791
-How was it?
-So embarrassing. Everyone was naked.

512
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,504
Do you remember how cold we were?

513
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,799
No, I don't remember.

514
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,844
I'm hungry.

515
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:20,970
Me too.

516
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,138
I don't know this area.

517
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,849
Let's just choose a place
that smells good.

518
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,766
Okay.

519
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,145
Whoa, he's bringing out another pan.

520
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,819
-What?
-Hang on.

521
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,532
You act like you haven't eaten in days.

522
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,913
The station didn't have any smell at all.

523
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,080
It was so dreary.

524
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:52,043
Is this the smell of plain bread loaves
or baguettes?

525
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:56,088
Does the food at the station
have to have no smell and no taste?

526
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,008
How do you eat that for a year?

527
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,012
I started missing Earth
after only ten days.

528
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,099
I've never been there
for more than three months,

529
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:11,145
but according to some senior astronauts,
after three months,

530
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,814
they were dying to hear birds chirping.

531
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,858
Then after six months,

532
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:20,571
they said you go crazy
just wanting to hear the sound of rain.

533
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,742
I've even seen people bring recordings
of Earth sounds to play up there.

534
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:31,499
But right now, I really want to bottle up
this smell and take it back with me.

535
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,629
That feeling of sinking into hot water
at the bathhouse earlier today,

536
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,799
and the sensation
of the water lapping against my skin,

537
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,218
and the sounds of this neighborhood

538
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,389
as we wait here together
for the bread to come out.

539
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,100
It's nice.

540
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,942
It isn't nice because it's Earth.

541
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,194
It's nice because you're with me.

542
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,488
Is that so?

543
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,824
I see.

544
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,123
You almost died up there.

545
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,583
Aren't you scared to go back?

546
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,962
I'm not scared of dying.

547
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,508
I don't care when I die,
but I want to die when I'm happy.

548
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,844
Everyone dies.

549
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,887
Can I be honest with you?

550
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,723
That day,

551
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,311
even if I had died in that tent,

552
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,397
I didn't think I'd feel resentful
or angry about my life.

553
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,734
Because I wasn't alone.

554
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,071
Yeah.

555
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,657
"Being here with someone I like

556
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,077
and dying like this wouldn't be so bad."

557
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,834
"I've been lonely my whole life,
but I'm not lonely anymore."

558
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,169
That was what I thought.

559
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,421
No way.

560
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,841
"I'm going to survive and make it back

561
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,596
so I can eat something hot
with the commander,

562
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,683
take a warm bath with her,
and date like other normal people."

563
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,268
"And if we fall deeper in love,

564
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,979
I'm going to marry
and have kids with her."

565
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,940
"At least three."

566
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,693
"I definitely won't die
in some kind of accident."

567
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,655
"I'm going to live a healthy life
until I'm almost 100,

568
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,618
and then die just a day or two apart
from this woman."

569
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,871
"I should live at least a day longer

570
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,748
so she won't grieve because of me."

571
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,961
Those were the thoughts I had
as I begged and begged

572
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,297
and prayed and endured.

573
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,760
"I refuse to die like this
in here with this woman."

574
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,597
I vowed to myself that I wouldn't die.

575
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,234
And if we fell deeper in love,
what was it that you would do?

576
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,239
If we fall deeper in love…

577
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,117
-What was that about kids? How many?
-So, if we fall deeper…

578
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,953
Huh? How many kids would we have?

579
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,329
I don't know.

580
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,750
What? Dream on, buddy.

581
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,130
Oh, it's open! Let's go.

582
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,297
Come in.

583
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,814
DAD

584
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,232
Hi, Dad.

585
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,234
What the hell have you been up to?

586
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,445
MZ switched their primary bank.

587
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,572
They switched to our competitor.

588
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,907
I want you to get over there
and fix this now!

589
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,259
Chairman Choi.

590
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,054
Isn't this stooping a bit low?

591
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,307
What?

592
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,101
Please switch your primary bank
back to ours.

593
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,770
Go-eun is my woman.

594
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,189
Please bring her back too.

595
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,858
You told me to give up.

596
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,443
Give up?

597
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,613
Nobody has ever dared
to tell me to give up before.

598
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,739
You give up.

599
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,866
I thought you liked me.

600
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,036
You could never be satisfied
with a guy like Ryong.

601
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,663
Ryong didn't give up.

602
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,291
Even when he didn't have any eggs,
he didn't give up.

603
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,419
Even in situations where, as you said,
giving up was the only option,

604
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,921
he didn't.

605
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,839
You lost.

606
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,676
He was on the brink of freezing to death,
and he still didn't give up.

607
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,221
You could learn a thing
or two from him, you punk.

608
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,973
Ryong is a scumbag.
He has feelings for someone else.

609
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,061
Look at this punk.

610
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,105
Ryong has given up Go-eun.

611
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,153
Go get Ryong.

612
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,170
Do you have another woman?

613
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,005
What?

614
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,216
I am even…

615
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,638
thinking about keeping the socks
you wore as heirlooms.

616
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,349
I asked you a question.
Do you have another woman?

617
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,769
If that's true,

618
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,023
it won't matter that you risked your life
to make that morula.

619
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,233
I won't trust you with it.

620
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,485
I'll also kick you out of the hospital

621
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,029
and put a stop
to the space fertility clinic.

622
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,992
I'll make sure you never practice medicine
on Earth again.

623
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,704
Sir, I was going to tell you,

624
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,873
but, you see, Go-eun and I--

625
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:05,958
Dad.

626
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:13,966
Why are you doubting Ryong
just because of what Kang Kang-su said?

627
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,303
What, after that
ice cream backstabbing incident,

628
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,305
do you two have
something else up your sleeve?

629
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,974
How are you planning
to stab us in the back this time?

630
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,268
Listen, sir.

631
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,104
If it weren't for that lunatic
Kang Kang-su,

632
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:31,567
Ryong and I wouldn't have any problems.

633
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,819
Because of that man,

634
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,073
I can't bring myself
to look Ryong in the eye.

635
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,077
He books the room next to mine
at our hotel and goes around

636
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:46,123
telling everyone that my ex-boyfriend
is staying in the room next to mine,

637
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,167
making me into this strange woman--

638
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,210
That's going a bit overboard.

639
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,212
Is this true?

640
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,173
Yes, he's in the room next to hers.

641
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:58,510
Do you have any idea how pathetic he is,
begging me to take him back?

642
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,720
Pathetic?

643
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,890
When have I ever acted pathetic
around you?

644
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:07,186
He walks around the hotel restaurant
in his pajamas

645
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,939
and forces people to kneel in front of him
in the lobby, going on and on about money.

646
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,650
Did you rip people off?

647
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,318
You really are something else.

648
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:18,197
You act like
you're the center of the universe.

649
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,824
It's not me that he likes.

650
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:25,245
He needs our company
to make his bank our primary bank.

651
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,706
Why do you think I dumped him?

652
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,501
This is so embarrassing.

653
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,797
While this so-called astronaut
is on Earth,

654
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,632
he either spends all day
with his fruit flies,

655
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,134
or he's at a fruit fly conference,

656
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,763
or he goes to parties
to raise money for fruit fly research.

657
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,516
He'd come over after midnight,

658
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,477
and all this man would do
is spend the night.

659
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,854
The only time I ever saw him was in bed.

660
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,525
The minute he opened his eyes,
he'd run off to his little fruit flies.

661
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,861
You'd only come to sleep with me
because you were supposedly so busy.

662
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,322
How is it
you don't have a Nobel Prize yet,

663
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,492
and instead, you go around
trying to turn my dad against Ryong?

664
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,745
That thing he can't do at the station,

665
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,123
the thing he can't do with fruit flies.

666
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,792
That's the only thing he came to me for,
to sleep with me.

667
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,377
Enough.

668
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,922
I'm okay.

669
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,759
You have no idea
how to be an older brother figure,

670
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,970
but you have the nerve to talk about mine.

671
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,267
Now that I like somebody else,

672
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,727
he's refusing to give up

673
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,229
because his pride's been hurt.

674
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,565
Dad,

675
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,609
he treated me worse than his fruit flies.

676
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,695
Do you still want us to work things out?

677
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,155
Huh? Do you?

678
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:46,201
Why do you still speak
to this fruit fly of a man?

679
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,871
You, get lost.

680
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,497
Sir.

681
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,793
That bastard Ryong
has feelings for somebody else.

682
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,880
Ryong, would you like to have lunch?

683
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,339
Sir.

684
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,424
Hey!

685
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:04,553
I want you to ban this fruit fly lover.

686
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,679
Don't let him in again.

687
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,367
If anyone's going to tell him,
it'll be me.

688
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,536
I haven't given up on you yet.

689
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,538
At least let me save face.

690
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:33,999
Okay.

691
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,838
-Are you insane?
-Hey!

692
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,382
You… Blindsiding me again?

693
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,018
Shit.

694
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:57,064
Take it out on me,
not my precious piece of crap car.

695
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,566
You think I'm going to go down alone
at the disciplinary hearing?

696
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,110
You're going down with me.

697
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,655
Say that again.

698
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,448
You think I won't do it?

699
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,451
Did they get caught?

700
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,496
-What? Did you take it from them?
-You listen to me.

701
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,540
You stole my money and my girl.

702
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,583
Aren't you the real thief here?

703
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,337
Fine. Even if I get a harsher penalty

704
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,799
and they slap me with a fine
of billions of won, thanks to you…

705
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,927
Thanks to you, I've got it covered.
Much appreciated.

706
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,720
Do you really want to start something?

707
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,055
You little shit.

708
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,391
-You asshole.
-Hey!

709
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,896
You still haven't implanted the morula
into Dr. Na Min-jeong, have you?

710
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,607
You bastard.

711
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,695
You should know when to shut up.

712
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,904
Can't you distinguish

713
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,865
between your love life
and matters of life and death?

714
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,618
You're only good at betraying people.

715
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,496
Stop. You're going to make things
difficult for Ms. Choi.

716
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,664
Please stop.

717
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,541
So what if I betrayed a thief like you?

718
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,084
-So what, you bastard?
-What?

719
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,044
That's nothing compared to
what you deserve.

720
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,011
Go-eun.

721
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,852
You're not even worth hitting.

722
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,609
You happy?

723
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,694
Are you guys satisfied?

724
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:37,998
There will be a disciplinary hearing
for Kang Kang-su tomorrow.

725
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,877
The inspector general will personally
be overseeing the proceedings.

726
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,296
The entire crew
from Expedition 3 must attend.

727
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,341
Yes, Chief.

728
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,427
Kang Kang-su's experiment,

729
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,722
using the donated eggs and Santi's sperm
from the station, was an act

730
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,973
of contempt and deception

731
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,185
not only to his fellow astronauts
but also to the KSA.

732
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,103
It will be Kang Kang-su's judgment day.

733
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,606
Do your best to cooperate
with the inspector general.

734
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,234
How is it possible not to know
what was in the incubator?

735
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,529
Here, we can only monitor
whether it's on or off.

736
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:16,036
We can't know what's inside the incubator
until they report it.

737
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,207
Si-won, come with me to the main office
before we go home for the day.

738
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,044
I need to get something
from my office for the inspection team.

739
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,128
Okay.

740
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,632
Let's have dinner.

741
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,344
I'm not done with work.

742
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,230
We all warned you.

743
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,940
Warned me about what?

744
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,024
You know.

745
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,571
Let's finish this after dinner.

746
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,908
I want to get this done and go.

747
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,785
Aren't you going to listen to me?

748
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,752
It doesn't have to be me,
just don't date the tourist.

749
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,839
If everyone is against it,
there's probably a good reason.

750
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,010
Is this intended to be advice
or a warning?

751
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,346
You're kidding me, right?

752
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,808
Dong-a, I don't have much time.

753
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,935
I'm leaving for space in a few days.

754
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,020
Every second feels precious
to me right now.

755
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:29,860
The thought of leaving someone I like
behind on Earth makes every day feel

756
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,612
like it could be my last,
like I've been sentenced to death.

757
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,657
The thought of wasting even a second
is making me crazy.

758
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,455
Did you sleep with him?

759
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,585
When?

760
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,923
When I risked my life to save you?

761
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,179
When you were naked and alone together
in the sleeping bag?

762
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,515
Yes.

763
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,809
You're lying.

764
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,234
You and I are no different.

765
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,488
Stop lying. Up there? In zero gravity?

766
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,614
Yeah.

767
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,950
That punk did what a mouse couldn't?
You expect me to believe that?

768
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,577
Yeah.

769
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,124
On top of everything,
now you're lying to me?

770
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,919
Eve, you've gone mad.

771
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,420
You're nuts, you know that?

772
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,631
We're not done talking.

773
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,011
Why didn't you tell Dr. Ma,

774
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,388
who has been hell-bent on getting mice,

775
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,682
the most prolific breeders
of all mammals, to mate?

776
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,976
Why didn't you tell your partner that?

777
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,354
Why do you only lie to me?

778
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,775
You and I are not the same.

779
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:55,028
I'm a terrible person,
which is something you could never be.

780
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,154
I…

781
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,158
I know you. You're not like that.

782
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,041
But it's true.

783
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,751
But it's true.

784
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,214
You guys lost. We did it first.

785
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,008
Aren't we amazing?

786
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,223
You guys need to step up
your game, got it?

787
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,375
Chief?

788
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,002
We're running late.

789
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,397
I'm heading out now. Just wait a bit.

790
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,454
Do you have an umbrella?

791
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,017
-Chief.
-Yeah?

792
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,436
On your way home,
can you drop me off at the MCC?

793
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,729
Do it tomorrow.

794
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,190
The flight team wants it by tonight.

795
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,900
Then take a taxi.

796
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,568
Come on. It's raining.

797
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,445
Then at least give me the company card.

798
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,156
Just take my whole wallet,
why don't you?

799
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,157
What did you say?

800
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,535
Let's have dinner.
I don't want to eat alone.

801
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,747
I told you, I have to work.
What did the inspector general say?

802
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,708
As expected, the mood was tense.

803
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,555
Isn't that the commander?

804
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,478
She doesn't even have an umbrella.
She can't afford to catch a cold now.

805
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,271
-Call her. Let's pick her up.
-Okay.

806
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,086
Aren't you cold?

807
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,672
Why'd you come out?
It's just around the corner.

808
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,675
Why didn't you borrow an umbrella
instead of walking in the rain?

809
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,635
Everyone had already left for the day.

810
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,555
So the people
who dislike me have all left?

811
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,726
Hang on. What's that?
What's wrong with your neck?

812
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,310
-Huh?
-Who did this?

813
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,104
This? It's nothing.

814
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,897
-What?
-It's no big deal.

815
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,817
Out of nowhere?

816
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,072
So, where's that commander now?

817
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,700
The one who ordered me not to like her
up there in space.

818
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,077
You called me a murderer.

819
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,788
Where's the guy
who said he'd never save me again?

820
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,207
I left him in space.

821
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,630
I love how the rain sounds.

822
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,215
There you go again.

823
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,926
Here's the thing.
It's not the sound of the rain you love.

824
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,346
You also love the sound of the rain
because you're with me, Commander.

825
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,474
You're right.

826
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,156
It started from then, that's right.

827
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,992
Yep, that's when it was.

828
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,119
And Dong-a risked his life to go up there.

829
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,249
Let's be honest.
We all thought something was off, right?

830
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,251
They held back

831
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,629
and after they got back,
that's when sparks flew?

832
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,799
Hey, Si-won. Zoom in over there
behind the sleeping bag.

833
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,468
-Behind the sleeping bag?
-Quickly.

834
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,597
Okay.

835
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,975
Zoom in more.

836
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:36,935
-More?
-Yes.

837
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,940
Is that an incubator back there?

838
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,066
An incubator?

839
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,151
Was there an incubator there?

840
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,820
Isn't that an incubator door?

841
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,864
It's too dark to see it clearly. Hang on.

842
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,877
You're right, that's an incubator.

843
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,047
It hadn't been used since
we repurposed that module for observation,

844
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,467
but the power turned on
just before the space debris hit.

845
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,346
We can't tell from Earth
what it was used for.

846
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,764
After the debris hit,

847
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,642
communications were cut off,
so there's no record after that.

848
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,018
Who could have used it?

849
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,993
All hell might break loose
at tomorrow's disciplinary hearing.

850
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,496
Check to see who went there
when the debris hit.

851
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,581
Okay.

852
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:02,103
So he had more embryos
than the seven morulas we caught him with.

853
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,314
Damn.

854
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,025
Get Kang Kang-su and the tourist in here.

855
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,528
-The tourist too?
-The tourist was in there the whole time.

856
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,698
He was messing around in there
and got left behind. Call them now!

857
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,388
You two are in cahoots, aren't you?

858
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,215
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

859
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,676
Name, Kang Kang-su.

860
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,470
Your status as an astronaut
has been permanently revoked.

861
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,638
Traitors.

862
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,600
We may have lost our baby,

863
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,185
but I wanted to save the morula.

864
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,104
We're not in cahoots, we're enemies.

865
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,316
Shut your mouth.
I can't believe a word you say anymore.

866
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,609
She doesn't have any family,

867
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,736
so wouldn't it be nice if she had

868
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,072
at least one person back here on Earth
who had her back?

869
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,824
-I think it's pregnant!
