1
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,427
He risked his life by boarding the Maru,

3
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,722
a domestic spacecraft which hadn't
completed a reentry test, to rescue…

4
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,638
Welcome back.

5
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,311
I'm fine.

6
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,521
Yeah, you are.

7
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,191
First of all, welcome back.

8
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:35,321
How did a commander and a tourist end up
stranded on the space station alone?

9
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,241
The storage module
in the observation area was

10
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,909
severely damaged by space debris,

11
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,328
which caused the hatches
on both sides to seal shut.

12
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,664
The tourist was trapped inside

13
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,041
and couldn't reach the main module.

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,751
Even if it was to save a colleague,

15
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,712
you risked your life boarding a spacecraft

16
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,798
that hadn't completed a reentry test.
That couldn't have been easy.

17
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,051
I didn't just go up there
to save the tourist,

18
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,597
but to save the woman I love
with all my heart.

19
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,932
I didn't even have time to be scared.

20
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,435
So you two are in a relationship?

21
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,477
Are you a couple?

22
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,901
There's no one in the world I love more.

23
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,199
We actually have
another well-known couple here.

24
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,037
CEO Choi Go-eun of MZ Electronics,
you're here for

25
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,830
your fiancé, Mr. Gong Ryong.

26
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,041
You must've been very worried about him.

27
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,293
You recently announced your engagement.

28
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,587
When is the wedding going to be?

29
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,392
I'd marry him right now if I could.

30
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,731
A question for the commander.

31
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,610
I heard the solar array was damaged
when the space debris hit.

32
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,322
How did you two manage to withstand
the cold of space until the very end?

33
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,783
Well…

34
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,546
If…

35
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,178
If we make it back alive…

36
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,265
Will you stop saying "if"?

37
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,271
Each of these portable oxygen tanks
lasts about 15 minutes.

38
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,108
It's too soon to be saying "if."

39
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,414
If…

40
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,666
I told you not to say that.

41
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,128
If we make it back alive…

42
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm going to kiss you every 15 minutes.

43
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,227
If we make it back alive…

44
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,316
we'll have bowls of steaming noodles…

45
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,946
at those tables
outside convenience stores…

46
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,410
together.

47
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,876
And we'll blow
on the hot noodles as we eat.

48
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,589
I want to do that every day.

49
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,508
Okay, sounds nice.

50
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,889
I want to grow old with you…

51
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,272
until I'm frail and weak

52
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,359
and die by your side when I'm 100.

53
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,989
Okay.

54
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,328
I want…

55
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,624
to take you out on dates

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,501
on Earth.

57
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,173
I'll give my all to be with you…

58
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,347
to love you…

59
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,063
and…

60
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,399
to live fully.

61
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,281
Eve.

62
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,451
Here.

63
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,023
-Well--
-The protocol in situations like that

64
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,651
is to strip down
and hold each other close,

65
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,028
no matter who you're with.

66
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,822
That's how you keep each other warm.

67
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,242
In those moments,
you're not a man and a woman.

68
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,037
You're just colleagues
fighting for survival together.

69
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,625
All members of Expedition 3,
Commander Eve,

70
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,421
Kang Kang-su, Lee Seung-jun,
Mina Lee, Santi, and the tourist,

71
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,423
have returned to Earth safely.

72
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,216
They'll return to the space station

73
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,635
as soon as they recover
and the repairs are made.

74
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,221
All right, we'll head to Seoul now.

75
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,558
Commander, any words for your boyfriend
who risked his life for you?

76
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,311
-Please say a few words.
-Any plans for a press conference?

77
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,520
What happened to your arm?
You're so clumsy.

78
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,417
That hits the spot.

79
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,463
I thought you quit smoking.

80
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,639
You look scared.

81
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,728
Are you feeling anxious?

82
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,535
You're probably right
about what you're thinking.

83
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,306
Commander!

84
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,559
Don't get up. I told you
to stay as still as possible for a while.

85
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,520
Feel like throwing up?

86
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,189
I don't have anything left to throw up.

87
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,443
-Do you think you can take this off?
-Yeah.

88
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,321
-I can't breathe.
-I got it.

89
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,836
Remove your suit and lie down.

90
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,589
Balancing will be hard
with your vestibular system messed up.

91
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,675
This blue compression suit

92
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,637
might feel a bit tight,
but you have to keep it on.

93
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,310
Can you lift your bottom?

94
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,606
All right, here we go.

95
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,650
One, two, three.

96
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,776
There you go.

97
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,029
Good job.

98
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,828
Dong-a, go get some rest in your room.
We can take it from here.

99
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,539
It was just a one-day trip for me.
I'm totally fine.

100
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,667
By the way, where's Dr. Kang?

101
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,252
Where did he slip off to this time?

102
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,254
Can I lie down now?

103
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,423
The floor is spinning.

104
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,175
Take off all his clothes minus the suit.

105
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,218
-Okay?
-You got it.

106
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,553
What? No, wait.

107
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,846
It's fine.

108
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,226
My stomach hurts.

109
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,187
Listen, can I use the bathroom?

110
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,815
You might get dizzy and fall
if you try to move.

111
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,566
You should go help him.

112
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,819
No, I can go by myself.

113
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,739
After your miraculous return to Earth,

114
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,034
you want to crack your head open
and die in the bathroom?

115
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,285
No way.

116
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,328
Let's go.

117
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,996
No, I don't…

118
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,290
-It's no trouble.
-I don't need your help.

119
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,669
You really don't have to.

120
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,510
Let me help you.

121
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,264
No, I can handle this.

122
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,640
You can't do this alone.

123
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:08,936
Your body can't even tell whether you're
in gravity or zero gravity right now.

124
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,734
Why are you being so nice to me?

125
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,824
Is there a reason I shouldn't be?

126
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,535
Don't be so nice to me.

127
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,509
What?

128
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,721
From the moment
you open the door and go back out there,

129
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,931
stay the hell away from Eve.

130
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,856
You almost got her killed.

131
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,942
What were you doing
in the observation module that

132
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,028
kept you from getting
to the main module in time?

133
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,200
Like I said, you almost got Eve killed.

134
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,577
Your dramatic space trip is over now,

135
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,537
so stay away from her.

136
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,914
Don't get it confused.

137
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,918
You're with Choi Go-eun.

138
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,212
And Eve is with me.

139
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,098
I can pull down my own pants.

140
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,063
I'll be sitting down, not standing up.

141
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,606
I can handle it, all right?

142
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,528
Get out.

143
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,528
Where's my son-in-law?

144
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,156
Isn't this his room?

145
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,783
Is he being seen by a doctor?

146
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,661
Family visits are not allowed right now.
Please leave.

147
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,266
Are you okay, Ryong?

148
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,978
Geez, what did I tell you?

149
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,563
Come on.

150
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,733
Lay him down on the bed.

151
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,568
-And take off his clothes.
-Got it.

152
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,778
No, hold on a second! I'm going to puke!

153
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,696
I can't lie down.

154
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,656
I thought you were done.

155
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,283
Your stomach should be empty.

156
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,661
Chairman Choi!

157
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,579
Yes.

158
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,164
You did good.

159
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,540
You did great, Ryong.

160
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,208
I know.

161
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,587
I told you not to bend over!

162
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,755
You can marry Go-eun.

163
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,507
He's throwing up again.

164
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,762
He's going to get dehydrated.
For God's sake.

165
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,938
I'll go get him an IV.

166
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,733
Sir, please take this.

167
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,861
What? Me?

168
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,865
I can't ask them
to wash this for me, can I?

169
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,037
Come on, take it.

170
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,998
Don't just throw it away.
Make sure you wash it, okay?

171
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,709
This sock has been to space, you know.

172
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,840
Could you guys give me a hand?

173
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,802
This is killing me.

174
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,823
Sir, that's the portable freezer
we gave him!

175
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,575
I was worried
he might've left it at the space station,

176
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,245
but it's okay now. He did it.

177
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,579
Congratulations, sir.

178
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,667
Go-eun.

179
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,669
Min-jeong.

180
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,384
My baby. Thank goodness.

181
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,178
-Come on, lift your arm.
-No, I can't.

182
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,263
Not even a little?

183
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,848
Go-eun.

184
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,395
The morula is safe.

185
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,856
It passed through the atmosphere
without any issues.

186
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,733
-Really?
-Are you serious?

187
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,986
Thank God.

188
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,614
-Yi-man.
-Yeah?

189
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,908
-You know Dr. Na, right?
-Yeah.

190
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,118
Is she doing all right?

191
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,871
Oh, right. I'll go check on her.
I'll be right back.

192
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,164
You…

193
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,875
You did it!

194
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,959
Wait.

195
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,421
Hey, you… You stink of cigarettes.

196
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,549
Have you been smoking?

197
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,762
You're the best.

198
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,474
What happened to your arm?

199
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,061
You shouldn't be smoking when you're hurt.

200
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,533
The commander doesn't smoke?

201
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,454
You can't smoke up there.

202
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,003
I saw you two
right before you were rescued.

203
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,175
Did you kiss?

204
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,056
Did you kiss her?

205
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,624
Go-eun.

206
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,920
Don't waste your time
on an opportunist like me.

207
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,300
Your father
wouldn't let me work as an ob-gyn,

208
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,178
so I wanted to get back at him

209
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,473
and work my way up.

210
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,186
Luckily,

211
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,107
you fell for me.

212
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,070
And I played along,
knowing that I was being a jerk.

213
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
Being with you

214
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,786
made me feel reassured, like I was rich.

215
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,416
And I thought…

216
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,171
I'd come to love you in time.

217
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,093
But when you asked me to marry you,

218
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,472
I just couldn't say yes.

219
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,185
I felt like…

220
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,981
I'd be a real jerk if I did that.

221
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,695
You're lying.

222
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,698
Go-eun.

223
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,746
Sorry it took me so long to be honest.

224
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,837
I'm sorry.

225
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,644
Then be an opportunist till the end.

226
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,610
If you do this now…

227
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,114
what am I supposed to do?

228
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,329
Tell me you're pushing me away because
you have feelings for someone else.

229
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,498
I'd rather deal with that.

230
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,628
At least then, I could fight for you.

231
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,131
At least then…

232
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,969
I wouldn't feel so pathetic.

233
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,123
WELCOME BACK TO EARTH

234
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,657
What are you doing out of bed again?

235
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,369
You don't even need to take this test.

236
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,580
I won't stay for long.

237
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,376
You just won't listen.

238
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,003
You never do.

239
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,091
You should go get some rest, Dong-a.

240
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,175
Don't bother.

241
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,095
You think he'll listen to you
when he won't even listen to me?

242
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,818
The IOU will send
an investigation team to the station soon.

243
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,861
They will investigate the accident.

244
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,533
What was the tourist doing
in the observation module anyway?

245
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,162
He said he was trying to grab
the camera from there

246
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,872
when he got stuck.

247
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,041
You know how messy
the cables are over there.

248
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,962
Why would he care about some stupid camera
in a life-or-death situation?

249
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,507
Things were pretty chaotic.
I think he was a bit flustered.

250
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,886
I'll need a more detailed report
on what happened when you two were alone.

251
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,055
Was there any specific issue?

252
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,183
Well…

253
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,481
We only had 15-minute oxygen tanks.

254
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,607
What?

255
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,860
What about the one-hour tanks?

256
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,736
There weren't any.

257
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,574
What else?

258
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,576
Sorry?

259
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,161
Tell me more in detail.

260
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,211
Well, is that all?

261
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,923
Yeah.

262
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,178
When I talk
to the investigation committee,

263
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,388
I'll give them all the details I remember.

264
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,641
Just 15-minute tanks?

265
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,268
You had a close call.

266
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,520
We only had nine 15-minute tanks.

267
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,621
That feels good.

268
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,539
Did you sleep well?

269
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,457
Yeah.

270
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,292
I slept like a rock.

271
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,045
I feel so much better.

272
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,801
I see you're doing much better.

273
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,096
You want water? Let me get it for you.

274
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,308
Let me try.

275
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,185
Sure.

276
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,315
Impressive…

277
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,000
Bravo.

278
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,169
I knew you'd recover quickly.

279
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,385
Would you like more water?

280
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,303
Damn, it's tight.

281
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,599
Gong Ryong, you bastard.

282
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,019
I won't let you get away with it.

283
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,749
-Are you Mr. Gong Ryong?
-Yes.

284
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,460
Sit up nice and easy.

285
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,839
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

286
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,178
Excuse me.

287
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,388
Yes?

288
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,017
Eve Kim, the patient in Room 2.
Has she been eating well?

289
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,143
Yes.

290
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,730
HOSPITAL ROOM 2
EVE KIM

291
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,481
Hi, I brought your meal.

292
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,650
Thank you.

293
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,235
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

294
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,205
ANY PLANS FOR AFTER YOU'RE DISCHARGED?

295
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,547
GONG RYONG
HOSPITAL ROOM 1

296
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,549
Any plans for after you're discharged?

297
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,567
You never loved me?

298
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,569
Me? How's that even possible?

299
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,949
Are you trying to get revenge for my dad
betraying you and giving Kang-su your job?

300
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,119
If you want revenge, go after my dad.
Why are you taking it out on me?

301
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,124
I get it. You're saying you were
miserably lonely and sad in space.

302
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,086
Fine, I'll put up with
your whining this time.

303
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,630
I left you alone
when you were feeling humiliated,

304
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,507
so now you're like, "Screw them all."

305
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:02,722
You want to pull this off
and rub it in their faces, right? Fine.

306
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,933
You're sick of my family?

307
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,975
Fine.

308
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,354
They won't be my family anymore.

309
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,696
Do you seriously expect me
to believe what you said?

310
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,672
HOSPITAL ROOM 2
EVE KIM

311
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,603
Come in.

312
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,485
Time for your oxygen therapy.

313
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,778
All right.

314
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,655
How's the hospital food? Good enough?

315
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,325
Yeah. After all the dry,
powdery stuff I had to eat,

316
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,410
it tastes amazing.

317
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,078
Great.

318
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,622
I almost forgot. Ryong wanted me

319
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,292
to give this to you.

320
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,669
This is for me?

321
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,840
He said it's a gift
and I shouldn't give it to anyone else.

322
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,467
-Weird guy, right?
-Right.

323
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,555
-Shall we?
-Sure.

324
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,850
The bed is so comfy, by the way.

325
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,522
For the oxygen therapy, let's pair them up

326
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,026
-based on their oxygen saturation levels.
-Okay.

327
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,196
Did you have your heart checked?
Is everything okay?

328
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,489
Yeah, they said it's fine.

329
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,951
You look even prettier than
you did in space.

330
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,953
Me?

331
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,915
You're just experiencing
a grayout, Dr. Lee.

332
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,001
The gravitational acceleration
during reentry damaged your vision.

333
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,086
It'll clear up
once you adjust to the gravity.

334
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,755
Dona.

335
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,839
No, that's not it.

336
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,342
Eve and Gong Ryong were hypoxic
when they were rescued.

337
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,010
-Let's pair those two.
-Okay, sure.

338
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,188
Dong-a.

339
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,406
Have you finished eating?

340
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,075
Yeah, what about you?

341
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,076
Yeah, me too.

342
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,453
No, it's okay. Leave it.

343
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,497
I know the smell bugs you.
I'll take it out.

344
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,581
You don't have to.

345
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,026
That couldn't have been easy.

346
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,152
Right.

347
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,197
I didn't just go up there
to save the tourist,

348
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,700
but to save the woman I love
with all my heart.

349
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,119
So you two are in a relationship?

350
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,328
Are you a couple?

351
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,539
There's no one in the world I love…

352
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,799
I put you on the spot, didn't I?

353
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,513
I'm sorry.

354
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,563
What are you doing?

355
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,190
It's Chief Kang.

356
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,153
I slept with her.

357
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,197
While you were away…

358
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,285
I must've been completely out of my mind.

359
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,996
There's no excuse for it.

360
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,665
I'm sorry.

361
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,961
When all I could think about
was saving you, I was shameless.

362
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,214
I acted like a nutjob

363
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,009
and had the courage to say,

364
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,180
"I'll go crazy if I don't save her."

365
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,515
"We'll live or die as one."

366
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,524
But now, I can't even look you in the eye.

367
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,362
Being here alone with you, I'm shaking,

368
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,573
and I can't breathe.

369
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,913
I don't know what I was thinking.

370
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,210
Get up.

371
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,962
Please forgive me.

372
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,466
Get up, Dong-a.

373
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,636
You know how simple-minded I am.

374
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,349
I don't like complicated stuff.
I can't understand it.

375
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,810
Please cut me some slack.

376
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,021
I'll wait until you can forgive me.

377
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,756
Are you still working?

378
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,133
CLOSED FOR DINNER

379
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,301
Sorry? Oh, yeah.

380
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,180
Ryong is still undergoing tests,
so you should visit him tomorrow.

381
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,016
I'll go with you ladies.

382
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,477
That's so kind of you to think of us.
Thank you, Ms. Choi.

383
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,147
Ms. Choi, how's the burn on your arm?

384
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,190
I hope it won't leave a scar.

385
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,027
Please don't call me Ms. Choi.

386
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,320
Who addresses
their daughter-in-law like that?

387
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,407
What should we call you then?
We're just so grateful.

388
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,201
Just call me Go-eun.

389
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,078
-What?
-What?

390
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,624
By the way,
why is he still getting tests taken?

391
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,170
He must be in terrible shape
if he has to take so many.

392
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,464
It's not just Ryong.

393
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,176
They're standard tests
for all astronauts, so don't worry.

394
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,512
They say it takes about 3 to 4 days
to readjust to gravity.

395
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,098
-I see.
-It takes that long?

396
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,684
We're taking up too much of her time.

397
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,644
Right, we'll let you go now.

398
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,271
See you soon, Ms. Choi.

399
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,397
All right.

400
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,039
Let's just stay and work then.

401
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,541
-Should we?
-Yeah.

402
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,714
Wait, but I want to meet that woman too.

403
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,257
We should thank her.

404
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,967
Who? The commander?

405
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,928
Why would you want to meet her?

406
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,024
Any discomfort?

407
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,151
Are you good?

408
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,152
Yes.

409
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,863
Okay, then. Don't talk.
It'll reduce the effect.

410
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,073
-Okay.
-All right.

411
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,456
Will the results
for Santi's sperm test be out soon?

412
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,541
Yes.

413
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,335
Let's get started.

414
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,314
This place reminds me
of the space station.

415
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,025
This will last longer than
15 minutes, right?

416
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,117
Do you remember
when we argued over the nine oxygen tanks?

417
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,165
We both insisted
the other should take the last one.

418
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:13,087
I guess we were terrified of being the one
to watch the other die first.

419
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,634
We're selfish people.

420
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,111
What a waste of oxygen.

421
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,614
You're breathing it to stay alive
after what you did?

422
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,283
-Dr. Kang.
-Who the hell are you to make Go-eun cry?

423
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,161
How dare you crush her pride
and hurt her like that?

424
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,079
All she ever did…

425
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,999
All she ever did was like you!

426
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,338
You think only your feelings matter?

427
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,672
What about hers?

428
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,841
What about her feelings?

429
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,055
You have no problem

430
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,140
breaking her heart
and tearing it into shreds?

431
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,518
I hope you suffocate and die.

432
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,937
You arrogant dirtbag!

433
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,068
You heartless bastard!

434
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,076
I'm not telling you
to make things right with Go-eun.

435
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,495
So don't try to make amends.

436
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,121
Don't even apologize.

437
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,541
If you do that
just to make yourself feel better,

438
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,419
I'll kill you for real.

439
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,088
What's going on here?

440
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,382
Ryong!

441
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,259
What the hell?

442
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,344
-Aren't you a space scientist?
-If you…

443
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,638
-Let go! Hey!
-If you hurt Go-eun again…

444
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,058
Let go. Let go of him!

445
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,476
I swear I'll make you pay!

446
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,772
Why are you fighting like
a couple of thugs in the hospital?

447
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,940
Are you insane?

448
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,400
Are you all right?

449
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,655
What the hell happened here?

450
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,493
He really laid into you.

451
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,080
Why didn't you stop them?

452
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,168
It looked like he deserved it.

453
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,338
Come on, you're not helping.

454
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,548
She's right.

455
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,427
I… I deserved it.

456
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,637
I can't believe you people!

457
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,307
You fought so hard to survive in space,

458
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,809
so why are you acting like
you want to die now?

459
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,939
I'll get the first aid kit.
Stay right here.

460
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,442
We'll finish therapy later.

461
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,211
Man, that's rough.

462
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,506
Look at us. This is just great.

463
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,550
I know.

464
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,447
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

465
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,117
The Korean astronauts are amazing.

466
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,994
Yeah, I agree.

467
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,747
A spacecraft
will head to the ILS as planned.

468
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,458
The mission has changed
to investigate the incident.

469
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,252
Since restoring power
is the highest priority,

470
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,631
we'll look over the solar panel,
the energy conversion device,

471
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,467
and the perforation of the storage module.

472
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,094
By the way,

473
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,597
how did the tourist get left behind
in the observation module?

474
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,060
He said that he was isolated
while trying to get his baggage.

475
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,146
Was he not briefed
on the severity of the situation?

476
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,150
I guess he was just

477
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,902
bemused or something.

478
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,989
Please try to find the tablet
and the cell phone

479
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,783
that the team left behind.

480
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,994
Is there anything else
we can do to support you?

481
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,985
THE TRUTH IS, I CAME HERE
TO CREATE EMBRYOS…

482
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,357
Here's your meal.

483
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,609
You're doing much better.

484
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,114
Could I ask you something?

485
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,950
What's that place
with all the tables down there?

486
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,538
Oh, it's a convenience store.

487
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,998
It's a convenience store?

488
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,708
Thank you.

489
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,919
Sure, hope you enjoy!

490
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,045
Will do.

491
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,052
How about I find us a good place to eat?

492
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,679
Code blue, code blue.

493
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,517
Paging Dr. Lee from Cardiothoracic Surgery
to the Gravity Adjustment Ward.

494
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,685
Code blue, code blue.

495
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,356
Paging Dr. Lee from Cardiothoracic Surgery
to the Gravity Adjustment Ward.

496
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,150
Code blue, code blue.

497
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,443
-Eve?
-Paging Dr. Lee.

498
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,904
-Report to the Gravity Adjustment Ward.
-Ryong?

499
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,245
Are you all right?

500
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,539
-Monitor, please.
-I'm on it.

501
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,715
Dona, are you okay?

502
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,633
Yeah.

503
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,398
Si-won, let's go.

504
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,697
Dong-a has no idea
it's his birthday today, does he?

505
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,532
I think everyone else forgot as well.

506
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,741
Even the commander?

507
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,285
Even her.

508
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,412
She's been caught up
in gravity readjustment.

509
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,798
I found it in his sock.

510
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,258
That dude is so…

511
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,724
Mina, are you feeling okay?

512
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,021
Wait, what are you all doing here?

513
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,480
Nothing.

514
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,815
What brings you here?

515
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:34,528
Oh, it's Dong-a's birthday today.
We planned a little surprise party.

516
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,322
Should we light the candles here?

517
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,449
Sure.

518
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,578
By the way, where's Dr. Kang?

519
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,249
He's probably in his room.

520
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,878
Should we invite the tourist too
while we're at it?

521
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,963
Sure, why not?

522
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,089
-What's going on?
-Gosh.

523
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,758
What are you all doing without me?

524
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,261
Nothing.
We're here to celebrate Dong-a's birthday.

525
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,971
We were just about to come get you.

526
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,390
Chief Kang is coming too.

527
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,227
By the way, where is Dong-a?

528
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:14,234
Happy birthday to you

529
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,573
Happy birthday to you

530
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,491
Happy birthday…

531
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,494
-You know what? Forget it.
-No, we're doing this together.

532
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,703
All right, fine.

533
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,208
Happy birthday to you

534
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,672
-Olé!
-Happy birthday.

535
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,964
Well, this is embarrassing.

536
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:40,260
Chief, I appreciate it,
but could you guys leave now?

537
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,513
-I knew he wouldn't be so happy.
-Ta-da!

538
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,723
-Ta-da.
-What's that?

539
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,808
Well,

540
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,687
I thought the commander should see this.

541
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,938
Si-won, why would you…

542
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:52,856
What is it?

543
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,610
We were supposed to do
the abort and reentry tests

544
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,570
with that manikin,
but Dong-a took it down,

545
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,531
insisting on taking its place.

546
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,326
He was all,
"Eve will die waiting for a rescue ship."

547
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,245
"I'll be the manikin."

548
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,621
He wouldn't budge.

549
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,930
Come on. Turn that off.

550
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,015
-Not a chance.
-Why? What is it?

551
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,475
-Hang on.
-Yeah, let's see it.

552
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,437
-Yeah, you haven't seen anything yet.
-Wait, what's this video?

553
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,448
Eve.

554
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,703
I'm scared.

555
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,584
I'm terrified.

556
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,593
You must be so scared right now too.

557
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,269
I'm coming for you.

558
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,566
Just hold on a little longer…

559
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,113
Don't give up, okay?

560
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,117
I know I'm not the most reliable,

561
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,370
but you still have to trust me

562
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,331
if you're going to survive!

563
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,836
I'm coming for you.

564
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,967
I'll never let you die alone, okay?

565
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:48,805
I won't let you die up there
so lonely like that

566
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,474
with no one around.

567
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,394
No matter how scared I am,

568
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,397
I'm coming for you, Eve.

569
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,342
Give me the remote.
Come on, turn it off now!

570
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,136
-Come on.
-This is the highlight, okay? This is it.

571
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,846
-Hang on.
-Why? I think it's cool.

572
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,351
We have to go faster!

573
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,813
Hey, listen. You've seen enough.
Thanks for coming.

574
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,190
Come on, you should leave. Get out.

575
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,692
Yeah, thanks. Just go.

576
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,904
No, let's keep watching.
"I'm coming for you!"

577
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,296
Dr. Gong.

578
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,755
Dr. Na.

579
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,881
Dr. Gong.

580
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,885
Thank you so much
for everything you've done.

581
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,264
I'm sorry.

582
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,142
Don't be. Now it's time for you
to do your job as the mom.

583
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,770
So, how are you doing?

584
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:19,855
Me?

585
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,399
I've got some tough competition.

586
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,692
-Sorry?
-What?

587
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,157
I have to admit.

588
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,161
The guy is pretty great and impressive.

589
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,497
No one in this world,

590
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:42,044
on this entire planet,
is as great or impressive as you.

591
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,171
There's no way. Who could compare?

592
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,426
They say infertility
could lead to the end of life on Earth.

593
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,179
You're the one who saved
our planet and everyone on it.

594
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,515
Come on, you're exaggerating way too much.

595
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,065
Do you really think I'm a decent guy?

596
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,443
I think

597
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,946
I'm nothing more than
a speck of cosmic dust.

598
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,867
A selfish, petty, and jealous…

599
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,454
speck of dust.

600
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,085
I'm not part of the Choi family.

601
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,046
I hope you find someone you love,

602
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,757
who loves you back,

603
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:33,053
and stay happy and healthy with them.

604
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,767
Do I deserve that?

605
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,477
Of course.

606
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,853
Will it happen for me?

607
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,021
Absolutely.

608
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,069
I don't think it will.

609
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,575
Any plans for after you're discharged?

610
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,831
How about a movie?

611
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,795
Do you want to go for a walk?

612
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,506
How about I find us a good place to eat?

613
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,133
Why don't we go get a haircut?

614
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:18,974
BUY TICKETS HERE

615
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:34,030
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

616
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:11,902
DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK?

617
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:30,837
RYONG, PARTY OF 2

618
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:36,760
HOW ABOUT I FIND US A GOOD PLACE TO EAT?

619
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,562
HAIR SALON

620
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:54,694
WHY DON'T WE GO GET A HAIRCUT?

621
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,869
Let's do all of these things
here on Earth.

622
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,715
Come in.

623
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,982
You didn't eat your dinner.

624
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,275
Or take your meds.

625
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,656
Ryong.

626
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,577
Mr. Tourist.

627
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,704
I'm not hungry.

628
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,500
Do you want to go
to the convenience store?

629
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,065
Are you cold?

630
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:15,942
No.

631
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,989
Let's go.

632
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,787
Come on.

633
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,124
Ten seconds left.

634
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,751
-Hurry.
-This is hard.

635
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,091
I can't believe we're doing this.

636
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,968
I know, me neither.

637
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,809
You added the entire seasoning packet?

638
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,603
-Yeah.
-It's going to be too salty.

639
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,854
It's supposed to be salty.

640
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,106
You should add more water.

641
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,860
Come on, ramyeon should be salty.
That's what makes it tasty.

642
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,278
I'm finally having some,

643
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,489
so I'm eating it the way I like,

644
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,074
the way I think tastes best.

645
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,079
-Eve.
-Yeah?

646
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,956
That'll spike your blood pressure.

647
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,624
Good, mine's too low.

648
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,795
Come on, add more water.

649
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,343
All right, let's see how salty it is.

650
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,761
All right.

651
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,014
Let's eat!

652
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,824
I feel alive.

653
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,033
It's so satisfying.

654
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,289
MU CUP NOODLES
SLURP, ALL DONE

655
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,876
All done.

656
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,462
Thanks.

657
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,382
Hot food makes your nose run, huh?

658
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,851
I'm so happy right now.

659
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:19,899
Ryong.

660
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:21,860
Yeah?

661
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,322
Let's pretend like it never happened.

662
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,744
What do you mean?

663
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,704
The sex.

664
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,209
I've snapped back to reality.

665
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,173
Everything that happened in space
feels like a dream.

666
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,595
I risked my life
walking out into space for some guy.

667
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,931
I saved his life

668
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,141
and kissed him.

669
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,478
Even when you said you'd created
a human embryo, I wasn't mad.

670
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:58,980
And when I thought…

671
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,194
we were going to die,
I had sex with you in the freezing cold.

672
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,331
I don't do that.

673
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,834
To me, that's like a dream.

674
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,463
A good dream.

675
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,469
That's not who I am.

676
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,556
I've woken up from the dream.

677
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,558
You should too.

678
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,273
That's not who you are?

679
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:47,028
Dong-a risked his life to save us.

680
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,907
That's not as easy as it sounds.
It's not something to take for granted.

681
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,451
And you have a woman
who trusted and waited for you.

682
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,960
Let's not hurt the people who love us

683
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,547
just because of the ten short days
we spent in space.

684
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,386
I'm going back to space in a month.

685
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:15,431
Once I do,
I'll never think about you again.

686
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,811
You keep denying yourself.

687
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,021
You keep denying your feelings.

688
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,733
Why do you do that?

689
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,944
For what?

690
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,362
For who?

691
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,243
You asked about my plans
after I get discharged.

692
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,082
I want to be done with you.
That's my plan.

693
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,795
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

694
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,589
It looks like

695
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,967
the two of them had sex.

696
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,302
So did you keep his legs still?

697
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,805
He gave the ticket back
because you did it, right?

698
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:22,475
Whether or not you and Ryong
end up together, it's all the same to me.

699
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,271
I wanted to meet you.
I kept thinking about you.

700
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,731
You're heading back to space soon.

701
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,609
Why don't you reconsider?
Stay with me a bit longer.

702
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,987
I'll need separate reports
from each of you.

703
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,072
Make sure you leave that part out, okay?

704
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,242
You're ashamed of what we did. Is that it?

705
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:48,501
