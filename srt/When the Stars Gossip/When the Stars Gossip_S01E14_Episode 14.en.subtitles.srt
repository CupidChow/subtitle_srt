1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,012
"We're here to honor the innocent souls."

3
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,264
"All lives,
though different in nature, are equal."

4
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,559
"While your lives were precious,
you faced noble deaths."

5
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,478
"Do not resent the heavens or humanity,

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,856
for your sacrifice aids mankind
and protects your own kind."

7
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,485
"We pray for your gentle spirits
and wish you peace,

8
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,696
hoping you'll find
a brighter world and eternal life."

9
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,367
We mourn the invaluable sacrifice
of animals in experiments…

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,619
MEMORIAL FOR LAB ANIMALS

11
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,289
…creatures who shared
emotions and senses like our own.

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,710
We bow our heads in respect
and pray for their eternal rest.

13
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,648
Why did the babies die all of a sudden?

14
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,193
They were probably unstable
from the moment of conception.

15
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,986
They were barely hanging on.

16
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,072
It's all because of zero gravity?

17
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,211
If it's this hard for a mouse
to be born in space,

18
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,673
is it even possible
for a human to be born?

19
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,568
I'm so sorry.

20
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,117
Did the surgery go well?

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,618
-Yeah.
-Good.

22
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,707
They have a strong maternal instinct.
Will she be okay?

23
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,627
It wasn't your fault, okay?

24
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,215
Take tomorrow off. You look exhausted.

25
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,302
Get some rest, okay?

26
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,725
Come on, she's doing fine. Go home.

27
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,684
But…

28
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,102
Just go.

29
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,605
Come on.

30
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,576
Cheer up, okay?

31
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,705
You know I'm your secret admirer, right?

32
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,838
Well, you make me feel
pretty lonely these days,

33
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,841
but I've always been on your side,

34
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,886
and I always will be,
although it hurts my pride a little.

35
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,013
So keep your head up, okay?

36
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,679
What's wrong? Why do you look so tired?

37
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,888
Were you up all night?

38
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,432
No, that's not it.

39
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,314
Take a look at this.

40
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,403
The door is locked.

41
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:50,952
Hello?

42
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,746
You're still up?

43
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,872
I can't sleep.

44
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,001
It feels like
the night before I went to space.

45
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,381
Doesn't it feel like just yesterday
that we were getting ready?

46
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,928
To be honest,
I was really nervous earlier.

47
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,598
The marriage registration form.
I thought you might slap me again.

48
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,893
I'm just happy you didn't.

49
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,150
Oh, right. I have one more gift for you.

50
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,529
But then again, I'm not sure
if you'll be happy or want to slap me.

51
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,531
I think you might be happy.

52
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,741
It's hard to tell.

53
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,828
What could it be?

54
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,497
Good night.

55
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,255
I'm leaving in three days.

56
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,425
I know.

57
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,517
Good night.

58
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,103
Good night.

59
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,343
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

60
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,576
IOU, everything is frozen solid.

61
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,827
It's a mess up here.

62
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,664
Make sure you search
every corner of the ILS.

63
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,125
If you see anything
out of the ordinary, bag it.

64
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,211
Copy that.

65
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:44,166
ILS 21:50, SEOUL 06:50

66
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,424
Chief, the IOU sent over
the footage from the robot arm first.

67
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,598
Is the investigation over?

68
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,393
Yes, the team has left the station
with what they collected.

69
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,688
They'll be arriving around 2 p.m., KST.

70
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,149
It looks like the crew

71
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,651
brought back all the experiment subjects,

72
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,487
but they left behind
a lot of their stuff in the chaos.

73
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,906
We got the exterior footage

74
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,410
of the hole in the storage module
and the areas that need repair.

75
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,038
Dong-a is set for a spacewalk.
Should we show it to him?

76
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,956
Yeah, he'll be the one to repair them.

77
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,583
Should I call the commander too?

78
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,003
No, not Eve. Let her rest today.

79
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,590
By the way, look at that hole.

80
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,344
If it had been any bigger,
the whole station would've blown up.

81
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,137
Yeah.

82
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,104
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

83
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,152
Look at that. When did she bring her food?

84
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,656
She didn't even say
she was going to see her.

85
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,995
And she gave her so much too.
Why would she do that for her?

86
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,997
Geez.

87
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,510
You didn't have to come all the way here

88
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,346
just to return this lunch box.
It's nothing special.

89
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,349
Thank you for the food.

90
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,144
I hope you liked it.

91
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,980
You really didn't have to bring this back.

92
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,945
I'd love to have your cooking again.

93
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,613
Again?

94
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,032
Yeah, again.

95
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,869
Why?

96
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,165
It was delicious.

97
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,807
I felt bad

98
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,017
after our conversation that day,

99
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,938
thinking I might've hit a nerve
just to ease my own mind.

100
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,777
As for the food,
I'd be happy to cook for you.

101
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,127
About that Christmas Eve,

102
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,797
you should just forget about it.

103
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,802
It's okay if you do.

104
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,017
Do you really think so?

105
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,274
Yeah.

106
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,366
I hope you stay healthy.

107
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,683
Take care then, Captain.

108
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,269
Will do.

109
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,230
-Oh, all right.
-Bye.

110
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,236
Bye.

111
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,916
2024, SPRING

112
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,589
NATIONAL CENTER
FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD

113
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,675
It'll be hard since it's been so long,

114
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,176
but I'll try to find her.

115
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,636
Thanks, I'll wait.

116
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,978
This is your first time
back in Korea in 37 years.

117
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,021
If I may ask,

118
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,566
why do you want to find your birth mother?

119
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,779
Well…

120
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,666
I just want to know why she abandoned me.

121
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,669
I wonder

122
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,755
if she's had a good life since then.

123
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,889
If she has,

124
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,100
I want to forgive her.

125
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,817
It's okay to look for her, right?

126
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,962
You and I were the same height
and weight before the experiment.

127
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,677
But after living in space,
you grew 5 cm taller.

128
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,763
Your crow's feet smoothed out,

129
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,889
and your telomeres,

130
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,850
which are associated with aging,
grew longer in space.

131
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,186
That's why you looked
so much younger than me.

132
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,899
But my muscle mass, body weight,
and bone density have decreased a lot.

133
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,985
With no gravity,
there's nothing to resist against.

134
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,698
I guess bones and muscles
are the biggest concerns in space.

135
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,535
Space radiation
has also increased your risk of cancer.

136
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,704
The increased blood flow to your eyes

137
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,916
has thickened the retinas,
which could lead to vision impairment.

138
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,753
Your thickened carotid arteries raised
the risk of heart disease and stroke.

139
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,131
During your time in space,
1,400 of your genes

140
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,217
showed completely different
activity patterns,

141
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,010
but this requires further follow-up.

142
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,264
Your immune responses to DNA damage
were different from mine.

143
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,357
This is just
a year-long comparison with me.

144
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,110
There's no need to worry.

145
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,988
You won't be staying up there
for years and years.

146
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,033
There are still no applicants?

147
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,785
No.

148
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,790
Are you going to continue
the twin experiment?

149
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,420
For me, I'll just be
doing my job in space as usual,

150
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,255
but it's got to be rough on you.

151
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,174
You can't eat what you want
or drink alcohol.

152
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,510
Your life will be restricted like mine.

153
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,137
Yeah, exactly!

154
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,057
Look, down here on Earth,
it's not easy living like you.

155
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,355
Don't you think
I'm turning a little hysterical?

156
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,065
I used to be a sweet girl.

157
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,738
It's your call.

158
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,616
I'll follow your decision.

159
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,123
Hey, did you get

160
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,168
a boyfriend or something?

161
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,712
-Is that the issue?
-No.

162
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,675
Dona, listen. Actually--

163
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,760
Hey.

164
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,681
You're not into dating,

165
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,268
and absolutely no guy is
interested in you either.

166
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,020
But that's not the case with me.

167
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,229
When I go clubbing,

168
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,316
there's always a boatload of guys
trying to hit on me.

169
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,778
You know how popular I am, right?

170
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,741
If it weren't for the promotion, I'd just…

171
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,455
See? If you guys hadn't let
Dr. Kang take the lottery ticket,

172
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,541
I wouldn't be having
this problem right now!

173
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,753
Lee Seung-jun, that damn idiot!

174
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,678
What happened to your sister?
Where's she at?

175
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,180
Leave her out of this.

176
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,869
Hi.

177
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,954
Dr. Kang.

178
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,457
Oh, wait…

179
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,918
We're coming in!

180
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,535
Dr. Kang.

181
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,266
What are you trying to pull?

182
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,519
They tossed it in the storage room.

183
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,063
No one can wear it anyway.

184
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,858
Chief Kang is just trying to punish you.

185
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,109
For what it's worth,

186
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,112
we want you to know that

187
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,407
we really appreciate
your effort and sacrifice,

188
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,452
your research, your generosity.

189
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,245
I mean, you even bought that robot arm

190
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,872
without any hesitation.

191
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,250
So, this is for you.

192
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,544
It's the least we can do.

193
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,381
You stole it?

194
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,678
Are you into stealing now?

195
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,641
We've already done it once,
so what's one more time?

196
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,102
So what if we get caught?

197
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,313
Well, we probably will.

198
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,607
You caught us too.

199
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,400
Whatever.

200
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,111
Isn't this the least we can do
for our teammate?

201
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,905
That's right.

202
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,324
Look.

203
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,202
You can hate us all you want to.

204
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,622
We won't hold it against you
even if you decide to.

205
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,380
You think you can wear me down with this

206
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,632
and make me share
the lottery winnings with you?

207
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,300
Not a chance.

208
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,930
-It's all mine.
-Of course.

209
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,849
We don't even want
to look at the ticket anymore.

210
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:17,567
09:20 P.M.
IOU MISSION CONTROL, HOUSTON, USA

211
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,946
But fortunately,
the hole was only 2 cm wide

212
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,156
at the base of the storage module,

213
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,076
so in total,
seven solar panels were damaged.

214
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,539
Share all the data
with the recovery team in Seoul.

215
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,750
Sir! Take a look at this.

216
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,382
I think this belongs
to the Korean tourist.

217
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,854
Come in.

218
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,192
What?

219
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,153
Is something wrong?

220
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,990
No, I just wanted
to get a checkup from you, Doctor.

221
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,035
It was a long wait without an appointment.

222
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,704
She's your last patient.

223
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,788
Really?

224
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,082
All right, I'll handle it then.

225
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,546
Let's go have lunch.

226
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,672
Let's have tteokbokki.

227
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,924
Come on. I had that yesterday.

228
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,392
I just wanted to see you at work.

229
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,854
Well, there's nothing to see.
Do you want to have lunch together?

230
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,398
-Let's have dinner later.
-No, I can't.

231
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,193
-You have surgery?
-Yeah.

232
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,405
Ready to go?

233
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,283
You spend your whole day
dealing with women in here, huh?

234
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,705
That's right.

235
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,627
By the way, Doctor.
How many babies have you delivered so far?

236
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:06,718
I'd say over a thousand, ma'am.

237
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,803
A thousand?

238
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,723
Hey, I'm curious.

239
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,351
What do ob-gyns do
when it's their own baby?

240
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,894
Do it themselves?

241
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,105
Some doctors do,

242
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,108
while others have
someone else deliver the baby

243
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,692
because the stress is too much.

244
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,362
What about you? What would you do?

245
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,322
-Me?
-Yeah.

246
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,075
If it were my baby…

247
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,246
I couldn't even be in the room.

248
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,164
God, no. I'd be too nervous.

249
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,126
There's no way I'd deliver my own baby.

250
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,089
Really?

251
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,091
Why do you ask?

252
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,135
No reason.

253
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,305
I was just curious
what ob-gyns do when it's their own baby.

254
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,432
I bet most of them are like me.

255
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,855
I see.

256
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,150
So?

257
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,111
Where's the gift?

258
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,573
The gift.
Aren't you going to give it to me?

259
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,783
You said it was here, right?

260
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,451
Did you come here for that?

261
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,204
I wanted to make sure I got it.

262
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,914
My gosh.

263
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,416
Where is it?

264
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,251
Geez.

265
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,547
I think I might get slapped again.

266
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,507
Come on, I slapped you before

267
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,677
because you totally
deserved it, Mr. Tourist.

268
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,929
I don't know. Maybe you'll like it.

269
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,599
You're killing me. What on earth is it?

270
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,976
I'm curious. What is it?

271
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,352
Huh?

272
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,521
Give me some more time to think.

273
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,274
Why are you tiptoeing around it?
What's the big deal?

274
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,318
There's a good reason for it.

275
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,195
Are you going to give it to me or not?

276
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,780
What's it going to be, huh?

277
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,826
Forget it. Just keep it for now.

278
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,579
You can give it to me
when I'm back next year.

279
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,498
You'd better, okay? Coward.

280
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,667
All right, I'll give it to you.

281
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,627
Hang on.

282
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,091
Here.

283
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,801
What's this?

284
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,929
"Obstetrics"?

285
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,848
Take this with you.

286
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:21,519
I know how tough and lonely it can get
being in space for a year.

287
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,021
I've been there myself.

288
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,982
Use this when you feel like giving up,

289
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,485
when you're scared, exhausted, or in pain,

290
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,197
or when your crew is giving you trouble
and not listening.

291
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,949
Open this in those moments.

292
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,453
An obstetrics book?
What am I supposed to do with it?

293
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,829
Smack them with it?

294
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,831
Well, you could. You're good at that.

295
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,795
It's way too heavy.

296
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,090
This is… No, it's too heavy.

297
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,424
Come on. Open it.

298
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,305
It must be more complicated
than mouse breeding.

299
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,989
Well, I…

300
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,284
I thought it'd be nice to share it…

301
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,955
with your crew when things get rough.

302
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:27,794
Look, even just one drop of this
was a huge help for me.

303
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,672
Yeah, this calls for a good slap.

304
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,677
Isn't it okay for five people
to share this one bottle

305
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,220
over the course of a year?

306
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,518
I got excited for nothing.

307
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,228
Forget it.

308
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,400
Fine.

309
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:56,364
I get it.
I guess this was a bad idea after all.

310
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,742
It was inappropriate.

311
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,120
I was clearly wrong. It was inappropriate.

312
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,913
Let's go eat now. I'm hungry.

313
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,082
Aren't you hungry? Let's go.

314
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,459
Well, this blows.

315
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,419
-Come on.
-At least buy me a nice lunch.

316
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,587
Sure.

317
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,298
Sure.

318
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,343
Let's go have something good.

319
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,430
We're having this
since we don't have time,

320
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,890
but I'll treat you

321
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,893
to the best food in Seoul
tomorrow and the day after, okay?

322
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,780
-Why did you bring that here?
-What?

323
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,781
That.

324
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,993
Oh, I'm going to put it in my car.

325
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,411
I don't want people to see it.

326
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,081
So you know it looks bad?

327
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,248
Of course I do.

328
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,762
By the way, did you do it?

329
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,846
Do what?

330
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,515
You know what.

331
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,527
You don't need to know.

332
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,279
You shouldn't know.

333
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,407
I'm not an idiot.

334
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,371
Just pretend like you don't know.

335
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,957
Like you don't know anything.

336
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,584
I did the ICSI behind your back

337
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,420
and brought the morula here in secret.

338
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,088
You've never even seen it.

339
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,467
Those are the facts.

340
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,303
Let's pretend
you've never even heard of it.

341
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,976
How did you do the ICSI by yourself?

342
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,231
It's impossible to do it alone
without a microscope.

343
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,153
Did Kang-su help you?

344
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,741
Did he help you do it?

345
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,617
No.

346
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,286
It was on the ninth day

347
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,830
that you told me
you had a morula in your pocket.

348
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,916
Since it takes three days
for a morula to develop,

349
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,671
that means you must've done it
on the sixth day or earlier.

350
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,508
There's only one night I'm suspicious of.

351
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,262
The night when Mina, Seung-jun, and Santi

352
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,432
were all in the airlock.

353
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,768
Was it that night?

354
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,024
Look, the three of them just--

355
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,066
Just what?

356
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,532
Don't blame them.

357
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,835
They helped you.

358
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,882
If I hadn't locked the microscope away,

359
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,675
you wouldn't have had to…

360
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,765
It's my fault. It's all on me.

361
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,892
I'm sorry.

362
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,853
So when is it?

363
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,525
When is it?

364
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,485
Tonight.

365
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,251
As the commander,
I'm not sure if I should let this happen.

366
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,465
Do you really want to do this?

367
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,178
I do.

368
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,572
Eve.

369
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,160
Just forget about it all.

370
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,465
Good luck, then.

371
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,469
I'll see you later.

372
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,995
Tonight.

373
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,291
Do you really want to do this?

374
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,295
I do.

375
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,550
Eve.

376
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,427
Just forget about it all.

377
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,049
Where are you? Come to my office now.

378
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,224
Chief.

379
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,061
It's from the IOU.

380
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,441
The truth is,

381
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,860
I came here to create embryos
using the MZ Group heir's sperm

382
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,821
and his wife's eggs.

383
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,325
This was around the time

384
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,997
he and Eve were left alone,
waiting for the rescue ship.

385
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,293
One space tourist is about to ruin
everything the KSA has accomplished.

386
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,504
It says Eve didn't know.

387
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,464
I'm sure she wasn't involved.

388
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,260
What if she saw this note?

389
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,930
What if she chose not to report this
to me or the IOU?

390
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,017
If she knew and still helped him
bring the embryo here,

391
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,226
she's an accomplice.

392
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,479
Hang on.
Are you sure he brought it down to Earth?

393
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,231
The incubator was empty.

394
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,651
They found nothing
in the observation module.

395
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,194
They suspect he brought it here.

396
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,659
If he implants
the illegally created embryo in Seoul,

397
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,454
the KSA
will have to take full responsibility.

398
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,165
We need to seize it
and punish him before that happens.

399
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,709
-I'll talk to Eve.
-No.

400
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,378
You go get the tourist. I'll handle Eve.

401
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,757
Now!

402
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,846
Where's Mr. Gong Ryong now?

403
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,766
We're getting GPS signals
from Mr. Gong Ryong's cell phone

404
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,809
at the MZ Medical Center.

405
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,395
But are we even allowed
to track his location like this?

406
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,314
-What if--
-I'll take care of it.

407
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,983
We don't have time.
Just get him here before this gets out.

408
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,153
Get the unauthorized embryo too.

409
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,654
It needs to be investigated,

410
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,823
so bring it back exactly as you found it.

411
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,283
Oh, man.

412
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,795
We'll take a family photo together
in nine months, okay?

413
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,547
My grandkid better have
two eyes, a nose, a mouth,

414
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,966
arms, legs, ears, nostrils,

415
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,760
ten fingers, and ten toes.

416
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,888
You'll make sure of that, right?

417
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,932
We'll take a happy family photo

418
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,643
with me holding my grandkid, okay?

419
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,479
I'll do my best, sir.

420
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,192
Keep the room secure
so Ryong won't be disturbed.

421
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,401
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

422
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,112
Shall we?

423
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,082
We've destroyed the portable freezer
and the satellite.

424
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,264
-You're coming?
-I know the hospital inside out.

425
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,988
PEDIATRICIAN NA MIN-JEONG

426
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,871
Dr. Na, are you ready?

427
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,955
Yes, Dr. Gong.

428
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,958
Please wait in the recovery room.

429
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,043
I'll call you when everything's ready.

430
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,128
Okay.

431
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,189
Just the tourist and the commander?

432
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,566
Check all the footage.
Look for anything suspicious.

433
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,658
EVE

434
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,919
-Hello?
-Eve.

435
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,087
I need you at the MCC right now.

436
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,924
What's going on?

437
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,302
I have some questions.

438
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,473
Yeah, all right.

439
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,406
Get the other astronauts in here too,
but don't say anything.

440
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,200
Okay.

441
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,043
-That car.
-What?

442
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,379
It's Mr. Gong's car.
I saw it the other day.

443
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,484
EVE

444
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,627
GONG RYONG

445
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,643
EVE

446
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,323
Hi.

447
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,533
The Korea Space Agency MCC, please.

448
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,414
How are things progressing?

449
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,917
Well, Dr. Gong went into
the operating room a little while ago.

450
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,377
Should I ask for an update?

451
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,462
Don't bother.

452
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,964
I'll go check on them myself.

453
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,676
All right.

454
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,972
Mr. Gong Ryong is in the restricted area
on the first floor, west wing.

455
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,140
What's over there?

456
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,476
The operating rooms for VIP patients.

457
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,311
So he's doing one of two things.

458
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,771
Delivering a VIP's baby…

459
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,448
Or implanting Na Min-jeong's morula.

460
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,855
Who are you people?

461
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,357
We're from the space agency.

462
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,609
You can't come in here!

463
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,693
Please leave.

464
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,279
Did you know Dr. Gong conducted
an illegal experiment

465
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,407
with your son's sperm
and his wife's eggs in space?

466
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,827
All of you. Get out of here now!

467
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,620
It's that room on the left over there!

468
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,665
-It's an operating room.
-Please cooperate.

469
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,420
What? Are you threatening me right now?

470
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,839
Space agency?
I don't give a damn! Get out!

471
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,428
They're about to implant it!
If they do, it's over!

472
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,430
-It won't even take five minutes!
-Hurry!

473
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,515
-We have to stop them!
-Get out!

474
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,189
Are you ready?

475
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,652
Ryong, they caught us!

476
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,572
-Get out of the way!
-Move!

477
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,073
Hey!

478
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,534
There's no time. Hurry!

479
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,704
Wait, you can't lock the door?

480
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,664
No, you can't lock an operating room.

481
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,000
What do we do?

482
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,420
Get the morula first!

483
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,469
No! Be careful, okay?

484
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,387
If you drop it, the morula will be lost.

485
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,930
It'll die if you tip it over!

486
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:15,890
Take it from him!

487
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,809
All right, I'm taking this with me!

488
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,853
Don't touch me.

489
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,190
Why are you doing this?
Please give it back.

490
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,274
Mr. Gong Ryong.

491
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,361
I CAME HERE TO CREATE EMBRYOS…

492
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,197
Have you seen this note?

493
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,784
Did you help keep it alive?

494
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,291
Did you help him?

495
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,585
That morula died.

496
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,089
This is the one I made
after coming back to Earth.

497
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,842
I did the IVF here on Earth,

498
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,136
so what's the issue?

499
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,262
Look.

500
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,015
That's my son and his wife's baby.

501
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,934
It's more precious to me than my own life!

502
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,938
My son died young,
and that's the last of his bloodline!

503
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,065
Everyone, get out of the way.

504
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,693
If you touch me, I'll take it
as an admission of your crime.

505
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,278
If you come any closer,

506
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,739
I'll drop this, and it's over.

507
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,533
Now, move!

508
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,410
Please step aside, Father.

509
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,710
Mr. Gong Ryong.

510
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,173
We're taking you in for violating
space experiment ethics regulations.

511
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,801
You can make your statement at the MCC.
Let's go.

512
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,928
Shall I get an incubator?

513
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,596
The chief wants it undamaged.

514
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,392
There's a portable incubator
in the next room.

515
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:45,020
Please.
Please put it in the incubator, okay?

516
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,897
Bring it to my car.

517
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,109
-What do we do, Dr. Gong?
-Min-jeong…

518
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,902
What do we do?

519
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,882
GONG RYONG

520
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,177
Is the morula okay?

521
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,930
This is yours, isn't it?

522
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,731
It's just like Santi's sperm,
which I've seen a million times.

523
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,026
I can tell.

524
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,903
You could never fertilize an egg
with this sperm on Earth.

525
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,162
All 16 blastomeres are perfectly intact.

526
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,622
This is why he went to space.

527
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,415
He made this on the space station.

528
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,585
Man, I can't believe this.

529
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,254
That bastard's got some nerve.

530
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,505
What do we do, Chief?

531
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,008
What… What are we going to do now?

532
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,011
He managed to bring it down to Earth
without a scratch.

533
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,847
What happens now?

534
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,855
But listen,
I went through all the CCTV footage.

535
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,566
On the fifth day in the main module,

536
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,736
Eve took the ICSI microscope apart
and locked it in the rack.

537
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,156
The tourist argued with her
and tried really hard to stop her.

538
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,825
He clearly needed
the microscope up until then,

539
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,994
which means he still hadn't done the ICSI.

540
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:28,582
But after that,
no one took it out of the rack.

541
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,833
Yeah, she's right.

542
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,002
I saw that too.

543
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,381
Then how the hell did he do it?

544
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,259
Without the microscope,
there's no way he could've done it alone.

545
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,316
Hey, why didn't you report it?

546
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,527
Why did you leave it out of the report

547
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,405
and hide it when you knew everything?

548
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,784
I wanted to let him do it.

549
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,993
Are you insane?

550
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,495
I wanted it to survive.

551
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,124
Why? What's the reason?

552
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,919
Because you have feelings for him?

553
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,509
Is he here too?

554
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,857
So did you open the rack for him
without getting caught on CCTV or what?

555
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,276
He needed the microscope, right?

556
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,403
Did you give it to him?

557
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,115
The commander doesn't know.

558
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,997
The CCTV cuts out when the station
passes through the radio shadow zone.

559
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,416
That's when I did it.

560
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,545
In the middle of the night the next day,
when everyone was asleep,

561
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,131
I stole the keys from her pocket,

562
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,301
took out the pipette holders,

563
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,720
connected them to the microscope,
and did the ICSI.

564
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,725
Eve never saw the note, right?

565
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,810
Are you sure about that?

566
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,564
If she had,
the morula and I wouldn't be alive now.

567
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,567
She wouldn't have let it slide.

568
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,905
You all saw what happened
when Kang-su tried it.

569
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,662
She doesn't know anything.

570
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,665
Not what I did, how I brought it here,

571
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,166
or what I was planning to do.

572
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,378
She's…

573
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,214
She's just clueless.

574
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,925
If you showed her the note,

575
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,594
I'm going to kill you today.

576
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,682
You had the nerve to say you like her
after what you did?

577
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,815
The MZ Group chairman doesn't know either.

578
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,859
I wanted to marry his daughter,

579
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,695
so I did it in secret in space.

580
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:48,115
When I came back,
I told him I made it work here on Earth.

581
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,160
I wanted to marry into his family.

582
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,954
That's the reason.

583
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,541
That's why I did it all by myself
without telling anyone.

584
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,339
That's right.

585
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,261
The sperm
could only be straightened out in space.

586
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,305
I…

587
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,766
did fertilize it in zero gravity.

588
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,277
Please give it back.

589
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,074
I'm begging you.

590
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,368
Please give it back.

591
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,078
I wanted to give it a chance.

592
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,914
It would've been too cruel
to take that away from it too.

593
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,458
To you,

594
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:43,462
it's just 16 cells
created in an illegal experiment,

595
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,298
but to those
who see it as their last hope,

596
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,300
it's a living being.

597
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,177
It's a human life.

598
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,638
So I'm begging you.

599
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,682
Please. Please give it back.

600
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,643
Its mother is waiting.

601
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,019
Shut it!

602
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,145
Please give it back.

603
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,316
Look, if you just give it back,

604
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,568
I…

605
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,489
I'll accept any punishment
you decide to give me.

606
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,951
I'm begging you.

607
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,081
Please.

608
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,877
Please give it back to me.

609
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,592
This isn't just the tourist's mess now.
You're in it too.

610
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,511
I don't buy everything he says.

611
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,263
Do you even realize
what you've done to the KSA?

612
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:39,685
The IOU won't just come after you.
They'll grill the entire crew.

613
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,146
I even have doubts about the ones
Kang made, which are supposedly destroyed.

614
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,899
So spill everything you know.

615
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:51,071
I already got Santi, Mina,
and Seung-jun to come in.

616
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,032
Did the three of them help him?

617
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,288
No, right?

618
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,792
If they knew about this,

619
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,628
we're really done for!

620
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,759
You idiots!

621
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,855
Did the tourist
bribe them into helping him?

622
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,026
If all the members of Expedition 3
knew about it…

623
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,320
If they helped him…

624
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,658
I deserve to be fired
a hundred times over.

625
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,746
This is a huge disgrace
to the Korea Space Agency!

626
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,958
If it gets out that we have
a morula that was created in space,

627
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,836
the other member countries will go nuts.

628
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,172
They'll demand to do
all the banned experiments

629
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,882
they weren't allowed to,

630
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,843
and we'll be held responsible for it.

631
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:58,180
We'll lose our membership in the IOU,
which we fought so hard to secure.

632
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,057
All our ongoing projects
will be put to a stop,

633
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,227
and we'll lose the Maru,
which we've poured trillions of won into!

634
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,813
The Korea Space Agency will be torn apart!

635
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,234
We'll all be dismissed and banished.

636
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,572
We won't be able to do anything
related to space ever again!

637
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,461
Think about what the IOU wanted
to achieve with Santi's sperm.

638
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,465
We could explain that the sperm
of MZ Group's heir was also misshapen

639
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,302
and try to convince them
that it's a scientific achievement

640
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,262
for solving infertility, Chief.

641
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,431
You want to try to have
this illegal experiment

642
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,350
recognized as a scientific achievement?

643
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,603
You want to gamble the future
of the Korea Space Agency

644
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,688
on a morula that
may or may not become a life?

645
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,941
It could be
an opportunity for both, Chief.

646
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,317
The tourist

647
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,028
performed the ICSI,

648
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,905
smuggled the embryo into Earth,

649
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,324
and attempted to implant it.

650
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,035
He could face penalties in
the hundreds of billions for that alone.

651
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,872
Add the bribery of the astronauts,
including the commander,

652
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,582
and the charges become more serious.

653
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:12,003
He'll lose his medical license
and face criminal charges.

654
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,588
He'll end up in prison!

655
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,177
Do you still want to hand over
the embryo to the MZ Medical Center?

656
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,893
Fine.

657
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,814
If you really can't give it up,
go ahead and gamble.

658
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:35,318
Your colleagues, your beloved tourist,
and the KSA.

659
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,530
If you decide to risk it all
as the commander,

660
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,950
I'll do as you say.

661
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,333
What's it going to be?

662
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,628
What should I tell the IOU?

663
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,425
Tell me.

664
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,344
Say something!

665
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,699
When Dr. Kang did the same thing,

666
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,118
Santi was deeply hurt.

667
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,870
Mina and Seung-jun too.

668
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,331
The three of them were
way more upset than I was.

669
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,835
There's no way they helped the tourist.

670
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,255
As the commander, I'll handle this.

671
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,174
How?

672
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,681
Just give me five minutes.

673
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,809
Five minutes with Mr. Gong.

674
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,743
Commander.

675
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,622
Commander.

676
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,041
You'll give it back, right?

677
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,096
You haven't changed your mind, right?

678
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,931
We felt the same way about it.

679
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,058
You…

680
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,396
haven't changed your mind, right?

681
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,941
The truth is,

682
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,654
I came here to create embryos
using the MZ Group heir's sperm

683
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,156
and his wife's eggs.

684
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,798
You're just a tourist.

685
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,720
I'm the commander who needs to protect
the space station and the space agency.

686
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,640
I managed to fertilize an egg.

687
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,894
In my pocket outside

688
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,981
is an embryo with 16 cells.

689
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,734
A living being.

690
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,828
As per space experiment
ethics regulations,

691
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,873
I'm discarding it.

692
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,170
Don't forgive me.

693
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,727
No.

694
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:03,735
Eve!

695
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,487
Don't do it.

696
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,531
Don't do it, Eve!

697
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,868
I hope it's born healthy.

698
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,540
Don't do it, please!

699
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,462
Eve.

700
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,047
Don't give up.

701
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,849
Don't do it.

702
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,060
Don't do it!

703
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,230
Don't.

704
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,732
Don't do it.

705
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,009
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

706
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,928
I'm sorry.

707
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,054
You're sorry?

708
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,723
The other members
don't know anything, Chief.

709
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,101
You're going to pin
all the blame on Mr. Gong?

710
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,561
So it's just Ryong who's screwed.

711
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,396
Go-eun.

712
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,106
Don't do anything for me.

713
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,151
I don't deserve anything from you.

714
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,111
The defendant, Gong Ryong,

715
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,447
is sentenced to two years in prison.

716
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,240
They already cut you loose.

717
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,284
It's over.

718
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,368
STRANDED ASTRONAUTS RETURN…

719
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,494
Please dismiss me

720
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,038
and let me take full responsibility.

721
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:06,292
