(Salt Gang's Headquarters)

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,784
On the eighth day,

3
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,960
the Chai family and Zijin Hall

4
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,760
will settle our feud
at Yunshui Manor in Jiangzhou.

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,000
Years of grievances
will lead to a battle.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,840
Dan Xingbian

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
claims righteousness
in the martial world

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,479
but is a mere delusional fool.

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,799
Flaunting his imperial connections,

10
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,320
he's grown intolerably arrogant.

11
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,640
I've heard recently

12
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,359
he plans to quit martial arts

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,240
to focus solely on chess and painting.

14
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,320
His "five crafts and eight trades"

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
are street-level lackeys.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,079
(Chai Yu, the Chai family's head)

17
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,799
They wallow in false peace
and complacency.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,439
Lord Chai,

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
my porridge should be ready.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,799
If we keep talking,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,239
it will grow cold.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,079
If I bring it in to eat,

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,239
that would be impolite.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
You, Hu Qianshou,

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,640
fear impropriety?

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
I came to your private chambers,

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,359
yet couldn't even see your face.

28
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,719
This crippled form

29
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,000
requires a privacy screen.

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,200
First,

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
it shields me from drafts.

32
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,079
Second,

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,159
a maimed man prefers not to be seen.

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,079
Lord Chai, you descend

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,159
from imperial bloodlines

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,560
and are a leader of our era.

37
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,680
Don't stoop to my level.

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,359
Let me be blunt.

39
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,439
When my family clashes with Zijin Hall,

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,319
will your Salt Gang

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,120
side with anyone?

42
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:00,736

46
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,680
Lord Chai,

47
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,199
I'm no martial artist.

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,080
I possess no fighting skills.

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,800
My allegiance means nothing.

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Your Salt Gang's wealth rivals kingdoms.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Don't speak of wealth—

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,599
you'll get me killed.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why hoard such fortune then?

54
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,960
The Salt Gang deals

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,680
in contraband salt.

56
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,479
This illicit trade

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,199
breeds enemies.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,719
The imperial court opposes us too.

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
The imperial court

60
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,719
is our mutual foe.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,520
Why not form an alliance?

62
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,919
Our situations differ.

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,840
You antagonize the imperial court,

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,960
while the imperial court antagonizes me.

65
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,080
The Salt Gang must

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,719
navigate dangerous margins.

67
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:15,136
You must

68
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,920
excuse my candor.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
Let me mention several incidents.

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Ponder these carefully, Master Hu.

71
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,399
Last October,

72
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
the Grand Treasury's

73
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,480
Left Repository

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
saw seven officials die overnight.

75
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,519
All poisoned.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
Two summers past,

77
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:39,199
Mingzhou's vice-prefect drowned himself.

78
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,000
Yet when retrieved,

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,560
his head and body were separated.

80
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,728
Five days ago,

81
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,920
Bazhou's new vice-prefect,
Feng Youlan, vanished.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,639
Presumed dead.

83
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,560
Master Hu,

84
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,920
if you refuse aid,

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,399
the Chai family will war
with your Salt Gang.

86
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,759
Lord Chai.

87
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
Lord Chai!

88
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,759
Lord Chai, Master Hu is calling you.

89
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,920
Close the door.

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,480
(Hu Qianshou, Salt Gang Leader)
Stop hiding.

91
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Face me directly.

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Lord Chai, please go ahead.

93
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,439
My family and Zijin Hall

94
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,079
both harbor your spies. Correct?

95
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,519
Your profits

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,639
partly grease imperial palms,

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,800
while the rest

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,800
are spent on your family

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,920
and Zijin Hall.

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,920
Otherwise,

101
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,560
how could the Salt Gang survive

102
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,920
between court and martial factions?

103
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,759
(Qi Qing, the Chai family's warrior)
Among Qi Qing,

104
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,399
(Tie Lin, the Chai family's warrior)
Tie Lin,

105
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,848
(Tie Mu, the Chai family's warrior)
and Tie Mu

106
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,480
outside the door,

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,279
who's your man?

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,639
You came to visit me

109
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
and brought three of the Chai family's

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,879
six elite fighters with you.

111
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
Or are the three all your men?

112
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,839
True elite fighters
can't be bought with money.

113
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Lord Chai,

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,279
you're overly suspicious.

115
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,920
I've made myself clear.

116
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,040
I won't leave without reason.

117
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,399
Your Primordial Celestial Qi Art

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,560
has reached the seventh layer.

119
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:51,424
(Shi Xing, Salt Gang Leader's Aide)

120
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,720
Here's my proposal.

121
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,079
If the Chai family

122
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,800
clashes with Zijin Hall,

123
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
I'll side

124
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,319
with the Chai family.

125
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,079
Among Zijin Hall's
five crafts and eight trades,

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,399
who's your mole?

127
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,759
Exposing them
would endanger their lives.

128
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,439
We all just want to earn some money.

129
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,184
Fine.

130
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,720
My people in both factions

131
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,399
will follow your commands.

132
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,936
Agreed?

133
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,160
On the eighth day,

134
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
I'll meet Dan Xingbian.

135
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,800
Before that date,

136
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,600
half of Zijin Hall's
five crafts and eight trades will die.

137
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,839
Lord Chai,

138
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,480
you overestimate me.

139
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,600
Two from the eight trades
died in Ba County.

140
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,319
Five remain in Jiangling City.

141
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:42,000
If I didn't value you,

142
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,319
why would I make this personal visit?

143
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,800
Then let one more die today

144
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,680
to prove my loyalty to you.

145
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,600
Deal.

146
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,199
Safe travels, Lord Chai.

147
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
I'm crippled

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,560
and can't see you out.

149
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Farewell.

150
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,959
Go to Lin'an and inform Dan Xingbian

151
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,360
that Chai Yu has visited me.

152
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,120
The Chai family
will war with Zijin Hall.

153
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,159
And I'll support Zijin Hall.

154
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,039
Master, are you certain

155
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,960
about joining this conflict?

156
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,159
It's not direct involvement.

157
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,919
The elites I planted in both factions

158
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,879
exist for such occasions.

159
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,600
After the eighth day,

160
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,600
the Chai family will vanish
from the martial world

161
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,600
along with Zijin Hall.

162
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,759
Only our Salt Gang will remain.

163
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,712
Understood.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,919
It's cold.

165
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,440
The message from Kuizhou.

166
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:31,808
(Letter)

167
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,080
Well?

168
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,848
(Letter)

169
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
You need to tell me anyway.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,519
The Young Leader is dead.

171
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,480
Explain clearly.

172
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,704
Master,

173
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
your son,

174
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
Hu Baili, has died.

175
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,039
What else?

176
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,679
Seventeen is arriving shortly

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
with Young Leader's body.

178
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,559
Next time the porridge cools,

179
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,320
you'll die.

180
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,112
Understood.

181
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,232
(Jiangling)
Let's go.

182
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,328
Bravo!

183
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:36,960
Punch him!

184
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,976
Why staring at me?

185
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Stop gawking! All of you!

186
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,248
It's nothing.

187
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,080
We've never seen you
look like this before.

188
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,399
Don't stare anyway.

189
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,279
You're dressed so beautifully

190
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,639
yet forbad anyone to look.

191
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,000
Why?

192
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,120
This isn't for your eyes.

193
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:21,568
Watch out.

194
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:29,300
My dress.

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,968
Pan.

196
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,279
It's our young lady. You've seen right.

197
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,159
My lady, two people are at Cuihua House

198
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,879
accompanied
by a scholar-looking stranger.

199
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,000
We never saw him in Kuizhou.

200
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,840
Were the Five Elders summoned?

201
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,679
Elder Fu of Hat-making is in Pengze.

202
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,720
He should arrive.

203
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,360
As usual, nobody follows me.

204
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:56,640
My lady!

205
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,120
Only two Westerners remain.

206
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,279
Even if Ouyang Feng is skilled,

207
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,039
if we attack together,

208
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,159
we could eliminate them.

209
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,664
Why must you...

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,232
Why must what?

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,440
Why bother inviting the Five Elders?

212
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,039
It's complicated.

213
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,360
Complicated? My lady, please do explain.

214
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,279
Does this outfit look bad on me?

215
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,240
You look beautiful no matter what.

216
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
My lady,

217
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,039
I think it's best if our group

218
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,519
stays by your side for now.

219
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:45,600
After all,
I killed one of the Westerners.

220
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,559
If Master Dan truly blames us,

221
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,639
Pan Jie can't bear it.

222
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,168
My lady,

223
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,960
how complicated is it really?

224
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,200
To put it simply,

225
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,480
I just want to mess with Ouyang Feng.

226
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:10,320
(Cuihua House)

227
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,232
Good!

228
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,184
Good!

229
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,960
- Small!
- Big! Big!

230
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,552
This is

231
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,279
way too lively.

232
00:13:58,816 --> 00:13:59,776
Want to play?

233
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,336
Mr. Ouyang,

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
how about we find a quiet place to rest?

235
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
We're already here. Let's explore.

236
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,039
Only the South has such places
in all the realms.

237
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:10,944
Let's go.

238
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,768
Yaoshi.

239
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Inside the carriage?

240
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,720
There's also a woman.

241
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,919
The 'undying body' Young Leader
brought back from Mount Ba.

242
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,360
A final act of his filial piety
to you before dying.

243
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,208
Open it.

244
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,279
My son died at the Kuizhou branch.

245
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,600
Why did you bother to return?

246
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:23,200
Master,

247
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
it's to let you
understand the full story

248
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,360
before I leave for good.

249
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,448
Go ahead.

250
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,360
Young Leader obeyed your order to ambush

251
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,480
and kill Bazhou's new vice-prefect,
Feng Youlan, at Mount Ba.

252
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,039
Feng Youlan was killed,

253
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,519
but his daughter jumped off a cliff.

254
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,759
Young Leader searched the cliff base

255
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,679
and found her miraculously alive.

256
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,039
Her body emitted a scent
that repelled insects.

257
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,399
She could even jump up and run.

258
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,280
Continue.

259
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,680
Young Leader was filial.

260
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,279
Understanding your health,

261
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,599
he brought this woman to the branch,

262
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
planning to send her to Jiangling
for your examination.

263
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
Following Young Leader's pigeon message,

264
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,200
I went to kill the Westerners.

265
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,079
I failed the task,

266
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,279
and the garrison arrested them.

267
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,079
So I brought their belongings
back to the branch.

268
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:26,592
At nightfall,

269
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,000
a sorcerer came to retrieve the luggage

270
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,720
and killed your son.

271
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,152
Sorcerer?

272
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,200
Master,

273
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,264
I have never seen anyone

274
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,640
with martial arts at such heights

275
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,960
or even heard of any.

276
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,880
No martial arts
could reach such heights.

277
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,920
He was with the Westerners?

278
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,319
Yes. We encountered them
at the post house.

279
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,559
Their leader is Ouyang Feng.

280
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,119
His martial arts are good too.

281
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Anything else to add?

282
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,880
Leader, two more points.

283
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,880
That sorcerer and this woman
must be lovers.

284
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,519
At the post house,

285
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,039
the sorcerer fed her pills.

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,240
Her survival from the fall

287
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,680
must be connected to him.

288
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,240
Seventeen!

289
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,359
Seventeen!

290
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,216
Deng Zhao!

291
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,119
Master,

292
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,920
Deng Zhao is our Kuizhou branch member.

293
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,279
I...

294
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,559
I ordered him to track the sorcerer
and Ouyang Feng.

295
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,680
Master.

296
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,759
Let him in.

297
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,024
Seventeen.

298
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:03,368
Master.

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
Go ahead.

300
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
The sorcerer and two Westerners
arrived in Jiangling's

301
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,640
Cuihua House.

302
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,279
Go to Cuihua House

303
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,039
and tell that sorcerer to come here.

304
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,192
To headquarters?

305
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,519
Didn't you claim

306
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,640
he's involved with that woman?

307
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,000
Don't disrupt business.

308
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,480
Just make him come alone.

309
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,136
Understood.

310
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,640
The tiles

311
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,400
must be revealed

312
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,839
from bottom to top bit by bit.

313
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,480
- This is the fun of Pai Gow.
- Right.

314
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,960
Revealing them all at once
ruins the suspense.

315
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,480
Exactly. You don't know how to play.

316
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,640
Did I win?

317
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,640
You get a pair of Red Heads.

318
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,319
Third smallest, reversed.

319
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,544
But it's fine.

320
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,279
Want to raise by ten coins?

321
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,799
- Yeah.
- Go ahead, raise it.

322
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,839
Gotta raise the stakes.

323
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,119
But mine is small.

324
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,559
Well. Mine might be even smaller.

325
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,160
Right. Exactly.

326
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,920
Deal. Ten more coins.

327
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,559
Such boldness.

328
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Blow! Blow!

329
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,039
Call! Call!

330
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,720
Call!

331
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,640
Double celestial pair.

332
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Second highest straight.

333
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,000
You tricked me?

334
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,359
Honor your losses.

335
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,000
Well? Enjoying this?

336
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,200
If you're good, beat me then.

337
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:08,599
Exactly.

338
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:12,640
Again.

339
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,720
Do you have someone you care about?

340
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,120
I do.

341
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,279
He died at Kuizhou Yamen.

342
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Three of us came from the West.

343
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,599
Lie died. Only two remain.

344
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
With you, we become three again.

345
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,559
You are nothing.

346
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,920
But Young Master likes you.

347
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
You make him happy.

348
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,319
Entering South improved his mood.

349
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,279
Killing you might be better.

350
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,839
But I fear upsetting him.

351
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
Human hearts are too complex.

352
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,839
Too complicated.

353
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,559
From Kuizhou

354
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,759
to Jiangling, it's a three-day journey.

355
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,400
But my son's corpse shows no decay.

356
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,480
You caused this.

357
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,119
I'll untie you.

358
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,440
Can you move?

359
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,079
Can you speak?

360
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,279
In my youth, I visited Mount Ba.

361
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,872
There,

362
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,599
cliffs tower hundreds of feet.

363
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,000
How could anyone survive such a fall?

364
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,839
Sorcerers don't exist in this world.

365
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,232
The person

366
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,039
who gave you the pills—what's his name?

367
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,960
How did he save you?

368
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,799
Don't move. Stay still.

369
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,880
I know a bit

370
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,960
about alchemy poison.

371
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,160
To get the best alchemy poison,
there are two methods.

372
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,040
First,

373
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,000
you need vast wealth.

374
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,960
Second,

375
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,960
extensive time commitment.

376
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,480
Don't move. Stay still.

377
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,599
I beg one thing of you.

378
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:09,984
Go ahead.

379
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,200
Kill me.

380
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,240
All actions bear consequences.

381
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,359
Your father died by my son's hand,

382
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,456
and my son

383
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,359
was killed by the one
who gave you the pills.

384
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,839
He'll arrive shortly.

385
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,039
You'll meet him.

386
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,920
I'll make him

387
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,519
pay with his life for my son's.

388
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:40,864
Want to raise again?

389
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,160
Did you see the tiles?

390
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,320
No.

391
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,720
Even if you did, it's nothing.

392
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,279
I didn't see them.

393
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:49,440
I trust you.

394
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,784
How much?

395
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Bring a gold ingot.

396
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,200
- Young Master...
- Bring it.

397
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,592
Youngster,

398
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,519
gambling shouldn't be about wealth.

399
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,880
I don't want wealth.

400
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:07,839
Then why?

401
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,304
I can't accept this.

402
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,519
You come from wealth.

403
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,119
You can't handle failure
and are too arrogant.

404
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,680
This ruins both wealth and health.

405
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,119
Gambling hates overcompetitiveness.

406
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,599
I won't play with you.

407
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,599
You Southerners have no backbone.

408
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,960
Then let's gamble.

409
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,440
Don't mention North or South.

410
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,839
One gold ingot.

411
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,032
You dare?

412
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
The stakes are too high. I'm panicking.

413
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,119
Forget about the gold.

414
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,119
Let's just add ten more coins.
How's that?

415
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:40,352
Scared, are we?

416
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,680
I've never feared anything in my life.

417
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,728
Reveal the tiles.

418
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,920
- Is it big?
- Ask him.

419
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:13,792
Is it big?

420
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,599
Double celestial.

421
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,160
Same as my previous hand.

422
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Second highest straight.

423
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,359
Don't show off again.

424
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,200
Who showed off?

425
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,392
Show your tiles!

426
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm about to lose my entire fortune.

427
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,440
Blow! Blow! Blow!

428
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,319
Call! Call! Call!

429
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:44,000
Youngster,

430
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,208
my apologies.

431
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,920
Ultimate Treasure.

432
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,000
You'd see this maybe twice
in a year of gambling.

433
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,760
You lost again.

434
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,840
You...

435
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,599
You just inhaled my secret concoction,

436
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,759
Three-Day Spiritbane.

437
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,119
I was pondering

438
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,440
whether to come in.

439
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,839
I'm Hu Qianshou.

440
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:29,664
And you?

441
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,560
Huang Yaoshi.

442
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,039
Yaoshi?

443
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,240
Yaoshi, do you wish to let her live?

444
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:40,960
I do.

445
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,439
Otherwise,

446
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,440
I wouldn't have saved her in Ba.

447
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,519
How did you save her?

448
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,039
I realigned

449
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,799
seventy-plus broken bones

450
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,400
in her body

451
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,440
and fed her two Ninefold Yin Pills.

452
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,319
Ninefold Yin Pills?

453
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,559
I accidentally concocted them years ago.

454
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,799
Only seven existed in this world.

455
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,200
Now only

456
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
five remain.

457
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,240
To save her,

458
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,079
would you die?

459
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Why force this choice?

460
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,480
I bear her no enmity.

461
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,480
But you killed my son.

462
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,920
Since he's already dead,

463
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,200
don't dwell on it.

464
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,799
Dwelling changes nothing.

465
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,480
Letting go brings peace.

466
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,039
That makes sense.

467
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,480
Take me with you.

468
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,720
I told you at the post house.

469
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,200
I can't take you.

470
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,040
Forget it.

471
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,599
Then why did you return?

472
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,920
My sworn brother Ouyang Feng said

473
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,359
I should meet you.

474
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,359
Your earlier words made sense.

475
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,079
Since my son is already dead,

476
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,680
there's no need for dwelling.

477
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,279
Dwelling changes nothing.

478
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,839
If you truly believe that,

479
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:27,960
that's great.

480
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,279
I vowed long ago to stop killing.

481
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,560
Back then,

482
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,559
it was truly unavoidable.

483
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,640
Are you truly

484
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,799
not involved with her?

485
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,359
My men told me that.

486
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:55,200
We're mere strangers who crossed paths.

487
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,400
Including now,

488
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,680
this is only our third meeting.

489
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,599
Then I retract my earlier words.

490
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,559
Let me reframe this.

491
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,160
To let her live,

492
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,079
will you kill your sworn brother
Ouyang Feng?

493
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,400
Why insist on forcing choices?

494
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,920
Because no one here can stop you.

495
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,039
And you refuse to take her away.

496
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,319
Earlier,

497
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,319
I used my Three-Day Spiritbane on her.

498
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,440
By the Chou hour, she'll forget

499
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,160
everyone she ever knew.

500
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
Tomorrow, she'll forget who she is.

501
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,000
By this time the day after,

502
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,039
her soul will scatter.

503
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,920
Before Chou hour, bring me

504
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,280
Ouyang Feng's head.

505
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,639
I'll detoxify her and let her leave.

506
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,159
And then all debts are erased.

507
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,960
I, Hu Qianshou, keep my word.

508
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,608
Go.

509
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Heavens!

510
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,840
I'm leaving.

511
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,440
Go then.

512
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,128
I'm leaving.

513
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,639
I won't be coming back.

514
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,800
Never return here.

515
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,800
It's best to forget those
I remember in this life.

516
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,159
Soul scattering is even better.

517
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,128
In this world,

518
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
is there anything

519
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,559
you need me to do for you?

520
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,840
Just one thing.

521
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,280
Don't listen to him

522
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,199
to kill your sworn brother.

523
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,719
Live well in this world

524
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,480
as long as you can.

525
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,840
Someone

526
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,360
once said the same words to me.

527
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,960
Word for word.

528
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,000
Go now.

529
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,599
This is farewell.

530
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,599
What's your name?

531
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,320
Feng Heng.

532
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,239
Go, go, go!

533
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,039
Step right up! Place your bets.
No changes after the final call!

534
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,119
Bet! Bet! Bet!

535
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,639
Big! Big! Big!

536
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,360
Big or small? Bets closed!

537
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,639
My luck is unstoppable today.

538
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:07,872
Let's all enjoy this.

539
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,040
You kid.

540
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,568
Thank you, Lord Chai.

541
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,559
This brat's generous.

542
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,199
Here, take it.

543
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,719
Young master, these Southerners
are shameless cheats.

544
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,320
Losers pay gracefully.
We're being honorable.

545
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,679
Youngster, you're decent.

546
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,119
I like you.

547
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,960
Let's burn this den of thieves,

548
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,920
slaughter these shameless rats,

549
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,320
take the gold back, and go.

550
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:41,400
Where's Yaoshi?

551
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,272
Why care about him?

552
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,320
Just burn it all and reclaim our gold.

553
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,920
Then I'd be no better
than the scoundrels.

554
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,519
Exactly.

555
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,400
Today's been fun.

556
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,079
I'm content.

557
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,599
Keep these two gold ingots.

558
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,800
Let's play again.

559
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,559
Off we go. No more games.

560
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,039
Mongrel, trying to flee?

561
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,208
What did you say?

562
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,488
Return the gold.

563
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,744
Another round.

564
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,199
Last two ingots. Three straight wins?

565
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,519
I refuse to believe it.

566
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,440
You little brat with a filthy mouth.

567
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,760
We'll settle this later.

568
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,760
Fine. Let's see you escape now.

569
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,920
Youngster, what's your name?

570
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,664
Ouyang Feng.

571
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm Chai Qiong.

572
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,960
Today I'll satisfy you

573
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,280
and teach you a lesson.

574
00:38:43,648 --> 00:38:44,640
Deal the tiles.

575
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,912
Stop laughing.

576
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,952
Is my hand big?

577
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,159
Sir,

578
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,360
you've got twin High Steps.

579
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,039
Only Zero Mist loses to this.

580
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,239
Heaven help me.

581
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,559
Help me.

582
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,840
Please don't let it be the smallest.

583
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,559
Blow! Blow! Blow!

584
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,512
No more blowing.

585
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:35,920
Ultimate Treasure!

586
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,880
Dominates all!

587
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,159
So ecstatic.

588
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,280
I'll slaughter you all...

589
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,960
Sit.

590
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,559
Want to bet three horses?

591
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,119
Purebred Ferghana steeds.

592
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,840
I live and eat at Cuihua House.

593
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,000
What use are horses?

594
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,960
Just say yes or no.

595
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,576
Fine horses!

596
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,280
Pity. No use for them.

597
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,440
Take them to market at dawn tomorrow.

598
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:24,760
Yes, Lord Chai.

599
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,000
The horses became his?

600
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,096
Come on, move.

601
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,599
Ouyang Feng,

602
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,920
losing everything's a blessing.

603
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,272
Let's find Yaoshi.

604
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,320
Leaving like this?

605
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,880
Don't go. You can't leave.

606
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,800
Apologize for your insult earlier.

607
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,320
Young Master, you heard it.

608
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,440
We gave him gold and horses.

609
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,719
Now he wants my apology?

610
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,136
How should I apologize?

611
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,880
You're admirable.

612
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
His apology is enough.

613
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,760
He's with me. His apology is my apology.

614
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,079
Then your apology will do.

615
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:10,599
Hand over the gold.

616
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,760
Zhao, no bloodshed.

617
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,599
Apologies won't do.

618
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,960
Kneel and kowtow three times to leave.

619
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,000
There is still time to kneel.

620
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,519
I'll make you kneel!

621
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,079
Two more to go.

622
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,704
Know martial arts?

623
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,039
Just a bit.

624
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,239
Care to test it?

625
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,960
I honor my bets.

626
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,159
He insulted you once.

627
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,800
And you slammed him down.

628
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,599
Let's go our separate ways.

629
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,984
No.

630
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,199
Two kowtows remain.

631
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,000
Don't want to hurt you.

632
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,048
Come on then.

633
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,000
I've won plenty of gold from you.

634
00:42:13,856 --> 00:42:14,816
I'll fight one-handed.

635
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,960
You will?

636
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,199
Right. Only one hand against you.

637
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,440
You're asking for humiliation.

638
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,960
Your martial arts are passable.

639
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,559
But your acupoint strikes are good.

640
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,119
Youngster,

641
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,280
that's one kowtow just now.

642
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,119
One more left.

643
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,159
You've been restless
since the first hand,

644
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,800
enduring no hardship at all.

645
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,400
Poor gaming manners
and mediocre martial arts.

646
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:30,519
Well. I will handicap myself further

647
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,199
to teach you propriety.

648
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:37,440
What's this?

649
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,360
A mishmash of martial arts,
nothing remarkable.

650
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:42,960
It's been years
since I last fought anyone.

651
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:44,199
Today's game amuses me.

652
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:45,960
So I'll stretch my old bones.

653
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,976
Come on.

654
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,719
Let me show you
Mount Baituo's techniques.

655
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,760
Not entirely formless.

656
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,239
Not bad. Not bad.

657
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,599
Youngster, your skills impress.

658
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,639
Who are you in Southern martial arts?

659
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,639
Don't mention martial arts.

660
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:50,639
I'm just a gambler.

661
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:51,920
Don't mention South.

662
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,520
You Northerners
and Westerners should know

663
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,480
this is the Song.

664
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,480
Are you the South's top fighter?

665
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,880
Why keep saying "South"?

666
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,280
It's the Song.

667
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,840
Are you the best?

668
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,320
Losing to the best would be honorable?

669
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,559
At least second or third then?

670
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,320
Youngster,

671
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,039
fortune changes like dice rolls.

672
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,360
We win this hand and lose the next.

673
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,559
Don't lecture me.

674
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,320
Such a sore loser.

675
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,159
I'm the best fighter in Cuihua House.

676
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,280
First in Jiangling as well.

677
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,159
In the Song,

678
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,239
who dares claim supremacy?

679
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,304
Excuse me.

680
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,119
Where's Cuihua House's stable?

681
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,559
Left turn outside.

682
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,288
Thanks.

683
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:13,639
You're with Ouyang Feng, aren't you?

684
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:16,320
In a way.

685
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,840
Ease his worries.

686
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,320
Life has ups and downs.

687
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,679
Time for me to gamble more.

688
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,000
