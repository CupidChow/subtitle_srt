1
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,079
Ms. Fu?

2
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,039
Find a place nearby to rest.

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,759
I'll heal myself.

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,479
They'll chase

5
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,640
and then return.

6
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:57,408
My lady,

7
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,159
Ouyang Feng
killed Liu Fang and Tang Long.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,520
I must avenge them.

9
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,999
Come back.

10
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,359
Are you a match for him?

11
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,919
Don't provoke him.

12
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,920
There's a Zaojun Temple below.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960
Let's rest there.

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Where's Pu Yuan?

15
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,959
Pu Yuan killed Pan.

16
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,799
He chased me into Pengze.

17
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,560
Hadn't Ouyang Feng acted,

18
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,120
Pu Yuan would've killed me.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Ms. Fu, you go first.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,400
I'll catch up later.

21
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,920
I can't just leave like this.

22
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,639
I need answers.

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,840
Which were Liu Fang and Tang Long's?

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
I don't know.

25
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,919
But Yaoshi came by.

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
He buried them.

27
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,879
Will we stand here forever?

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,360
I killed those two.

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,199
Though we were friends in Jiangling,

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
that's changed now.

31
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,559
If you want my life,

32
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,599
I won't resist.

33
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,560
Ms. Fu's at Zaojun Temple below.

34
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,879
Whether to take your life

35
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,759
is her decision.

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,159
If you won't act, I'll go.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
Ouyang Feng.

38
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,560
You must stay with us

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,240
at least for today.

40
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,879
Why should I?

41
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,439
Ms. Fu's injured.

42
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,039
If Tie Mu and Qi Qing return,

43
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,120
Yu Dian and I need your protection.

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Protect you?

45
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,280
You're currently the strongest fighter
among us four.

46
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,199
And Ms. Fu got injured because of you.

47
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,159
I'm begging you.

52
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,320
In the carriage,

53
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,800
there's the scent from that incense.

54
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,799
There is?

55
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,920
It's dissipated.

56
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
What incense was it?

57
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,800
Persian Mirage Butterfly Herb.

58
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
Even if I told you,

59
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,839
you wouldn't know it.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
In Liao, Jin, and Song,

61
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,160
few would recognize it.

62
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,760
Why did you

63
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,879
wait till the scent faded

64
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,719
to board?

65
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,279
I detest that scent.

66
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,839
Perhaps too cloyingly sweet.

67
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,039
Master.

68
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,399
What's wrong?

69
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,879
Huang Yaoshi's ahead.

70
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
He's not approaching.

71
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Drive the carriage there.

72
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
You stay still.

73
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,239
Understood.

74
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,279
Make way!

75
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
You came.

76
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,119
I came

77
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,920
to exchange words with Master Hu.

78
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,679
Yaoshi,

79
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,160
what requires discussion on the road?

80
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
Where's Ouyang Feng?

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,079
How should I know?

82
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,159
Hasn't he

83
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
been with you?

84
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Back at the inn,

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
I heard everything.

86
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
If Ouyang Feng's life

87
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,639
is harmed

88
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
by you,

89
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,480
I'll have no choice

90
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,120
but to show you discourtesy.

91
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,719
The people behind you

92
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,079
will also have to die.

93
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,039
Yaoshi,

94
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,959
the Salt Gang's affairs are complex.

95
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,279
Alone,

96
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,759
I must safeguard

97
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,439
the livelihoods of thousands.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
The martial world's conflicts

99
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,720
inevitably entangle us.

100
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
Recently, Ouyang Feng

101
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,320
has been mingling with the Chai family

102
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,159
and those from Zijin Hall.

103
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,279
I merely

104
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,879
heard some rumors from acquaintances

105
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,200
and kept it to myself.

106
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,960
How could his life

107
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,879
be harmed by me?

108
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,239
I...

109
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,200
I've never even met him.

110
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,080
Master Hu,

111
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,679
are you telling the truth?

112
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,799
Don't you know

113
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
who I am?

114
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,879
He doesn't know at all.

115
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,399
Miss Feng holds grudges against me.

116
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,480
About your father's death

117
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
and my son's death,

118
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,080
I've already explained to Yaoshi.

119
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,799
They cancel each other out.

120
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Yaoshi,

121
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,039
do you want my advice?

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
I do.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,399
There are two kinds of people.

124
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,879
Good doers without desires

125
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,559
and evil doers with desires.

126
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,840
If Master Hu were truly desireless,

127
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,679
why would he stir up conflicts

128
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,639
to dominate all?

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,799
He didn't avenge his own son's death

130
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,720
but killed for money
across a thousand miles.

131
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,639
Does that make sense?

132
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,119
Killing?

133
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,360
For money?

134
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,799
When have I ever killed anyone?

135
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
My father

136
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
confiscated your salt

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,919
in Huainan.

138
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,200
You hunted and killed him at Mount Ba.

139
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,879
Salt Gang is extremely rich.

140
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,720
Was your own son's life

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,879
less valuable
than a few thousand jin of salt?

142
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,879
I do have desires.

143
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,919
I told Yaoshi before.

144
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
Which are?

145
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,120
To borrow your skills

146
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,000
to restore my crippled body,

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,080
so I can walk freely again.

148
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,759
Okay.

149
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Let's make a deal.

150
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,799
You cure Miss Feng's poison,

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and I'll realign your bones again.

152
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,800
Afterward,

153
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,039
Miss Feng joins me.

154
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Yaoshi,

155
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,279
you said

156
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,440
I needed seven bone-aligning sessions
over 21 days,

157
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,840
followed by the elixir,

158
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,120
to fully recover.

159
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,360
After today,

160
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
there are five sessions to go.

161
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,919
I'll leave another

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,759
Ninefold Yin Pill for you.

163
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,000
Take it after 21 days,

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,840
and your condition

165
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,360
will significantly improve.

166
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,639
But Miss Feng and I

167
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,359
will be gone

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,039
and won't return.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,879
Shall we go up?

170
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Just breathe normally.

171
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,919
Test it yourself first.

172
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,039
Please align my bones

173
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,919
and give me the pill.

174
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,960
Still, I should thank you.

175
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,679
Miss Feng,

176
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,960
despite her youth,

177
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,200
shows worldly wisdom

178
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,440
and exceptional intellect.

179
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,039
I never expected

180
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,720
such capabilities from her before.

181
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,919
You can take her with you now

182
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
and talk with her.

183
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,440
But before You hour,

184
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,479
you must

185
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,559
bring her back.

186
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,240
Or don't return her.

187
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,399
Three-Day Spiritbane

188
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,720
advances its effects

189
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,919
by eight hours earlier

190
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,840
each time it's not neutralized
every three days.

191
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,720
Two days ago, it was the Chou hour.

192
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,040
Today,

193
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,200
it'll be the You hour.

194
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,239
I thought

195
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,039
you neutralized it just now.

196
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,639
How could it be neutralized?

197
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,600
Those powders earlier

198
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,960
were just

199
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,879
for poison testing.

200
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,480
Persian Mirage Butterfly Incense

201
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,519
is the real

202
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,440
Three-Day Spiritbane.

203
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,919
Your martial arts are extraordinary.

204
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,480
Only Miss Feng

205
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,840
can restrain you.

206
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,159
Feng Heng

207
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,960
will have soul scattering

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,279
when the You hour arrives.

209
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,519
I've been so sincere to you.

210
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,879
Yet you...

211
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,919
How could there
still be someone like you

212
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,879
in this world,
so simple-minded and slow-witted?

213
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,600
I, Hu Qianshou,

214
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,360
have no martial skills

215
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,120
and am disabled.

216
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,480
If I'm a good doer without desires,

217
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,679
how could I have survived till now?

218
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
My ambition for martial world dominance

219
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,200
might as well be forgotten.

220
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,200
Are you going to kill me?

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,840
A peerless master

222
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
is now trapped by a woman.

223
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,440
I bet you don't dare.

224
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,879
Let's go.

225
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
Master.

226
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,039
They'll come back

227
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,279
before the You hour.

228
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,280
Ouyang Feng,

229
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,480
why did you obey her and stay here?

230
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,559
I'll leave when your strength returns.

231
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,680
How peculiar.

232
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,759
When I recover,

233
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,559
you won't be able to leave.

234
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,200
(Travel Permit)
You saved me from Tie Mu.

235
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,480
I'll stay in case they return.

236
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,280
It makes sense.

237
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,559
What's Yu Dian doing?

238
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,399
Digging a pit.

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
To bury him after you're healed.

240
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,760
Did you hear that?

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,840
He heard.

242
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,119
Ouyang Feng,

243
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,920
if I were you,
I'd kill me and Ms. Fu now.

244
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,359
What do you mean?

245
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,200
You called me back.

246
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,079
Stop the nonsense.

247
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,160
I...

248
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,000
Never mind.

249
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,400
I killed your two people.

250
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,920
So I've avenged Lie and Zhao.

251
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,759
I'll stay for one more day.

252
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,079
If the Chais come,

253
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,200
I'll fight them.

254
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,240
If they don't,

255
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,519
no debts between us anymore.

256
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,960
You think debts disappear?

257
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,040
Yes!

258
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,559
My conscience is clear.

259
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,680
If you feel unresolved,

260
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,279
do what you must quickly.

261
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,839
No wonder Min likes you.

262
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,599
Don't mention that.

263
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,039
Martial world matters

264
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,559
can't be settled

265
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,799
with mere words.

266
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:13,959
With reason,

267
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
everything becomes clear.

268
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:19,839
Come.

269
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,679
Let's talk outside.

270
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,320
Let's talk.

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,960
I'll wait outside.

272
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,599
You'll come eventually.

273
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,359
In Kuizhou Posthouse,

274
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,080
you said

275
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,039
I've touched you,

276
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,720
so you can't live in this world anymore.

277
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,560
At that time,

278
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,599
I should've taken you away.

279
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
I only wanted you to take me away.

280
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,079
I never thought
you'd stay with me forever.

281
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,839
I wanted

282
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,119
to live a simple life together.

283
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,680
It's almost You hour.

284
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,199
Go back.

285
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,159
Ask Master Hu

286
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,159
to detoxify you.

287
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,319
What if he refuses?

288
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,960
I'll exterminate the Salt Gang.

289
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,400
A recluse from the world

290
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,319
living amidst mundane troubles.

291
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,640
How heartbreaking.

292
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
You said
the Ninefold Yin Pill is a poison.

293
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,759
Even if it resurrects me,

294
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,960
I won't last long.

295
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,560
How long can I live?

296
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,159
If it goes well,

297
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,399
three to five years.

298
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,040
Throughout the year,

299
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,599
you're in seclusion half the time.

300
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,280
Why bother?

301
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,000
We met on a cliff.

302
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,279
We'll part on a cliff too.

303
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,799
We were strangers from the start.

304
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,119
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

305
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,759
It's easy to forget me.

306
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,840
Who are you?

307
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,240
Tell me.

308
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,640
Why sit here in silence?

309
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,160
You called me here.

310
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,320
Speak your mind.

311
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,320
The pit is dug.

312
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
When Ms. Fu comes out,

313
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,560
we'll bury you in it.

314
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,920
You killed two from the eight trades.

315
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,519
There's no refuge

316
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,559
for you in Song territory.

317
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,760
I know that.

318
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,599
In that case,

319
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,080
I'll return west.

320
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,200
Then why not leave now?

321
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Ms. Fu saved me in the city

322
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
and took a strike for me.

323
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,000
I'll stay in case the Chais return.

324
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,119
It was my excuse to lure you back.

325
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,280
A reasonable excuse.

326
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,040
This pit

327
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,680
is meant for your grave, Ouyang Feng.

328
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,320
I'm not a fool.

329
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,039
You can't bury me.

330
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,480
You can't match Ms. Fu
when she comes out.

331
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,799
I don't fight women.

332
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,680
Because I'm a woman?

333
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,119
I don't fight women.

334
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,422
If women attack me, I won't fight back.

335
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,440
Then die here tonight.

336
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,319
A true man fears no death.

337
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,160
I thought myself invincible
in the Southern martial world.

338
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
These days revealed

339
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,440
I'm actually insignificant.

340
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,240
Only principles remain in my life.

341
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,960
If I abandon these,

342
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,200
I deserve not even death.

343
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,440
Let's go to the Western Regions.

344
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,160
I don't want to stay here either.

345
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,200
Just the two of us,

346
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,279
abandoning all grudges.

347
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,480
You may abandon grudges, but I won't.

348
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,799
Liu Fang and Tang Long
were my sworn siblings for a decade.

349
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,559
I won't spare him
for your personal affections.

350
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,399
Ouyang Feng.

351
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,359
In Jiangling we vowed friendship.

352
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,759
I'll take blades for you.

353
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,599
I keep my word.

354
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,480
This is my limit.

355
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,519
Don't force me with death.

356
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,200
I don't need that.

357
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,279
Just die here then!

358
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,359
Who's the woman in it?

359
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,760
None of your concern.

360
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,200
So that's how it is.

361
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,480
This entanglement exhausts me.

362
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,399
I'll decide this.

363
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,559
If you're sincere to Min,

364
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,720
go west back to the Western Regions.

365
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,159
From this day,

366
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,599
never return to Song.

367
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,279
If you refuse,

368
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,759
Zijin Hall's two artisans

369
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,159
won't die in vain.

370
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,319
Lie and Zhao died too.
How's that balanced?

371
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,200
Grudges multiply.

372
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
Can't be balanced.

373
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,759
Now you abandon reason?

374
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,480
We've shown ample restraint.

375
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,799
This world's beyond reason.

376
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,839
I merely wished to reach Lin'an.

377
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,640
I never provoked
the Southern martial world at all.

378
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,079
Though my martial skills
may be lacking...

379
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,359
Min, have you gone mad?

380
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm perfectly sane.

381
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,000
Ouyang Feng, leave now!

382
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,280
My lady,

383
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,839
I've served you for a decade.

384
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,680
You've barely met this man.

385
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,320
Ouyang Feng,

386
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,039
do you truly wish to die here?

387
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,359
Ouyang Feng?

388
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,240
Yu Dian,

389
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,879
bury him.

390
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,680
There's a temple below.

391
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,080
They won't be here.

392
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,240
Descend.

393
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,879
Dan Min,

394
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,240
you've been willful

395
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,400
because of your brother.

396
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,759
Were he not Hall Leader,
who'd tolerate you?

397
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,240
In both martial and official circles,

398
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
you're nothing.

399
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,599
Today,

400
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,640
you fought kin for foes.

401
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,119
If I cut you down,

402
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,960
Master Dan would be speechless.

403
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,200
Yu Dian, keep burying him.

404
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,040
Ms. Fu.

405
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,160
Ms. Fu.

406
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,000
Bury him.

407
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,440
Where have I been willful?

408
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,359
I just wanted to find someone I love.

409
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,599
I'd listen to him and stay by his side.

410
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,400
Who cares
about martial or official circles?

411
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,160
You are not willful?

412
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,239
The one you love?

413
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:52,640
Have you ever asked
if he loves you back?

414
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,119
I won't ask.

415
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,359
I won't ask.

416
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:00,839
Ms. Fu,

417
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,839
just let him go.

418
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:10,919
Continue.

419
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,879
I'll check.

420
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:49,919
Fu Ruoqing,

421
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,279
did you kill my brother?

422
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,440
Tie Lin is dead?

423
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,359
Pay with your life!

424
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,720
Ganging up on me again?

425
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:23,919
Dian,

426
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,359
unseal my acupoints.

427
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,280
Yu Dian!

428
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,920
Ms. Fu doesn't know.

429
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:31,960
That man doesn't know.

430
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,920
Don't you know my heart?

431
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,960
Elder Fu's acupoint techniques

432
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,560
are beyond my power.

433
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,920
It must be the Chai family's
Tie Mu and Qi Qing up there.

434
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,079
Elder Fu told me to bury him.

435
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,400
Back in Pengze,

436
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,240
Ms. Fu struggled
against Tie Lin and Qi Qing.

437
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,720
Tie Mu ranks second
among the Chai family elites.

438
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,039
We'll all die here tonight.

439
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,560
Qi Qing,

440
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,639
why hesitate?

441
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,520
Qi Qing,

442
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,400
she took my strike in Pengze.

443
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,639
I'll handle her.

444
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,639
You capture Dan Min.

445
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,199
Qi Qing,

446
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,280
don't you fear I...

447
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,720
Thank you

448
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,119
for not exposing it.

449
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,160
Double-dealing

450
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,960
must be exhausting.

451
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,200
Ouyang Feng?

452
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,999
Say something.

453
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,880
Say something,

454
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,720
Ouyang Feng.

455
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,760
Say something!

456
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,320
I'm fine.

457
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,400
My body just won't move.

458
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,920
Who's that woman in the painting?

459
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,960
Still on about that?

460
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,440
Who is she?

461
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,199
You madwoman!

462
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,920
Get me out of here.

463
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,640
Dian

464
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,200
and Ms. Fu

465
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,320
both died?

466
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,800
Get me out.

467
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,240
Unseal my acupoints.

468
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,640
I'll help them.

469
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,079
It's too late.

470
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,399
Too late now.

471
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,680
Ouyang Feng,

472
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,600
promise me

473
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,160
not to speak

474
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,120
or move.

475
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,000
When I first saw you at Kuizhou Yamen,

476
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,920
I loved you from the first moment.

477
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,239
You said

478
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,719
being together for a day

479
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,880
could be taken as a lifetime.

480
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,559
We've had our day together.

481
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,720
Dan Min,

482
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,120
unseal me.

483
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,760
In the next life,

484
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,440
I won't be willful.

485
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,360
Let's be friends.

486
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,519
Friends for life.

487
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,559
Dan Min!

488
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,840
Dan Min!

489
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,559
Unseal me!

490
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,639
Unseal me!

491
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,399
Unseal...

492
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,160
Spread out.

493
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,840
Search the whole temple.

494
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,840
Over here!

495
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,680
She fled downward.

496
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,840
After her!

497
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,519
Ms. Fu?

498
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,439
Dian?

499
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,240
Ms. Fu?

500
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:31,919
Ms. Fu?

501
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,880
Ms. Fu!

502
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,439
Be careful, it's hot.

503
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:18,959
Here.

504
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,120
Take some.

505
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,600
Chai Huo,

506
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,039
you eat it.

507
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,079
Okay.

508
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,200
Master,

509
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,719
Huang Yaoshi is back

510
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:49,879
with Miss Feng.

511
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,239
Two hours have passed
since the You hour.

512
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,079
In another hour,

513
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,480
she will awaken

514
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,239
but she won't even know
her own identity.

515
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,880
How to detoxify her?

516
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,400
You're free to kill me

517
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,519
and everyone else here.

518
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,960
But the antidote method

519
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,440
can't be revealed to you.

520
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,760
Wake her up.

521
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,199
I have important business
at Yunshui Manor in Jiangzhou.

522
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,079
Help me deal with elites
from the Chai family and Zijin Hall.

523
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,280
Handle it to my satisfaction,

524
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,760
and I'll neutralize Miss Feng's poison

525
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,760
and let you leave.

526
00:40:51,642 --> 00:40:54,846
(Yunshui Manor)

527
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,119
Dan Xingbian isn't coming?

528
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,519
That's correct.

529
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,160
Why?

530
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,880
I waited two days in Lin'an.

531
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,840
Dan Xingbian said

532
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,639
Chunfeng House's Jia Xiaoduo
has been popular lately.

533
00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:13,312
Her zither, singing, and chess skills

534
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,680
will dominate Lin'an

535
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,920
for a decade.

536
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,496
Calligraphy and painting fall short,

537
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,079
but remain passable.

538
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,079
I challenged him

539
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,840
to a duel at Yunshui Manor,

540
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,280
yet he dares to snub me!

541
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,400
Dan Xingbian said he

542
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,519
has a chess game with Jia Xiaoduo

543
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,720
in three days.

544
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,199
(Qi Ming, Chai family's elite)

545
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,480
The word has been spread.

546
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,039
Lin'an's cultural elites
will also attend.

547
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,519
Coming here

548
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,159
would dampen his elegance.

549
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,559
Prioritizing a courtesan

550
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,960
over a martial arts duel.

551
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,800
How despicable!

552
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,519
Since he won't come,

553
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:57,919
Zijin Hall won't

554
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,679
send anyone else.

555
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,320
Dan Xingbian

556
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,760
doesn't know we have his sister?

557
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,160
He knows.

558
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,960
He said if you

559
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,079
kill Miss Dan Min,

560
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,119
it would mean war with Zijin Hall.

561
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,360
If Miss Dan Min remains alive,

562
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,639
why would they fight the Chai family?

563
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,800
Uncle,

564
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,320
Master Hu and over twenty men

565
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,488
(Chai Shang, Chai family's junior)
have waited in the Jianqi Hall

566
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:24,544
for over two hours.

567
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,600
Hu Qianshou

568
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,840
promised alliance with our family

569
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,239
but secretly conspired with Zijin Hall.

570
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,599
Is that true?

571
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,840
Yes.

572
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:40,840
Hu Qianshou plays both sides

573
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,000
to make our family and Zijin Hall

574
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,599
weaken each other at Yunshui Manor

575
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:45,919
so he can profit.

576
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,760
With Dan Xingbian absent,

577
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,719
how can he profit?

578
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:55,519
Perfect timing.

579
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,840
I'll finish this cripple.

580
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,039
Your brother cares not for you.

581
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,239
He prefers to play chess

582
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,760
with some courtesan in Lin'an.

583
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,360
Enough talk.

584
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,119
Kill me if you dare.

585
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,000
My lord, Master Chai has returned.

586
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,840
Who?

587
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,488
Master Chai Qiong
is drinking on the lake.

588
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:38,879
Qi Qing.

589
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:40,079
Yes, my lord?

590
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,320
Tie Lin and Tie Mu are dead?

591
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,720
Yes.

592
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,199
Guard Dan Min and bring her later.

593
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,039
Understood.

594
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,840
What's wrong?

595
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,599
I'm fine.

596
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,199
How did Tie Lin and Tie Mu die?

597
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,000
They were killed
by Fu Ruoqing of Zijin Hall.

598
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,000
Fetch me more wine.

599
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,840
What's Dan Xingbian's response?

600
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:44,119
Only one sentence in two days.

601
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,639
He said he cares not
about martial conflicts.

602
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:49,719
The Salt Gang and the Chai family
can fight if they want.

603
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,639
He didn't say anything else?

604
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,639
I didn't want to talk too much
with Dan Xingbian.

605
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,440
Now that we've come to Yunshui Manor,

606
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,519
let's give this fight our all.

607
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,280
Master,

608
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,039
Yunshui Manor has numerous elites.

609
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,960
Our chances are slim.

610
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,519
Your presence
turns the odds in our favor.

611
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,240
I will

612
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,200
do my utmost.

613
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:34,079
Hu Qianshou,

614
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,280
you play both sides.

615
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,039
Don't you want to live anymore?

616
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:43,400
Lord Chai, please calm your anger.

617
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,280
Let me explain.

618
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
What more is there to say?

619
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,400
From now on,

620
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,280
you,

621
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,720
Chai Yu,

622
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,599
will obey the Salt Gang's commands.

623
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,680
In the martial world,

624
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,599
the Chai family is gone.
