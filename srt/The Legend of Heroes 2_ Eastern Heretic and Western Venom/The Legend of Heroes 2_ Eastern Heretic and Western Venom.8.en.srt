1
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,240
From now on,

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,359
you, Chai Yu,

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,519
shall work for our Salt Gang.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,960
As long as you comply,

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,199
I will spare you from the calamity.

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,560
With the bunch of losers you brought?

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,320
For twenty years,

8
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,240
the Chai family

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,920
has never matched Zijin Hall's might.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,679
The "eight trades" may not be fancy,

11
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,560
but any of the "five crafts"

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
could best these two
top fighters of yours.

13
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,880
The martial artists

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,600
lurking in brothels and theaters
throughout the area

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,759
all have connections with Zijin Hall.

16
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,600
And Dan Xingbian's martial arts

17
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,519
surpass yours by far.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,864
The only one I fear is Master Dan.

19
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,359
I've never considered you,

20
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,439
Chai Yu,

21
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,159
a threat.

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
Youngster.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,840
Sharp palm strike.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,319
You old thing.

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,879
I see.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,640
But he alone

27
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,359
is not enough.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,200
Naturally, Shi Xing is not alone.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,480
He merely tends to my daily needs.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
Isn't that Zijin Hall's

31
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,599
Oil Artisan Pu Yuan?

32
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,799
When did you submit to the Salt Gang?

33
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,439
The one who's going to wipe out
the Zijin Hall is in that carriage.

34
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,184

(Jianqi Hall)

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll go.

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,039
Are you going to kill for me?

41
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,599
I'll try not to.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
Hu Qianshou won't keep his word.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
He won't detoxify me.

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,599
Chai Yu, think carefully.

45
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,479
There will be trouble
if that person comes out.

46
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,879
If the Three-Day Spiritbane
acts up again,

47
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,519
promise me...

48
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,040
(Jianqi Hall)

49
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,319
Promise to take me with you

50
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,600
and slowly remind me of everything.

51
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
I have no family

52
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,600
beyond my father in this world.

53
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,560
I will certainly remember you again.

54
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,759
After I deal with them,

55
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll make Hu Qianshou detoxify you.

56
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,199
Let me deal with you first.

57
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Bring my uncle here.

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
Understood.

59
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:35,760
Anyone else?

60
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,039
Let me do it.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Go.

62
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,600
Ask Qi Qing to bring Dan Min.

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,840
Understood.

64
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,679
Master Hu.

65
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,959
When does the toxin kick in today?

66
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,400
At the Wei Hour.

67
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,919
The Wei Hour.

68
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,560
It's almost time.

69
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,039
Master Chai

70
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Yunshui Manor is in peril.

71
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,800
Lord Chai,

72
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,439
do you intend to join the fight?

73
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,199
If you lose,

74
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,759
all is lost.

75
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,560
Who is this man?

76
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,199
Huang Yaoshi,

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
a reclusive master

78
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,399
who works for me now.

79
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
A reclusive master?

80
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,240
Just another hound on your leash.

81
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,439
Stop wasting your breath, Lord Chai.

82
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,600
Have you decided

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,360
to join our Salt Gang?

84
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,519
Does Chai Yu know about your dealings
with Hu Qianshou?

85
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Let's go.

86
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,079
Since you won't submit,

87
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,480
we have to eliminate

88
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,439
the Chai family today.

89
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,199
In peril?

90
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,160
How are we in peril?

91
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,560
I can't even drink in peace.

92
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,959
It won't be that easy.

93
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,959
Let's see if my elder gives consent.

94
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
Uncle.

95
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,000
You're back right when needed.

96
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,839
How are you in peril?

97
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm the one in peril.

98
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,879
Vast as the world is,

99
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,879
I have nowhere to go.

100
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Uncle, the Yunshui Manor
is in grave danger today.

101
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,639
Please intervene.

102
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,000
Otherwise,

103
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,519
our Chai family

104
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,480
will fall into the hands
of this disabled man.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
Is it fun?

106
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,879
Is it fun?

107
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,559
Look what I've become.

108
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,000
Did you think of some use for me?

109
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Speak.

110
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,320
Master Hu.

111
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,080
I won't fight him.

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,879
Why are you working for him now?

113
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,519
Mr. Chai.

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,480
Fate is unpredictable.

115
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,600
Uncle, please

116
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,360
teach him a lesson.

117
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,639
He could teach me a lesson.

118
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,920
And he did. That's why I came back.

119
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,480
Don't fight

120
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
if we can't win.

121
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,799
Just admit defeat.

122
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,159
Martial arts isn't about empty boasts.

123
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,720
The affairs of

124
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,919
the martial world never end.

125
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,960
Hu Qianshou.

126
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,759
What do you want?

127
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,840
Nothing really.

128
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,279
Lord Chai wanted to take me down first.

129
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,440
Thankfully, Huang Yaoshi stepped in.

130
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,759
I...

131
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,519
I merely suggested

132
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
that the Chai family join the Salt Gang

133
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
to spare me

134
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
perpetual fear

135
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,240
for the rest of my life.

136
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,120
Just join them.

137
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,639
Yunshui Manor
remains our property, right?

138
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,720
We'll unite against common enemies.

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,840
How could I covet your family property?

140
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,399
It's settled, Chai Yu.

141
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,240
Titles mean nothing.

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,519
Life goes on as usual.

143
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,639
Wine still flows freely.

144
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,000
That's good enough.

145
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
Lord Chai.

146
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,480
From now on,

147
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,039
the Chai family
will be a branch of the Salt Gang.

148
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,879
We swear an alliance with you

149
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,639
against Zijin Hall right here.

150
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,759
Master, here is Miss Dan.

151
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,000
Since my uncle said

152
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,720
that titles mean nothing,

153
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,719
well,

154
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,119
the Chai family

155
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,440
shall join your Salt Gang.

156
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,119
Master Hu.

157
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,559
Are you done with business here?

158
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,680
Almost.

159
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,200
This woman

160
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,600
is Dan Xingbian's younger sister,

161
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,759
Dan Min.

162
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,960
Tie Lin and Tie Mu died, trying to

163
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,440
bring her from Jiangling.

164
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
Master Hu.

165
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,639
To be honest,

166
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
I fear you'll break your word.

167
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,560
If your Salt Gang

168
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,720
allies with us against Zijin Hall,

169
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,559
you have to kill

170
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Dan Xingbian's sister

171
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,000
right this moment.

172
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,879
I am

173
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,639
a disabled man.

174
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,039
How do I kill her?

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,159
You don't have to do it.

176
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,679
Your gang members can do it for you.

177
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Why don't you kill her?

178
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
I brought her here.

179
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,480
Yunshui Manor

180
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,639
is my property.

181
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,840
Since we are

182
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,919
now allied,

183
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,840
must you force my hand again?

184
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,919
Petty schemers.

185
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,559
You're scared of my brother, after all.

186
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,999
Who dares to kill me?

187
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,759
Pu Yuan.

188
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,879
Lord Chai made a fair point.

189
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,639
Pu Yuan. Kill her.

190
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,639
Master Hu.

191
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,039
How meticulous you are.

192
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,799
Pu Yuan is your lapdog
planted in Zijin Hall.

193
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,360
If he kills Dan Min,

194
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,799
and Dan Xingbian seeks vengeance,

195
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,559
you can shirk responsibility.

196
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,519
We're leaving?

197
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,240
That young lady, Dan Min,

198
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,840
is the woman Mr. Ouyang loves.

199
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Take her with us.

200
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,159
What about you?

201
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,399
Want a weapon?

202
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,719
Pu Yuan.

203
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,000
Aren't you ashamed?

204
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,080
I have no choice.

205
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,080
Pu Yuan.

206
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,919
Today, either Miss Dan dies

207
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,879
or you die.

208
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,399
Prepare to die.

209
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,679
An intruder!

210
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,480
Who's next?

211
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,480
Carry him away.

212
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,479
Lord Chai.

213
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,480
Dan Min must die here today, right?

214
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:57,879
That's right.

215
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,920
Why?

216
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
She's just a girl.

217
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,280
Uncle.

218
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
You've been idling around.

219
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,960
When have you ever cared about us?

220
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,359
If you're stepping in,

221
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,440
why don't you kill Huang Yaoshi?

222
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,240
I've already lost one fighter.

223
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,720
It's your turn now.

224
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,199
It's only fair.

225
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:26,639
Who's next?

226
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,320
Qi Qing.

227
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,240
My lord.

228
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,839
Tie Lin and Tie Mu

229
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,599
died while pursuing her.

230
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,759
Escort Miss Dan on her final journey.

231
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,520
You wish.

232
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,919
Who are you?

233
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,480
Yaoshi.

234
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,000
Mr. Ouyang.

235
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,359
I wanted to wait outside Pengze.

236
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:15,959
I am truly sorry.

237
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,519
But I've decided to head straight

238
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,359
to Lin'an with Zhao.

239
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
Thank you for burying him.

240
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,359
Why are you here?

241
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,480
I thought I was late,

242
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,040
but I'm lucky.

243
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,320
She's Dan Min.

244
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,079
We're sworn companions.

245
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm taking her away.

246
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,319
So you're

247
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,119
Ouyang Feng?

248
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
That's me.

249
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,560
And you are?

250
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,640
Hu Qianshou of the Salt Gang.

251
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,680
And the man in the hall

252
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,759
is Lord Chai Yu.

253
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,680
Dan Min is going to die here today.

254
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
You're Yaoshi's friend.

255
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,279
You'd better not interfere.

256
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,200
I'm not a top martial artist

257
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,599
who can save Miss Dan.

258
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,880
I'll gladly die here with her.

259
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,439
Yaoshi.

260
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,599
What matters more?

261
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,920
Your friend or your woman?

262
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,599
Choose wisely.

263
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,000
I already promised you

264
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,079
to detoxify Miss Feng

265
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,599
before the Wei Hour.

266
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,880
But if you intervene

267
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,559
and let Miss Dan get away,

268
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,680
Miss Feng

269
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,119
will become a walking corpse.

270
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,839
Is she in the carriage?

271
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,520
Yes.

272
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,199
Still troubled?

273
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:24,959
Yes.

274
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,200
Isn't Miss Feng nice?

275
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,520
I've made up my mind

276
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,520
about her.

277
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,040
Good.

278
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,519
You should thank me.

279
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,560
Of course.

280
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:41,880
My resolve is firm.

281
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,839
Let the two of us

282
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,920
handle it ourselves.

283
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,079
I'm a mediocre martial artist

284
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,399
who may die here.

285
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,440
I'll never repay the debt

286
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,919
if I cause trouble

287
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,640
for my friend.

288
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,400
Yaoshi, please understand that.

289
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,240
What are you waiting for?

290
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,040
Qi Qing.

291
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,599
Will you die for her?

292
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,000
Will you die for your friend?

293
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,199
My lord.

294
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,559
I'm no match for them.

295
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,760
Qi Qing.

296
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,079
You're a top fighter of the Chai family.

297
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,200
Yet you lost to two juniors?

298
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,000
Can you take the humiliation?

299
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,560
Don't hold back.

300
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,000
Kill Dan Min.

301
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,040
Kill Dan Min.

302
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,759
I'm no match for them.

303
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,799
It's true humiliation

304
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,720
if I keep fighting.

305
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,799
So what if he's holding back?

306
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,520
Mr. Chai.

307
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,799
You don't get to

308
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,200
lecture anyone from my family.

309
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,559
Master Hu, it's your turn now.

310
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,000
Am I not pretty anymore?

311
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
Nonsense.

312
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,920
I don't care. You're my friend.

313
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,320
Today is

314
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,799
the happiest day of my life.

315
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,480
You're happy, but I'm not.

316
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,040
I'm cornered.

317
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,839
I thought about it.

318
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,439
From now on,

319
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,039
I'll be a laughingstock.

320
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,319
That's why I came here.

321
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,559
I'm doing this for myself,

322
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,119
not for you.

323
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:00,919
Don't overthink it.

324
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,760
Alright.

325
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,639
Fight for yourself.

326
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,680
I'll fight for myself.

327
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:17,879
Who's next?

328
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,000
Go.

329
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,200
Mr. Chai.

330
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:04,359
You still owe Yaoshi a favor.

331
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,200
What does he want? Speak.

332
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,960
Your friend's life is at stake.

333
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,359
Yet you remain silent?

334
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,920
Mr. Chai, please help

335
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,279
Ouyang Feng...

336
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,080
Are you alright?

337
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,199
That's it.

338
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,200
Whoever makes a move

339
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,119
will answer to me.

340
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,680
Yaoshi.

341
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
Kill Dan Min

342
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,920
and your friend.

343
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,639
Yaoshi.

344
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,319
Do you know how I feel

345
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,079
to see you betray yourself?

346
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,759
You know that life's too uncertain

347
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,599
to measure.

348
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,560
Life is worthless

349
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,839
when we act against our will.

350
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,440
But a heart-led life

351
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,440
leaves no room

352
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,279
for deathbed regrets.

353
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,000
But I can't bear to let you go.

354
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,520
Neither can I

355
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,400
let you go.

356
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,759
But what Hu Qianshou demands of you

357
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,440
is against our will.

358
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,079
It's almost the Wei Hour.

359
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,839
You'd better hurry.

360
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,840
Chai Yu.

361
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,879
At this point,

362
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,880
we're sworn enemies with Zijin Hall.

363
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,759
If we don't join hands,

364
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,119
one day,

365
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,039
Dan Xingbian will kill us all.

366
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,399
Uncle.

367
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,880
We share the same bloodline.

368
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,480
Don't ruin the future

369
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,960
of the entire clan.

370
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,439
Stand aside.

371
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,720
The rain is pouring.

372
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,720
The sun's completely obscured.

373
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,400
It's the Wei Hour.

The antidote.

403
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,039
Spare me.

404
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,079
Huang Yaoshi.

405
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,799
Kill them!

406
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,319
The Salt Gang's cause will triumph.

407
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,720
It will triumph.

408
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,519
The Salt Gang's cause will triumph.

409
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Baili, my son.

410
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,720
Baili, my son.

411
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,839
I've avenged you.

412
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,000
The murder who killed you

413
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,039
is devastated now.

414
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,839
I won't fight you.

415
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:46,919
Step aside.

416
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,760
Leave.

417
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,839
Take your friend.

418
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,240
Master.

419
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,400
- We took revenge.
- Master.

420
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,440
Our vengeance is done.

421
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
Father.

422
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,519
Seventeen.

423
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,760
Master.

424
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,679
Come on.

425
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,119
Let's go.

426
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,079
Hu Qianshou is your enemy.

427
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,279
He's already left.

428
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,280
That person

429
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,400
killed my friend's love.

430
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm from the Chai family.

431
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,079
Kill me first

432
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,000
if you have to kill them.

433
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:07,879
Yaoshi.

434
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,079
Miss Feng is still lying in the rain.

435
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,440
Go on.

436
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,920
I don't want to return to Lin'an.

437
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,960
Just bury me.

438
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,199
Alright?

439
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,519
My friend.

440
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,079
Alright.

441
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,440
I-I buried you once before.

442
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,760
Now we're even.

443
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,039
Help me with something.

444
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,199
I only have

445
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:31,919
my brother

446
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,480
Dan Xingbian left in this world.

447
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,639
He knew I was kidnapped
to Yunshui Manor,

448
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,920
but he didn't come to save me.

449
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,800
Go to Lin'an and ask him

450
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,800
why...

451
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,960
why...?

452
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:14,263
(Dan Min's grave)

453
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:21,051
(Dan Min's grave)

454
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:30,208
(Dan Min's grave)

455
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:33,999
I didn't expect

456
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,400
that our friendship would end so soon.

457
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,480
When we first met,

458
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,960
I thought I was a decent martial artist.

459
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,984
But I couldn't even protect you.

460
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,480
If I survive my trip to Lin'an,

461
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,800
I'll visit you.

462
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:56,544
(Dan Min)

463
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,760
Mr. Ouyang.

464
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,519
What a pity.

465
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,280
I made two friends in the South.

466
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,176
Both friendships ended.

467
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:03,999
Give me the luggage.

468
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,240
Where are you going?

469
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,639
I must become stronger than you.

470
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,239
That's my ultimate goal.

471
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,239
But right now,

472
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,000
I must find Dan Xingbian in Lin'an.

473
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,800
He didn't come to save his sister.

474
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,840
He should at least kneel at her grave.

475
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,168
If he still doesn't come,

476
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,639
even if I die by his hand...

477
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,719
If I die by his hand,

478
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,720
that's the end.

479
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,519
Give me the luggage.

480
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,480
You've only seen

481
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,679
parts of our martial world.

482
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,960
Dan Xingbian

483
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,559
is said to be

484
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,440
far more skilled than Chai Qiong.

485
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,439
Doesn't matter.

486
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,159
At worst, I die.

487
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,960
My friend Dan Min

488
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,880
asked me to do this.

489
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,080
Do you need me to do something?

490
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,039
I'll go to Lin'an

491
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:18,919
with you,

492
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,696
find the person in the painting,

493
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,360
and escort you back.

494
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,159
Is Miss Feng coming too?

495
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:29,959
I'm not

496
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,199
even sure if Miss Feng

497
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,320
will wake up.

498
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,639
Even if she wakes up,

499
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,280
she won't recognize me.

500
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,880
To be honest,

501
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,719
I'm mad at you.

502
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,800
But I would have prioritized

503
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,320
Miss Feng if I were you.

504
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,760
That's how one treats
the person they care about.

505
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,280
Brothers.

506
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,640
Friends.

507
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,119
Mundane affairs.

508
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,800
Nothing matters as much as love.

509
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,679
So I totally get it.

510
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,400
This is Persian Mirage.

511
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,679
The Herb grows
at the Sulaiman Pass of Persia.

512
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,239
Poison in the leaves.

513
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,559
Cure in the stems.

514
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,079
Persians grind the leaves
to make incense

515
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,320
to disorient prey animals.

516
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,679
Humans faint after inhaling it,

517
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:47,519
but they wake up

518
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,719
once you burn the stems.

519
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,320
How do you know this?

520
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,776
Baituo Manor specializes in poisons

521
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,760
and is one hill away from Persia.

522
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:06,320
My mother took me to Persia many times

523
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,920
when I was young.

524
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,440
Stay with her for an hour.

525
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,320
Once she wakes up,

526
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,320
everything starts anew.

527
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,639
Close all the carriage windows.

528
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,776
That was the only stem.

529
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,559
Don't let the smoke dissipate.

530
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,720
Where are we going?

531
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:50,959
Yaoshi?

532
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,160
Where are we going?

533
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,200
To Lin'an.

534
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:06,959
