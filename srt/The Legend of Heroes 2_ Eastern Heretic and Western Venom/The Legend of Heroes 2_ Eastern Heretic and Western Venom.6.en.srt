1
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,400
Young Master.

2
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,879
Lie was killed by Pan Jie.

3
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,000
But I didn't kill Pan Jie.

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,840
It's him who did it.

5
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,760
Do you believe me?

6
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,159
I'll kill them all for you.

7
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,159
Killing him alone is enough.

8
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,079
During the journey

9
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,999
to Lin'an,

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
don't

11
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,719
think about it.

12
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,120
Elder Fu is in Pengze.

13
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,159
Let's go.

14
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
Let's go.

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Let's go.

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,360
Liu Fang!

17
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,223
(The Legend of Heroes)

18
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:32,191
=Duel on Mount Hua=

19
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:34,207
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel,
The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

20
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,247
=Eastern Heretic and Western Venom=
=Episode 6=

21
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,319
You were captured by them,

22
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,920
then where is Pan Jie?

23
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:42,639
My kidnappers were

24
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,480
Tie Mu and Tie Lin.

25
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,759
Your brother Tie Mu?

26
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,399
Stop pretending

27
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,400
and buying time.

28
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,720
Waiting for the helper?

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
Answer me.

30
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
Never!

31
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
Anyway, Lord Chai

32
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,760
wants to declare war.

33
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,399
You met me and Qi Qing,

34
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,079
meaning the end of you.

35
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,160
Don't damage my hat.

36
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,439
Take Dan Min away!

37
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,560
None of you can leave!

38
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,799
Min.

39
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,640
Pick up the hat.

40
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
Don't damage it.

41
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,839
You still care about hats?

42
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,120
We'll put one on you after you die.

43
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,480
Let's see who dies first.

44
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,160
Qi Qing, why didn't you kill her?

45
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,359
Let go of Tie!

46
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,679
What?

47
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,920
So you can double-team me again?

48
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,759
If I exert internal strength, he'll die.

49
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,040
Let's talk it over.

50
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,639
Don't hurt Tie.

51
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
Fine.

52
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,639
Let's talk about
the Chai family and Zijin Hall.

53
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,279
We coexisted peacefully
for more than a decade.

54
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,920
Why captured Min to Yunshui Manor

55
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,320
this time?

56
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,279
Ms. Fu.

57
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,360
Kill him first!

58
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,720
Don't be that brutal.

59
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,240
Men dislike it.

60
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,560
After making it clear,

61
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,279
I'll ask about your Ouyang Feng.

62
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,879
Here.

63
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,600
Pengze County was flooded last month.

64
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,559
We chose to stay here

65
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,639
because it's deserted and quiet.

66
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Later,

67
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,759
have someone bring Yaoshi

68
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
a clean pair of shoes.

69
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,960
Thank you, Master Hu.

70
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,120
Miss Feng started cooking
and warming wine

71
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,519
inside

72
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,240
when she heard you were coming.

73
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,000
Seeing you like this

74
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,879
reassures me.

75
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
What do you mean?

76
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,279
You carry Miss Feng

77
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,679
in your heart.

78
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
If you decide to take her away,

79
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,720
you'll definitely
stay together till death.

80
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,879
Till death?

81
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,440
All people will die.

82
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,200
While we breathe,

83
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,120
treat each other kindly.

84
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,279
Thank you, Master Hu.

85
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,080
Lord Chai wants you dead.

86
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,679
If we take Dan Min to Yunshui Manor,

87
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,919
Zijin Hall's five crafts
and eight trades,

88
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,639
and Dan Xingbian would come

89
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,799
to meet their doom.

90
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
Don't hurt Tie!

91
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,200
Zijin Hall's five crafts

92
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,159
never take lives

93
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,440
unless it's necessary.

94
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,200
If he can't explain,

95
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,359
then you'd do it.

96
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,519
Lord Chai scheduled

97
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,120
a meeting with Dan Xingbian

98
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,600
at Yunshui Manor,

99
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
intended for a battle.

100
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,320
We captured Miss Dan

101
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,799
to threaten Zijin Hall's

102
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,799
five crafts and eight trades

103
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,759
to come to Yunshui Manor in advance.

104
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,279
On the meeting,

105
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,000
we'll kill Master Dan.

106
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,120
Why would Lord Chai do so?

107
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,639
Miss Dan is Master Dan's sister.

108
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,279
The treasured jewel

109
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,639
of government and martial world.

110
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,160
With her,

111
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,399
Zijin Hall

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,879
will naturally surrender.

113
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,000
Now let's talk about

114
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,960
why you showed mercy

115
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,919
to me earlier.

116
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,639
I didn't.

117
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,679
If you hadn't held back,

118
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
how could I have subdued Tie Lin?

119
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,120
Chai family has six masters.

120
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,679
Even one could overwhelm me.

121
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,200
Forgive me

122
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,599
for wearing

123
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,879
dirty shoes.

124
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,359
It's okay.

125
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
It's not okay.

126
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,879
Master Hu said

127
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,919
he'll fetch me new shoes later.

128
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,480
Try some.

129
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,799
Though the Salt Gang has flaws,

130
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,840
the travel provisions

131
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,840
are fully stocked.

132
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,879
I'll only stay for a while.

133
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Mr. Ouyang

134
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,840
is waiting for me.

135
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,159
Just taste one dish.

136
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,360
Take one sip of wine.

137
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,360
I especially asked them

138
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,559
to prepare this for you.

139
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,719
How is it?

140
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,680
Excellent.

141
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,240
It's the 18-year-old Nu'er Hong wine.

142
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,159
Pour the boiling water

143
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,320
into a cool pot
for a quarter of an hour.

144
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,039
Then put the wine flask inside

145
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,240
and drink after a while.

146
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,799
The aroma peaks then.

147
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
Learned it from books?

148
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,159
I used to warm wine for my father,

149
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,560
and he preferred it.

150
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,440
But the flasks here

151
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,280
are large,

152
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,320
so the aroma weakens a bit.

153
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
Your father was fortunate.

154
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,480
I was the fortunate one.

155
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,639
Pity he was killed by Hu Qianshou.

156
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,519
Pu Yuan.

157
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,080
Did you kill Pan?

158
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,000
You believe that Westerner's

159
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,240
words?

160
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,559
A dying man's words.

161
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,159
Why shouldn't I believe?

162
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
Yu Dian.

163
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,559
Let's find Elder Fu first.

164
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,320
Where's the tailor shop

165
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,360
in Pengze County?

166
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,320
Did you poison him

167
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,160
with the Chai family?

168
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,639
Westerners did all this.

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,159
Why would Ouyang Feng

170
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,999
do such things?

171
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,399
He just killed Liu Fang and Tang Long.

172
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,600
Only you and I remain

173
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,639
among Zijin Hall's

174
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,840
eight trades.

175
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,239
He's here.

176
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,999
It

177
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
really was you.

178
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,559
Why, Pu Yuan?

179
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,759
Men die for wealth,

180
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,840
and birds perish for food.

181
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,200
I just want

182
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,040
a better life.

183
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,879
I want to return to Lin'an.

184
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,679
Forgive me, Yu Dian.

185
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,399
Who's there?

186
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,480
Who's there?

187
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,320
Murder!

188
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
Stop!

189
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,639
You play the xiao flute?

190
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,920
I do.

191
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,519
Would you play me a tune

192
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,759
before leaving?

193
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,240
Okay.

194
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Take off your shoes.

195
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,359
I'll clean them for you.

196
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,400
Don't take Hu Qianshou's shoes.

197
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,679
It's improper.

198
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,159
Hu Qianshou

199
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,319
isn't that kind.

200
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,320
I mean,

201
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,519
taking off the shoes.

202
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,279
When I fell off the cliff

203
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,240
and first met you,

204
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,599
you realigned all my bones.

205
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,720
What's there to mind?

206
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
That's to thank you for saving me.

207
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,559
I saved you?

208
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,480
At the Eagle's Nest,

209
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,720
(that was the final moment)

210
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,560
(of my cultivation.)

211
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,680
(Any ordinary villain)

212
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,519
(could have taken my life.)

213
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,199
(Yet you)

214
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,359
(chose to fall off the cliff)

215
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,439
to save me.

216
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Who are you?

217
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,480
Where did you come from?

218
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,639
Get lost!

219
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,759
Don't you know who I am?

220
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,240
I don't care.

221
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,439
Why are you here?

222
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,599
Get lost!

223
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,759
I'm here to fight.

224
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't move.

225
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Kids, don't move.

226
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,359
It's dangerous.

227
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,480
That's Mr. Chai.

228
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,680
You can't deal with him.

229
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,359
Hu Qianshou?

230
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,599
Let go!

231
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,160
Let go!

232
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,279
Why are you here?

233
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,279
I need to go to

234
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,839
your Yunshui Manor.

235
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,880
Yunshui Manor isn't mine.

236
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,640
Your Cuihua House

237
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,680
is mine.

238
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,640
Then why

239
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,279
are you here?

240
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,079
Is Huang Yaoshi here?

241
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,280
Where is he?

242
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,400
I came to fight him.

243
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,200
When did you

244
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,359
have a grudge against Huang Yaoshi?

245
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,039
Cut the nonsense!

246
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,199
Where is he?

247
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,040
In there.

248
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:38,919
But

249
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,119
don't disturb him!

250
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,759
So what if I do?

251
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,840
This way please.

252
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,080
Please.

253
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,759
Huang Yaoshi, I finally caught...

254
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,599
He's here for you?

255
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,879
Yes.

256
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,680
She's Miss Feng, Feng Heng.

257
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,159
He's Mr. Chai.

258
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,720
Well...

259
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,240
What are you doing?

260
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,159
Cleaning my shoes.

261
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,039
And I'll play the xiao flute for her.

262
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,799
Let's settle matters between us.

263
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
In here or outside?

264
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,000
Explain yourself.

265
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,680
Let go of Tie.

266
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,400
You can take

267
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,799
Miss Dan.

268
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,639
No way.

269
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,000
Lord Chai is my patron.

270
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,279
And Salt Gang's Gang Leader

271
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,559
is my financier.

272
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
By Lord Chai's order,

273
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,959
Dan Min

274
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,119
must be taken to Yunshui Manor.

275
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,720
Master Hu

276
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,759
feared Zijin Hall's growing power will

277
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
beat the Chai family.

278
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,559
The Salt Gang wants Zijin Hall

279
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,240
and the Chai family
to destroy each other.

280
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,000
From then on,

281
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,720
the Salt Gang will dominate.

282
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,959
Qi Qing.

283
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,200
Are you helping the Salt Gang

284
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,960
and let the Chai family die

285
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,079
by Zijin Hall's hands?

286
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,039
I'm telling you this,

287
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,200
making me ashamed to face

288
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,119
Lord Chai again.

289
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,559
Do it!

290
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,800
I know

291
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,039
coercion is wrong,

292
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,279
And I hate doing this.

293
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Make your demands.

294
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,920
Anything works.

295
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,880
But I'm coming from Jiangling,

296
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,480
so this fight must happen!

297
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,759
Mr. Chai,

298
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,119
your skills surpass mine.

299
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,400
I surrender, okay?

300
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,160
It doesn't count.

301
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,240
But I don't even have shoes.

302
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,559
If I return it,

303
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,279
with shoes, you'll run away.

304
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,200
My agility isn't as good as yours.

305
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,559
But it doesn't apply to other things.

306
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,240
Anything

307
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,520
works?

308
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,320
Of course.

309
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,599
Then one request.

310
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,520
Say it.

311
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,480
Not now.

312
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,440
When he names one,

313
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
you must fulfill it.

314
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,240
Huang Yaoshi.

315
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,640
Does she speak for you?

316
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,079
Yes.

317
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,079
Good! I agree.

318
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,160
Now give me the shoe first, okay?

319
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,720
Thank you, Mr. Chai.

320
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,160
This is serious.

321
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,559
Don't hold back.

322
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,240
How about this?

323
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,880
I'll play a tune.

324
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,079
If you

325
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,839
can withstand it,

326
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,359
I lose.

327
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,599
What do you mean?

328
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,680
Internal strength fuels my tune.

329
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
The stronger you are,

330
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
the greater the impact.

331
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,319
But those with no martial skills

332
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
remain unaffected

333
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,639
and only hear

334
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
the exquisite melody.

335
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,359
Without physical combat,

336
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,640
you want to defeat me

337
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,920
with the flute melody?

338
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,199
Actually,

339
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,079
she wants to hear it.

340
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,344
(Tailor Shop)

341
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:56,966
Whoa.

342
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,119
Tie Mu.

343
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,959
Save me!

344
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,920
Why didn't you kill Ouyang Feng?

345
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
I'll kill you!

346
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,912
(Tailor Shop)

347
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:41,536
(Tailor Shop)

348
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Min, let's go.

349
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
Tie Mu.

350
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Where's Miss Dan?

351
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,880
Fu Ruoqing?

352
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,480
Ouyang Feng.

353
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,240
Take them away.

354
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,159
Let's go, Miss.

355
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,480
Who's the xiao flute master here?

356
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,759
Ms. Fu, he's Ouyang Feng.

357
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,599
The melody is beautiful.

358
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:48,879
What's its name?

359
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,440
Melody of Bihai.

360
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,559
Are the new shoes ready?

361
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
The shoes are cleaned.

362
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:06,920
Perfect.

363
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,759
If it's possible,

364
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,960
I'll make you a pair

365
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,839
that fits better.

366
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,680
I can make clothes too.

367
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,599
Luckily, I listened to Mr. Ouyang

368
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,080
and came for you.

369
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,119
If I miss this,

370
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,039
I would regret for years.

371
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,640
Actually, I should've taken you
with me long ago.

372
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,759
You said to only stay for a while.

373
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,640
Mr. Ouyang is waiting for you.

374
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:42,919
Yes.

375
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:45,919
Not wearing them?

376
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,200
Enough!

377
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:56,960
The world

378
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,440
has such masters!

379
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,920
I was being too arrogant

380
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,960
for decades!

381
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,400
Tell me what you want me to do.

382
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,559
I have nothing

383
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,199
for you to do.

384
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,679
Name one!

385
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,920
Or I won't be at peace.

386
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,239
If I have to name one,

387
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,760
then please

388
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,360
return to Jiangling

389
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,479
Cuihua House

390
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,159
and have fun as you did before.

391
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,000
It doesn't count.

392
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,079
I still owe you.

393
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,400
I can't return to Cuihua House anymore.

394
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,880
In this vast world,

395
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,480
I am

396
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,920
just a joke.

397
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:43,920
Move!

398
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,840
Move!

399
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,840
So infuriating.

400
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:15,919
Tie!

401
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,920
Lord Chai treated me nicely.

402
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,320
Come on.

403
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,519
Go capture Dan Min

404
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,679
and Elder Fu!

405
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,119
Hu Qianshou paid so much

406
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,440
that no one can reject.

407
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,200
Chase them!

408
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:36,719
Tie.

409
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,559
Let's talk later.

410
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,320
Go.

411
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,720
When you return,

412
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
I'll be dead then.

413
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,840
Have you

414
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,840
fought?

415
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
With internal strength.

416
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,199
I heard your flute playing.

417
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,360
Forgive me.

418
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Without martial skills,

419
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
it's just a melody.

420
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,760
The stronger the internal strength,
the bigger the impact.

421
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,719
It's okay for you.

422
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,239
I'm disabled.

423
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,159
But it works out.

424
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,840
I can fully appreciate your music.

425
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,800
You may go.

426
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,320
I have new shoes for you.

427
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,720
No need.

428
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,239
Miss Feng

429
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,360
has already cleaned them.

430
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,960
I prefer these.

431
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,880
Then as you please.

432
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Good.

433
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,360
Very good.

434
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,679
Seeing you two grow closer,

435
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,239
I couldn't be happier.

436
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,360
What exactly do you want?

437
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,840
From what I understand,

438
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,679
no one in Chai family

439
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,119
surpasses Chai Qiong.

440
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,199
Huang Yaoshi defeated him

441
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,760
with only flute melodies.

442
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,800
His martial skills are
way beyond my expectations.

443
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,800
When he returns,

444
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,119
I'll tell him.

445
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,559
About what?

446
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,720
What

447
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,920
kind of person you are.

448
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,519
Go ahead.

449
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,760
Better tell him soon.

450
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,719
Mr. Ouyang.

451
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,320
My brother!

452
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:18,999
Brother!

453
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,120
Brother!

454
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,039
Who killed him?

455
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,439
Fu Ruoqing.

456
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,079
We brought Dan Min here,

457
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,960
never expecting Elder Fu present.

458
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,880
How could the two of you

459
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,559
lose to Elder Fu?

460
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,199
Explain this, Qi Qing.

461
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,719
She took my palm strike, then ran

462
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,880
with Ouyang Feng

463
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,720
and Dan Min.

464
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:58,919
Chase them!

465
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,240
Kill them all!

466
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,480
- Yes!
- Yes!

467
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,960
Who's there? Go away!

468
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,079
Zijin Hall's trade,

469
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,760
Oil Artisan Pu Yuan.

470
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:47,879
Gang Leader.

471
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,920
He's from Zijin Hall.

472
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,280
Master Hu.

473
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:58,599
Why are you here?

474
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,120
All of you may go.

475
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,760
Yes!

476
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,079
Go away.

477
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,559
Go ahead.

478
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:27,999
Someone in there.

479
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,039
Don't mind it.

480
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,360
I can't return to Lin'an.

481
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,800
Why?

482
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,239
Among eight trades,

483
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,719
except Xiang Hang

484
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:38,559
in Quanzhou,

485
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,519
only Yu Dian and I remain.

486
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,719
I eliminated Pan Jie.

487
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,280
He was Master Dan's

488
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,679
disciple of Xixing Palm.

489
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,599
Half the reputation of eight trades

490
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,719
came from Pan.

491
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,320
You killed Pan Jie,

492
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,480
and your skills must be decent.

493
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,360
Just fortunate timing.

494
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,359
However,

495
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,239
those two Westerners saw me.

496
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,280
We chased them here.

497
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,280
Westerners

498
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,639
killed Tang Long

499
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,920
and Liu Fang outside the city.

500
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,280
I wanted

501
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,199
to kill Yu Dian,

502
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,519
but the Westerner intervened

503
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,519
and saved her.

504
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,800
That Westerner

505
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,360
is Ouyang Feng, right?

506
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,920
You are wise.

507
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,800
Where's Ouyang Feng now?

508
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,760
One of Ouyang Feng's men died

509
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,159
outside the county.

510
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,599
He chased me all the way here.

511
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:39,639
We met Tie Mu and fought again.

512
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,919
Tie Mu

513
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,320
should've finished him off,

514
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,320
but Ouyang Feng was lucky

515
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,760
and made it here.

516
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:50,079
Ouyang Feng is an outsider.

517
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,920
Why does he prevent you
from returning to Lin'an?

518
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,039
I failed to kill Yu Dian

519
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,679
and had no way out.

520
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,120
I want to stay here

521
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,239
to serve you.

522
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:03,840
You took my money

523
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,440
just to live

524
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:07,719
a comfortable life, right?

525
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,199
Life matters most.

526
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
When you succeed in eliminating

527
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,119
the Chai family and Zijin Hall,
dominating the martial world,

528
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,559
then I can return to Lin'an
and enjoy my life.

529
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,920
Your position in Zijin Hall could be useful.

530
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,559
What a pity.

531
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,079
Please take me in.

532
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:34,039
Seventeen.

533
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:35,919
From now on,

534
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,840
he'll follow your orders.

535
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,160
Yes.

536
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:43,959
Come with me.

537
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Move!

538
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:48,519
