1
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,879
I was already leaving.

2
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,519
I returned to tell you one thing.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,840
Tomorrow,

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,079
Master Hu will pick you up.

5
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,640
He'll go to Jiangzhou.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,040
I'll follow him

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,040
behind.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,400
When it's convenient,

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,160
I'll talk to you.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,600
At your convenience...

11
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:48,959
Got it.

12
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,639
The candle's lit.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,200
I help you put it out?

14
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,519
Thank you.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Master Hu.

16
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,920
Have you decided?

17
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,199
Tomorrow,

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
I'll go with you.

19
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,680
Mr. Ouyang and I happen to

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
be heading to Lin'an too.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,599
Three horses await outside

22
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,319
for you and your companion.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,159
I don't know

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,599
how I can thank you.

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,239
If possible,

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,599
could you examine my crippled legs

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,359
and see if you can treat them?

28
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,199
Okay.

29
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,239
Where's your injury?

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,239
The spine in my back.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,920
I had a fight in my youth.

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
It's an old injury.

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
It's been 18 years.

34
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,359
Too late.

35
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,044
(The Legend of Heroes)

36
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,012
=Duel on Mount Hua=

37
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:26,028
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel,
The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

38
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:29,068
=Eastern Heretic and Western Venom=
=Episode 5=

39
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,759
You practiced martial arts,

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,319
unlike Feng Heng,

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
an ordinary person.

42
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,280
When she was injured,

43
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,199
she happened to meet me.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,599
I'm also lucky

45
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,840
to meet you now.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,240
However,

47
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,759
every three days,

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,319
bonesetting once.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,879
After two bonesettings,

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,240
take one Ninefold Yin Pill.

51
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,559
Seven cycles.

52
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,560
After 21 days,

53
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,719
take another pill.

54
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,280
Then you will walk normally.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
However,

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,039
you can't use martial arts.

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,680
Can I

58
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,280
have the Ninefold Yin Pill now?

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
This pill

60
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
regenerates bones and tissues,

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,879
but carries toxicity.

62
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll risk anything

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,839
for normal legs.

64
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,679
I'm not refusing you.

65
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,920
You have to take it

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,160
after six days

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,520
and two treatments.

68
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,319
Give it to me now.

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,759
Thanks.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Thanks.

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,519
Baili.

72
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,319
I met Huang Yaoshi by lucky chance.

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,800
After my crippled legs are cured,

74
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,079
I will destroy him.

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
I saved your life.

76
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,919
You're welcome.

77
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,040
Why did you save me then?

78
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,879
Someone injured you

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,152
with the Primordial Celestial Qi Art
of the Chai family.

80
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm making it up to you

81
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,959
on their behalf.

82
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,160
Not because you're virtuous.

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
You're not good.

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,280
Ouyang Feng is better than you.

85
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,039
Young Master.

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
Young Master.

87
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,000
He'll be fine.

88
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,399
He'll awaken in an hour.

89
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,240
Splash water on his face to wake him.

90
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Then why not do it?

91
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,640
Asking me?

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
Why should I fetch water?

93
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,399
I'm staying here

94
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,519
for you two.

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,560
Your physique is good.

96
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,160
An average martial artist

97
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,480
needs two hours to clear the poison.

98
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,399
You woke up earlier

99
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,359
than I estimated.

100
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,439
Why are you here?

101
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
The gold.

102
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,920
Huang Yaoshi not only recovered the gold

103
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,199
but asked me to deliver it personally.

104
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,480
Though two ingots are mine.

105
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
I've had them.

106
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,279
When I arrived,

107
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,720
I saw Tie Mu trying to kill you.

108
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,919
I drove him away.

109
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,919
Tie Mu?

110
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,439
You should thank me.

111
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Thank you.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
Not sincere enough.

113
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,240
Thank you so much, Mr. Chai.

114
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,639
Don't I keep my word?

115
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,879
It's pretty fair.

116
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
I made you kowtow for a reason.

117
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,800
I made you thank me for a reason.

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,560
Your martial arts reign supreme.

119
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
You can act as you please.

120
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,199
I'm a top martial artist
only in Cuihua House,

121
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,080
Jiangling,

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
not in the whole world.

123
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,199
Your friend Huang Yaoshi

124
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,959
might be better than me.

125
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Yaoshi?

126
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,200
Impossible.

127
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,159
A top-tier master

128
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,600
did a telekinetic trick and cheated.

129
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,320
But it's fine.

130
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,519
I'll wait here for him.

131
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,600
How many top masters like you
does the South have?

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,000
The Song.

133
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,719
Alright.

134
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,759
Few top masters exist.

135
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
But now, Huang Yaoshi joins the ranks.

136
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
How dare you remain here!

137
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,399
He killed Pan Jie.

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
Why bother?

139
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
The knife on Pan

140
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
is yours!

141
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,080
Never thought you'd deny even this.

142
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,879
You also killed Nianyu

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,879
and Bidao.

144
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,240
Slanderous lies!

145
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,559
Pan was a top martial artist.

146
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,159
Even Lie can't defeat him

147
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,999
on his own.

148
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,399
How could I kill him?

149
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,320
Since Lie died

150
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,600
by my Pan's hand,

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,559
you murdered him in revenge.

152
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,360
Shamelessly,

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
you call him Pan.

154
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,879
As a guy from Western Regions,

155
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,279
you're so unreasonable.

156
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,879
You murdered Pan.

157
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,000
But when confronted,

158
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,279
you wept?

159
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,399
It's time to kill you

160
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,600
and avenge Pan's death.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,840
Prepare to die!

162
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,960
How stupid you are!

163
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
There's a traitor among you,

164
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,279
yet you help him?

165
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,600
He poisoned the food!

166
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,480
What a silver-tongued guy!

167
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,639
Shut your mouth!

168
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,999
Where's Dan Min?

169
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
The Chai family abducted her.

170
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:19,999
We couldn't catch up.

171
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,000
Then why return?

172
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
He murdered Pan!

173
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,399
You colluded with the Chai family

174
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
to poison the food

175
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,840
and incapacitate Dan Min,

176
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
so Tie Lin and Tie Mu

177
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,519
could abduct her.

178
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
I was poisoned too.

179
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
You're pretending.

180
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,679
Look at you now.

181
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,519
You look fine.

182
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:39,279
Nonsense!

183
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,080
You suggested poisoning the food.

184
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,519
You told Tie Mu

185
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,000
to silence my master and me.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,919
Tie Mu is a top-grade expert.

187
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,639
If he wants you dead,

188
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,416
will you be standing here alive?

189
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,496
If I hadn't been poisoned,

190
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,039
Tie Mu couldn't have fought me.

191
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,799
Who poisons themselves

192
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,136
while waiting for killers?

193
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,639
You're in league with the Chai family!

194
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
Mr. Chai came to deliver the gold

195
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,399
and drove away Tie Mu.

196
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
Who?

197
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840
The martial world

198
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,039
is quite lively, isn't it?

199
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,679
What are you?

200
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,360
You greasy runt!

201
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,879
Mind your tongue!

202
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,360
Asking for a beating.

203
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,080
Old man, I'll deal with you first.

204
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,879
Are you Mr. Chai?

205
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,759
Why?

206
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,440
I guess you're Chai Qiong.

207
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,960
I'm Tang Long.

208
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,440
12 years ago,

209
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,320
I once met you.

210
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,639
I spend every day at Cuihua House.

211
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,960
No need to talk about history.

212
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Mr. Chai.

213
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,072
Tie Mu is from the Chai family.

214
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,559
When he tried to kill Ouyang Feng,

215
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,440
why did you save him?

216
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,559
Who said I saved him?

217
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,879
You're spouting nonsense!

218
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,200
I don't care about the Chai family.

219
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,720
I hate matters

220
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,519
of the martial world.

221
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm here to repay gambling debts.

222
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,800
I just arrived.

223
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,799
How should I know what

224
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,639
you're talking about?

225
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,119
Did you hear that?

226
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,160
Clearly,

227
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,040
these two Westerners

228
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,279
just lied.

229
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
Kill them

230
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,840
to avenge Miss and Pan!

231
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,000
Given your rudeness,

232
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
I gave you three slaps.

233
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,080
Do two more yourself.

234
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,519
What insolence!

235
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,320
Attack them together!

236
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,559
Let us

237
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,480
kill the three of them.

238
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm not afraid of fighting.

239
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,720
But let's make it clear first.

240
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
I have nothing to do

241
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
with the Chai family

242
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
or Zijin Hall.

243
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:40,919
I'm on my way

244
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,840
to Lin'an.

245
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,399
Stop pestering me.

246
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,952
Finding Dan Min should be your priority.

247
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
Fight!

248
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,399
Bring it on!

249
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,399
We'll follow your advice.

250
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
But if we

251
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,799
have questions again,

252
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
we'll come back to you.

253
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
Are you kidding?

254
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,239
Let's settle it...

255
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,080
Do you want to leave?

256
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,159
I've been trying to suppress my anger

257
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
all night long.

258
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,120
Whoever bears my anger

259
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,000
will be unlucky.

260
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,519
From now on,

261
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,688
we'll head straight to Lin'an.

262
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:19,999
Focus on traveling.

263
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,600
No provocations, no meddling.

264
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,359
Young Master.

265
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,320
We're never afraid.

266
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Just kill those

267
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,679
who provoke us.

268
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,639
I'm not afraid.

269
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,559
But meeting Miss Liu Rusi in Lin'an

270
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,679
and returning home matter.

271
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,599
Lie died for nothing.

272
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,600
The killer died too.

273
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,399
And I'm not the killer.

274
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,159
I exerted all my strength

275
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,919
but didn't even touch his robe.

276
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,480
And he only used

277
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,519
one hand and one leg.

278
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
You saw it yourself.

279
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,368
What about Huang Yaoshi?

280
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,808
We're not traveling with him?

281
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,879
Yaoshi might be a master.

282
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,160
How strong is he?

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,960
I'd like to know too.

284
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,559
I'm waiting for you.

285
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,359
Mr. Chai.

286
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
Where's the gold?

287
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,479
Inside.

288
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,159
What about Mr. Ouyang?

289
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,399
Also inside.

290
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,320
Thanks.

291
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,200
Come down. Let's duel.

292
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,039
Why?

293
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,040
You cheated at gambling.

294
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,519
You lost two rounds and got angry.

295
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,679
Then you played a trick.

296
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,679
If I hadn't realized it,

297
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,679
how would I reclaim

298
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,320
Mr. Ouyang's gold?

299
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,240
Fine, I see.

300
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,440
It's fair.

301
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,759
Even so, come down and fight!

302
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,759
I haven't met a worthy opponent
in ten years.

303
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,480
So, I killed my time at Cuihua House.

304
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,240
If we don't compete,

305
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,440
I won't feel peaceful from now on.

306
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
Mr. Ouyang.

307
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Should we find a place to rest first

308
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,880
or set out immediately?

309
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,319
Where did you get horses?

310
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,159
Master Hu gave them.

311
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,200
When traveling,

312
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,160
we can rotate

313
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,119
between six horses.

314
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,000
That's good.

315
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,240
We lost our horses.

316
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,640
Huang Yaoshi! Don't leave!

317
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,920
Mr. Chai, I'm leaving.

318
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,079
If you don't fight,

319
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,240
I'll make the first move.

320
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,960
You're a reasonable man

321
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,599
and won't force me,

322
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,760
right?

323
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,599
How could you come and go like this?

324
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,799
You're killing me.

325
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,359
Shouldn't you tell me

326
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,279
where you're taking me?

327
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,680
Lord Chai is waiting for you

328
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,560
at Yunshui Manor.

329
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm hungry and thirsty.

330
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,919
Here you go.

331
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,448
I need to change clothes.

332
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,680
Can you see me

333
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
dressed like this?

334
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,720
What's wrong?

335
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
Everything's wrong.

336
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:54,799
To meet Chai Yu,

337
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
I should dress properly, right?

338
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,200
There's a tailor shop

339
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
in Pengze.

340
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,368
I need to wash my face too.

341
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,679
Fine.

342
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,759
We'll make a stop in Pengze.

343
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Miss Feng.

344
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,200
It's a long journey.

345
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,119
Riding a horse isn't proper.

346
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,680
And in a carriage,

347
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,400
we should keep our distance.

348
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,839
I'm a disabled man.

349
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,480
Miss Feng.

350
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Don't overthink.

351
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,200
About the Three-Day Spiritbane,

352
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,960
I'll neutralize it once tonight

353
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,799
and once more tomorrow night.

354
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,079
Then it'll be cleared.

355
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Miss Feng, don't worry.

356
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm not worried.

357
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,480
Really?

358
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,359
Because of him,

359
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,159
I'm not worried.

360
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
Do you like him?

361
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:52,879
Of course.

362
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,400
Does he like you?

363
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,079
He will.

364
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,079
It's rare in this world

365
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,240
to find someone as pure-hearted

366
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,839
as Huang Yaoshi.

367
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,440
And his martial arts are great,

368
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,559
right?

369
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,399
Sure.

370
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,000
He

371
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,000
isn't far behind us.

372
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,599
Seventeen will contact us midway

373
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
as agreed last night.

374
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,759
Your father is already dead.

375
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,720
Stop dwelling on it.

376
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,079
My son is dead too.

377
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,519
Let the past be.

378
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,079
I'll let you
and Huang Yaoshi be together.

379
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,880
Consider this

380
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,119
my good deed.

381
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,799
Though before

382
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,039
I never heard of you,

383
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,240
I know exactly

384
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,920
what you're like.

385
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,599
What am I like?

386
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,519
Evil people rarely change.

387
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
You're the type

388
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,640
of incorrigible villain.

389
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,240
Though I'm young,

390
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,920
I've traveled widely with my father

391
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,319
and seen many people.

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,840
In this world,

393
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,880
bad people outnumber the good.

394
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,839
Truly good souls like Huang Yaoshi

395
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,599
are even rarer.

396
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,480
Miss Feng has a calculating mind.

397
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,359
You're the schemer.

398
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,840
You

399
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
have ulterior motives.

400
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,599
Right.

401
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,320
You need me

402
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
to clear the Three-Day Spiritbane.

403
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,119
And I

404
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,039
need Huang Yaoshi

405
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,519
to treat my crippled legs.

406
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,039
After that,

407
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
what do you plan to do?

408
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,079
Miss Feng.

409
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,519
Overthinking is not good for you.

410
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,039
Huang Yaoshi

411
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,400
hasn't decided to take you away yet.

412
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,480
She's read countless books

413
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:29,919
with a good memory.

414
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,000
She is very knowledgeable.

415
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:35,959
Before leaving,

416
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,000
I put out the candle

417
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,880
in her room.

418
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,960
Then I stood in the corridor

419
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,599
to listen to her breathing.

420
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,840
Later,

421
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,000
her breathing grew

422
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,400
calmer and calmer.

423
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,559
Then she fell asleep.

424
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,039
She was in her room,

425
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,344
and you were in the hallway.

426
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,920
You could still

427
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,760
sense her breathing?

428
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,959
Exactly.

429
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,159
Mr. Ouyang,

430
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,839
did I make any mistakes?

431
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,960
You're experienced in this.

432
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
If I make a mistake,

433
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,240
you must tell me.

434
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,559
I'm experienced?

435
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,400
You told me to meet her.

436
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,440
Where did I go wrong?

437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,759
You're only talking about yourself!

438
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,880
Do you know how

439
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,720
I spent last night?

440
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,240
- You...
- I lost all the gold.

441
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,519
- Well...
- Not exactly.

442
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,440
You won it back later.

443
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,400
Besides the gold,

444
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
I lost three horses too.

445
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,119
I got beaten in the stables.

446
00:24:44,736 --> 00:24:46,359
After mastering Mount Baituo techniques,

447
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,240
I thought

448
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,119
few could rival me.

449
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,920
Yet in the stables,
Instantaneous Leap, Shentuo Palm,

450
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,640
bone-piercing
and pressure-point attacks,

451
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,680
even at full power,
I couldn't touch Chai Qiong.

452
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,400
He only used one hand and leg!

453
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,240
Understand?

454
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,319
Zhao even watched me

455
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,599
kowtow to him three times.

456
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,959
Did that happen

457
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,400
before you asked me to see Feng Heng?

458
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
When did I

459
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,599
ask you to see her?

460
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,599
When?

461
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,920
After you returned,

462
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
you hesitated to choose

463
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,000
between her and me.

464
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,559
Are we still friends?

465
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,400
I haven't had friends

466
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
for ages.

467
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,720
Now, I can do anything

468
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,680
for you.

469
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,000
Come on.

470
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
Sounds like you've lived for centuries.

471
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,319
Are you immortal?

472
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,680
Is your mind addled?

473
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,119
I...

474
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,039
After you left,

475
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,879
Dan Min came.

476
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,440
She talked nonsense too.

477
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,359
I met her once by chance.

478
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,599
She claimed to fall for me

479
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,960
and be with me forever,

480
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,000
traveling the world.

481
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,759
Good heavens!

482
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,039
Luckily, the food was poisoned.

483
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,119
Zhao fought Zijin Hall

484
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,000
outside,

485
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,240
while I fought inside.

486
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,640
Then another expert came,

487
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,119
spouting gibberish.

488
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,160
If Master Chai hadn't come

489
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,039
to deliver the gold,

490
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,919
I, Ouyang Feng,

491
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,279
would've died.

492
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,599
Do you know martial arts?

493
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,160
That's not important.

494
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,519
Dan Min...

495
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,039
That's crucial! Don't talk about her.

496
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,320
My fault.

497
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,759
I was too selfish,

498
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,039
only talking

499
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:28,879
about myself.

500
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,359
Now, it's your turn

501
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,880
to speak, alright?

502
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,599
No.

503
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,720
You're so slow.

504
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,799
Have you eaten too much?

505
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,759
Turn!

506
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,079
She already made you upset,

507
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,639
didn't she?

508
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,680
Sure, but not the kind
you're thinking of.

509
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,119
I saw her as a friend.

510
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,119
Yet she attacked me.

511
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,439
I refused her,

512
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,759
and she asked me to kill her.

513
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,880
How could I possibly kill her?

514
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,319
But she is pretty cold.

515
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,160
If I refuse her, she'll kill me.

516
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,279
What's going on?

517
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:04,079
In Kuizhou,
I asked you to travel with me

518
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,440
because I hoped you'd tell me

519
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,848
about the customs of the South.

520
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,176
It's your turn to talk.

521
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,679
About what?

522
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:16,880
Do you know martial arts?

523
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,720
Are you a master?

524
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,520
Where has

525
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,439
Dan Min gone?

526
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,880
She was captured by the Chai family.

527
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,559
The Chai family? Why?

528
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,160
How should I know?

529
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:31,599
The martial world is complex.

530
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,439
None of my concern.

531
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,079
If I were captured,

532
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,759
would that not concern you?

533
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,399
It's different.

534
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,079
You're male, and she's female.

535
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,520
I see.

536
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,199
Mr. Ouyang,

537
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,240
you should find her.

538
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,640
Why should I?

539
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,920
You must voice your feelings

540
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
and make her understand,

541
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
or you will keep being upset.

542
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,440
I swear

543
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
I won't fall for a woman

544
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,280
like her.

545
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,039
Then you must let her know.

546
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,799
I'll keep it to myself.

547
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,799
What if she dies?

548
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,799
Keeping it to yourself won't help.

549
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,599
You will remain upset.

550
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,400
Right.

551
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,879
Go.

552
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,079
Go.

553
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,640
Caught up with you again!

554
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,599
Get out of here.

555
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
He's here for you.

556
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,680
I know.

557
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,520
Come on.

558
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,759
I hate being bothered.

559
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,759
Quick! He's getting away!

560
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
He's escaping.

561
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,119
Ouyang Feng,

562
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,160
you look pale.

563
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,400
Feeling unwell?

564
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:38,528
(Pengze County)

565
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Tie.

566
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,040
Tie.

567
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,480
Tie!

568
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,319
Pengze was flooded

569
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,159
a month ago.

570
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,759
Only 16 soldiers remain here.

571
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:38,959
Tie!

572
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,359
Tie.

573
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,640
Tie.

574
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,679
Salt Gang's people are here.

575
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,200
- Salt Gang?
- Yes.

576
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,319
Two large carriages.
Staying at an inn on the east.

577
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,000
27 people and 36 horses.

578
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,968
We came to the wrong place.

579
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,439
Let's leave.

580
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,320
Where can you change clothes?

581
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,160
Turn a corner ahead,

582
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,359
and there's a tailor shop.

583
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,088
I went there last year.

584
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,559
Pengze County is deserted.

585
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,640
No tailor shops remain.

586
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,279
Check it out. There might be one.

587
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,359
Who are you?

588
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:14,440
They're from the Chai family.

589
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,079
The Chai family?

590
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,240
What should we do?

591
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,720
Why are they here?

592
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,480
Are you scared?

593
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
What's there to fear?

594
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,039
Sure, nothing to fear.

595
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,319
I'm just a woman.

596
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,240
You have a dozen men.

597
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,160
Two masters are with you.

598
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,119
What's there to fear?

599
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,440
Withdraw!

600
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,839
Don't meddle in their affairs.

601
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,480
- Go!
- Come on!

602
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,520
Move!

603
00:30:48,288 --> 00:31:02,363
(Tailor Shop)

604
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,679
Is anyone there?

605
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,880
Is anyone there?

606
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,879
Wait.

607
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,079
Pengze County is deserted.

608
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,759
What are you doing here?

609
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,040
What's your name?

610
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:56,959
Qi Qing.

611
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,359
What's your rank in the Chai family?

612
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,840
Dismount.

613
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,840
Answer my question.

614
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,519
How can you run a business
with no customers?

615
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,559
I have nowhere to keep the stuff

616
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,119
in my shop.

617
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,160
The floodwater receded.

618
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,440
I came back to clean and repair.

619
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,520
Customers

620
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,839
will come eventually.

621
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,440
(Fu Ruoqing, Clothing Rraft in Zijin Hall)
You've come after all.

622
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,359
Ms. Fu.

623
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,079
I need to change clothes

624
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:51,920
and wash my face.

625
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,640
Why are you dressed like this?

626
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,000
I...

627
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,200
I've fallen for a man.

628
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,599
Does your brother know?

629
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,520
He doesn't need to.

630
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,839
And the man?

631
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,400
Get changed inside.

632
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Clean water's precious.

633
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,599
Use it sparingly.

634
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,240
Okay.

635
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,520
I need

636
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,080
to go inside.

637
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Hold on.

638
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,079
Why are your hands tied?

639
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,439
Come here.

640
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,280
What's going on?

641
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,079
Tie underestimated her.

642
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,519
This woman is a master.

643
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,776
Which rank do you hold in Zijin Hall?

644
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Third in the five crafts.

645
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,640
Clothing craft.

646
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,519
I'm Fu Ruoqing.

647
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,600
Have some tea?

648
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,199
This clean water was carried

649
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,039
from distant sources,

650
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,400
more precious than tea.

651
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,640
Fu Ruoqing.

652
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,760
I am

653
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,440
no match for you.

654
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,760
But Qi Qing and I can

655
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,680
defeat you together.

656
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,199
So, you're Tie Lin

657
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,440
and Qi Qing.

658
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,840
You'd better stay out of this,

659
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
or you'll lose your life.

660
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,480
Let me take Dan Min to Jiangzhou.

661
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,120
Alright.

662
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,960
After Dan Min changes clothes

663
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:54,960
and I talk to her,

664
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,840
you can leave.

665
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:57,919
What will you say?

666
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,000
She came specifically to see me

667
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,840
and said she liked a man.

668
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,519
As an elder of hers,

669
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,079
I ought to advise her.

670
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,559
Drink some tea.

671
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,960
Please wait patiently.

672
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,800
A young girl will

673
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,719
take a while to get changed

674
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:25,879
and wash her face.

675
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
For the record,

676
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
both of you also stand no chance

677
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,559
of defeating me together.

678
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,320
Since we can talk,

679
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,320
why resort to force?

680
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,519
You're right, madam.

681
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,479
I'm not that old.

682
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,440
Don't be so formal.

683
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,440
You have seniority over me.

684
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,016
I only have seniority in Zijin Hall.

685
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,039
You two

686
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
don't be so formal.

687
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,399
Huang Yaoshi.

688
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,039
My leader fears you might get lost.

689
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,559
He sent me specifically to tell you

690
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,079
that Miss Feng will rest

691
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,199
at Pengze County.

692
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,440
If you want to enter the county,

693
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,039
we'll get the meal ready.

694
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,800
If you proceed onward,

695
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,119
please inform us

696
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,079
of your next stop.

697
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,679
The leader will escort Miss Feng

698
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,600
to meet you.

699
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,519
Got it. Thanks.

700
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,160
Go!

701
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,519
You may go.

702
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,079
We part ways here.

703
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,719
Are you not entering the county?

704
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,399
I'm going to Lin'an,

705
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,280
not entering Pengze.

706
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,599
Then I'll be back soon.

707
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,920
Wait for me.

708
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
I won't wait.

709
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,800
We just came across each other.

710
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,920
Eventually, we'll part ways.

711
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,760
Why do you say that?

712
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,208
Since passing through Kuizhou
into Jiangling,

713
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,239
as you said,

714
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,439
I've been upset.

715
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,679
Zhao and I should head straight
to Lin'an.

716
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,960
You told me to find Miss Feng.

717
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,920
Then go ahead.

718
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,800
Don't split your focus.

719
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,519
I'm leaving.

720
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:18,999
Go and find Dan Min.

721
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,559
Where can I find her?

722
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,159
The martial world here is complex.

723
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,080
What can I do even if I find her?

724
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,119
Can't you wait for me?

725
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,200
Yaoshi.

726
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,760
Tell me the truth.

727
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,480
Who exactly are you?

728
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,639
I'm just a nobody.

729
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,599
Huang Yaoshi.

730
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,079
I knew you'd take this path.

731
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,800
Stop.

732
00:38:59,039 --> 00:38:59,879
Mr. Chai.

733
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,039
What exactly do you want?

734
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,360
Tell me the truth.

735
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,239
Who exactly are you?

736
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,360
I'm just a nobody.

737
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,920
That makes it even stranger.

738
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,760
We must have a fight.

739
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,480
If you lose to me,

740
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,880
I'll return to Cuihua House

741
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,720
and gamble again.

742
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,440
Mr. Ouyang, help me persuade him.

743
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,840
I'll be right back.

744
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,399
Don't go.

745
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:34,919
Him?

746
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,039
He can't help.

747
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,679
He's no match for me.

748
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,960
I won't deal with him.

749
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,280
Go ahead, Yaoshi.

750
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,480
Stop avoiding me.

751
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,400
Let's fight.

752
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,760
Fight or not?

753
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,479
So infuriating.

754
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,120
Wait for me.

755
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,280
So infuriating!

756
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,240
Set off to Lin'an.

757
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,760
From now on,

758
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,199
don't meddle in anything.

759
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,680
Ms. Fu.

760
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,559
Where's the used water?

761
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:55,999
Inside.

762
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,039
Throw it away.

763
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,800
Give it to me.

764
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,720
Tea?

765
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,320
Yes.

766
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,000
Do not

767
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,120
enter.

768
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,439
Speak.

769
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:37,000
Drive them away first.

770
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,400
Can't they hear it?

771
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,639
I asked Pan Jie

772
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,159
and Yu Dian to invite Ouyang Feng

773
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,719
to dinner

774
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,559
in Jiangling.

775
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,400
The Chai family poisoned the food
and seized me.

776
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:54,639
I don't know

777
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,479
how Ouyang Feng is.

778
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,120
Let them tell you.

779
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,039
Who's Ouyang Feng?

780
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,199
The man I like.

781
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,000
From Western Regions.

782
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,320
Nobody knows him.

783
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,280
I've decided.

784
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,519
I'll spend my life with him.

785
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,559
Why?

786
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,320
No reasons.

787
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Well, that's good then.

788
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,239
Is his family wealthy?

789
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,559
I guess so.

790
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,192
His martial arts are good.

791
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,559
Stop talking now.

792
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,320
We're taking her.

793
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,920
With Ms. Fu here,

794
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,960
you think you can leave?

795
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:53,599
Does Ouyang Feng like you?

796
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,119
Sure.

797
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,176
Otherwise, why did he drink with me?

798
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,920
They poisoned Ouyang Feng too.

799
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:02,880
Did you hurt Ouyang Feng?

800
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,280
Answer Miss Dan's question.

801
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,119
Make it clear before you leave.

802
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,960
You conspired with the Chai family

803
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,199
to poison Miss Dan Min.

804
00:43:58,559 --> 00:43:59,599
Where have you taken her?

805
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,880
We didn't poison her.

806
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,239
Chai Qiong was with you.

807
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,479
Stop arguing!

808
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,360
Since he is not here,

809
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:07,800
it's time to make you pay.

810
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,480
No need to talk anymore.

811
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,599
Why must you keep harassing us?

812
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,519
I didn't even avenge Lie's death

813
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,400
in Kuizhou.

814
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,840
Even if my martial arts

815
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,039
may seem inadequate,

816
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:18,880
I can still

817
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,920
fight all of you.

818
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,760
Fine.

819
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,800
Now that this guy is injured,

820
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,519
you'll have to

821
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:25,599
fight the four of us.

822
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,199
You have

823
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:14,519
a short temper.

824
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:15,679
