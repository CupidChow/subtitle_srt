1
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,920
Don't tell anyone about what happened.

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,320
We don't know any Southerners.

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,904
Who would I tell?

4
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:27,232
Mr. Ouyang.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,296
- Yaoshi.
- I was looking for you.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,880
They said you were at the stable.

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,344
What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,200
Yaoshi, are you hungry?

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,520
I'm not hungry.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm also not hungry.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,759
If you are hungry,

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,520
I can accompany you for a meal.

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,400
Actually, I need

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,079
to ask you something.

19
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,560
When did you start serving Baili?

20
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,520
When I was eleven,

21
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,479
and Young Leader was twelve.

22
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,199
Kuizhou branch.

23
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,120
You don't need to return there.

24
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,400
I understand.

25
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,039
Stay by my side.

26
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,240
I'll treat you as my own son.

27
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,656
Is that acceptable?

28
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
I would gladly serve you,

29
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,000
even with my life.

30
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,744
Rise.

31
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,360
Tell me.

32
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,759
Will Huang Yaoshi kill Ouyang Feng

33
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,319
for her sake?

34
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,319
- I don't know.
- He will.

35
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,079
A man

36
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,720
will do anything for the woman he loves.

37
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:21,216
Master,

38
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,560
shall we summon more skilled fighters?

39
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
Shi Xing

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,639
went to Lin'an during the day

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
to meet Master Dan.

42
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,439
If he is here,

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
he can handle Huang Yaoshi.

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,079
In Jiangling recently,

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,199
among Thirteen Taibao,

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,959
five trades are present.

47
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,040
But they're either no match
for Huang Yaoshi

48
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,360
or too distant to help promptly.

49
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,279
The Chai family's elites

50
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,920
have their own tasks too.

51
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,792
Master,

52
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,920
you strategize without leaving home.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,279
Without leaving home?

54
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,040
I can't even move from this chair.

55
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Master, I speak clumsily.

56
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,399
Tell me when Huang Yaoshi arrives.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When he arrives?

58
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,399
What if he takes the woman away?

59
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,519
If Huang Yaoshi wants to take someone,

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
who could stop him?

61
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,519
With Three-Day Spiritbane,

62
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,480
a love-stricken man

63
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,920
takes away

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,680
a woman who doesn't even know herself,

65
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,560
how pathetic is that?

66
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,160
I lost all my money.

67
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
We'll have hard times ahead.

68
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,199
Do you care about the money?

69
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,079
Money means nothing.

70
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,519
I just feel bad for you.

71
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,639
This journey was far from luxurious.

72
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,879
I've gambled away three horses too.

73
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:08,352
I

74
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:10,784
have something

75
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,519
embarrassing

76
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,839
to discuss with you.

77
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,776
Just say it.

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,959
As your sworn brother, I'll help you.

79
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,480
I've found out her name.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
Who?

81
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,399
Feng Heng.

82
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,720
The woman who's unsettled you?

83
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,399
A pitiful woman.

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She's been on your mind all along.

85
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
I didn't expect this.

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,079
Then bring her here.

87
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,128
But what if

88
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
I have to choose between you and her?

89
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,440
What should I do?

90
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,936
What?

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,496
Me

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,512
and her?

93
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,040
I've been to Salt Gang branch.

94
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,904
It's been years

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,439
since I last made a new friend.

96
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,279
So many years.

97
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
To be honest,

98
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,720
in my life, I've never had friends.

99
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,279
I went to Kunlun at ten,

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
and left there at 23.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,960
After that,

102
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,008
I was always alone.

103
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,920
You're my only friend.

104
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,079
What kind of choice?

105
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,800
Only one lives.

106
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,720
Why would you think that?

107
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,240
I didn't.

108
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,199
Hu Qianshou,
the Salt Gang leader, said it.

109
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,920
He basically implied it.

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,079
To choose between me and her?

111
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,199
Either I die or she dies?

112
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,920
He poisoned Feng Heng.

113
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,199
You can't fight. How can you choose?

114
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,480
How is that even related?

115
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
Back in Kuizhou,
you witnessed my skills.

116
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,519
- Aren't I good?
- Yes.

117
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,759
Would I surrender my life
to you for nothing?

118
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,680
Yaoshi, this wounds me.

119
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,319
I never imagined you are
out of your mind.

120
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm stressed out.

121
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
So I'm here to ask you.

122
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,059
You said you had something embarrassing

123
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,079
to discuss with me.

124
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,439
That's asking?

125
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,040
If you want my life, take it.

126
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,839
This evasiveness is unworthy.

127
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,399
We're buddies.
So speak your mind openly.

128
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,839
I have nothing to say.

129
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,680
Then this charade is even worse.

130
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,160
Do you know how this tortures me?

131
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,319
Are you aware of what just happened?

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,200
A true man should bear his own burdens.

133
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,559
If you can't endure,

134
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,559
find a way to endure regardless.

135
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,749
We're in deep trouble.

136
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,879
If you come discuss it with me,

137
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,000
who else would I turn to?

138
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,888
Mr. Ouyang,

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
I was wrong.

140
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,679
I was wrong.

141
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,120
Actually, the dilemma
isn't between you and her.

142
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,120
The struggle is within myself.

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
This makes no sense.

144
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,032
I don't need your care.

145
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,919
I see you as my brother.

146
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,456
You only care about yourself.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,480
Why are you so upset?

148
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
Other than losing money,

149
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,720
has anything else happened?

150
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,080
What could possibly happen?

151
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,399
What else could it be?

152
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,600
You'd be happy if you lost everything?

153
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,056
Then I understand.

154
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,600
Good that you do.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
Wait for me.

156
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,879
Stay right here.

157
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,360
How could I only think of myself?

158
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,159
How could I only think of myself?

159
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm being inconsiderate.

160
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,960
My apologies.

161
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,512
I'm at fault.

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,639
I've wronged Mr. Ouyang.

163
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,672
I'm at fault.

164
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,952
What did you say?

165
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,536
Excuse me.

166
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,200
Big or small?

167
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Place your bets.

168
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,920
I bet big.

169
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,320
I bet big.

170
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,639
- Maybe...
- Listen to me. Bet big.

171
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:30,360
Final bets!

172
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
I refuse.

173
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,440
Bet small! Reveal!

174
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,480
Reveal!

175
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,919
- Small!
- Big! Big!

176
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,399
Four, four, six. Big wins.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,568
Sir?

178
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,879
Sir, please wait.

179
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,919
I want to use this flute

180
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,279
to win back what Ouyang Feng lost.

181
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,559
What nonsense!

182
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,600
But examine this flute.

183
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
It's ancient jade from Kunlun Mountain.

184
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,440
Okay.

185
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,840
Bet big or small?

186
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,879
Place your bets.

187
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,200
I care not for riches.

188
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,544
Nor does he.

189
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:14,559
But losing travel funds has upset him.

190
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,776
What's the wager?

191
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,016
This flute

192
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,200
for one gold ingot.

193
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,608
Is it fair?

194
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,039
- I mean the terms.
- Your choice.

195
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,519
I'll follow your lead.

196
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,720
Young Master, it's Zijin Hall's people.

197
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,752
Stay calm.

198
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,320
We're not here to fight.

199
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,080
I want to fight.

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,559
My lady needs to speak privately
with Young Master.

201
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,960
Give me back Lie's life!

202
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,240
Sure.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,159
When my lady finishes,

204
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,360
if you want to fight,

205
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,559
I'll face you alone.

206
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,080
If your skills prevail,

207
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
take my life.

208
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,279
What's your background?

209
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,360
I told you in Kuizhou.

210
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,936
I didn't listen.

211
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm one of Zijin Hall's five crafts
and eight trades in Lin'an.

212
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
Pan Jie, Wood Artisan.

213
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,840
Eat first or talk first?

214
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,159
Who are you?

215
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,240
Don't you recognize me?

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,399
Your big mouth looks familiar.

217
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,440
I'm dressed up like this on purpose.

218
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,400
Why?

219
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,039
I don't know why either.

220
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,120
Why did you dress up like this?

221
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,559
I'm a woman.

222
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,984
Can't I dress up this way?

223
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,600
Then what style reflects your true self?

224
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,399
Your old look was comfortable.

225
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,016
You were comfortable?

226
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,200
Anyway,

227
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,039
these wide sleeves and long robes

228
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,440
and the hairpins and trinkets

229
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,960
make me uncomfortable.

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,679
You only know comfort.

231
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,080
Never tending to affairs

232
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,080
or doing anything!

233
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,279
Get lost! Now!

234
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,240
I have long said

235
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,879
men are despicable.

236
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,896
What is your name again?

237
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,080
Do you forget me when I'm not around?

238
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,639
Not that I'd forget.

239
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:49,728
Dan Min.

240
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:51,799
Right.

241
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,840
My lady fancies your young master.

242
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:00,352
Nonsense!

243
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,960
Young Master! Young Master!

244
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,480
Will you keep standing?

245
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,776
What's all this?

246
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
These are the finest wine and dishes

247
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
of the best tavern here.

248
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:17,248
Care to try?

249
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:20,919
Young Master.

250
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,760
You leave.

251
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,600
Who do you think you are?

252
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,480
Dian.

253
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,856
Don't worry.

254
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:31,296
You leave.

255
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,879
Have meat and drink.

256
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,759
I'm only treating you.

257
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
No share for others.

258
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,559
Young Master,
the food might be poisoned.

259
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,679
Among eight trades,

260
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,679
five are present here.

261
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,960
Poison would be needless

262
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,016
against you two.

263
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,440
You leave. I'll speak with her.

264
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,519
We were looking for you.

265
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,039
You saved us the trouble.

266
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,600
When Young Master finishes,

267
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,664
I'll take your life

268
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,559
one by one.

269
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,639
I'll take your life first.

270
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,600
Why should we fight you one by one?

271
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,256
Eat.

272
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
Didn't you want to talk?

273
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,519
You keep eating.

274
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,240
Why don't you eat?

275
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,504
I'm not hungry.

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,279
Let's drink. One sip for me

277
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,608
and one sip for you.

278
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,520
As for the meat,

279
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,808
one bite for me

280
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,112
and one bite for you.

281
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:23,799
My mouth is bigger.

282
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,640
Why force me to eat?

283
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,359
If you don't eat,

284
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:34,680
I get nervous.

285
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
If I killed the three

286
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,599
in Ba County,

287
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I'd admit it outright.

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,160
A true man acts and speaks

289
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,440
without deceit.

290
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
I know you weren't involved.

291
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,799
- You believe me?
- I do.

292
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,799
If you believe me, why come here?

293
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,079
I came of my own will.

294
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,680
They feared you'd hit me

295
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,559
and insisted on this.

296
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,640
You struck first.
You wouldn't listen to me.

297
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
Eat.

298
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,599
I've never treated anyone like this.

299
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,279
Just appreciate it.

300
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,000
Or I'll turn hostile.

301
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,799
- Big!
- Small! Big!

302
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,279
Master Chai, you lost again.

303
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:45,632
Well...

304
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,519
Y-You cheated!

305
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,319
Originally,

306
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,400
one gold ingot was enough.

307
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,599
But you insisted on keeping me here.

308
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:56,960
Another round.

309
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,759
My last two ingots.
Three wins to turn the table.

310
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,680
- Sir...
- I refuse to believe this!

311
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:03,640
Don't be angry.

312
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,359
A gambler's honor. Who's angry?

313
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,839
What time is it now?

314
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,079
Time doesn't matter.

315
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
I must leave before Chou hour.

316
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,319
I must leave now.

317
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,759
- Scared?
- Don't go.

318
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,680
Leaving after winning?

319
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,559
Poor gambling manners.

320
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,279
That's not how it works.

321
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,240
- How about this?
- No.

322
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:31,119
Go ahead.

323
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
One final bet.

324
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,680
If I lose,

325
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,920
all twelve gold ingots are yours.

326
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,599
If you lose, keep your two ingots.

327
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,039
But you must

328
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,599
go to West Market on the East bank

329
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,160
to find a food stall there

330
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,480
and give the ten ingots

331
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,960
personally to my friend Ouyang Feng.

332
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:55,232
You know him.

333
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,079
Why this condition?

334
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,880
What kind of bet is this?

335
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,832
I risk two,

336
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,176
and you risk twelve.

337
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,392
That's unfair.

338
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,319
Requiring your personal errand

339
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:07,232
makes it fair.

340
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,216
I'll bet.

341
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,720
Big or small?

342
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,464
Big!

343
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,200
Then I'll bet small.

344
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,359
Wait.

345
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,920
Keep your hands off the table.

346
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,088
Reveal.

347
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,616
It's small.

348
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,104
Incredible!

349
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,240
A master gambler?

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,480
I'm in a foul mood today.

351
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,928
State your business.

352
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,000
No more food or drink.

353
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,319
What's troubling you?

354
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,519
Tell me about it.

355
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,440
None of your concern.

356
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,080
You're in a bad mood.

357
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,480
You seemed different days ago.

358
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,680
This outfit doesn't suit you.

359
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,559
I'll dress however

360
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,559
you like in the future.

361
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,920
Are you out of your mind?

362
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,839
My subordinate died in Kuizhou.

363
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,119
There's no future between us.

364
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,759
Let me tell you a story.

365
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,432
Not in the mood.

366
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,119
You told one in Kuizhou's court.

367
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,720
Why can't I share mine now?

368
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
Come. Sit.

369
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,056
Be brief.

370
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,160
My brother is Dan Xingbian.

371
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:33,599
Heard of him?

372
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,839
Is this storytelling?

373
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,680
I could tell a hundred of such stories.

374
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,119
I'll tell it my way.

375
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,279
Just listen carefully.

376
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,119
Dan Xingbian leads the Zijin Hall.

377
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,200
He's Song's best martial artist.

378
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,720
I'm 21. How old are you?

379
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,599
Your brother?

380
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
Song's best martial artist?

381
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,400
How many best martial artists
does Song have?

382
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,200
- Your age?
- Older than you.

383
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,480
Since I was 16,

384
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,519
my brother arranged
three marriage proposals for me.

385
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
First, the Imperial Sacrifices
Minister's son.

386
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,599
Second, the Military Councilor's son.

387
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,839
Third, the Infantry Commander.

388
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:19,880
All ended in fights.

389
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,680
Why beat you?

390
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,960
Who dares to beat me?

391
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,920
The only person

392
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,599
who ever beat me is you.

393
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,200
Get to the point. You're insufferable.

394
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,319
My brother wants
a political marriage for me.

395
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:40,519
I don't want it.

396
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,759
Yet I don't know what I want.

397
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,559
Until recently,

398
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,480
I met someone.

399
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,759
He told me

400
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,720
that true man should
roam the world freely,

401
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,720
dwelling not on the future,

402
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,839
and when meeting someone he likes,

403
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,319
being together for a day

404
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,640
is for a lifetime.

405
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,616
So?

406
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,079
You're that person I like.

407
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,480
I'll roam the world with you.

408
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,640
We'll share countless lifetimes.

409
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,559
Have you lost your mind?

410
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,440
Is that all you have to say to me?

411
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,720
You've lost your mind.

412
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,519
Now that I've confessed to you,

413
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,079
if you agree, I'll follow you.

414
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,616
If you refuse,

415
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,359
this is pointless.

416
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,232
Friend,

417
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,319
let's settle Lie's debt first.

418
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,359
I'm not your friend.

419
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,800
Dan Min,

420
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,200
let's settle Lie's debt first.

421
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,759
Who's Lie?

422
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,799
My subordinate

423
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,599
died at Kuizhou Yamen
and was buried outside Kuizhou.

424
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,712
Fine.

425
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,216
Kill me then

426
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,000
to repay his life.

427
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,079
You poisoned me.

428
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,616
I...

429
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,119
You poisoned the food and wine.

430
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,599
My feelings for you are genuine.

431
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,400
Why would I poison you?

432
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,400
I can use poisons,

433
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,799
but I have no reason to harm you.

434
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,440
Whatever, Ouyang Feng.

435
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,039
My affection for you

436
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,000
is already known to all here.

437
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,559
Soon the entire martial world will know.

438
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,119
If you don't like me,

439
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,039
I'll lose my dignity.

440
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,799
You might as well kill me.

441
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,839
Why do all women say such things?

442
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,200
What other woman

443
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,880
- No other woman.
- said the same to you?

444
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,039
There was no other woman.

445
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,200
Yaoshi mentioned
meeting a woman who unsettled him.

446
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,480
He said he'd kill her
if he couldn't take her away.

447
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
Do I unsettle you then?

448
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,240
I've been unsettled since morning.

449
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
It started before you even arrived.

450
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,160
I've never met a man like you before.

451
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,680
I'll be obedient.

452
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,599
Can we just be friends?

453
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,344
Not enough.

454
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,799
I'll take blades for you.

455
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
Your troubles become mine.

456
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,079
Really?

457
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,200
I never lie.

458
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,000
Still not enough.

459
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,720
Then forget it.

460
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,119
Romance requires solemn vows.

461
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,839
How could I ever love a woman like you?

462
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,599
Then kill me.

463
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,480
I have no strength.

464
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,000
Then I'll kill you.

465
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,119
You madwoman!

466
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,519
Again?

467
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,359
Yes!

468
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,560
Enough!

469
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,400
Not enough!

470
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,328
Pan,

471
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,319
let me deal with this Westerner.

472
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,079
- My lady!
- Dian, the food is poisoned.

473
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,240
Ouyang Feng, will you agree?

474
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,240
Agree now, and it's not too late.

475
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,224
My lady?

476
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,920
Repay Lie's life first.

477
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,400
Don't let him escape.

478
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,599
- Come on!
- Two against one isn't fair.

479
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,200
Pu Yuan?

480
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,040
Why?

481
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,599
Hu Qianshou wants

482
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,759
one of eight trades dead tonight.

483
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,440
It has to be you, Pan.

484
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,816
You're

485
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,240
from the Salt Gang?

486
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,599
I poisoned the food.

487
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,200
This didn't concern you originally,

488
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
but our young lady dragged you in.

489
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,079
- Young Master!
- Tie Lin, why are you here?

490
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,088
Young Master!

491
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:04,920
My lady!

492
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,960
Ouyang Feng.

493
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,400
Don't even think of running.

494
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,920
Where could I run?

495
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,599
If you don't come for me,

496
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,119
I'll come to you.

497
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,400
You lunatic.

498
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,319
Pu Yuan, after him!

499
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,599
The Westerner killed Pan.

500
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,728
Rescue the young lady first.

501
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,032
Let's go!

502
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,839
Both of Westerners can't live.

503
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,559
They know I poisoned Dan Min

504
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:10,920
and killed Pan Jie.

505
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,519
We hold no grudge.

506
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,640
But I must take your life.

507
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,599
Speak clearly.

508
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,200
Despicable coward!

509
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,920
You poisoned the wine.

510
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,519
I didn't administer the poison.

511
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,519
And it's nothing extraordinary.

512
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,000
It was just

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
to knock out Dan Min,
Dan Xingbian's sister.

514
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,319
Where are you taking her?

515
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,920
Does she

516
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,000
concern you?

517
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,264
She is my friend!

518
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,880
What are you doing?

519
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,168
Master Chai.

520
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,519
Did you

521
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,880
kill Nianyu?

522
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,664
Who?

523
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,679
Those two who died in Ba County.

524
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,440
No.

525
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,519
I don't lie.

526
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,960
Then I must apologize.

527
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,679
What are you doing?

528
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,719
Acting under Lord Chai's orders.

529
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,119
- To kill?
- Yes.

530
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,760
You scoundrel!

531
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,440
Is the Chai family's dominance
not enough?

532
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,159
Dare to hide?

533
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,079
Is the dominance not enough?

534
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,440
To dominate the martial world?

535
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,280
Why go against a Westerner?

536
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,719
Master Chai, you know this man?

537
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,840
I've just met this youngster.

538
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,079
I quite like him.

539
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,400
Then I'll report to Lord Chai

540
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,760
that it was you who vouched for him.

541
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,679
Make it clear.

542
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,400
(Chai Qiong, the Chai family's elder)
It's me, Chai Qiong,

543
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,800
who vouched for Ouyang Feng.

544
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,368
Yes.

545
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,800
And the one outside.

546
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:39,872
Yes.

547
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,768
Master Hu.

548
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
You've returned.

549
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:13,119
I left here during the day.

550
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,760
Now that I look back,

551
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,480
I feel ashamed.

552
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,320
I would never harm my buddy.

553
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,599
It doesn't matter. I anticipated this.

554
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,079
But it's almost the Chou hour.

555
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,320
The incense inside

556
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,239
counters the soul scattering.

557
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,639
It's already worked.

558
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,400
Just go in and snuff it out.

559
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,888
Yaoshi,

560
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,079
let's step aside

561
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,960
and talk over there.

562
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,679
Yaoshi,

563
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,719
when you spoke during the day,

564
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,440
I overheard.

565
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,400
Now that you're back,

566
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,599
are you taking her away?

567
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,760
Not exactly.

568
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,199
After you left, I reconsidered.

569
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,039
I shouldn't have

570
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,440
given you both trouble.

571
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,320
My son's death

572
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,159
results from

573
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,559
my past deeds I couldn't avoid.

574
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,800
When men lack virtue,

575
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,719
retribution follows.

576
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,480
Besides, the dead can't return.

577
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,159
Please forget my threats

578
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,239
against your buddy.

579
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,599
As for Feng Heng,

580
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
you can take her now.

581
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,119
Consider it

582
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,880
- as my good deed.
- Master Hu.

583
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,560
Truthfully,

584
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,079
I haven't decided yet.

585
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,559
Why?

586
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,920
Past matters

587
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,904
still haunt me.

588
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,320
Now,

589
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,239
you can't let her go either.

590
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,360
How about this?

591
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,159
Three-Day Spiritbane

592
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,000
needs daily detoxification.

593
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,920
Full detoxification takes three days.

594
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm going to Jiangzhou tomorrow.

595
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,719
I'll take her along

596
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,559
in my carriage.

597
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,920
If you agree,

598
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,159
I'll prepare your horse too.

599
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,920
Ride behind us.

600
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,079
If you want to see her,
catch up and meet her.

601
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,119
You can see her every day.

602
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,519
When the three days are up,

603
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,039
take her away if you wish.

604
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,679
If you haven't decided yet by then,

605
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,480
I promise

606
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,280
she'll be properly cared for.

607
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:12,239
Why will you do this?

608
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,880
I'm a businessman.

609
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,840
I weigh risks and benefits carefully.

610
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,960
You are a martial arts expert.

611
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,599
Making an enemy of you

612
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,959
is worse

613
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,920
than offering you convenience.

614
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,119
Then how should I

615
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,079
thank you?

616
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,320
If you wish to thank me,

617
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,639
that's more than enough.

618
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:22,599
I'll leave if you want to sleep.

619
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,639
Why did you come back?

620
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,960
The soul-scattering effect

621
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,984
has worn off.

622
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,520
If I hadn't returned,

623
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,920
I fear you'd forget me forever.

624
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,760
Did you do anything terrible?

625
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,472
No.

626
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,599
I won't kill my buddy.

627
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,559
Leaving again?

628
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,048
No rush.

629
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,920
I'll stay a little longer.

630
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:03,936
It's alright.

631
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,840
Go ahead. I'll wait here
for Huang Yaoshi.

632
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,320
Didn't you have the food

633
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,639
Master Hu sent you?

634
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,480
I ate a little.

635
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,720
Not to your taste?

636
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,480
The food contains bracken roots.

637
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,920
That makes me dizzy,

638
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,519
like poisoned wine does.

639
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,320
Thanks for coming back.

640
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,360
How does bracken cause poisoning?

641
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,039
Regular people aren't affected.

642
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,599
But I am.

643
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,880
Winter bracken is more dangerous for me.

644
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,760
Why?

645
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,079
In winter, roots grow deep
with less sunlight,

646
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,599
making bracken thick and juicy.

647
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,719
In summer, bracken is dry and thin.

648
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,960
Southern bracken differs from northern.

649
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,559
Kunlun Mountain bracken is the thickest.

650
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,679
After the Jianyan migration,

651
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,320
the Song-Jin border

652
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,920
follows the Qinling-Huaihe line.

653
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,679
Common bracken roots

654
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:37,440
mostly come from Song lands.

655
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,360
The Salt Gang is rich.

656
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,639
So their bracken roots

657
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,119
likely came from north
of the Qinling-Huaihe line.

658
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,639
Might even be from Kunlun Mountain.

659
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:48,679
You know about cooking

660
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:50,359
in great depth.

661
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,200
Not exactly.

662
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:54,559
But I cook decent meals.

663
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,920
And know about herbs?

664
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,240
Not truly.

665
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,079
But I know bits and pieces.

666
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,840
Have you been to Kunlun?

667
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,120
No.

668
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,760
I've traveled and studied
with my father since childhood.

669
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,079
I read eclectic texts.

670
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,559
And I never forget what I read.

671
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,559
Yet not forgetting

672
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,160
some things

673
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,840
brings pain.

674
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,639
Today I told you to live well

675
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,480
in this world

676
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:30,559
as long as you can.

677
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:35,039
You said someone once
said the same words

678
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,039
to you.

679
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,039
It was a long time ago.

680
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:42,879
She had been

681
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,480
frail since birth.

682
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,280
When I was ten,

683
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,599
I went to Kunlun Mountain

684
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,800
and used my body

685
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,760
to test medicines for her.

686
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,639
So she called me Yaoshi.

687
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,559
In the first year, many times

688
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,519
I nearly died.

689
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,760
Second year was better.

690
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:11,399
In the fourth year,

691
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:12,999
we became

692
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,280
connected in thought,

693
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,119
like

694
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,199
two fruits

695
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,559
on one vine.

696
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,000
But like twin fruits sharing one vine,

697
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,519
we competed
to drain each other's vitality.

698
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:39,359
In the fifth year,

699
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:42,079
she began to grow more beautiful.

700
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,320
In the sixth year,

701
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:47,999
she started

702
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,960
to cherish my fading existence.

703
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:53,919
In the eighth year,

704
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,079
she put in effort

705
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,760
to channel all vitality

706
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,840
to sustain me.

707
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:05,159
In the ninth year,

708
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,760
she said,

709
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,240
"Live well

710
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,079
in this world

711
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,639
as long as you can."

712
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,119
Stop it.

713
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,199
If you continue,

714
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,760
it'll upset you.

715
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,199
I've never shared these memories before.

716
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:34,519
If I don't speak now,

717
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:37,800
they might vanish forever.

718
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:40,199
You haven't forgotten.

719
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,960
You're just pretending to.

720
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:47,400
Our time together is brief.

721
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,160
Let's instead

722
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,159
share happier recollections.

723
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,639
