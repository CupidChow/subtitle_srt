1
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,199
Stop it.

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,640
Let's get some sleep.
We'll leave at dawn.

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,399
Come out. Time to court.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,080
Now?

5
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,960
Who will interrogate us?

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,400
No idea.

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,960
The court here

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,079
isn't closed this late?

9
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,200
What are you two doing?

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,480
Just him alone.

11
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,359
Is the courtroom far?

12
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,439
Just ahead.

13
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,639
Wait here.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,040
I'll go myself.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,200
Come with me. Don't touch anything.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't touch anything.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,400
Come with me.

18
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,199
Come here.

19
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,719
Stand over here.

20
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,320
- Here?
- Stand over here.

21
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,999
Don't move.

22
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,559
Don't move.

23
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,159
Stand there.

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,360
Who are you?

25
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,319
(Dan Min, Lady of Zijin Hall)

26
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,159
Dan Min.

27
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,639
I mean,

28
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,759
what are you doing here?

29
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,080
To interrogate you.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
No need to move,

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,280
if you feel

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
comfortable there.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,400
Is it comfortable?

34
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,400
Definitely better than standing there.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,599
You killed the three in Ba County?

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,159
The Kuizhou prefect is a woman?

37
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,039
I ask,

38
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,680
then you just answer.

39
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:56,384
(The Legend of Heroes)

40
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,353
=Duel on Mount Hua=

41
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:18,369
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel,
The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

42
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:21,409
=Eastern Heretic and Western Venom=
=Episode 2=

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
Is it okay for me to sit here?

44
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,599
It's okay.

45
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,839
Then can I ask you questions?

46
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,720
No.

47
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,680
That's not fair then.

48
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,839
I can leave anytime.

49
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,279
Think your martial arts

50
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,480
are superior?

51
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:43,759
Yes.

52
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,879
Why?

53
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,839
My martial arts
dominate the Western Regions.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
And the South neglects martial arts.

55
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,399
It means my martial arts dominate the South.

56
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,719
You might not even be my match.

57
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,439
I won't argue with you.

58
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,279
Because I'm a woman?

59
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,839
I don't fight women.

60
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:08,959
If women attack me,

61
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,120
I won't fight back.

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,560
Especially

63
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,040
a woman like you.

64
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,680
A woman like me?

65
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,079
Not womanly.

66
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,039
Telling the truth.

67
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,360
Three died in Ba County.

68
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,279
Two from Thirteen Taibao

69
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,399
of Zijin Hall, Jade Artisan

70
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,239
and Comb Artisan.

71
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,879
One from the Chai family,

72
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,759
Tie Sen the Sixth.

73
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,360
I don't know

74
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,279
any of them.

75
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm innocent.

76
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,400
Then why are you sitting there?

77
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,279
It's comfortable here.

78
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
I wanted to see

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,319
(Hall of Justice)
the courtroom.

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,279
They say it's a place for justice.

81
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,479
You are

82
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,040
Ouyang Feng, right?

83
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Yes.

84
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,720
If you killed those people,

85
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,839
then you'll die here.

86
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,839
If you leave Kuizhou,

87
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,920
you will be chased after.

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,079
If you return to Western Regions,
we'll still come for you.

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,839
If we can't find you,
we'll destroy Xuetuo Manor.

90
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
Not Xuetuo Manor,

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,680
but Baituo...

92
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,240
Baituo Manor.

93
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,839
Stop being

94
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,680
arrogant.

95
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,800
We have plenty of excellent

96
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,600
martial artists.

97
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,760
Enough.

98
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,679
You beat me.

99
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,560
You look down on me?

100
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,720
I don't.

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,240
You refuse to reason,

102
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,519
but keep threatening me.

103
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,759
Did you kill them?

104
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,279
Are you here to uphold justice?

105
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
I...

106
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,320
You have to answer

107
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,599
three questions.

108
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,039
I'll decide

109
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,639
if you killed them.

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
I always tell the truth.

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
What kind of life

112
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,639
do you want to live?

113
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,480
I roam the world freely.

114
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,279
You claimed

115
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,040
I'll die here, yet

116
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,560
you're curious about my life?

117
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,879
Answer my question.

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Fine.

119
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,399
When my father was alive,

120
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,319
Imperial Preceptor Qiuci

121
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,279
gave my brother and I
a bunch of grapes each.

122
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,079
I devoured mine immediately.

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
It was so sweet.

124
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,359
But my brother

125
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,639
counted every grape

126
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,680
on his bunch,

127
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,920
then ate just one.

128
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,319
Imperial Preceptor Qiuci

129
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,959
told us the number of grapes

130
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,000
determines our remaining years.

131
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,560
My brother's grapes remain intact.

132
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,600
He takes one every year.

133
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,839
I don't want that life.

134
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:49,879
And I don't count

135
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,720
my remaining days.

136
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,839
It's good that I can enjoy

137
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,879
a lifetime's sweetness in one day.

138
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
If I meet someone

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,199
I love,

140
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,439
and she loves me as well,

141
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,560
then that makes a full bunch of grapes.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,079
Every day together

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,959
counts.

144
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,120
That's the life I want to live.

145
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,960
Telling the truth.

146
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,920
Who's there?

147
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
From Lin'an Zijin Hall.

148
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,799
(Pan Jie, Wood Artisan of Zijin Hall)

149
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm Pan Jie, Wood Artisan.

150
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,440
(Pu Yuan, Painter of Zijin Hall)
I'm Pu Yuan, Painter.

151
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,080
(Yu Dian, Bamboo Artisan of Zijin Hall)
I'm Yu Dian, Bamboo Artisan.

152
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,720
(Tang Long, Stoneman of Zijin Hall)
I'm Tang Long, Stoneman.

153
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
(Liu Fang, Hinge Artisan at Zijin Hall)
I'm Liu Fang, Hinge Artisan.

154
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,120
What?

155
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,759
Where's your manner?

156
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,320
Jade Artisan Liu Tianshui

157
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
and Comb Artisan Liu Baogen

158
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,279
died in Ba County.

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,840
We're here for that.

160
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Return to your cells.

161
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,200
Don't seek death.

162
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,120
You should heed your own advice.

163
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,720
Where is Mr. Ouyang?

164
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
At least tell us that.

165
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
In the courtroom ahead,

166
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,840
talking with our Miss.

167
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,599
Go back.

168
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,399
We won't return to cells.

169
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,360
We'll wait here for Mr. Ouyang.

170
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,359
Agreed?

171
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,920
Ouyang Feng.

172
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,399
Comfortable being there?

173
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,999
Quite.

174
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
Then stay put.

175
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,519
What kind of woman do you seek?

176
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,240
Tender, sentimental

177
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,039
as women here.

178
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,240
Sings Liu Yong's verses.

179
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,576
Like the figure in the painting.

180
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,440
Wake up!

181
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,840
Who's she?

182
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,000
Well...

183
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,960
Oh no!

184
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,639
My luggage was left

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
at the tavern from the fight.

186
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,759
You're an official.

187
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,639
Could you get it for me?
There's a crucial painting

188
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,479
inside.

189
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
Return to your spot.

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,159
A woman in the painting?

191
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Yes.

192
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
You saw it?

193
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,119
No.

194
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm leaving then.

195
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
I didn't kill anyone.

196
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
- Believe it or not.
- I haven't finished asking.

197
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,200
You have. Exactly three.

198
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
What?

199
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,679
What kind of life

200
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,519
do you want to live?

201
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,080
What kind of woman do you seek?

202
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,279
A woman in the painting?

203
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,080
You didn't kill people,

204
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
but you can't leave.

205
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,879
Why?

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,840
No why.

207
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,680
What do you want?

208
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
I'll do whatever I want.

209
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,639
To be honest,

210
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,840
I hate an unreasonable woman
like you the most.

211
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,720
I am here

212
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
to kill you.

213
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,519
Don't blame me.

214
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,559
I won't blame you.

215
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,960
End of the story.

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Ouyang Feng.

217
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,720
No one dares speak to me like this!

218
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,120
You ask for it!

219
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,440
I'll kill you later.

220
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,559
Why do it later?

221
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,639
That's enough.

222
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,720
You hit me?

223
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,279
I didn't mean to.

224
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,120
Didn't expect you are really agile.

225
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,440
I'm more than that.

226
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,080
I only used thirty...

227
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,480
half of my strength.

228
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,720
It's not acceptable either.

229
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
(Hall of Justice)
Why?

230
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,279
I told you,

231
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,039
I didn't kill anyone.

232
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:54,279
We have no grudges,

233
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,879
why did you do so?

234
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,320
You can't escape.

235
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,759
No matter where,

236
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,840
I will find you.

237
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,200
Can't believe it!

238
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,480
Come back!

239
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,159
Lie!

240
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,040
Lie.

241
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,759
This person is eerie.

242
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,160
All my

243
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,000
internal strength

244
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,039
was drained away.

245
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
Mr. Ouyang.

246
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,639
What happened?

247
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,480
Mr. Ouyang.

248
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,024
People of Zijin Hall are all tough.

249
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,240
Let's go.

250
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,640
Come on. We lost our luggage.

251
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,319
Did you get anything?

252
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,759
They killed Jade Artisan

253
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,720
and Comb Artisan?

254
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,640
Summon the five crafts.

255
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,000
The Five Elders aren't gathered.

256
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,279
Whoever's summoned comes.

257
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,039
Inform the Hall Leader first?

258
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:32,879
No.

259
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,159
Just make them come.

260
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,439
I'll go after

261
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,519
Ouyang Feng.

262
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,519
I must hunt him down.

263
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,080
Who's there?

264
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,119
Open the door.

265
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,640
We lost a piece of luggage here.

266
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,079
Return at dawn.

267
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,079
It will be dawn soon.

268
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,639
What did you say?

269
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,800
Just open the door.

270
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,640
Lie.

271
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,839
- Lie!
- Return at dawn.

272
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,448
- Lie!
- It will be dawn soon.

273
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,439
You!

274
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,920
It was a guy named Pan Jie.

275
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,712
When Lie fought against him,
his internal strength was drained away.

276
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,680
There are masters here.

277
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,840
But none can match you.

278
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,359
Return to the yamen

279
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,880
and kill them all,

280
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
to avenge Lie!

281
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,279
I left a piece of luggage here.

282
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,359
Have you seen it?

283
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,799
People of the Salt Gang branch took it.

284
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,399
Mr. Ouyang.

285
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,399
Return to the yamen.

286
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,039
Going to Lin'an won't help.

287
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,400
Without the painting,

288
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,359
Miss Liu Rusi

289
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,799
won't recognize

290
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,639
the betrothal.

291
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,319
Return to the yamen

292
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,599
and kill the Zijin Hall people.

293
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,960
Bury Lie first.

294
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,079
What else do you want?

295
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,199
What?

296
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,920
Young Leader is already dead.

297
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,799
A decade or a century,

298
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,319
all men must die.

299
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,000
Apologies.

300
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,319
The body is right in the carriage.

301
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,319
The body is in the carriage?

302
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Back to headquarters.

303
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,359
Go.

304
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
What are you doing here?

305
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
Waiting for someone.

306
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,960
Not us?

307
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,119
No.

308
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,040
You may go.

309
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,039
Killing the Salt Gang's Young Leader

310
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,839
is a great crime.

311
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,040
Wherever you go,

312
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,480
you'll be hunted down.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,840
How about this?

314
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,560
I'll apologize.

315
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,240
What was his name?

316
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,080
Hu Baili.

317
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,320
Hu Baili.

318
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,680
We're strangers

319
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,199
who met by chance.

320
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,119
Our fates

321
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,040
are destined.

322
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,040
Don't blame me.

323
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,639
Go.

324
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:16,959
Mr. Ouyang.

325
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,799
Bury Lie here?

326
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,720
We can't carry him around.

327
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,240
Return to the yamen

328
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
and kill everyone

329
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,319
in Zijin Hall with Lie's blade.

330
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,559
If we return now,

331
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,599
those people have gone.

332
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,079
There are soldiers now.

333
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,119
What should we do?

334
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,680
I'll go to Lin'an.

335
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,480
After meeting Liu Rusi,

336
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,240
tell her the whole story,

337
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
and she'll listen.

338
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,519
The painting is the token.

339
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,800
Without it,

340
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
she would not go with us

341
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,720
to Baituo Manor.

342
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,079
If we can't meet Liu Rusi,

343
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,839
how will I explain all this?

344
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,799
Dian.

345
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,639
You come with me.

346
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,720
The rest stay behind.

347
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,639
Miss!

348
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:24,879
Miss!

349
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,960
They killed Jade Artisan and Comb Artisan?

350
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,520
Right!

351
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,240
We should follow her.

352
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,079
We cannot let her be in danger.

353
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:36,879
Here.

354
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,399
Eat more.

355
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,040
What's wrong?

356
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,079
Only rough wine and steamed cakes left.

357
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,560
Okay.

358
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Let's be clear first.

359
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,000
None of my business.

360
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,359
Just asking.

361
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,760
About what?

362
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:52,720
Where to?

363
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,679
Who?

364
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,544
The one in the carriage.

365
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,400
Back to headquarters.

366
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,559
Why is she with you?

367
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,279
Are you enjoying toying with us?

368
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,560
Want to kill us,

369
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,920
get it over with!

370
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,000
What do you mean?

371
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,839
What do you want?

372
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,639
I told you,

373
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,959
just asking.

374
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,480
Why is that lady

375
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,119
in your carriage?

376
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,439
Is

377
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,519
this your business?

378
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,039
None.

379
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,240
Then let us go.

380
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,920
Can't she move?

381
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,159
She

382
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,560
can't.

383
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
Can she speak?

384
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes.

385
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,119
Why take her

386
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
to Jiangling?

387
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,280
A dying act

388
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,200
of Young Leader.

389
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,039
He wanted

390
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:51,879
to offer her

391
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
to Gang Leader.

392
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,119
Gang Leader is paralyzed.

393
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,759
Maybe she can cure him.

394
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:08,879
Let's go.

395
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,759
Two steamed cakes. Enough?

396
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,199
Yes.

397
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
A jug of wine?

398
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,040
I don't drink.

399
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,679
Two coins then.

400
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
Two coins?

401
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,279
Two steamed cakes

402
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,520
cost two coins.

403
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,599
No money.

404
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,119
This is an official post house.

405
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,359
Want to eat and run?

406
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,039
Hurry!

407
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,879
Go!

408
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,599
Darn!

409
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,920
I want to talk to her.

410
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,519
Go ahead. I won't move.

411
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,400
What's your name?

412
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,599
No need to know.

413
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,240
I want to know.

414
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,159
Why?

415
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,560
It could

416
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,039
make me remember you.

417
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,560
Why

418
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,760
remember me?

419
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,359
From a young age,

420
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,200
I've wandered with my father.

421
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,319
Had no acquaintances.

422
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,279
When I met you,

423
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,000
he died.

424
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,559
You kind of saved me.

425
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,319
Why are you paralyzed?

426
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,839
Ninefold Yin Pill

427
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,920
won't prolong your life,

428
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,960
but I realigned your bones.

429
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,399
In two hours,

430
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,359
you could move and walk.

431
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,519
In less than two hours,

432
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,400
I would get up and run.

433
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,519
Are you this impatient?

434
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,079
He came to kill me.

435
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,799
And he killed my father.

436
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,000
I

437
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:18,319
don't want to know

438
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,480
grudges between you two.

439
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,240
Take me.

440
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,879
Why?

441
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,680
I can wash clothes,

442
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,560
and cook meals.

443
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,319
My dishes are tasty.

444
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,680
Just take me with you.

445
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,559
I can't take you.

446
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,119
For years,

447
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,000
even decades,

448
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,000
I've always been alone.

449
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,359
I'm a weirdo.

450
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,399
Often,

451
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,039
I don't talk to anyone
for a year or two.

452
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,159
Sometimes,

453
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
I travel with someone

454
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,400
for months.

455
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,839
If I find it bored,

456
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,359
then leave.

457
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,559
Taking you along,

458
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,320
it's too

459
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,520
troublesome.

460
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,000
Close your eyes.

461
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,119
Our fates are

462
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,039
all destined.

463
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,679
Don't blame me.

464
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,519
You said that before.

465
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,920
I'll realign your bones

466
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,079
and give you a Ninefold Yin Pill.

467
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,079
You'll take your path,

468
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,240
and I'll take mine.

469
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,599
Your face looks deathly pale.

470
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,800
Open your mouth.

471
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,159
Kill me.

472
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,839
Because I don't take you?

473
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,359
Because I'm yours now.

474
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,359
If you reject me,

475
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,680
how could I survive?

476
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,520
You're mine?

477
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,520
No one

478
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,839
has ever touched me.

479
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,240
I just tried to save you.

480
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:00,720
Take the pill?

481
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,599
No.

482
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,680
You may go.

483
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,039
You'll recover by Jiangling without it.

484
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,639
What's your name?

485
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,720
Huang Yaoshi.

486
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,840
Thank you.

487
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,680
Just now,

488
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
I shouldn't have said those things.

489
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,159
I should've kept it

490
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,160
to myself.

491
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,079
What's your name?

492
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,639
No need to know.

493
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,240
Anyway,

494
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,039
you don't want to.

495
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,479
Right.

496
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,599
One last favor, okay?

497
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,680
What?

498
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,240
I can't move.

499
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,000
All along the way,

500
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,559
I don't want to lie next to a body.

501
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,320
Again?

502
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,800
I'll kill you!

503
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,000
Can't even spare a single coin?

504
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,239
Looks quite decent though.

505
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,239
Two steamed cakes, return one,

506
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,679
and that one's been bitten once.

507
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,880
This is an official post house.

508
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,239
Do you have any coin?

509
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,159
I want to search your luggage

510
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
for one coin.

511
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,399
It's fine.

512
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,800
What?

513
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,760
Everything's fine.

514
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,600
Two jin of wine,

515
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:00,999
One jin of beef.

516
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,400
Coming.

517
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,639
I'm not that kind of person.

518
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,719
I'm the kind

519
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,760
of person you are.

520
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,400
You kill, I burn.

521
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,679
I drink, you eat.

522
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,000
Or switch if you prefer.

523
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,280
You're my brother,

524
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,760
and I'm your buddy.

525
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,640
Ouyang...

526
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Ouyang Feng.

527
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:19,959
Mr. Ouyang.

528
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,120
From now on,

529
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,360
I'll go

530
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,480
wherever you go.

531
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,039
I'll support you

532
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,360
whenever you need.

533
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,880
Today I buried a buddy

534
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,920
and wanted to get wasted.

535
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,200
Drink or not?

536
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,359
Mr. Ouyang.

537
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
We don't know who he is.

538
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,119
Coming here through Sanguan Pass.

539
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,599
I don't care who he is.

540
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,480
Men are openhearted.

541
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,039
Don't worry too much.

542
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:52,959
Yes.

543
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,840
If you don't mind, Yaoshi,

544
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,679
share your troubles with me.

545
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,919
(Wine)
Please sit.

546
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,079
Confessing over wine brings relief.

547
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,399
What did she say?

548
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,440
She said...

549
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,000
What?

550
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,840
Kill me.

551
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,320
What? Kill you?

552
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,400
She wanted me

553
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,960
to kill her.

554
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,400
She said she's mine,

555
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,439
but I reject her,

556
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,239
so she can't live anymore.

557
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,760
Did you mishear her, Yaoshi?

558
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,360
You don't even know her name!

559
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,079
We have just

560
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,639
met twice.

561
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,679
Do you fall for her?

562
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,159
No.

563
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,000
Then

564
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
you are captivated

565
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,880
by her.

566
00:38:59,079 --> 00:38:59,919
Impossible.

567
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,720
In this world,

568
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,360
no one understands me anymore.

569
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,079
You are

570
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,039
too heartbroken.

571
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,320
Heartache strikes,

572
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
days drag like years.

573
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,119
Either be trapped forever,

574
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,679
or escape feeling like reborn anew,

575
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,960
with no one surrounded.

576
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,119
I've been to your regions.

577
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,679
Vast lands, few people.

578
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,400
Walk hundreds of li,

579
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,000
you barely meet anyone.

580
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,760
People there are bold spirits.

581
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,079
It's rare to find

582
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,360
someone like you

583
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,800
who's sensitive about love.

584
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,119
Once a Westerner

585
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,639
had great wealth,

586
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,960
many followers

587
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,919
and multiple wives.

588
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,679
He had two sons.

589
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,519
The elder was

590
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,640
clever and cautious,

591
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,240
born to the legitimate wife.

592
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,480
The younger

593
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,999
was also clever,

594
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,239
born to the concubine

595
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,360
from here,

596
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,039
and won the most favor.

597
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,960
But that Westerner died.

598
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,239
The concubine took her son

599
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,639
to travel afar

600
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,280
(and endured the hardships.)

601
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,920
(They journeyed afar)

602
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,079
(to seek a man.)

603
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,440
(Only then did the son)

604
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,120
(realize that man)

605
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,039
(was his real father.)

606
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,840
(The concubine and that man)

607
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,119
(were only together for days,)

608
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,559
(yet she longed for him for long.)

609
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,159
But that man

610
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,519
feared the influential

611
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,519
Westerner's clan

612
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,519
and refused to take

613
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,400
them in,

614
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,440
so the concubine killed the man.

615
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,960
Then she took her son again

616
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,880
to travel afar

617
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,039
and endure the hardships,

618
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,639
returned to the influential

619
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,559
Westerner's clan,

620
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
entrusted her son to

621
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,840
the elder son,

622
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,840
and then took her own life.

623
00:40:59,119 --> 00:40:59,959
She said,

624
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,079
if she couldn't be

625
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,919
with that man,

626
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,679
then try luck

627
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:05,919
in the underworld.

628
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,480
Are you the elder son

629
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,680
or younger son?

630
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,120
The younger son.

631
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,920
My brother treated me well,

632
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,719
but after growing up,

633
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,960
I wanted to come visit.

634
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,800
You should go see

635
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,639
the woman who's unsettled your heart.

636
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,840
Forget it.

637
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:47,879
This world

638
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,320
is full of pitiful souls.

639
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,359
Meet her once more

640
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,679
to learn her name.

641
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:55,959
So what

642
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,760
then?

643
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,400
It will make you

644
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,360
remember her.

645
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,199
Better than

646
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,280
remembering a stranger.

647
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,840
Come on.

648
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,680
Help us.

649
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,160
Try harder.

650
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,760
Push! Harder!

651
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,639
Put Young Leader back in the carriage.

652
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,920
That monster won't chase us.

653
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,840
We can't Gang Leader to see

654
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,239
Young Leader like this

655
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,280
when we return.

656
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,600
Well...

657
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:53,399
Seventeen.

658
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,639
He died at Kuizhou branch.

659
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,159
When we reach Jiangling,

660
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,600
will Gang Leader

661
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,159
kill us?

662
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:03,399
Yes.

663
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,079
I don't want to return.

664
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,280
Who else refuses to return?

665
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:28,679
Anyone else?

666
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,000
Put Young Leader

667
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,760
back in the carriage.

668
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,039
Deng Zhao.

669
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,720
Seventeen.

670
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,599
Go to the post house and monitor
the sorcerer and those Westerners.

671
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,239
Report their whereabouts

672
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,280
to headquarters.

673
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,640
Mr. Ouyang.

674
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
We're traveling together.
Don't give me any gold.

675
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,880
It means nothing to me.

676
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,960
Just provide food and shelter.

677
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
You can take mine.

678
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,239
I have a dozen gold ingots.

679
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,680
Use them as needed.

680
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,920
Is that painting valuable?

681
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:25,119
Did you check it?

682
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,359
No.

683
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,280
In Kuizhou,

684
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,800
when the Salt Gang guy checked it,

685
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,079
and I saw it.

686
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,000
The woman in the painting is Liu Rusi.

687
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,239
My trip to Lin'an is

688
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,519
to bring her back.

689
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,760
Are you marrying her?

690
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,000
It's my brother.

691
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,599
She'll be my sister-in-law,

692
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,760
but not yet.

693
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:49,959
Dian,

694
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,880
am I pretty?

695
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,800
Do I seem not womanly?

696
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,280
You're the fairest.

697
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,800
But being womanly means nothing.

698
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,600
Why?

699
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,719
It's you to decide

700
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:03,679
whether you look pretty.

701
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:05,760
It's men to decide

702
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,239
if you are womanly.

703
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:09,440
Men aren't reliable.

704
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,440
When they fancy you,

705
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:12,640
they like your beauty.

706
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,679
When they lose interest,

707
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:16,360
no beauty matters.

708
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,680
That's perfect.

709
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,960
If you meet someone you fancy

710
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,519
who doesn't care for you,

711
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,119
that breeds resentment.

712
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,760
Then kill him.

713
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:27,159
Killing solves nothing.

714
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,280
The resentment remains.

715
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:30,519
Once he's dead,

716
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,400
what's left to resent?

717
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,720
Resent yourself.
