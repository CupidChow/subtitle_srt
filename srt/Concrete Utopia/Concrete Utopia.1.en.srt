We can't reach the police or fire department?

22
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,370
Is it really safe here?

23
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,210
How could we know that?

24
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,050
- What if it collapses?
- It's my first earthquake, too.

25
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,550
Better off here. They're freezing to death outside.

I'd rather be crushed than freeze.

28
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,620
Is there any backup generator?

29
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,600
At least get the water running.

30
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,820
Everyone just calm down! We're trying our best!

31
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,390
The water at least...

32
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,230
We've got 22 bottles of water.

33
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,340
Okay, 22 bottles of water.

34
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,620
How long do you think this will last us?

35
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,120
The rice cakes Dad sent haven't gone bad yet.

36
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,530
I don't know.

37
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,630
Maybe a week?

38
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,810
We should've gone to Walmart when you suggested it last weekend.

39
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,570
How can this happen?

40
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,570
I really think we should go to Dad.

41
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,290
I told you, it's too dangerous.

42
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,460
Let's wait just a bit.

43
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,850
A rescue team will come soon.

44
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,860
Don't worry, we'll be okay.

46
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,050
I said who are you?

47
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,910
Excuse me.

48
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,350
My son is so cold...

49
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm so sorry, but can my boy sleep in there?

50
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,850
I'm begging you.

51
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,150
You're the only one who opened the door!

52
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,900
Help us, please?

53
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,410
Our situation...

54
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,450
Wait!

55
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,440
This is super expensive.

56
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,770
Take this, and at least help my son.

57
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,590
What is it?

58
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,570
I'm from Dream Palace across the street. Please help!

59
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,800
There are three buttons. Push the top one.

60
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,790
Then turn this to make the light stronger, shall I show you?

61
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes, please.

62
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,450
- Turn it like this...
- I see.

63
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Thank you!

64
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,080
We're all just helping each other.

65
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,160
- Sleep tight!
- Yes!

66
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,300
- Get some rest.
- Yes.

67
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,080
Give me some ramyun and water.

68
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,880
Have any gasoline?

69
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,390
What are you selling?

70
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,880
NO CASH WILL ACCEPT LIGHTERS, GAS, WATER

71
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,520
Do you take batteries?

72
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,600
Would you take this?

73
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,970
How could that pipsqueak steal everything I have?

74
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,720
Get out! Get out, you thief!

75
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,460
We should just kick out these damned outsiders.

76
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,270
Are they American or German roaches? Why are they so big?

<i>Hello?</i>

79
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,110
Are you getting the signal? Over.

80
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,370
There's no rescue signal. Just a squeaking sound.

81
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,710
"Over"

82
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,060
Over.

83
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
You're back?

84
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,000
It's cold, right?

85
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,010
What is it?

86
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,230
Ta-dah!

87
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,840
What's this? Where'd you get it?

88
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,540
Eat it, quick.

89
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,270
Let's share it.

90
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,180
Just this once!

91
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Let's have it ourselves. It was so hard to get this.

92
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,610
Still...

93
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,730
Hurry up... Here.

94
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,610
Is it good?

95
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,930
Have a bite.

96
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,890
There's another fight out there. With the outsiders

97
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,200
Can't people just be humane, peace loving citizens?

98
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,800
Don't worry.

99
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,420
Whatever happens, I'll protect you.

100
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,820
So impressive, my husband...

101
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,120
Now?

102
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,670
Lady!

103
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,060
What?

104
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,380
Bone... bone...

105
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,710
- What?
- What bone?

106
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,810
Boning who?

107
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,310
I wanted to make bone soup, since it's lunchtime.

108
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,230
Sure...

109
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,370
Oh, I disturbed your eating...

110
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,830
Tell them thank you!

111
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,010
Slow down!

112
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,370
<i>They're so shameless, even while living off us.</i>

113
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,490
We were greedy, eating it ourselves.

114
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,720
You said it was hard for you too when you had to pay rent.

115
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,810
That was totally different. We're a crisis now!

116
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,160
We take them in, and they act like it's their home.

117
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,620
Beat it! Just get out!

118
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,340
- Honey - Those assholes!

119
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,090
Where are you going?

120
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,240
Wait here.

121
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,500
Honey, are you okay?

122
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,000
First, lie him down.

123
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,160
Are you a doctor?

124
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,920
A nurse.

125
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,960
A nurse?

126
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,540
Somebody bring a clean cloth or towel!

127
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,970
Mr. Oh! Are you okay?

128
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,950
How did he get hurt?

129
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,090
How could this happen?

130
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,690
What's that smoke?

131
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,480
Fire! There's a fire!

132
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,220
Move back!

133
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,080
Get up, quick!

134
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,220
Move back!

135
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,360
Out of the way!

136
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,390
Mister!

137
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,300
He went in!

138
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,870
Out of the way!

139
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,760
Pull this over here!

140
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,690
Hurry!

141
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,600
The water tank is frozen, it won't work!

142
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,790
Pull it that way!

143
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,950
Hurry!

144
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,090
Go!

145
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,910
The water isn't running!

146
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,550
Quick!

147
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,700
Grab it. Grab it here.

148
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,390
- In the back!
- Yes!

149
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,050
Pull the hose!

150
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,030
You throat still stings?

151
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Are you okay?

152
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:14,820
I'm fine.

153
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,830
It was this man here!

154
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,820
So this was the man...

155
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,290
Oh my, your face is all black.

156
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,320
I'm the head of the women's council.

157
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,870
Oh, hello.

158
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,730
You saved us from a disaster. How could you be so brave?

159
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,570
Can't let it collapse, this is the only one left.

160
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,290
The building won't collapse from a fire on the first floor.

161
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,170
Where do you live?

162
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,640
You're on the 9th floor?

163
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,570
So am I.

164
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,400
We came down in the elevator, that time.

165
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,050
Oh, right.

166
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,940
I'm in #902.

167
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,670
An old woman lives there.

168
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,280
You're her son!

169
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,690
If it weren't for him, we'd all have burned to death.

170
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,860
No, it was nothing.

171
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,470
That young guy...

172
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,470
He and the other residents did a great job.

173
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,660
<i>The guy who got stabbed owns the apartment.</i>

174
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,940
He was out in the cold, then came home.

175
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,350
But a pack of strangers were camped in his living room, so he blew up.

176
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,830
For them, freezing outside or getting stabbed in here is all the same,

177
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,290
so out comes the knife! And since that didn't work...

178
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,370
Oh, hello!

179
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,220
Joo-ran, come here and check in!

180
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,190
Hello.

181
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,550
- What happened to your head?
- Mom! Mom!

182
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,730
Here, each of you take one. One each!

183
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,720
You there! No, no no!

184
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,140
You who took two! Give it back.

185
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,580
Or I'll take all of these back!

186
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,220
Excuse me!

187
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,280
Listen up...

188
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,880
Shall we start our meeting on the outsiders issue?

189
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,200
Yes!

190
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,930
So, is it only residents here at the meeting?

191
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,700
I, Kim Keum-ae, can guarantee the identity of everyone here.

192
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,450
On your way in, I checked each of you in the register.

193
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,090
- Can I...?
- Yes, go ahead.

194
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,140
We lived in Samyoung Villa for 20 years,

195
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,020
and moved in here just 3 weeks ago.

196
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,550
Where's Samyoung Villa?

197
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,910
You know the pedestrian overpass? Across from there, by the church.

198
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,890
In the back...

199
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,320
- Oh, that one?
- It was meant to be.

200
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,140
- Good for you.
- Lucky to move here.

201
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,230
Thank you.

202
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,450
To be honest,

203
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,210
I think we should evict them all.

204
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,510
It took us 23 years, to earn enough for this home.

205
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,550
Moving to this side of the street...

206
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,190
My wife and I worked our tails off to come here...

207
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,920
Hold on.

208
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,770
You say "evict", but in this weather you're telling them to go die.

209
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,010
Some people have no...

210
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,380
How can you say that?

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,330
You think I enjoy this?

212
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:14,230
Then how about only letting, them stay until the rescue team comes?

213
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,690
Rescue team? Seen any helicopter pass by?

214
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,160
Nothing but sparrows.

215
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,970
Right, and soon we'll be all out of food and water.

216
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,040
What will you say then?

217
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,470
You're too dramatic.

218
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,570
At times like this, you need to act cautiously and rationally...

219
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,760
You can die rationally, I'm going to live dramatically!

220
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,380
What did you say? You told me to die, pig?

221
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,470
How old are you anyway?

222
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,530
- I'm 99, why?
- Stop.

223
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,020
Stop your bullshit!

224
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,930
This complex is finished.

225
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,830
- Letting in trash like you.
- Where do you live, bastard?

226
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,460
# 1004, bastard!

227
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,140
Will you please stop!

228
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,920
If you're going to fight, then just leave.

229
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,910
Stop this.

230
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,960
Let's return to the main point.

231
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,650
Almost all the outsiders here come from Dream Palace.

232
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,210
Right!

233
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,660
Remember how they used to look down on us?

234
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,630
Putting up gates, screaming about keeping school districts separate.

235
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,570
Honestly, if the tables were turned they'd send us all packing.

236
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,600
Even worse.

237
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,700
That's right.

238
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
Still...

239
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,100
Shouldn't we try to find a way to all live together?

240
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,990
Seeing it from their point of view...

241
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,090
All live together, or all die together?

242
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,490
From their point of view, should we all get stabbed and die?

243
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,480
No, but...

244
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,680
Generosity comes from full stomachs. But food's running low.

245
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,700
It's easy to say we'll help, but you saw what happened today.

246
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,190
And even if we sit still, there's no guarantee they'll do the same.

247
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,630
Why make such unrealistic proposals?

248
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,350
Then you think we should evict them?

249
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,110
I'm saying we should consider it.

250
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,100
You from #602, what do you think?

251
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,620
He's a public servant.

252
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,380
Don't public servants have plans for this type of emergency?

253
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,220
He's a public servant?

254
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,830
Sure...

255
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,780
Yes, well...

256
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,140
First, in an emergency I think it's important to build a system.

257
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,500
From an organization, and pool our strength to solve the crisis.

258
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,070
Pool our strength how?

259
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,970
I could've said that!

260
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,300
The reason everyone is talking at once

261
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,280
is that we don't have someone to decide things.

262
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,190
So we need someone here to stand at the center.

263
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,240
Right.

264
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,250
Right, we need a leader. A delegate.

265
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,950
- Right.
- But who?

266
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,570
Someone who's lived here the longest, with the most age and experience?

267
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,620
The ones who have lived here longest are this gentleman and lady.

268
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,180
- Why don't you just do it?
- Should be a man, of course.

269
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,100
No, they say women are stronger in a crisis.

270
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,980
Right.

271
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,360
People, there's something more important than strength.

272
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,360
Self-sacrifice.

273
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,330
Who knows if he's alive or dead,

274
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,130
but remember Lee, our leader in the redevelopment fight?

275
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,560
- Right.
- Remember? A man of wrath.

276
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,100
We need a man who could risk his life for us,

277
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,710
and with eyes blazing,

278
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,810
leap into the heat of a roaring flame!

279
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:25,450
Couldn't we entrust the fate of Hwang Gung Apartments to such a man?

280
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,430
A person of such dependability and decisiveness!

281
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,510
It's unanimous.

282
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:45,030
Kim Young-tak of #902 has been voted our provisional Resident Delegate.

283
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,110
Everyone give him a hand.

284
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,790
Sure...

285
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,970
What was his job?

286
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:05,420
I feel like our apartment complex has been chosen.

287
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,830
And so, we must all survive to the very end, and...

288
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,380
Yes, please.

289
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,260
That's all.

290
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,850
Yes!

291
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,850
M...

292
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,890
KIM YOUNG-TAK

293
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,450
Sign here.

294
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,250
Next, take two stones.

295
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,620
So I'll explain again...

296
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,500
"Evict" is the white stone. "Disagree" is the black stone.

297
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,410
You can only put in one.

298
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,530
You can't put in both.

299
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,410
Yes, please.

300
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,810
Okay, put one in.

301
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,080
Then, you go out.

302
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,040
Put the other stone here. Right.

303
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,090
Then you go out. That way, yes.

304
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,950
But you need to come back.

305
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,430
Yes, please.

306
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,930
Shall we start?

307
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,330
Yes!

308
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,710
Have another of these.

309
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,260
- Come in.
- Yes.

310
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,240
# 602. Name, Min-sung.

311
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,120
- Valuable human resources...
- I see.

312
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,190
It's a landslide.

313
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,480
- What was white again?
- Evict.

314
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,310
And the result is!

315
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,890
A majority have decided to evict the outsiders. Right?

316
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,510
So Mr. Delegate, what's your plan?

317
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,390
Well... we better plan something.

318
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,640
They'll plan something, I guess...

319
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,650
Plan what?

320
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,730
If people are evicted, where will they go?

321
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,960
I don't know, let's just sleep.

322
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,900
There'll be some place they can go.

323
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,990
This building survived, right?

324
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,030
Honey, when you voted, what color did you put in?

325
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,150
They said not to tell even your spouse.

326
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,000
<i>Hey lady, over!</i>

327
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,470
What's going on, over!

328
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,350
I told you to call me Sis.

329
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,010
Need to poop?

330
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,290
Yes I do.

331
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,040
Let's go. Give me this.

332
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,800
Careful.

333
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,900
Push!

334
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,760
Push!

335
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
Push!

336
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,810
Over here! Come and help!

337
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,820
Again! One, two!

338
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,280
Hyo-jin, just a second! We'll get you out!

339
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,080
What's that?

340
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,020
Help! Help...

341
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,750
Hyo-jin, I'm sorry!

342
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,190
Min-sung, you'll need to head our anti-crime task force.

343
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,500
What? But I...

344
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,490
I don't know how to do this.

345
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,540
You're young, and did your military service not long ago.

346
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,440
Someone like you needs to help out.

347
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,790
I'll be counting on you.

348
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,150
So here we have 136 households, 219 survivors in all.

349
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,310
The people I mentioned before are task force leaders.

350
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,120
We chose people who served in the military.

351
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,540
So... yes?

352
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,460
- I used to work at Happiness Realty.
- Yes, I know.

353
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,180
Since this is a sensitive a matter concerning apartment safety,

354
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,010
shouldn't the leaders all be homeowners?

355
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,340
Why look at me? We have a lot of loans, but it's our home.

356
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,280
Don't make assumptions.

357
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,460
Just thought I'd check.

358
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,640
The banks have all collapsed, who cares about loans now?

359
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,100
- You've got the deed?
- Of course.

360
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,910
Then it's your home.

361
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,710
Outside everything has crumbled, only this building is left.

362
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,200
Honestly, there's no difference now between a murderer and a pastor.

363
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,610
There's no high and low. Everyone is equal.

364
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,670
Everything's has been reset. Am I wrong?

365
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,190
Anyway,

366
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,630
leaders, spread the word, and let's meet at dawn tomorrow.

367
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,380
Won't we need take some weapons?

368
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,690
You mean we should carry clubs or something?

369
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,820
Isn't it obvious?

370
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,200
You think they're just going to file out willingly?

371
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,910
But we have no intention of killing anyone or whatever.

372
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,590
- It's just in case.
- Excuse me.

373
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,500
I'm sorry, but my health is not good.

374
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,710
I'm sorry.

375
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,170
What? You're quitting?

376
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,510
Yes, I'm sorry.

377
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,080
If you do this, soon everyone will drop out!

378
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,990
No, sir. My health is truly not good

379
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,200
How bad can it be? This guy here was stabbed!

380
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,510
Right!

381
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,500
Sure, I understand.

382
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,710
- Oh my!
- Let go.

383
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,680
Excuse me.

384
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,200
How can you be so egotistical?

385
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,280
You said picked people who served in the military.

386
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,720
I was exempted from duty. Kidney disease.

387
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,590
- Well then...
- Ma'am.

388
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,990
I assume you'll find a replacement for me.

389
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,020
Good luck.

390
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,560
I guess his kidneys never recovered.

391
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,300
Just a second, almost done.

392
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,610
All done now.

393
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,400
Smells like strawberries!

394
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,100
I'll be back.

395
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,400
<i>Attention, please!</i>

396
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,920
<i>Everyone who is not a resident of this complex,</i>

397
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,510
<i>- please gather in front of the building.</i>
- Thank you!

398
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,760
Hurry, or the better homes will get taken.

399
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,690
See you later!

400
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,540
<i>- I repeat.</i>
- Bye!

401
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,800
<i>We will distribute empty homes to people from the outside.</i>

402
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,060
<i>We request your prompt cooperation!</i>

403
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,220
So cold...

404
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,410
What are they doing?

405
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,460
What is that?

406
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,960
Thanks to all who contributed their efforts to the renovation campaign.

407
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,950
Now...

408
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:43,660
Now, I have something unfortunate to tell you.

409
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,830
Those who are not residents of Hwang Gung Apartments

410
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,200
are kindly asked to leave this complex.

411
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,860
What?

412
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,590
I repeat.

413
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:01,120
From today, non-resident outsiders are not allowed to live here.

414
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,690
We ask you to leave quickly.

415
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,120
- What the hell?
- What are you talking about?

416
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,160
You said you'd distribute empty homes!

417
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,490
Are those empty homes yours?

418
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,590
Did the owners transfer them to you?

419
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,150
You're acting like you own them!

420
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,980
Who are you to order us to leave?

421
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,980
Calm down.

422
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,720
Are you telling all of us to freeze to death?

423
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,060
Chief Park!

424
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,770
Chairperson!

425
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,130
I've worked here for 20 years!

426
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,770
Chairperson! Say something!

427
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,090
I can't believe you people!

428
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,170
Don't do this, okay?

429
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,700
Do you know who this person here is?

430
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,460
This is our district's Congressman, Yu Doo-hyun.

431
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,660
- Heard of him?
- No.

432
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,490
Let's solve this with dialogue.

433
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,410
Please lower your weapons.

434
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,540
People! You need to remain calm!

435
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,840
We may be living through this difficult time,

436
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,770
but if we all team together, we can beat this, right?

437
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,980
Right!

438
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,840
Hey!

439
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,870
Congressman,

440
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,330
please leave.

441
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,650
What the hell?

442
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,190
Who are you to tell him to leave?

443
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,790
Me? I'm the resident delegate.

444
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,850
Who the hell cares?

445
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,360
I'm Yu Doo-hyun! Don't you watch TV?

446
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,130
Just shut up, and please leave.

447
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,030
You told the Congressman to shut up?

448
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,020
People! Let's go in!

449
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,370
You bastards!

450
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:31,210
- Let's push our way in!
- Let's go!

451
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,420
Mr. Delegate, are you okay?

452
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,150
Let's go!

453
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,390
Push!

454
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,040
Push!

455
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:45,310
Stop them!

456
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,670
Stop them!

457
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,560
Wait, don't push!

458
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,180
Wait!

459
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,400
You assholes!

460
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,250
Mr. Delegate!

461
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,530
Mr. Delegate, are you okay?

462
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,860
Blood!

463
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,080
What?

464
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,890
Get out!

465
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,820
Everyone out!

466
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,580
Get out!

467
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,840
Get the hell out!

468
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,980
Go!

469
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,270
Beat it!

470
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:15,970
Get out!

471
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,670
Beat it, assholes!

472
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,150
You bastards!

473
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,580
We'll be back!

474
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,690
Bring a towel!

475
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,050
NON-RESIDENT DENIED ENTRY

476
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,730
Good luck.

477
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,160
Thank you.

478
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,920
Thank for you efforts.

479
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,710
Thank you.

480
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,110
You look sexy!

481
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,650
- He does.
- Don't say that...

482
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,990
Long live our apartment complex!

483
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,340
Yes, long live our apartments.

484
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,190
Long live our apartment complex!

485
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,080
Long live Kim Young-tak!

486
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,880
Long live our apartment complex!

487
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,550
Long live our apartment complex!

488
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,180
Long live Kim Young-tak!

489
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,070
Long live Kim Young-tak!

490
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,190
Long live our Delegate!

491
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,150
Long live Kim Young-tak!

492
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,260
Our apartments belong to the residents!

493
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,470
Our apartments belong to the residents!

494
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:38,840
Our apartments belong to the residents!

495
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,190
Our apartments belong to the residents!

496
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,450
Our apartments!

497
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,430
Our apartments!

498
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,260
Belong to the residents!

499
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,340
Our apartments!

500
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,700
Our apartments!

501
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,960
Belong to the residents!

502
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,220
Belong to the residents!

503
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,470
Our apartments!

504
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,850
Our apartments!

505
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,060
Belong to the residents!

506
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,190
Belong to the residents!

507
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,800
Our apartments!

508
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,180
Our apartments!

509
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,470
Belong to the residents!

510
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,900
Belong to the residents!

511
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,740
Mr. Delegate!

512
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,000
Delegate Kim!

513
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,610
Hello.

514
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,210
Hello.

515
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,000
Hello!

516
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,390
We appreciate your hard work during our renewal drive.

517
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,310
Today I'd like to talk about Resident Regulations.

518
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,030
Resident Regulations

519
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,670
1. Apartments belong to residents. Only residents may live here. (etc.)

520
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,720
The only people allowed inside this complex are residents.

521
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,210
No, this way, Min-sung.

522
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,020
Up against the side.

523
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,920
<i>To maintain public order, it is forbidden to go in and out at will.</i>

524
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,060
NON-RESIDENTS DENIED ENTRY

525
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,380
Rations are provided according to one's contributions.

526
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,630
So that all is fair.

527
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,640
We can't have some people work and others slack off, right?

528
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,520
Min-sung?

529
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,170
Yes!

530
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,430
<i>The Anti-Crime is in charge of patrols and maintaining order.</i>

531
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,940
<i>Men between the ages of 16 and 60 are all eligible.</i>

532
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,640
<i>- You can come to me and sign up.</i>
- Loyalty!

533
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,400
Loyalty!

534
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,070
<i>The Rations Force, to regulate distribution of limited resources</i>

535
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,540
<i>will issue rations periodically according to set regulations.</i>

536
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,840
<i>The Maintenance Force improves living space</i>

537
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,850
<i>and takes the lead in repairing electricity and heating.</i>

538
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,130
Wow, Dad, you're the best!

539
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:51,850
<i>The Medical Force provides medical care and welfare services on each floor.</i>

540
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,630
Now, don't trade this medicine for liquor like last time!

541
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,450
Oh, shit...

542
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,880
And most important, waste management.

543
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,770
<i>This practice of dumping one's waste anywhere you like</i>

544
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,760
<i>does not befit proper human beings.</i>

545
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,960
Hello there!

546
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,110
That's a full one.

547
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,320
Goddamn creep...

548
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,330
We must trade, conserve, share, rescue and exchange our resources!

549
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,800
And then, fire prevention!

550
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,630
If you start fires anywhere you want, we'll all end up roasted.

551
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,800
Plus,

552
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,400
we can't have disease spread, so maintain personal hygiene!

553
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,630
Let's all live well together!

554
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,410
Most important is not to be afraid!

555
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,630
Whatever it's like outside, whoever is there,

556
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,020
if we're not scared, we'll win.

557
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,570
If we don't want our families to starve,

558
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,410
our Anti-Crime Force must be brave, right?

559
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,400
Yes, that's right!

560
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,880
- Shall we shout our slogan?
- Yes!

561
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,620
Okay.

562
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,850
One, two, three!

563
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,170
Hooray Hwang Gung! Hooray Hwang Gung!

564
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,260
Let's go! Win!

565
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,720
Watch where you step.

566
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,380
- Careful, on the left!
- Yes.

567
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,930
Don't be startled.

568
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,140
Isn't that Congressman we saw last time?

569
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,210
He liked to talk big, but now he's dead.

570
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,170
If you leave the apartments, you die.

571
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,550
What's that?

572
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,470
Honey!

573
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,050
Are you okay?

574
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,670
Yeah.

575
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,240
Good luck.

576
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,200
Not that we can use any of this.

577
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,530
Thanks for bringing this... moldy food.

578
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,080
Okay, one, two, three!

579
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,820
Hooray Hwang Gung! Hooray Hwang Gung!

580
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,770
Let's go! Win!

581
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,470
<i>The building was standing so they went in,</i>

582
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,650
but when they opened the door,

583
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,630
corpses were everywhere!

584
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,320
<i>And it was all the result of human violence!</i>

585
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,630
<i>Oh my... Beast with human faces...</i>

586
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,360
Is this edible?

587
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,470
It should be okay.

588
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,700
We only have a few days of food, now.

589
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,480
We're in trouble...

590
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,060
All done now.

591
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,670
One, two, three!

592
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,140
Hooray Hwang Gung! Hooray...

593
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,510
Give it some spirit!

594
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,400
One, two, three!

595
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,070
Hooray Hwang Gung!

596
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,070
Let's go!

597
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,850
Win!

598
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,890
Let's go!

599
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,450
How did you meet your wife?

600
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,510
At the university, on a blind date.

601
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,810
What department?

602
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,080
Public Administration.

603
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,360
So your dream was to be a public servant, then?

604
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,500
Yes, please.

605
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,910
My parents died early.

606
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,810
I had no big ambitions,

607
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,910
I just dreamed of creating a stable family life.

608
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,830
So I married early,

609
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,220
barely managed to buy an apartment...

610
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:58,910
The strength of a nation deviates from this integration of the home...

611
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,900
You know that saying, to protect your family is patriotic.

612
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,500
The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home?

613
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,570
Yes, that's what I just said.

614
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,830
I had a family, too.

615
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,000
Though we didn't live together.

616
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,930
Then your family...?

617
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,860
But do you plan to have children?

618
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,330
- Last year we had a miscarriage...
- I'm sorry for asking.

619
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,260
It's okay.

620
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,990
I see.

621
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,200
It's not that we did anything wrong,

622
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,360
but something happened,

623
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,610
and it was really hard for Myung-hwa.

624
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:09,900
Still, we'll all be rewarded.

625
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,200
For all the trouble we're going through now.

626
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,080
We'll all be rewarded.

627
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,430
<i>Lady!</i>

628
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,160
<i>Hey, Lady!</i>

629
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,410
What?

630
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,850
- The walkie-talkie!
- Hey!

631
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,670
You little brat, be quiet!

632
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,080
Joo-mong, what's going on?

633
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,430
Joo-mong?

634
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,610
<i>You have to say "Over".</i>

635
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,650
Right... "Over".

636
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,250
<i>Mister, what number apartment is this?</i>

637
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,870
<i>Hey, you! Stop it!</i>

638
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,110
<i>I'm telling you, stop! Go to your mother now!</i>

639
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,460
Just a minute... hello?

640
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,750
<i>That boy stayed at our house before.</i>

641
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,840
<i>Are you with his mom? I think I can help you.</i>

642
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,520
<i>Yes? Hello?</i>

643
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,220
Came to the right place.

644
00:49:58,550 --> 00:49:59,970
These really is something

645
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,590
Son, you think you can open that by pulling?

646
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,790
Grab by the lock and twist.

647
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,290
- I'll check out the area behind.
- Okay.

648
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:19,880
Then you try it!

649
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,870
Huh?

650
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Push, push!

651
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,840
What?

652
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,260
Ji-hyuk?

653
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:37,980
He's got a gun!

654
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,890
You shitheads!

655
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,520
Just you try laying a finger on my store!

656
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,210
I'll blast a hole in his damn skull!

657
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,750
All right, okay.

658
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,650
We'll just leave, so please lower the gun.

659
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,110
I won't fall for it any more, shitheads!

660
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,150
Please calm down.

661
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:55,760
We'll go, honestly. Please let him go.

662
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,610
- You take me for a fool?
- Please save me!

663
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,380
We're going. Let's go!

664
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,680
Yes!

665
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,720
Shit, don't move!

666
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,490
Let's go...

667
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,910
Grab him!

668
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,570
Take the gun!

669
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,590
Shit!

670
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,940
Grab him! Grab that bastard!

671
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:31,160
Ji-hyuk!

672
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,890
Hey!

673
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:32,730
Is he okay?

674
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,020
Yes, I think it hit his helmet.

675
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,770
You asshole!

676
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,010
How could you take a young kid hostage?

677
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,350
Bastard!

678
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,880
Don't you have any shame? You bastard!

679
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,690
Let's get the stuff.

680
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,740
Yes, please.

681
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,760
Wow, it's a party!

682
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,880
Hey, put that in!

683
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,820
This is a real feast!

684
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,530
Hey, I get whatever's left!

685
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
Ji-hyuk lived thanks to you.

686
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,460
Good job.

687
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,740
Take the dog!

688
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,990
Let's get going!

689
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,120
Daddy...

690
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,950
Daddy...

691
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:09,620
Honey... Oh no!

692
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,010
Daddy...

693
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,290
Did you guys hear the rumor?

694
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,640
What rumor?

695
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,870
The apartment complex?

696
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,340
You dumb shit, you believe that?

697
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,170
An apartment complex here? It's been like this for two months.

698
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,640
Don't be stupid.

699
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,680
I heard it, too.

700
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,300
It's just like before. They say it's paradise.

701
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,310
Eat up.

702
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,990
I heard something different.

703
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,950
I heard they eat people there.

704
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,650
After spreading rumors about the paradise or whatever,

705
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,890
they use the people who show up as food, stringing them up,

706
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:35,380
letting the blood drain from their ankles...

707
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,420
Shit!

708
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,910
They run like cockroaches!

709
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:14,210
The Hwang Gung festival is about to begin. Applause!

710
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,340
Those people ate already.

711
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,080
The other side! Don't get them confused.

712
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,110
Don't serve them twice!

713
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,960
With your cheers and applause, the feast can truly begin!

714
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,300
Give us a cheer!

715
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,100
Ladies and gentleman, a new year is upon us.

716
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,840
Let's all shout it together. One, two, three!

717
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,360
- Let's have a Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

718
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,240
How long has it been since I've had meat?

719
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,760
The flesh of others is so tasty.

720
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:46,830
Bon appetit.

721
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,970
Aren't you eating?

722
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,990
Hey, Miss!

723
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,360
It was hard getting that meat. If you don't want it, I'll take it.

724
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,750
- No, we'll eat it.
- Sure, isn't it tasty?

725
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,820
Min-sung! Mr. Delegate wants you.

726
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,860
Come have a drink!

727
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,900
We'll borrow our Min-sung for a second!

728
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,630
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

729
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,380
Let's give a hand to our Anti-Crime Force leader!

730
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,790
Scoot over. Sit down here.

731
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,580
Have a drink. Do we have a glass?

732
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:48,210
Ji-hyuk, don't think of me as an old fart, just listen.

733
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,780
These hard times we're going through,

734
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,930
think of it as doing your military service early.

735
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,860
Besides, when you enter society, this all goes on your resume.

736
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,750
Are you a good student?

737
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,500
Huh?

738
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,530
Something's coming!

739
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,810
Don't change the subject.

740
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,260
Nothing's coming.

741
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:11,150
Something's really coming.

742
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,590
If there's nothing, you're dead.

743
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,720
It looks that way, right?

744
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,690
If you stare at one spot for too long, that's what happens.

745
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,280
Look!

746
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,370
What the hell?

747
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,470
What is that?

748
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,840
Ji-hyuk, what is that?

749
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,170
Huh?

750
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:38,110
<i>There's a road I want to travel.</i>

751
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,680
<i>It's been so hard and lonely...</i>

752
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,960
<i>She's a fierce one.</i>

753
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,200
Her father had an affair with the woman in #1010.

754
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,530
{\an8}OWNER: Moon Seung-hun / DAUGHTER: Moon Hye-won

755
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,580
Somehow she found out, and put up a hand-written poster!

756
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:10,620
So that woman fled and moved to a new place.

757
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,480
Not sure about her mom, but this girl made it back alone.

758
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:18,930
Hey you!

759
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,260
Hey!

760
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,550
Come here and say hello.

761
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,560
Remember the guy from next door?

762
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,870
No?

763
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,270
Nobody does these days.

764
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:36,300
- Are you all enjoying your meal?
- Yes!

765
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:44,470
I think our apartment complex is truly the best in Korea.

766
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,580
The most expensive!

767
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,190
And the best, right?

768
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,790
Yes!

769
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,850
For the first time since our renewal, we have a new resident.

770
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,430
Please say hello!

771
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,230
Population growth isn't easy.

772
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:14,210
But for any group to thrive, one must respect the rules.

773
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,530
What's the first rule of our complex?

774
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,860
- Our apartments belong to residents!
- I didn't hear, what was that?

775
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,400
Our apartments belong to the residents!

776
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,510
That's right!

777
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:33,820
Let's welcome our newest resident and family member.

778
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,300
Ms. Moon Hye-won from #903. Give her a hand!

779
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,110
Welcome!

780
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,750
Now you've got the mike, sing a song!

781
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,410
Are you kidding?

782
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,070
Don't hold back!

783
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,290
Sing a song! Sing a song!

784
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,600
Song no. 539.

785
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,720
Song no. 539!

786
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:05,940
To all our residents, I love you!

787
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:07,810
Love you too!

788
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,920
So sexy!

789

01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,140
Rah rah rah! Rah rah rah!

<i>Always there waiting, always there waiting...</i>

01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:47,000
<i>Your apartment waits for me...</i>

795
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,310
<i>Rah rah rah! Rah rah rah!</i>

796
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:51,820
<i>As abnormally low temperatures persist,</i>

797
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:55,850
<i>Korea continues to set new records for cold weather.</i>

798
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:58,970
<i>Today's daytime temperature will be minus 26 degrees.</i>

799
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:01,250
<i>Please dress warmly in the cold.</i>

800
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:03,890
<i>According to the Astronomical Research Institute,</i>

801
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,540
<i>a Gemini meteor shower will grace the night sky.</i>

802
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,940

01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:37,390
PLEASE PAY BY THIS WEEK! - CAREGIVER

806
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,460
What?

807
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,860
Why's the door unlocked, the lights out...?

808
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:52,850
Mom!

809
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:55,440
What were you doing?

810
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,390
Did you eat?

811
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,630
Kim Young-tak.

812
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,940
Who are you? How'd you get in here?

813
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,220
I moved in. I'll live here.

814
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,700
I'm reporting you for trespassing.

815
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,910
Give my money back!

816
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,570
I'm just listed as the power of attorney, I don't know anything.

817
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,620
I'm a victim, too.

818
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,070
I know you conspired together, don't give me that bullshit!

819
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,280
Pay me!

820
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,140
Or give me this house.

821
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:30,280
I can't believe this. I never even got a contract.

822
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,970
I never got any money!

823
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,220
Those guys will never be caught.

824
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,820
You'd have to turn the world upside down.

825
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,930
They just picked some naive jerks and ran their scam.

826
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,690
Naive jerks?

827
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,110
What's with you

828
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,250
What? Naive jerks?

829
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,870
I don't care if those other jerks go to the police or kill themselves,

830
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,410
but I'm not the one of those chumps. You picked the wrong guy.

831
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,640
Mun Seok-jo that realter fled the country.

832
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:57,340
And you got paid in your friend's name, Hong Man-gi!

833
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,530
I dug it all up, you scheming dirtbag!

Shit!

835
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:09,030
You're the idiot for throwing in cash for a cheap house!

836
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:12,000
If you don't like it, go through the courts!

837
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,440
Mr. Mo Se-beom, I'm sorry. Okay?

838
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,470
So get out of my house!

839
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,640
Get out!

840
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,610
You piece of shit!

841
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:52,000

842
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,370

Eat this, bastard!

846
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,260
Give back my money! My money!

<i>Dad, where are you?</i>

<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

<i>Debt collectors are coming to the store!</i>

<i>Don't touch that!</i>

862
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:48,670
I came here to solve that, but...

863
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:51,630
<i>Solve? What will you solve?</i>

864
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:55,310
<i>Have you ever solved anything your entire life?</i>

865
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,670
<i>- Stop!

01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,530

886
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,710

01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,050
Is this a joke? How can I live on this for a week?

900
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,700
Why didn't you fill the water bottle?

901
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:41,570
That's the last of we scraped up from the water tank.

902
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:43,420
Why raise a fuss? We're all struggling.

903
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,600
If you received your rations, hurry up and go.

904
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,300
All you do is sit around all day. Don't be so selfish.

905

Hurry up, everyone's waiting!

906
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:53,970
The Anti-Crime Force gets so much, and the rest of us should starve?

907
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,500
We distribute according to the work each person does.

908
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,640

909
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:59,410
Shut my mouth?

01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,270
Shut my mouth?

911
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,260
How do you think I ended up like this?

912
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,610
How the hell do you think this happened?

913
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:11,880
You think I don't know you kill people for a loaf of bread?

914
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:15,820
Kids or adults, you're all murderers!

915
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:17,370
How can you say that?

916
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:18,810
What did you just say?

917
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:20,910
Murderers?

918
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:24,940
Then instead of those cockroaches,

919
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:29,600
you think my son should die instead? Huh?

920
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,830
Does my son have to die?

921
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:35,340
If you're not happy here, just live. Go out and live on your own.

922
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,060
Look, we have canned pupae.

923
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:42,830
Not many people got these.

924
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:47,190
- Honey.
- Yeah?

925
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:49,820
Did you kill someone on the outside?

926
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:55,110
Who said that?

927
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:11,670
Well. there was one incident.

928
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:14,280
But I don't think he died.

929
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:16,580
He didn't die.

930
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,510
Why look at me like that?

931
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:26,860
Ji-hyuk was almost killed. You know Ji-hyuk.

932
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,390
I don't want you go to those searches anymore.

933
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,660
But everyone goes, how can I not?

934
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,270
I don't care if people call us selfish

935
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,600
The rations I get are plenty.

936
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,560
Myung-hwa...

937
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:01,490
Other people don't know you like I do.

938
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:05,000
You're not someone who can easily hurt other people.

939
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,490
It'll ruin you.

940
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:20,740
Hello.

941
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:21,480
Here.

942
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,640
We're always grateful.

943
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,660
Lady!

944
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:27,000
Hey! Get back inside!

945
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,250
- Thank you.
- Sure.

946
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,310
Lady!

947
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,290
Oh, you received your rations?

948
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,200
Yes, please.

949
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,700
Why wear your shoes in the house?

950
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,420
My feet are cold.

951
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,120
That's what I thought.

952
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:36,100
Oh my, those outsiders left a real mess here.

953
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,730
Still, you're lucky to have a home in times like those.

954
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:46,550
Shall I put this here?

955
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:52,940
Don't leave the house for long while this is on.

956
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,120
And you mustn't add fuel while it is still on.

957
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:03,750
I've lived right next door, but hardly ever seen you, right?

958
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:10,470
Must've been loud with my mother next door,

959
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,290
but I'm only visiting now.

960
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:17,880
- You know the old woman in #902?
- Yes.

961
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,170
So you do know her.

962
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:39,670
Need to circulate the air.

963
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,920
Open the window in the utility room. Try to bear the cold.

964
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:53,680
But tell me.

965
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,240
Why'd you say you don't remember me yesterday?

966
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,610
Do you remember me?

967
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,430
I think I remember.

968
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:14,490
That's right.

969
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:18,850
Neighbors should know each other's faces.

970
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:23,990
I'll be going.

971
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,530
You took the anti-inflammatory?

972
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,320
Yes.

973
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:43,820
Such pretty nails. Did you do them yourself?

974
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,390
You're quite the artist.

975
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,330
I never tried this myself.

976
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,840
Nurses aren't allowed to.

977
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,880
Luckily we had some extras.

978
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,220
What is it like outside?

979
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:07,720
I mean...

980
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,720
Is there any hope out there?

981
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,140
It's hell.

982
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,290
I heard a group of people live near Seoul Station.

983
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,990
Not sure if you'd call that hope.

984
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,070
Hey!

985
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,670
Hey you!

986
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:34,050
Did you look for your mom?

987
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,340
Why ask that?

988
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,110
Why not?

989
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,070
She'll come back if she's not dead.

990
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:42,470
How can a daughter talk that way?

991
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:44,200
She'd be upset to hear you.

992
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:45,490
Have you never been outside?

993
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:46,490
What?

994
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,800
You all seem bizarrely hopeful.

995
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,570
Even out front, there are piles of frozen bodies.

996
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,110
You're living in your own goddamn world.

997
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,980
Such an odd manner of speech.

998
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:01,310
We can't just accept anyone.

999
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:05,220
Oh my, look at her glare! Look! Oh my!

1000
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,720
She's hilarious.

1001
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:08,740
Hey girl.

1002
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:14,730
We worked our asses of renewing this place.

1003
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,220
But you just waltz in here one day, saying,

1004
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:21,170
"I'm a resident," and take our food, but do you produce anything?

1005
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,400
Only shit?

1006
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,360
So you should at least be polite.

1007
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,000
Look, we are all chosen people, you get it?

1008
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,590
Honestly, I don't know what you did on the outside, but we took you in.

1009
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:37,440
Then shouldn't you show us some gratitude?

1010
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,500
Please stop.

1011
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,580
Look at this color. Wow, it's so cute!

1012
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:45,120
What do you mean, took me in? It's my own home.

1013
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,930
Her mom was nice,

1014
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:51,590
but she's got a rotten temper like her father.

1015
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:54,780
Piss off! Why do you all talk shit to me?

1016
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,680
Piss off? I was talking shit?

1017
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,660
Hey, I was talking shit?

1018
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,710
Don't you dare glare at me?

1019
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,150
Hye-won!

1020
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,280
This place is bloody insane!

1021
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,450
I struggled to come home,

1022
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,140
but those women are crazy,

1023
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,070
and what's with that Delegate guy?

1024
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,940
Coming into someone else's home!

1025
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,030
Listen...

1026
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,380
It was some other wacko that lived next to me.

1027
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,220
That man is not my neighbor

1028
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:23,580
They leave him alone, why come after me?

1029
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,100
What are you saying?

1030
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,640
What? Hye-won...

1031
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,260
Where's Mr. Delegate?

1032
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,360
What?

1033
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:41,580
Find him, quick!

1034
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:42,810
- Mr. Delegate!
- What's going on?

1035
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,900
Mr. Delegate!

1036
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,450
- Something awful happened!
- Hurry!

1037
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:47,560
What's wrong?

1038
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:48,490
Hey, go check it out.

1039
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,780
Let's go.

1040
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:02,120
YOU APARTMENT BASTARDS ARE HEADING FOR AN EARLY GRAVE

1041
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:06,620
We kept saying not to go outside, why'd he do this?

1042
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,290
He was looking for gold teeth.

1043
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,260
Those cockroaches come right up to the gate.

1044
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:19,430
Shit, is this how they get revenge?

1045
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,960
Those goddamned pricks.

1046
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,410
From now on, strictly control who leaves the complex!

1047
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,140
And increase the number of guards.

1048
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:53,970
Yes, please.

1049
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,200
Everyone stay on your toes!

1050
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,310
- Yes!
- Yes, sir!

1051
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:08,140
Here, the nice lady said to give these to you.

1052
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:12,920
Hey, not there!

1053
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:35,920
<i>So you're home?</i>

1054
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,890
<i>Open up for a sec.</i>

1055
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,000
Ah, Mr. Delegate... What is it at this hour?

1056
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,150
- Oh my, you were eating?
- Yes.

1057
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,750
Sorry to interrupt.

1058
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:57,840
That's okay.

1059
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,120
Is this canned pupae?

1060
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,690
Not many people received these.

1061
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,910
They taste great with red pepper paste.

1062
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:21,280
After the military, I did every kind of work you can imagine.

1063
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,900
I failed in several businesses,

1064
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,340
did deliveries, over manual labor.

1065
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,320
You worked really hard.

1066
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,510
I worked my damn ass off.

1067
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,100
But sir...

1068
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,920
Back then, I wondered why this shitty world hard it in for me.

1069
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,000
But later I realized,

1070
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:47,120
those were all assets.

1071
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:52,220
Assets.

1072
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:57,730
When I look at a person, I can tell right away.

1073
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,620
Whether he's cheating me or not.

1074
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,090
I feel it in my bones.

1075
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:28,120
You shouldn't come in people's homes at night...

1076
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,340
Please leave.

1077
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,320
If you've got extra furniture, why not donate it?

1078
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,290
What?

1079
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,190
We're short of firewood.

1080
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,100
So before I call some people over

1081
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:08,610
to clear all this furniture away...

1082
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,690
We should clear out the stuff that's inside.

1083
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:28,340
Please. I'm begging you!

1084
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:31,920
Wait!

1085
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:33,710
We told you to get out!

1086
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:38,250
No, no!

1087
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:39,580
We'll die out there!

1088
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,500
Mr. Delegate!

1089
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,240
Let's talk this over, please!

1090
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,310
If this isn't murder, you asshole!

1091
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,700
These aren't the only ones hiding!

1092
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,440
- You bastard!
- Search everywhere!

1093
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,100
Let go of me!

1094
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:53,450
Move!

1095
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,340
Anything else there?

1096
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:04,830
Nothing.

1097
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,900
Mr. Delegate, what is this?

1098
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,820
Myung-hwa should know.

1099
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,370
Are you crazy?

1100
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,220
Do you know what you did?

1101
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:31,510
I know that saving people is your job, and part of your character.

1102
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:36,780
But there are situations where that isn't possible, like right now!

1103
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,110
Why isn't it possible?

1104
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,310
You think this is okay? How could they do this?

1105
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:45,100
You've gotten strange, like that Delegate or whatever.

1106
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,480
I even heard he was fake.

1107
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,310
What do you mean, fake? Who said that?

1108
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,350
Kim Young-tak never lived in that home.

1109
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,040
Who said that?

1110
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:02,290
The girl who moved into #903.

1111
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,260
You believe her?

1112
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:11,040
A kid who showed up out of now where?

1113
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:12,450
She lived next door, she must have seen his face!

1114
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,010
Just calm down!

1115
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:21,720
Please just listen to me, Myung-hwa!

1116
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:26,660
If we're thrown out, we're finished.

1117
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:27,980
We'll die!

1118
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:37,370
Until I come back,
don't open the door for anyone or do anything.

1119
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:38,830
All right?

1120
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:40,810
I'll be back.

1121
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,880
Where's #809?

1122
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,780
He's at the meeting hall.

1123
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,010
And the others?

1124
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,090
They're waiting on the ground floor.

1125
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:11,220
Mr. Delegate! I need to say something.

1126
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,140
This isn't an issue for me to decide on my own,

1127
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,420
so say it at tomorrow's residents meeting.

1128
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,260
I'll work harder, Mr. Delegate!

1129
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,500
I'll make sure this never happens again, please forgive us!

1130
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,520
Mr. Delegate!

1131
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:42,660
I'll do whatever you tell me, so please help.

1132
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:45,460
Min-sung, don't degrade yourself.

1133
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,230
Get up.

1134
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,370
Please forgive us!

1135
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,720
Min-sung.

1136
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:04,720
From now on, word harder for the sake of our apartments.

1137
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:11,040
Thank you... thank you!

1138
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:16,310
Whatever we do, there's no need for guilt, and no need for pride.

1139
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,030
We're doing the obvious thing.

1140
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,260
Protecting our families.

1141
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:26,370
Come, get up.

1142
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,380
Yes!

1143
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:56,410
Go in!

1144
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,880
Honey!

1145
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,300
Most of you know this already,

1146
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:07,710
but last night we had an unfortunate incident in our complex.

1147
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,620
<i>One of our residents was hiding a group of cockroaches.</i>

1148
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,800
<i>{\an8}LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF</i>

1149
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:19,810
Come out here!

1150
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:22,380
Honey! Honey!

1151
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:23,600
Come out!

1152
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,420
Thanks to #307 Yong-ik's courageous accusation,

1153
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:34,640
we tracked down a group of roaches.

1154
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,390
Let's give him a hand.

1155
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:43,960
<i>Last night's incident tells us there are still outsiders</i>

1156
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:46,460
<i>hiding here and there in our complex.</i>

1157
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:57,130
All that our fathers and sons risked their lives to obtain...

1158
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,470
can we let that fall into the hands of outsider?

1159
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,930
<i>Those people outside aren't family.</i>

1160
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,240
<i>If a cockroach crawls to the kitchen table, is it family?</i>

1161
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:13,060
<i>What kind of family would burn, stab or kill people?</i>

1162
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,010
<i>Show some sense, everyone!</i>

1163
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,510
<i>To protect our apartment complex,</i>

1164
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:26,620
<i>the residents must step up.</i>

1165
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:34,140
Just go.

1166
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:35,860
Don't step up for my sake.

1167
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,400
Thanks to the cooperation of various residents,

1168
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,290
we have completed our internal cleansing.

1169
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:19,570
From today, only true residents remain in this complex.

1170
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:25,210
When you people made me your Delegate, I made a promise.

1171
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:31,940
Nothing else matters! I'll protect our residents, our family!

1172
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,590
Let's eat warm meals and sleep comfortably!

1173
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,840
If we unite as one under the name of our apartments, we'll prevail.

1174
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,070
In such desperate times,

1175
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:51,890
how can we trust or live with those who break the rules

1176
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:53,180
and put innocent people in danger?

1177
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:59,110
Still, despite their mistakes, they are residents.

1178
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,800
How can we throw away family?

1179
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:05,790
So instead...!

1180
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,460
100 times?

1181
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:13,310
Come on, 300 at least, don't you think?

1182
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:16,890
All right, let's do 200.

1183
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,730
We were wrong! We were wrong!

1184
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:26,560
They acted so high and mighty, but now they're scared.

1185
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:28,140
We were wrong!

1186
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:28,920
Louder!

1187
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,190
We were wrong!

1188
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:44,830
We were wrong!

1189
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:47,040
- We were wrong!
- I was wrong!

1190
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:51,260
I was wrong!

1191
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,330
You're worse than beasts!

1192
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:56,530
You shouldn't do this to people!

1193
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,560
However screwed up this world may be,

1194
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,800
there are things you should do,

1195
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:04,930
and things you shouldn't do!

1196
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,050
That asshole.

1197
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,130
I knew he was trouble.

1198
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:22,620
Oh no!

1199
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,760
Smells a bit like roast fish, you know?

1200
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:32,350
You know why we're burning his corpse?

1201
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,010
The corpses we threw in the trash last time all disappeared.

1202
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,490
Why do you think?

1203
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:41,310
Those cockroaches snuck in and carried them off...

1204
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:44,600
Wow, that's gruesome!

1205
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,870
They ate them?

1206
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:46,980
Yeah, seriously.

1207
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:49,240
Wow, they really ate them?

1208
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:50,720
They're insane.

1209
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,090
Come here, quick!

1210
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,700
Why did that collapse?

1211
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,480
Water!

1212
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,540
It's water!

1213
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:36,400
Everyone come here! Quick!

1214
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:39,030
Water's flowing? Really? Let's go look.

1215
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:45,410
Let's get going.

1216
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:53,450
Good work, everybody!

1217
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:55,280
Good job!

1218
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,780
Hye-won.

1219
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:02,520
That thing you told me last time.

1220
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,260
Can you tell me again?

1221
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:06,520
In detail...

1222
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,110
KIM-YOUNG TAK

1223
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:17,990
<i>I went to his door once when a package was misdelivered.</i>

1224
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:19,490
Are you Kim Young-tak?

1225
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,140
<i>I remember that creepy face perfectly.</i>

1226
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,560
Yeah, I am.

1227
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:27,880
Didn't know such a pretty girl lived next to me.

1228
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:29,950
Thank you.

1229
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:38,260
What a fucking scumbag.

1230
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:55,810
<i>Then where is the real Kim Young-tak?</i>

1231
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,400
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

1232
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,410
<i>But seeing as this Delegate came in my house to threaten me,</i>

1233
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,690
<i>he must be hiding something.</i>

1234
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,070
People, it won't dry up!

1235
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,780
Don't push! You there, don't push!

1236
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:41,730
This food won't last us a week. It's spread too thin.

1237
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,930
What'll it be now? We can't survive on water.

1238
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:49,190
If we reduce rations now, people will throw a fit.

1239
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,610
What more do you expect us to do?

1240
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,370
Why ask me? You figure it out. That's your job, isn't it?

1241
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:56,320
Mr. Delegate?

1242
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,650
Mr. Delegate!

1243
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,480
We'll do something.

1244
01:35:01,890 --> 01:35:04,860
But what will you do? How will you solve it? What solution?

1245
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:13,130
If we could solve it by wagging our tongues, it'd be easy.

1246
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:23,000
Don't worry. I've got an idea.

1247
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,460
Let's go!

1248
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:29,760
Let's go, guys.

1249
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,240
Wow, the Han River totally dried up.

1250
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:43,310
Mr. Delegate seems a bit woozy today.

1251
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,300
His eyes are bloodshot, doesn't look like he's sleeping.

1252
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,970
How far are we going?

1253
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,910
It'll take us forever to get back.

1254
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:32,070
What is that? Do you see?

1255
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:36,120
That scared me.

1256
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,550
A food court! Unbelievable!

1257
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:40,940
Try going in.

1258
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:43,830
But how do we get in there?

1259
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:45,500
Give it a try!

1260
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,270
Won't it be too dangerous?

1261
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,230
This is the only way.

1262
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:55,300
Let's go in and see what we can find.

1263
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:11,250
Snap out of it!

1264
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:12,430
There are no photos or anything. I guess he got rid of them.

1265
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:18,820
Granny!

1266
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:23,260
Granny! Sit up, please.

1267
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:25,980
Where is your son?

1268
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:29,360
The person you're living with is not your son, right?

1269
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:31,770
I'll help you, Granny.

1270
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,660
I'll help you find your son.

1271
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:47,810
I...

1272
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,860
I'm hungry.

1273
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,520
I'm hungry.

1274
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:55,690
Mommy!

1275
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:58,450
NO ENTRY

1276
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,820
Min-sung! Are you okay?

1277
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:05,740
Are you okay?

1278
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:08,430
I'm okay.

1279
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:10,350
Min-sung!

1280
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:11,910
I'll come back.

1281
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:01,680
Watch your head!

1282
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:09,490
This is months worth of food!

1283
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,980
Your mom will be so happy!

1284
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:18,630
- What's that?
- Watch your step.

1285
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:29,240
Let's hurry.

1286
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,630
What is it?

1287
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:43,450
What's going on?

1288
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,550
Look out!

1289
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:49,400
Careful!

1290
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:52,620
Up there!

1291
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:54,140
Hey, look out!

1292
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:57,780
Ji-hyuk! Ji-hyuk!

1293
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,950
Beat it, you dirtbags!

1294
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:10,090
Ji-hyuk! Ji-hyuk!

1295
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:21,020
Who are you coming in here!

1296
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:22,380
Die!

1297
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,650
Get under cover!

1298
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,820
Help Ji-hyuk!

1299
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:41,260
- Help!
- Grab the food!

1300
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:45,170
Just die, all of you!

1301
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:46,100
Those rats!

1302
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:48,890
- Go, quick!
- Ji-hyuk!

1303
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:51,000
Please, don't die on us!

1304
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,370
Beat it, you dirtbags!

1305
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,020
Oh no, Ji-hyuk...

1306
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,390
Ji-hyuk!

1307
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,990
Where's Ji-hyuk?

1308
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,350
Ji-hyuk!

1309
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:21,800
Ji-hyuk!

1310
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:27,880
Why? What's wrong? Ji-hyuk!

1311
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,870
Ji-hyuk! Ji-hyuk!

1312
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:31,830
Ji-hyuk! Ji-hyuk!

1313
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:36,260
He's not breathing.

1314
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:38,280
He's not breathing!

1315
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:42,370
Hey! Why? Why?

1316
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:46,600
Ji-hyuk, Ji-hyuk! Let's go.

1317
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:47,960
I'll carry you.

1318
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:52,190
Control yourself!

1319
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:53,250
Ji-hyuk!

1320
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:55,410
Let go of me. I'm not crazy.

1321
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,520
Ji-hyuk, I'll carry you.

1322
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,100
Let's go out!

1323
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,520
Men, women, everybody come out. Now!

1324
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:11,930
Get ready! Don't just sit there?

1325
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,830
Where are you going?

1326
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:15,730
- I'll be right back.
- Huh?

1327
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,770
What are you doing?

1328
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,790
Move!

1329
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:24,390
Keum-ae!

1330
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:26,690
- Wait! Grab her.
- Stop her!

1331
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,060
You said you'd solve it!

1332
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,250
You said you had an idea!

1333
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:37,330
- Putting my son in danger...
- Geum-ae!

1334
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:39,730
...and getting him killed, was that your idea? Let go!

1335
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:41,790
You murderer!

1336
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,560
You filthy murderer!

1337
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,700
Let go!

1338
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:49,130
You scarfed up the food your son risked his life to bring,

1339
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,110
so why freak out now?

1340
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:54,590
Let's keep our heads here!

1341
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:57,570
Just stop!

1342
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:10,890
If you go out and kill people, will your dead family members return?

1343
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:13,670
This is all for the sake of our apartments!

1344
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:15,580
What does that even mean?

1345
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:18,510
If you have eyes, look at what's happening here!

1346
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:19,330
Then what do you want?

1347
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:23,440
You want to make friends with those bastards outside?

1348
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:25,950
That's right. Before we all die.

1349
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,410
Where are you living now?

1350
01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:29,990
You live your elegant life inside the complex,

1351
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,420
so what do you know?

1352
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:36,630
If all of us die, who cares if we're inside or outside!

1353
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,930
Hey, how can you talk to our Delegate that way?

1354
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:41,590
Mr. Delegate!

1355
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:49,240
Take a look.

1356
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:54,710
Resident Regulation #1.

1357
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:59,250
Apartments belong to residents. Only residents may live here.

1358
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,270
Those are your words!

1359
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,450
Citizen ID: Kim Young-tak
Who is it? That's not his face.

1360
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:14,680
Mr. Delegate is a cockroach?

1361
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:17,420
- That's not his face!
- They could have the same name...

1362
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:18,350
It's different.

1363
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:19,750
Leave this place.

1364
01:46:20,650 --> 01:46:21,870
Who the hell is he?

1365
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,790
Check it.

1366
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:26,930
Who is this?

1367
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:30,070
It's the man from #902!

1368
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:35,090
Come here, you! Get over here!

1369
01:46:35,110 --> 01:46:36,640
Does anyone speak Japanese?

1370
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:38,660
Wait a minute. Everyone wait.

1371
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:40,310
Mr. Delegate!

1372
01:46:40,330 --> 01:46:43,550
Someone else could have put the body in here.

1373
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:46,730
Mr. Delegate, what is this?

1374
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:47,800
Please explain.

1375
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:50,630
Explain what? Didn't you see the ID card?

1376
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:52,070
Quiet!

1377
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,680
At least say something.

1378
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:08,190
- At least say something!
- Let go!

1379
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,900
I am Kim Young-tak!

1380
01:47:12,830 --> 01:47:16,850
I gave my life to this complex.

1381
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:19,320
Thinking of you all as my family.

1382
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:24,970
I covered myself and filth so that you wouldn't have to!

1383
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:28,140
I may not be registered here,

1384
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,710
but that home is as good as mine. I paid for it!

1385
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,730
But this goddamned cheat swindled me out of it!

1386
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:44,620
I am Kim Young-tak from #902!

1387
01:47:57,090 --> 01:48:00,400
You dirty cockroach!

1388
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:02,110
Bring back my husband!

1389
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:04,910
We never should've kicked out the outsiders!

1390
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:08,630
He's the one who pushed us to kick them out!

1391
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:10,500
He's just insane!

1392
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,220
He confessed with his own mouth now, right?

1393
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,310
This isn't the time for us to fight! We must fight the bastards out there!

1394
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:19,170
We're not fighting! All we need is to throw him out!

1395
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:31,040
You scumbags! Hands off!

1396
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:32,610
Get out, asshole!

1397
01:48:56,290 --> 01:48:57,290
Hye-won!

1398
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:13,860
It's all because of that bitch!

1399
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,830
If it weren't for her, nothing would've...

1400
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:43,800
They say when a hen crows, the family goes to ruin.

1401
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:52,310
Min-sung! Stop!

1402
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,430
What's with you?

1403
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:58,630
Why'd you do it?

1404
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:02,010
Don't come closer.

1405
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,910
Don't come closer!

1406
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:11,240
You idiot, there's no time for this!

1407
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:13,870
They're going to take our homes!

1408
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:19,480
Pull!

1409
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:22,490
We're here!

1410
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:27,220
What's going on?

1411
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:30,450
Let's go in!

1412
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:36,270
We're starving, you bastards! Give us food!

1413
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:37,840
Let's go in!

1414
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:45,440
Hooray Hwang Gung!

1415
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:47,290
Piss off, scumbags!

1416
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:48,890
Block the back gate!

1417
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:51,470
We need to block the back gate!

1418
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,300
Damn cockroaches!

1419
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:17,650
You bastards! Don't follow me!

1420
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:20,620
You lowlifes!

1421
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:23,700
I'll blast a hole in your head? You want one?

1422
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:29,700
That bastard's out of bullets!

1423
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:31,410
Now! Die!

1424
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:48,420
Honey, let's hide in here.

1425
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:52,540
Honey! When things quiet down, we can run, okay?

1426
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,400
Did they go in here?

1427
01:51:54,690 --> 01:51:55,810
Get them!

1428
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:59,260
You stay in here.

1429
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,360
What about you?

1430
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:03,290
I'll be fine.

1431
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,270
Come in here!

1432
01:52:04,290 --> 01:52:06,290
Die!

1433
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:07,290
Honey!

1434
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,700
You asshole!

1435
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:19,920
You bitch!

1436
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,890
You asshole!

1437
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:36,020
Honey!

1438
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:38,940
Stop it please!

1439
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:43,880
Stop!

1440
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:46,190
<i>Is is in here?</i>

1441
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,020
<i>Hey, this way!</i>

1442
01:53:53,810 --> 01:53:56,260
Come out! Now!

1443
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:02,840
Look out!

1444
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:04,200
Look out!

1445
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:52,620
Is everyone... okay?

1446
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,880
Mr. Delegate!

1447
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,230
Going to my home...

1448
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:03,430
I'll rest and comeback.

1449
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:08,140
Can you get in? Look inside.

1450
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:10,840
Is something there? Can you see?

1451
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:12,470
Wait a sec.

1452
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:16,530
I don't think there's anything.

1453
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:23,010
Hey, it's raining. Let's just go.

1454
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,700
It's this way. He went this way.

1455
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:49,440
Find him!

1456
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:50,560
He went up!

1457
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:52,310
I said go up!

1458
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:14,280
On the 9th floor.

1459
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:15,470
Hey, this way!

1460
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:19,390
Isn't this that guy?

1461
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,670
Is he dead?

1462
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:29,510
Shit... wearing shoes... bringing dirt in my home.

1463
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,110
Over here! Start with the food.

1464
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:12,000
Oh, right...

1465
01:59:15,230 --> 01:59:16,000
Here.

1466
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Try it on.

1467
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:39,010
You look pretty.

1468
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,690
I'll buy a nicer one later.

1469
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:53,410
Sorry.

1470
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:56,820
For what?

1471
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:00,840
Everything.

1472
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,110
I've made so many mistakes.

1473
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:15,370
But there's one thing I know I did well.

1474
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:21,160
Marrying you.

1475
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:12,610
Honey, wake up.

1476
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,390
It's so pretty.

1477
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:43,440
Kim Min-sung.

1478
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:48,390
Kim Min-sung....

1479
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:02,710
Please get up...

1480
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:09,490
Honey...

1481
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:24,500
Kim Min-sung....

1482
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:31,120
Honey...

1483
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:53,130
Do you have somewhere to go?

1484
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:57,870
Or you can come with us.

1485
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:35,170
Watch your step.

1486
02:03:35,190 --> 02:03:35,760
Yes, please.

1487
02:03:53,250 --> 02:03:54,660
Nice high ceilings, right?

1488
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,370
It might be uncomfortable but it's better than outside.

1489
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:05,470
Eat this for now.

1490
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:21,490
Am I just allowed to live?

1491
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:26,590
Why ask us that?

1492
02:04:28,290 --> 02:04:30,220
If you're alive, you can live.

1493
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:36,420
I see.

1494
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:39,890
Tell me though, the people in that apartment complex...

1495
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:45,650
There were rumors that they caught and ate people, is it true?

1496
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:46,950
What are you saying?

1497
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,460
I'm just curious.

1498
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:50,520
No.

1499
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:57,970
They were just...

1500
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:06,810
ordinary people.

1501
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:08,980
I see...

1502
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:13,100
How could you ask such a thing?

1503
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:16,050
- Push this here.
- First this way.

1504
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:23,260
Eat it while it's still warm.

1505
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:21,040
