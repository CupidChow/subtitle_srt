00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:30,034
- Kapour, kapour.
- Parkour, parkour.

188
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,035
You said kapour.

189
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:32,495
Stop it!

190
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:33,495
Enough!

191
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:35,665
Stop acting like children!

192
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,501
You really said kapour before.

193
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,252
Stupid! It really is parkour.

194
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,672
This asshole can't take a joke!

195
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,465
He's calling me stupid,
what about you then?

196
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,341
You're such an
attention-seeker!

197
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:46,425
You were the one
who told me it's kapour,

198
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,010
before you jumped
and jumped there asshole!

199
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,345
- Attention-seeker!
- Just like you!

200
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:50,513
- You just don't want to be humiliated,
- Stupid!

201
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:51,389
- putting all the blame on me.
- Stupid!

202
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:52,390
Kapour!

203
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,724
- It’s parkour.
- Kapour

204
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:54,724
You said kapour.

205
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:56,310
Profanity.

206
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,022
Wait, no!

207
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:01,357
Wait!

208
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:02,483
Nope, that's the rule.

209
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:05,903
What's going on?

210
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,956
Nope, you know the rules.

211
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:09,073
What rule?

212
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,705
One profanity, one…

213
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:17,665
One what?

214
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:35,224
[Section E teasing]

215
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:36,934
Husband and wife!

216
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,959
Jay!

217
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:45,109
No!

218
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,248
So, what can you say class?

219
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:02,668
Did Pandora's actions
cause chaos in our world?

220
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,589
It's all because of Pandora,

221
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:06,076
because she didn't listen.

222
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:07,829
If only she had followed orders.

223
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:12,343
Ma’am.

224
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,056
The good thing about
what Pandora did,

225
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,600
is that she fostered hope.

226
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,601
So you're saying,

227
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,228
we should thank her
because she was stubborn?

228
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:22,563
No.

229
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:25,599
What I meant was,
it’s unfair to judge that quick.

230
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,569
We can't blame her
for being curious.

231
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:31,489
Then who should
we blame for it?

232
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,949
That is called accountability.

233
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:36,869
If you'll blame it all on one person

234
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,454
instead of looking at yourself,

235
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:40,456
that's not accountability.

236
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,166
That's called cowardice.

237
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,002
You're selfish and a coward.

238
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:46,337
Yes Jasper Jean?

239
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,464
Maybe you're both right.

240
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:51,717
Maybe you both have a point, you
just need to understand one another.

241
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:52,717
Right?

242
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:54,178
Right?

243
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:56,755
What's up with him?

244
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,035
Why is Josh staring at me?

245
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:01,936
Okay, that's enough.

246
00:13:02,144 --> 00:13:03,938
Since we're on this topic,

247
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:06,023
might as well write
an essay about this.

248
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,232
Huh?

249
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:08,648
Annoying.

250
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,091
See where your stupid debate got us?

251
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:11,423
Now we're dragged into this.

252
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,132
Bring out one whole sheet of paper.

253
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,575
- Hurry up.
- Can I have a piece of paper, Jay?

254
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:17,660
- Jay, me too!
- Us too, Jay!

255
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,161
You've been asking
for too much!

256
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,008
This is five pesos.

257
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:22,598
That's five pesos, alright?

258
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,291
- Can I have some?
- Ten for you.

259
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:25,484
This is ten pesos!

260
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:29,036
I want to know your opinions
about the story of Pandora.

261
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:31,757
And if you learned anything from it.

262
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,845
I will write the questions
on the board.

263
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,595
Question number one.

264
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:40,808
What was the significance
of the box in Pandora's story?

265
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,196
Yuri...

266
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,733
Um, about what
happened earlier...

267
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,236
That's nothing.

268
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,071
Really?

269
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:56,824
Really? But you look—

270
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:58,113
Ms. Mariano!

271
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:00,824
Do you want to share
something to the class?

272
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:06,725
Is it funny?

273
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,168
Do you think it's funny?

274
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:39,325
"Yuri!!!"

275
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:57,091
"Pay attention to
our lesson, not on me."

276
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:14,311
“You're angry, aren't you?”

277
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:30,961
"Hey."

278
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:40,903
"Jay,"

279
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,403
You didn't want to talk to
me a while ago, but now!

280
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:00,948
Ms. Mariano!

281
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:05,072
If you're just going to
pester my class, then get out!

282
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,378
Boys, boys! Quiet boys, quiet!

283
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,772
Ma'am, can we go with her?

284
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,211
Quiet!

285
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,075
Hey, let me go with you.

286
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:21,719
Annoying.

287
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,306
- Jay!
- What the!

288
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,353
[Yuri chuckling]

289
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:50,581
Are you happy there?

290
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:52,718
Go, laugh about it.

291
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,883
Sorry you got thrown out
because of me.

292
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,195
Will your sorry fix anything?

293
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,431
I was already kicked out
of the class.

294
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,560
Why are you here?

295
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:16,255
I'm here to apologize,
and join you as well.

296
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,359
You're really something, huh?

297
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,323
What do you mean "I'm here
to apologize, and join you as well."

298
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:25,483
You didn't want to talk to me
earlier, and now you're here?

299
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,506
It’s not that I don’t want you, Jay.

300
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,910
You know that.

301
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:37,117
I'm not mad at you.

302
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,800
I'm jealous.

303
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:46,929
I can't help it, Jay.

304
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:49,890
I'm in love with you.

305
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,602
I can't control my feelings.

306
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,244
You're my fiancée,

307
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,072
but aside from them
not knowing anything…

308
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,783
someone else kissed you.

309
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,838
I know you had no idea
about this engagement.

310
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:27,553
You were shocked, you felt forced.

311
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,515
And maybe you
don't love me, Jay.

312
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,769
But you agreed to this engagement,

313
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:37,855
didn't you?

314
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:42,109
You agreed to be my fiancée.

315
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:47,030
To be honest, I should be the one
demanding from you, right?

316
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:53,620
Yuri…

317
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,368
What do you think
you're doing here?

318
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:10,281
- Huh?
- Answer me!

319
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:11,406
Damn it!

320
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,432
Keifer…

321
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:16,328
It hurts, I didn't do anything!

322
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:18,563
Exactly, you didn't do anything.

323
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,582
I told you, you're mine.

324
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,003
Let Yuri do that to
you one more time,

325
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:27,003
you'll pay for it.

326
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,353
I don't want to see
him like that again.

327
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,531
I can't handle it.

328
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,838
His anger reminds me of Kuya Angelo.

329
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:57,869
Why is he like that?

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,001
Hey!

331
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:05,783
What are you
gonna do with that?

332
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:07,963
Hey to you too.

333
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:10,159
Weren't you the one who
asked me to get you a spoon?

334
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:13,719
You’re acting like you own this house,
bossing me around! Here!

335
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,835
Yeah, but why are you
holding a fork?

336
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,296
- You're really spacing out.
- I hope you get tonsillitis.

337
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:21,685
I'll go and study!

338
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:34,581
Wow Jay, this is so delicious–

339
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:40,746
What happened to you, Jay?

340
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:44,875
Ah.

341
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:48,961
Ci…

342
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:56,595
What movie do you want?

343
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:58,138
I have many movies here

344
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:59,449
that you cannot watch online.

345
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,614
- You choose.
- Ah wait.

346
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:03,643
Wait a minute.

347
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:06,688
Uhm...

348
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,150
Have you seen
Keifer get mad?

349
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:15,370
Like really, really angry?

350
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,283
Is that what you’ve been
thinking of this whole time?

351
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:19,768
Is that why you've
been absent-minded?

352
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:21,691
Answer me, quick.

353
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,961
Have you ever seen
him really angry?

354
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:28,845
Yes, a lot of times.

355
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:31,355
How?

356
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,592
One thing I'll never forget

357
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,135
is when he got
so mad at Yuri.

358
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:39,296
Damn.

359
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:40,800
What happened?

360
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:43,915
We don't know why.

361
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,115
All we know is he
was so mad at Yuri.

362
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:48,218
He couldn't stop
punching Yuri on the face.

363
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,082
Why, what happened?

364
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,233
I don't know.

365
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:54,371
All I remember was Ella
kept crying on the side.

366
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:56,089
She was begging them to stop.

367
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,042
It was so chaotic.

368
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,155
What did you do then?

369
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,033
Nothing.

370
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:05,555
Jay, no one can stop Keifer
when he's that mad.

371
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:07,603
If we get close,
we'll get involved too.

372
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,044
I don't want to get punched
so I stayed away.

373
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,830
I feel bad for Yuri.

374
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:19,902
No.

375
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,626
Yuri's a dumbass.

376
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,516
What do you mean dumbass?

377
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,270
Yuri is a coward.

378
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,784
That's why he is
always clinging to Keifer,

379
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:32,883
because he is
afraid to confront him.

380
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:36,996
Jay, he doesn't fight fair too.

381
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:40,034
He makes a move
without us knowing.

382
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:41,732
Yuri?

383
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:42,821
Yes!

384
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,825
It's my first time
hearing you talk like that.

385
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,309
That's why I told you,

386
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:52,627
I don't want him for you.

387
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:55,155
So if he tries to
court you, don't let him.

388
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:03,346
Let's watch.

389
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:06,959
I've been saving the
ice cream for the movie.

390
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:08,897
You choose,
what do you want?

391
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,314
What do you feel like watching?

392
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:14,024
Oh wait, my ice cream.

393
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:17,360
Anything.

394
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:19,446
You said you have
some good ones

395
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:20,697
that aren't available
to watch online.

396
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:22,365
Yes, just you wait.

397
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:24,525
Promise, these
are all good stuff.

398
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,110
Hey! What kind of
good stuff are those?

399
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:28,847
Huh?

400
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:31,808
- I'm seeing a smirk!
- Jay!

401
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,084
Hey, behave yourself!

402
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:34,423
Who do you think I am?

403
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:37,189
Ci, it stinks!

404
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,423
Jay, there are
only two of us,

405
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:39,823
why are you putting
the blame on me?

406
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,061
Ouch!

407
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,173
My stomach hurts.

408
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:47,140
There, karma.

409
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,909
It's because of your greediness.

410
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,560
Too much
ice cream for you.

411
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,834
Ci, it really stinks!

412
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,569
Go run to the bathroom!

413
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,596
Hurry up, or you might
make a mess here!

414
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:04,229
What is this?

415
00:25:57,127 --> 00:26:01,214
Cut it off to be sure!

416
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:02,591
Let's go!

417
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,405
You probably know why
you're here right now, right?

418
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:08,298
Obviously.

419
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:09,787
So you can jump me with your goons.

420
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:16,632
You think you're tough, huh?

421
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:19,225
You really targeted Jay-jay, huh?

422
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:20,984
She was mine first.

423
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,571
What now?

424
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,217
Stupid!

425
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,134
I'm getting impatient,
let's do this!

426
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:30,534
Who's up?

427
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,843
Your turn, bro.

428
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:36,833
Let's go!

429
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,127
You messed with the wrong person.

430
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:42,505
My turn, my turn!

431
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:46,426
Screw you, you speak English
but you're still stupid, huh!

432
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:55,018
There you go, let's go Ci!

433
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,294
Let's go, Ci!

434
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,443
Three, two, one!

435
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,554
Happy New Year!

436
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,915
Here it comes, here it comes.

437
00:27:20,418 --> 00:27:21,711
You bastard!

438
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:23,672
One more!

439
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,979
Happy New Year!

440
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:29,327
Alright, alright!
I'm not yet done!

441
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,066
Let him go, let him go, let him go.

442
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:33,289
Let's go, Keifer!

443
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:40,629
There you go guys, I have
someone to introduce to you today.

444
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,857
Let's go!

445
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,820
Fuck you!

446
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:56,121
Oh my god.

447
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,414
Jay, success!

448
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:05,880
Why did you do that to Kiko?

449
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,020
Jay, Keifer will get mad at me.

450
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,439
I don't care!

451
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:24,977
Jay, you know what
Kiko did to you, right?

452
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,427
It's a serious matter.
It's not that simple.

453
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:28,737
He almost—

454
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,088
Yes, he did hurt me

455
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:32,282
but what you guys
did is too much!

456
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:34,551
Is hurting Kiko not enough,

457
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:36,571
the night you guys saved me?

458
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:38,471
And wasn't he expelled?

459
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:39,748
Wasn't that enough?

460
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:42,292
But that's assault, Jay.

461
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:43,665
That's a different matter.

462
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:46,254
And we're talking about you.

463
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:49,004
We're talking about me
but no one told me.

464
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,721
I'm not involved again, huh?

465
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:53,052
And this is how I find out?

466
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:55,047
None of you wanted me to find out!

467
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,324
Jay please, don't go!

468
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,350
Keifer might look for you,

469
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,618
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

470
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:02,353
Tell them I woke up late.

471
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:03,813
Jay, you can't.

472
00:29:03,838 --> 00:29:05,048
What do you mean?

473
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,609
Keifer knows when I lie.
Jay, don't.

474
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:08,985
Then be good at it!

475
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,261
It's not like that!

476
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,417
Go away!

477
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:31,049
What hospital is he in?

478
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:36,304
Ci-N, don't wait
for me to ask again.

479
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:37,472
One.

480
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,141
Two.

481
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:56,299
I don't know what I'm feeling

482
00:29:56,324 --> 00:29:58,159
now that I'm facing Kiko.

483
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:00,578
Anger?

484
00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:02,454
Rage?

485
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:04,165
Pity?

486
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:14,174
Kiko…

487
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,973
How are you?

488
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,603
I just found out...

489
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,436
about what happened to you.

490
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:27,689
Don't.

491
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:29,023
Huh?

492
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,776
Don't feel bad for me.

493
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,778
I deserve this.

494
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:37,057
- But...
- What I did

495
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:39,505
is unacceptable.

496
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:41,411
I know that.

497
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:45,665
Jay-jay…

498
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,838
I'm really sorry.

499
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,676
I don't know why
I did what I did.

500
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:00,555
I don't know, something
came over me and…

501
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:03,016
it just wasn't me.

502
00:31:06,644 --> 00:31:08,104
I was brokenhearted because…

503
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:11,274
Because you rejected me and…

504
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,363
These are just stupid excuses,

505
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,223
it doesn't excuse what I did.

506
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:24,454
Please forgive me, Jay-jay.

507
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:31,461
Apology accepted.

508
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,214
Really?

509
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:41,679
Just don't do it again, Kiko.

510
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:51,820
It's just me.

511
00:31:52,482 --> 00:31:53,984
You can stop looking around.

512
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:03,534
[phone buzzing]

513
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:09,025
So your classmates are
already looking for you?

514
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,777
No. Let them be.

515
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,632
You know you're
really lucky, Jay.

516
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:22,053
Your friends,
your classmates they…

517
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,055
they care about you.

518
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,675
So much, they're
willing to fight for you.

519
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:36,109
They weren't
like that with Ella.

520
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:42,674
How are you here?

521
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,463
When will you be discharged?

522
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,079
About a month.

523
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,331
But uhm,

524
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:54,351
they say around six to eight
months for my full recovery.

525
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:58,756
And then I have to
undergo physical therapy.

526
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:01,011
How about your studies?

527
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:04,637
I'm expelled, Jay.

528
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:06,139
Remember?

529
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:11,070
What did Freya say, by the way?

530
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,524
Nothing.

531
00:33:16,524 --> 00:33:18,317
I mean we broke up so…

532
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,876
she said she didn't want
a disabled boyfriend.

533
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:25,783
That girl is really something.

534
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:29,495
Well I mean,
it's just how she is.

535
00:33:31,164 --> 00:33:32,498
When you no longer benefit her,

536
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:34,859
she just drops you
like a hot potato.

537
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:36,753
I can see that.

538
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:42,967
She wasn't always
like that though.

539
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:47,007
I remember she was
really nice to me and Mykel.

540
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,891
When we were younger
and during summer classes.

541
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:54,145
It was really only recently
that she changed.

542
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:57,690
What happened to her?

543
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,031
Ask Keifer and Yuri.

544
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:06,574
Huh?

545
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:08,910
From what I remember,

546
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,499
Freya, when her boyfriend died,

547
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:15,525
and then,

548
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,210
afterwards...

549
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:21,738
she was passed around
Keifer, Yuri, and Aries.

550
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:35,707
There's Jay.

551
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,274
Where have you been?

552
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:42,860
I woke up late!

553
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:44,656
Ci-N said you went somewhere.

554
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:50,400
Yes! That's why I took so long.

555
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,790
Why weren't you answering your phone?

556
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:54,282
Uhm...

557
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:57,583
Because I knew it was you calling.

558
00:34:57,857 --> 00:35:00,144
Next time tell me
if you'll go somewhere.

559
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:01,520
So we don't have to worry.

560
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,346
What if the incident
with Rory happens again?

561
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:07,690
Sorry..

562
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,794
Promise next time, I'll tell you.

563
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:13,388
All of you.

564
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:15,602
I wonder what's up?

565
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:18,187
I just looked at the two of them,

566
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:20,333
but Josh seems to be watching.

567
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,407
Get out of there, I'll sit.

568
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:27,488
Go away!

569
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:39,542
I wonder what happened to Freya

570
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,438
that she ended up
with Keifer and Yuri?

571
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:43,412
Then Aries too?

572
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:45,378
Ah, right.

573
00:35:45,406 --> 00:35:47,894
Rakki told me something before.

574
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,940
That there was something
between Aries and Freya before.

575
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:53,138
Maybe that's what Kiko meant?

576
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:55,053
And now, Edrix too?

577
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,520
Why?

578
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,147
Nothing.

579
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:28,065
Food, food, food!

580
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,091
Children!

581
00:36:29,116 --> 00:36:30,693
You don't get to be picky!

582
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:33,232
Nobody has the right!
Not one of you has contributed.

583
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,035
Eat well.

584
00:36:35,313 --> 00:36:36,313
There we go!

585
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:39,310
And you're mad?

586
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:40,573
I got you, bro.

587
00:36:44,357 --> 00:36:45,358
Ci!

588
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Come with me.

589
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:49,443
By the way Jay,
how was your little errand?

590
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,966
How is Kiko?

591
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,576
You're too loud!

592
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,221
So dramatic!

593
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,926
What do you mean dramatic?
You're too loud.

594
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,340
Really? Don't you
have any shame?

595
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,337
You're checking up on the guy
you beat to a pulp!

596
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:03,006
I'm just asking.

597
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:06,167
He doesn't look so good.

598
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:09,697
He's disabled and
he can't move well.

599
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:10,723
He looks like this.

600
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:11,821
Ahh.

601
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:14,548
Too bad.

602
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:16,433
What do you mean too bad? Dumbass!

603
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,542
Ah! It hurts, Jay!

604
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,746
It hurts!

605
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:20,681
What are you talking about?

606
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,413
- I'm not saying anything.
- You're crazy.

607
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,142
I'll report you to Keifer!

608
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,582
That's where you're good at,
report to Keifer—

609
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,067
Keifer, Jay-jay is using profanity–

610
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:29,735
Come here!

611
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:30,735
Come here!

612
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,449
We'll go out!

613
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:33,531
But it's hot!

614
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:35,180
We'll go out, bye.

615
00:37:37,677 --> 00:37:39,303
Come here. You're being
way too loud since earlier!

616
00:37:39,328 --> 00:37:41,049
I didn't say anything
about going out.

617
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:42,623
What are we
going to do outside?

618
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:43,666
It's hot, Jay-jay!

619
00:37:43,842 --> 00:37:45,135
You're such a pain in the ass!

620
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:47,503
Go let Section E hear it!

621
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:49,422
You're gonna get me in trouble!

622
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,607
You're annoying.
I'm still hungry.

623
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:52,820
I am too.

624
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:54,552
This is your fault!

625
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:56,929
At least the cat is eating.

626
00:37:58,723 --> 00:37:59,515
It's cute!

627
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:00,850
I just said that nobody
should hear about it.

628
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,101
That's Josh!

629
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:04,437
- Ah really?
- Yes! Really, really?

630
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:06,998
Hey, Josh!

631
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:08,072
Oh?

632
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:09,792
The cat is so cute!

633
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:11,152
What a miracle.

634
00:38:11,738 --> 00:38:13,029
You're giving away food...

635
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:14,140
but to a cat.

636
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:16,148
Nothing, I'm just not hungry yet.

637
00:38:16,616 --> 00:38:17,856
So I just gave my lunch to him.

638
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:19,561
You should have
just given it to me, right?

639
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:21,365
- Are you hungry too?
- Yes!

640
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:24,932
Edy, come and eat.

641
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:25,958
Hey, Ci-N!

642
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:27,887
If I were you,
I wouldn't do that.

643
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:29,288
Why? It's grumpy?

644
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:32,340
You eat too much, Edy.

645
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,591
Who are you calling Edy?

646
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:35,526
The cat.

647
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:37,587
Huh? That's not Edy.

648
00:38:37,636 --> 00:38:38,637
Who is he?

649
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,341
Nothing. He doesn't have a name.

650
00:38:40,714 --> 00:38:41,714
Then he's Edy.

651
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:43,987
Where did you get Edy from?

652
00:38:44,477 --> 00:38:45,478
His color.

653
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:48,441
The one from
the battery commercial.

654
00:38:48,814 --> 00:38:50,900
- So Edy.
- Ah right!

655
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:53,344
That's a black cat too!

656
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:54,653
You're so smart!

657
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:57,235
Your friends must be smart too.

658
00:38:57,406 --> 00:38:58,866
That's not Edy!

659
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,410
- Whatever.
- Where are you going?

660
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,771
- I'll get food for Edy.
- Oh, Jay!

661
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:05,582
Why?

662
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,876
You know them right?

663
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,622
Huh?

664
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:12,194
Who?

665
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:15,758
The ones you saw on
the night of the festival.

666
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:24,190
Ah…

667
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:26,852
Oh?

668
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,607
If there is something
between you and Keifer,

669
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:35,528
promise me that you'll never
tell him about it.

670
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,011
"Something between us," really?

671
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:41,414
But didn't I tell you,

672
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:43,202
they are safe with Keifer.

673
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:45,037
- Really?
- Yes!

674
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,419
You know how Keifer is
when he's mad, right?

675
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:53,838
So while we still don't know
how Keifer will react...

676
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:55,464
don't tell him just yet.

677
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,468
In case it all works out fine.

678
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,556
What are you trying to say?

679
00:40:06,016 --> 00:40:07,418
I'm friends with Mayo and Kit.

680
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,732
I want them to be happy.

681
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:12,784
But I'm thinking,

682
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,560
maybe they'll stop hurting if

683
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,529
they stop this madness.

684
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:20,821
They're the ones suffering.

685
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,842
They're just hurting even more

686
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:25,077
because they
can't defend themselves.

687
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:27,705
You know what, you're right,

688
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,874
That got me thinking.

689
00:40:30,198 --> 00:40:31,575
Hello Edy!

690
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,961
This is for you.

691
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,601
Is that why you're quiet,
because you think like that?

692
00:40:36,797 --> 00:40:38,132
How did you even notice that?

693
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:39,783
I should do that too.

694
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:41,694
So I can think clearly.

695
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:44,263
There! He feels shy.

696
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:50,686
Jay, it bit me!

697
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:53,214
It's your fault, you brat!

698
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:54,597
There, you got yourself in trouble again!

699
00:40:55,683 --> 00:40:58,302
Jay-jay, I might die.
He might have rabies!

700
00:40:58,903 --> 00:40:59,904
It's your fault, Josh!

701
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,030
Come here, I'll check.

702
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,157
Get vaccinated right away,
come on, let's go see!

703
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:04,925
Jay-jay, I don't want
to get injected!

704
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,994
You're so dramatic,
you can't do anything about it!

705
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:08,162
Go get injected, go home!

706
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:09,317
They'll cut that off,

707
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:10,644
you're such a handful!

708
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:14,658
The bite still hurts, Jay.

709
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:16,082
The injection hurts too bad.

710
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,151
Poor brat, can I see?

711
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,594
Look, it bit me.

712
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,763
- Give it to me, I'll massage it.
- It hurts.

713
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:27,973
There, so the pain will go away.

714
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:30,851
- Like that.
- Thanks, Jay.

715
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:31,877
Is it okay now?

716
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:34,939
You're too attached to Jay-jay.

717
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:36,340
That's too much.

718
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:44,028
I think he's feeling jealous again.

719
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:54,833
And this other one too.

720
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:57,044
What do I do?

721
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,380
Are they jealous of Ci-N?

722
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:01,757
Are you and Yuri a thing?

723
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:04,173
Huh?

724
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:05,210
No!

725
00:42:05,408 --> 00:42:07,952
Yeah! Why is he
acting like you are?

726
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:09,324
Like he owns you.

727
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:12,309
Jay, don't say yes
if he courts you.

728
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:15,203
- Maybe—
- It's like you don't know Yuri.

729
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:17,147
He was the exact same
way with Ella before.

730
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:19,228
Oh, yeah.

731
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:22,403
Yes...

732
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:27,230
I'll just pee, okay?

733
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:35,249
Hey, Kit!

734
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:36,917
It's lunch break, right?

735
00:42:36,942 --> 00:42:38,152
Why are you not eating?

736
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:39,712
What are you doing here?

737
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:41,838
Nothing.

738
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:43,966
I just want to be alone.

739
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,386
Me too.

740
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:55,185
How are you and Mayo?

741
00:42:57,479 --> 00:42:58,480
Mayo?

742
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,941
I don't know.

743
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,718
He keeps on pestering me but
I don't want it anymore, Jay.

744
00:43:04,778 --> 00:43:05,851
Are you sure?

745
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:08,949
But that's not what you chose.

746
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,197
That's truly how you feel, right?

747
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:13,373
So, how are you
going to put a stop to it?

748
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:15,942
That's the thing,

749
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:20,309
I wish I was given choices
on how to feel.

750
00:43:20,753 --> 00:43:21,753
But there's none.

751
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,297
The choice given to me was,

752
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:26,717
to choose between my family, or him.

753
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:28,482
How?

754
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:34,266
I want to make this right.

755
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:37,394
I want to fix
whatever's wrong with me.

756
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:41,190
Wait a minute, there is
nothing wrong with you.

757
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:44,943
You don't need to be fixed
because you are not broken.

758
00:43:46,195 --> 00:43:47,821
It's easy for you to say,

759
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,908
because you're not in my place.

760
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,914
That's okay, I understand.

761
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:00,459
You don't understand, Jay.

762
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,545
Because you're not in a situation
where you have to choose

763
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,489
between family, or feelings.

764
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:07,675
You don't understand.

765
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:18,143
Should I continue
what I did before?

766
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,312
Huh?

767
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:23,257
It might be effective
and make a man out of me.

768
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:26,764
You just held my hand before.

769
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:30,489
Maybe...

770
00:44:39,915 --> 00:44:41,667
Try planting a kiss on me—

771
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:43,377
See?

772
00:44:43,585 --> 00:44:45,170
You're cross-eyed!

773
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,678
- You look stupid!
- You're too much!

774
00:44:47,968 --> 00:44:49,798
Your finger got me dizzy!

775
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:54,899
You're so stupid!
I told you to get your head straight.

776
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:56,524
Son of a bitch, is it Jay-jay?

777
00:44:57,512 --> 00:44:58,555
Is she the reason?

778
00:44:58,642 --> 00:44:59,643
Mayo?

779
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,281
Wait no!

780
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,522
You've misunderstood, it's Kit's fault!

781
00:45:03,522 --> 00:45:05,399
Come here and explain yourself!

782
00:45:05,424 --> 00:45:06,842
Come closer, quick.

783
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:08,485
Why did you agree?

784
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,012
You must have liked it too!

785
00:45:10,362 --> 00:45:11,947
You have Keifer and Yuri,

786
00:45:11,947 --> 00:45:13,157
and now you want Kit too!

787
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:15,200
Don't talk to Jay-jay like that!

788
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:16,736
He kissed you

789
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,162
...and you let him do it!

790
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:22,291
Fuck you!

791
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,127
Asshole, I didn't let him kiss me!

792
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:27,212
He was just joking about it,
it didn't happen!

793
00:45:27,237 --> 00:45:28,237
I didn't let him kiss me!

794
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:30,342
- You're such a dimwit!
- Hey, what's happening here?

795
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:33,635
Who tried to kiss you Jay?

796
00:45:33,806 --> 00:45:34,807
No one!

797
00:45:34,926 --> 00:45:37,345
You heard it wrong,
nothing happened!

798
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:38,790
I don't think so.

799
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:40,082
You did it again!

800
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:41,587
Does Keifer know about this?

801
00:45:42,352 --> 00:45:44,855
Edrix please, don't tell him.

802
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,206
It's Mayo's fault!

803
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:48,400
Calm down first,
calm down.

804
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:50,489
Can you mind your own business?

805
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,187
We're talking!

806
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:54,490
What the fuck
is your problem bro, huh?

807
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:56,133
Don't point your finger at Jay-jay!

808
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:58,202
Wait, all of you stop!

809
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:01,371
What? Did you fall
victim to this girl, too?

810
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,041
Nice, Jay!

811
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:07,002
Go! Flirt with
the whole Section E!

812
00:46:07,252 --> 00:46:09,379
After all, you're no
different from Ella!

813
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:12,048
Son of a bitch!
What did you say?

814
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:30,108
Hey, Jay!

815
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:32,069
What did the clinic say?

816
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,320
How's Mayo?

817
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:36,198
The nurse is taking care of him.

818
00:46:36,374 --> 00:46:37,709
He will come out in a bit.

819
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:39,344
That punch was child's play.

820
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:41,453
Come on, Jay.

821
00:46:41,703 --> 00:46:43,121
You punch like a dude!

822
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:45,207
It's even stronger than Kit's!

823
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,167
- No.
- That's too much.

824
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:48,279
- How, how?
- Here!

825
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,980
Like that!

826
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,423
No, his face is just too soft to handle it.

827
00:46:51,448 --> 00:46:52,616
You're something else, wow.

828
00:47:03,048 --> 00:47:04,048
Hey.

829
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:05,437
What happened to you?

830
00:47:09,106 --> 00:47:10,858
She has a new boyfriend again.

831
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,318
Oh, yeah.

832
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:14,736
And they're kissing already.

833
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:20,784
Have you tried approaching her?

834
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:22,578
I can't!

835
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,080
She hates Section E, remember?

836
00:47:26,206 --> 00:47:27,207
Oh, right.

837
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:31,850
And it looks like she hates
you guys more, now that I'm here.

838
00:47:32,004 --> 00:47:33,318
When I butt heads with her.

839
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:35,190
She's just so dramatic!

840
00:47:35,215 --> 00:47:36,633
It's like she's
always on her period.

841
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:37,743
She's always mad.

842
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:40,178
If she becomes your girlfriend,
teach her a lesson.

843
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:41,765
Of course!

844
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,848
What are you talking about!

845
00:47:42,848 --> 00:47:43,932
- That's my crush!
- Jay.

846
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:45,619
Edrix!

847
00:47:47,477 --> 00:47:48,562
Sorry, Jay.

848
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,189
I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

849
00:47:54,926 --> 00:47:56,177
You're different from Ella.

850
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:57,779
You are not the same.

851
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:02,034
I'm sorry if I punched you.

852
00:48:02,284 --> 00:48:03,660
You won't listen!

853
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:05,913
Sit down.

854
00:48:12,044 --> 00:48:13,503
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts.

855
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:14,564
Sorry.

856
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:23,820
Ah Edrix, why are you sad?

857
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,558
What were you talking
about a while ago?

858
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:27,935
A girl.

859
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:31,188
Oh? Edrix's girl?

860
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:32,898
It really is your girl!

861
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:34,232
You have a girlfriend?

862
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:35,317
No!

863
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:38,679
Not yet, he's still
dreaming about it.

864
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:42,913
Did you tell her how you feel?

865
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,137
I don't even know
if she notices me,

866
00:48:47,162 --> 00:48:49,831
or if she even knows I exist.

867
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:51,708
You have it good, actually.

868
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,002
In my case,

869
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:56,959
he knows I love him,

870
00:48:58,215 --> 00:48:59,800
but he's avoiding me.

871
00:49:02,452 --> 00:49:03,996
You know, you guys are right.

872
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:06,589
Falling in love is so hard, right?

873
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:09,184
What do you mean it's hard?

874
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:11,395
There are two guys
chasing after you.

875
00:49:11,645 --> 00:49:13,981
That's right!
You have Yuri and Keifer.

876
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:15,065
What?

877
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:15,941
- Yeah.
- Wait!

878
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:17,484
You guys sure know how to talk me up!

879
00:49:17,484 --> 00:49:19,236
Like I'm so gorgeous!

880
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:20,821
Isn't it true, though?

881
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:22,155
No, stop it.

882
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:23,365
You talk too much!

883
00:49:23,365 --> 00:49:26,535
I just meddled in your drama
and suddenly it's all about me!

884
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:27,744
But honestly,

885
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:29,454
you don't like either of them?

886
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:36,753
If I were you, I'd pick Yuri.

887
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:38,005
Why Yuri?

888
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:39,881
Keifer ain't shit.

889
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,885
The problem with him is that
he's selfish when it comes to girls.

890
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:47,280
So, despite Yuri being
his only remaining friend,

891
00:49:47,305 --> 00:49:48,765
he still stole his girl.

892
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:50,555
What do you mean?

893
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:53,537
Who would Keifer
steal from Yuri?

894
00:49:53,562 --> 00:49:54,896
Who else? Ella!

895
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:57,649
She wanted to choose Yuri.

896
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:01,820
But Keifer stole her away,
so she ended up with him.

897
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:05,815
What do you mean
it was supposed to be Yuri?

898
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:07,102
I don't know.

899
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,940
Well, that was what Ella said,

900
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:11,456
that she wanted to choose Yuri.

901
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:18,490
Ah right...

902
00:50:18,587 --> 00:50:19,713
By the way,

903
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:23,544
is Josh really that weird?

904
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:25,708
Has he always been this quiet?

905
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:26,969
No.

906
00:50:27,382 --> 00:50:29,175
His girlfriend died.

907
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:35,145
Since then, he became
quiet and a bit weird.

908
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,563
Really?

909
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,030
Poor him.

910
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,200
Let's go back to what we
were talking about earlier!

911
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:45,547
Answer it, Jay!

912
00:50:45,572 --> 00:50:47,115
You are so annoying,
I already changed the topic!

913
00:50:47,115 --> 00:50:47,824
It's your fault!

914
00:50:47,824 --> 00:50:49,409
- That's right!
- Who do you really want?

915
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:50,786
- Who?
- Yuri.

916
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:52,471
Let's look at Freya!

917
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:53,914
She might have a new photo.

918
00:50:53,939 --> 00:50:54,939
Not Freya!

919
00:50:57,491 --> 00:50:59,534
You cut class just
so you could talk here?

920
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:01,872
What are you talking about?

921
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:06,426
Drix.

922
00:51:09,846 --> 00:51:10,847
'Sup, Keifer?

923
00:51:11,223 --> 00:51:12,224
How you doing?

924
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,643
I'm stressed, how's you?

925
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:18,917
No matter what self defense I use,

926
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,952
someone is still bound to get hurt.

927
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:27,388
I just wanna show her.

928
00:51:29,442 --> 00:51:30,442
Man.

929
00:51:30,931 --> 00:51:32,641
Keifer ain't shit.

930
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:36,957
The problem is, he's selfish
when it comes to girls.

931
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:40,477
So, despite Yuri being
his only remaining friend,

932
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:41,795
he still stole away his girl.

933
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,970
Yuri is a coward.

934
00:51:47,747 --> 00:51:49,624
That's why he is
always clinging to Keifer,

935
00:51:49,783 --> 00:51:51,903
because he's too scared of
making an enemy out of him.

936
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:54,587
Jay, he doesn't fight fair.

937
00:51:55,422 --> 00:51:57,591
He makes moves without us knowing.

938
00:52:47,817 --> 00:52:49,988
Hey, Jay-jay!
Let's get Yogorino, please!

939
00:52:49,988 --> 00:52:53,366
I've been craving this
whole time, Jay please.

940
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:55,785
Do you think the rabies
has reached your brain?

941
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,187
You're taking
too long to choose.

942
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:58,722
David.

943
00:52:58,747 --> 00:53:01,082
Who asked you
to give me this necklace?

944
00:53:01,107 --> 00:53:02,776
Do you know
any child of Poseidon?

945
00:53:04,502 --> 00:53:06,254
Just get back here
as soon as you can.

946
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:07,672
Okay.

947
00:53:08,715 --> 00:53:09,716
Is that mine?

948
00:53:10,508 --> 00:53:12,969
Thanks anyways but
it would be a waste.

949
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,994
I crave a different kind
of sweet now.

950
00:53:15,263 --> 00:53:16,847
- What?
- Your lips.

951
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,644
Are we going
to attend mass here?

952
00:53:22,604 --> 00:53:23,730
So ugly.

953
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,375
I'll teach you
new Japanese words.

954
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:27,609
What is it? I can do that.

955
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:29,361
Say...

956
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:31,972
[in Japanese] I love you.

957
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,216
Why are you
doing this to me, Jay?

958
00:53:34,241 --> 00:53:35,492
Do you like Yuri?

959
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:36,628
Fine!

960
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:40,347
I don't know how I feel
but I'm doing what is right!

961
00:53:40,372 --> 00:53:41,945
It's supposed to be Yuri.

962
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,181
Because of that engagement?

963
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,152
It's the right thing to do, Keifer.
