1
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:27,902
Hello? Where are you?

2
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:30,421
I’ve been waiting
for you for a while now.

3
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,674
You know I’m supposed
to pick up the kids.

4
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:36,863
It’s hard to find a tricycle here.

5
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,732
What? You’re still fixing your tricycle?

6
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:41,807
It’s been a while!

7
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,790
What! What...

8
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:50,251
Help! Someone stole my phone!

9
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:53,827
- Hey! My vape!
- My phone was stolen.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,528
I haven’t finished paying for that!

11
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,622
Nice.

12
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:08,889
Got something good.

13
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:10,721
- Hi, Noli!
- Babe...

14
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:14,593
Babe, look at what I scored.
It’s brand new.

15
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:17,328
- Not bad! We can sell that.
- Of course.

16
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:19,438
Let’s test it out first before we sell it.

17
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:28,470
Let’s head in.

18
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,884
You go ahead, babe.

19
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:35,477
Come on.

20
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:39,550
How about you, babe?

21
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:40,910
What did you get?

22
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,400
I don’t have any.

23
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:44,643
Just for soft drinks—
money is slow right now.

24
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:46,350
Come on, eat some sardines,

25
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,502
I’ve sautéed some.

26
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:49,224
All right!

27
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:53,182
This is delicious!

28
00:01:57,505 --> 00:01:58,505
Thank you, babe.

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,590
You’re welcome.

30
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:15,221
Damn it...

31
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,228
What are you doing?

32
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:23,320
Didn't I tell you?

33
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:27,060
Never ever accept anything
from that foolish Captain!

34
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,519
What are you saying?

35
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,046
His people were the ones
who brought this,

36
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,071
not Captain himself.

37
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,237
Do you still see each other?

38
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,544
You know what?

39
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:38,037
You just threw away
what should have been our food.

40
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,309
You’re not thinking straight!

41
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,285
Have it your way.

42
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:44,255
Babe.

43
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:46,456
I’m sorry. Don’t be mad anymore.

44
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,011
- Whatever! You’re annoying.
- Fine, I’m sorry.

45
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,804
You act like you’re
still not used to me.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,688
I’ll make it up to you.

47
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,708
- This is my favorite.
- Yeah, I know.

48
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:36,502
- Babe... babe.
- Hmm?

49
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:38,311
This is great!

50
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:45,445
[speaking in foreign language]

51
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,470
- Oh...
- Oh!

52
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:49,185
- Sorry... I’m very very sorry.
- It’s okay. Are you okay?

53
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,153
Yes, I’m okay.

54
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:54,253
Ah! Your... polo...

55
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,189
- Pardon?
- have wrinkles.

56
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:59,671
- Have wrinkles there.
- Oh, okay...

57
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:02,406
- Single?
- You guessed it right. And you?

58
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,686
- No. Bye-bye.
- No? Oh, bye.

59
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,231
Babe, you were so good
at speaking English earlier.

60
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:13,923
You even had an accent.

61
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,212
Of course!

62
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,143
I was Best in English
back in kindergarten.

63
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,421
- Really?
- Yes.

64
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,446
Does that even exist?

65
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,718
- Well, you didn’t study.
- That’s fine.

66
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,227
- I’m good at other things.
- Like what?

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,053
- You already know.
- Hmm...

68
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:29,983
Esme, Noli...

69
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,392
- Captain.
- So it’s you guys. How are you?

70
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,217
We’re good. Let’s go.

71
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,958
Oh, by the way,

72
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:38,831
there’s a job opening
at the barangay,

73
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,056
maybe you’re interested, Esme?

74
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,443
That would be extra income for you.

75
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,862
The work is simple...

76
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,323
It’s not really necessary.

77
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:50,501
I can provide everything
my wife needs.

78
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,734
Here, look— our dinner is so delicious.

79
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:54,837
Right, babe?

80
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,070
Let’s go.

81
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,790
That bastard!

82
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,556
He thinks he’s someone great!

83
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:13,752
Just because he’s wearing a polo!

84
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,144
That idiot only won
because of cheating...

85
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,395
Huh?

86
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,234
Why does your face look like that?

87
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,528
What? Why?

88
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,156
Do you regret choosing me
as your boyfriend?

89
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:30,908
Where is that coming from?

90
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,661
You’ve been so quiet on our way home.

91
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,081
I’m sorry, okay!
This is just who I am!

92
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,930
I’m just poor, that’s all.

93
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:42,282
- Unlike Captain, right?
- Where is this coming from?

94
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,430
It’s so hard dealing with you,
you’re way too insecure.

95
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:49,296
Fine... I admit it, I’m insecure...

96
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,096
Can you blame me?

97
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:57,002
That bastard Francis tried
to take you away from me!

98
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,728
Did I let him?

99
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:00,551
No.

100
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:02,267
You know what,

101
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:03,666
we’ve had this issue for so long.

102
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,032
You still haven’t moved on.

103
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,387
Fine. Alright.

104
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:09,989
I said I’m sorry.

105
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,458
Wait...

106
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:34,493
Babe...

107
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,474
I promise you,

108
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,477
I’ll do my best to be enough for you.

109
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,229
I’ll be rich.

110
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,525
So that our future kids won’t have
to eat food that came from theft.

111
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,742
Do you accept

112
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,280
as your husband,

113
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,783
Noli, Esmeralda?

114
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,211
For richer, or for richest,

115
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,413
'til death do us part? Huh?

116
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,825
Even for poorer, or for poorest,

117
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,227
I will marry you, Noli...

118
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,711
That sounds so good.

119
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,515
- Come on, let’s eat.
- Yeah, that’s a good idea.

120
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,982
Babe, have some coffee too.

121
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,688
Oh, you’re having coffee again?

122
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,284
My sleeping problem came back.

123
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,620
I thought that was already fixed?

124
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,674
It came back.

125
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,150
Our family really has trouble sleeping.

126
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:39,667
By the way, how much
change do you have left?

127
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:42,408
Pay the rent right away...

128
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:44,235
The water and electricity bills too.

129
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,045
Then whatever’s left,
keep it for yourself.

130
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,132
No need. Let’s prioritize
your check-up first.

131
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,579
It might get worse later.

132
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,596
No need.

133
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:55,719
That’s yours.

134
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,970
I can handle this.

135
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,806
Go shopping.

136
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,058
It’s been a while since

137
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,185
I bought you new clothes.

138
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,686
Really?

139
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,899
Of course. You deserve it!

140
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,443
You’re so stubborn.

141
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,402
Thank you!

142
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:14,070
Bro! Esme!

143
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,115
- Not, come eat!
- Hey!

144
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,034
No thanks.
I won’t be long.

145
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,415
Bro, I got a tip.

146
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,169
Looks like we can score
something good here.

147
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,750
Great!

148
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,264
Hello, Oca, can you pick us up now?

149
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,590
Right there, bro.

150
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,636
I studied that couple’s schedule.

151
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,928
Damn.

152
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,917
Looks like we’re
gonna hit big on this one.

153
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:43,248
Yeah, bro.

154
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,921
Wherever you decide to marry Esme,

155
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:49,950
you can make it happen.

156
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,524
Awesome!

157
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,081
You know the plan, right?

158
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,133
Same plan as before.

159
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:56,101
I’ll wait for you in the alley.

160
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,617
Alright, I got this.

161
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,731
- Oh my God! Honey, my bag!
- What the? You bastard!

162
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,091
Come back here!

163
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:18,302
I can't chase...
Hey! What happened?

164
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:22,185
God! Just, don’t worry.

165
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,397
I’ll get you a new bag.

166
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Not!

167
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,775
- Not!
- Hey!

168
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,527
- Bro, I’m sorry.
- Not?

169
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,746
I’m sorry, bro.
I really need the money.

170
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,657
What the, Notnot.

171
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,183
Damn you, Not.

172
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,905
Why? Why, Not?
You bastard!

173
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,961
Son of a bitch!

174
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,839
Ma’am.

175
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,215
Here is the running bill
that you requested.

176
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,320
And this is the prescription
from the doctor.

177
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,130
Do we need this now?
Right away?

178
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:12,450
Yes, because all of them
are antibiotics.

179
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,333
Also, there’s a schedule

180
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,103
for when you need
to administer them to the patient.

181
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:18,506
That's all of it.

182
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,172
Excuse me.

183
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,667
Esme.

184
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,959
How are you feeling, babe?

185
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:36,615
I’m all right.

186
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,131
I’m fine.

187
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:42,457
I heard what Notnot did to you.

188
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,181
You know, I want
to report him to the police,

189
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:46,791
but you might get dragged into it.

190
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:48,822
That bastard!

191
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,347
Don’t worry.

192
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,419
I already sent the others
to look for him.

193
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,816
What’s that?

194
00:12:58,563 --> 00:13:01,113
Your hospital bill and prescription.

195
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,033
How much does it cost?

196
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,470
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of it.

197
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,757
I’ll find a way.

198
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,874
I’m sorry, babe.

199
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,935
I never thought

200
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,105
that bastard Notnot
would betray me like that.

201
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,893
It’s okay.
It’s all good.

202
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,028
What’s important is that you’re alive.

203
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,553
Because…

204
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,122
I don’t know what
I would do if I lost you.

205
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,518
I don’t think I can handle it, Noli.

206
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,087
Make sure everyone gets their share.

207
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,282
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

208
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,756
Go house to house,
family by family.

209
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,236
- Yes, Captain.
- Alright, go ahead.

210
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,742
[sighs]

211
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,031
Francis.

212
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,715
- Captain.
- Oh!

213
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,366
Esme, what brings you here?

214
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,093
Sit down.

215
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,139
I need your help.

216
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,765
What kind of help?

217
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,728
I need money.

218
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,040
Noli got stabbed.

219
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,562
He’s in the hospital right now.

220
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,484
Hm...

221
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:07,473
So that’s what I’ve been
hearing my staff talk about.

222
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,492
How much do you need?

223
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,077
Twenty thousand.

224
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,000
That’s quite a lot.

225
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,796
There’s medical assistance
available here in the barangay.

226
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,234
But that’s a long process.

227
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,915
It will take quite some time.

228
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,434
How long?

229
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,310
About a month, or even longer.

230
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,813
Besides...

231
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,946
There are others
who need it more than Noli.

232
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,757
People undergoing dialysis,

233
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,887
people with cancer.

234
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,244
Decent people, unlike Noli.

235
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,456
But you,

236
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,996
you already had a chance
to change your life,

237
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,053
yet you still chose trouble.

238
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,869
Are you lending me
the money, or not?

239
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,536
Because if not, I’ll just leave.

240
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,880
You talk too much.

241
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,431
I’ll lend you the money.

242
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,521
Here.

243
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,605
Twenty thousand.

244
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:27,845
But there’s a catch.

245
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,071
Can you handle it?

246
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:31,983
Forget it.

247
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,451
What are you going to do?

248
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,664
Are you going to let Noli die?

249
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,903
Huh? Can you do that?

250
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:43,482
Can you?

251
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,401
You love him so much, right?

252
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,149
Here, thirty thousand.

253
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,444
What? Are you going to be picky now?

254
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:04,648
Just think of it as

255
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,568
finding another hustle.

256
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,262
It’s just a different kind of itch
you’ll be scratching now.

257
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,114
So?

258
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,905
Don’t just stand there!

259
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,418
Damn it!
That’s thirty thousand right there!

260
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,201
Babe?

261
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,748
What took you so long?

262
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,352
I managed to score some medicine.

263
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,948
I came from the pharmacy.

264
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,736
How much did it cost?

265
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,592
Thirty thousand.

266
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:49,960
That's a lot.

267
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:53,031
Where did you get the money?

268
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:56,354
At the market.

269
00:23:56,746 --> 00:23:58,206
The phone was still new,

270
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,728
so I was able to sell it at a high price.

271
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,064
Thank you, babe.

272
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,887
I love you so much, Noli.

273
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,922
I'll do everything for you.

274
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:12,195
I love you so much too, Esme.

275
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,496
Your wound is about to heal.

276
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,577
Just a few more days.

277
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:47,881
Maybe you want to go somewhere?

278
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,738
I'll take you out.

279
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,982
No need.
Just focus on recovering.

280
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,258
You need to rest.

281
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,759
Who said that?
You’re talking about me.

282
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,873
Can you see that?

283
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,373
See?

284
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,476
You're so arrogant.

285
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,021
That's why you
always get into trouble.

286
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:07,896
But thank you, babe,
for taking care of me.

287
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,121
Geez, you're so dramatic.

288
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,092
I'm serious.

289
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,055
I'll never find
another woman like you.

290
00:25:15,954 --> 00:25:16,954
So,

291
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,184
I'll make it up to you, okay?

292
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,809
Hi, Noli!

293
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,044
It’s been a while.

294
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,529
So, you’ve been discharged.

295
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,232
Since a week ago.

296
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,278
How are you?

297
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,154
You really had me worried!

298
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:14,714
I was actually planning
to visit you in the hospital

299
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,339
to take care of you.

300
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,493
No need.

301
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,996
Esme was there.

302
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,540
She stayed by my side
24/7 at the hospital.

303
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:25,305
Hmm?

304
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,085
It doesn’t seem like it.

305
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,838
I actually saw her
at the barangay the other day.

306
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:33,186
Barangay? What was she doing there?

307
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,760
Why don’t you ask her yourself?

308
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:40,281
You know, when the cat is away,
the mice will play.

309
00:26:41,157 --> 00:26:43,619
Alright, I’ll go now

310
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,259
before I say something else.

311
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:47,485
Okay, bye-bye.

312
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,244
You’re smoking again?

313
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:17,515
Give me that.

314
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,602
Where did the money you used
to pay for the hospital come from?

315
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:26,161
Hmm?

316
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,271
Didn't I tell you that
I already sold a cellphone?

317
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:29,871
Ah... cellphone.

318
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,741
I don't believe it.

319
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,027
Then don't.

320
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:35,274
Alright,

321
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:36,607
let’s do it this way.

322
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:38,265
Let's just play
a guessing game.

323
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:39,991
Is this a person?

324
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:41,694
Huh?

325
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:44,068
- What kind of trip is this?
- Animal?

326
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:45,494
Demon?

327
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,208
Is it Captain?

328
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:50,783
Why do you always
think about Captain?

329
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,589
Because someone told me something.

330
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:56,189
Who?

331
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,433
Secret.

332
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,203
You know, whoever they are,
they're an idiot.

333
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,918
You've been caught red-handed,
and you still won't admit it!

334
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:09,733
Let go of me... Ouch!

335
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,088
Sorry, babe, sorry...

336
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,239
Sorry... sorry...

337
00:28:19,939 --> 00:28:21,857
Sorry. Forgive me.

338
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,342
Sorry, babe. Sorry...
Forgive me.

339
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:30,966
I... I'm really trying, babe, okay?

340
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:33,297
I'm trying...

341
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,438
Please forgive me, okay?

342
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,799
Come on, come on... Sorry.

343
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:40,706
Sorry, babe.

344
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,553
Ah, alright.

345
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,807
Okay, let's just meet there.

346
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:32,450
Okay, sure.

347
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:39,010
Alright, thank you.
See you... Okay.

348
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:51,344
- Take it already.
- How much is that?

349
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:54,841
- Twenty thousand is enough!
- Alright...

350
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:56,538
You're really
a son of a bitch, Francis!

351
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,642
What the hell!
What are you doing?

352
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,118
- Damn it... your iPad is trash.
- Hey, sorry, okay?

353
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,813
I'm not buying that anymore.

354
00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:06,470
Look, they left because of you!

355
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,584
You're so stupid!

356
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,277
That was money turned into dust!

357
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:12,259
You're really annoying...
Don’t follow me!

358
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:14,907
Damn it, Francis!

359
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,294
Get away from me!

360
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:25,503
What was that?

361
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:27,902
What do you mean,
"What was that?"

362
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:31,362
I was about to sell the iPad...
and you had to interfere.

363
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,659
I already said sorry, didn't I?

364
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:35,131
What more do you want?

365
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:38,267
What I want is for you
to fix your way of thinking!

366
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:41,081
You're so dumb...
You keep talking about Captain.

367
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,312
Who’s that?

368
00:30:58,811 --> 00:30:59,816
Nothing... Someone from cable,

369
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:01,321
someone wants a connection installed.

370
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,912
Hello, what time is it...
where are you?

371
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,705
Huh?

372
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,959
What time is it?

373
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,531
Damn it!

374
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,199
Damn it...

375
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:53,424
Shit!

376
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,182
Shit! So unlucky!

377
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,636
Damn it again.
That was money... money!

378
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,304
- Special delivery.
- Thanks, I guess...

379
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,177
Can I get some water?

380
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:18,797
Is that okay?

381
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,846
You haven't shown up
at the barangay, huh?

382
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:28,137
I was just busy.

383
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:29,880
I was actually
planning to go see you...

384
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:35,061
Out of everything I hate, it's waiting.

385
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:36,979
What the hell... Let go of me.

386
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:42,198
I said let go of me! Let me go!

387
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,172
I told you to let me go!

388
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:58,949
Let me go!

389
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:01,760
Let me go...

390
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,447
What the hell! Let me go!

391
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:13,784
Let go...

392
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,676
I said let go of me...
Let me go...

393
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:21,844
Son of a bitch!

394
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:24,075
What?

395
00:33:25,664 --> 00:33:27,255
You're disgusting!

396
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:36,017
Try me!

397
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,311
- Noli...
- Damn you!

398
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:44,077
You're a rapist!

399
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:45,956
I'm reporting you to the police!

400
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:48,510
What? You're going to report me?

401
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:52,477
Son of a bitch... who would
even believe you with your record?

402
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:53,643
Damn you!

403
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:57,582
And what are you even
saying about rape, huh?

404
00:33:58,694 --> 00:33:59,904
Esme wanted it.

405
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:02,634
- You son of a bitch
- Oh, isn't that right, Esme?

406
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:04,647
Get out!

407
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:06,465
You know...

408
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,996
the money she used
to get you out of the hospital,

409
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:13,005
that was my money.

410
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,337
- You already know what that mean—
- Bastard! Get out!

411
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,794
Don't believe him.

412
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,001
You know he likes me,

413
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,361
but he can't have me,
so he's doing this.

414
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:36,892
Who’s better in bed, me or him?

415
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,045
Huh?

416
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:41,202
Where did you do it?

417
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:43,312
At the barangay?

418
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:45,259
Damn you!

419
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:47,884
Did you enjoy it, huh?

420
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:50,676
Sorry, babe... Sorry...

421
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,864
I only did it because I love you.

422
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:57,978
Damn you!

423
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,629
Hey, Noli, how are you?

424
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:48,427
Where have you been?

425
00:35:51,997 --> 00:35:52,997
Babe?

426
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:59,361
You know, I understand
where you’re coming from.

427
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:03,636
But think about it,
I tried every way possible

428
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,288
to pay for the hospital.

429
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,832
I borrowed money...

430
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,960
I looked for work at the market—
but I had nowhere else to turn.

431
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:15,655
I didn’t want give
myself to the Captain.

432
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,062
I hope you understand that.

433
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:20,820
I did it because I love you, Noli.

434
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,140
Really?

435
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,851
You really love me?

436
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,915
Ouch! No! Noli,
not there, please!

437
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,802
No— Not there. No...

438
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:30,579
It hurts!

439
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,125
Please stop!

440
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,049
Babe, eat up.

441
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:31,664
Is that your breakfast again?

442
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:37,723
Come here, let’s eat.

443
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,236
Babe.

444
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:00,381
You’re so serious.

445
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,341
How are you, Noli?

446
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:09,474
I heard that what Esme did
to you is all over the place.

447
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:14,422
Hey, I wasn’t the one
who spread it, okay?

448
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,064
I just heard about it...

449
00:39:17,117 --> 00:39:19,866
But if I were you,

450
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:22,052
I’d get revenge.

451
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,707
Esme can’t be
the only one happy, right?

452
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:32,721
I can help you,

453
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:34,790
if you want...

454
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:11,025
You son of a bitch.
Why’d you stop?

455
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,812
Why? Noli?

456
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,509
Come here— Wait...

457
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,586
Where were you?
With Captain?

458
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,297
What are you saying?

459
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:12,553
I’m asking you where were you?

460
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,887
Can’t you see? I got beaten up.

461
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,058
Who did this to you?

462
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,103
Just a bad deal.

463
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,649
I— I got it... I got it.

464
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,280
Who did this to you?

465
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,659
- Just a bad deal.
- This is the last time, okay?

466
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:42,831
Next time, I won’t let you
do these deals alone.

467
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,330
Does it hurt?

468
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,004
Sorry. Sorry.

469
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,964
It’s okay.

470
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,844
I just miss you
taking care of me, Noli.

471
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,433
Can we start over?
Forget about Captain.

472
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:04,528
Enough!

473
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:09,492
Why? Do you think I wanted
to have sex with him? Huh?

474
00:51:10,626 --> 00:51:13,921
You don’t know,
I have nightmares every night!

475
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:18,592
No matter how much I shower,

476
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,176
I feel disgusted with myself!

477
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:23,829
I did it because I love you.

478
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:26,516
But what did you do?

479
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,417
Huh?

480
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,505
I said enough!

481
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,091
I did it because I love you!

482
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,261
What about me?

483
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,734
I’m sorry.

484
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,788
Stop crying.

485
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,833
I love you so much too, Esme.

486
00:52:33,848 --> 00:52:35,725
Babe, do you see that?
Over there.

487
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,160
Wow.

488
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:39,050
You already know, huh?

489
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,066
Hey— sorry, sorry.

490
00:52:50,373 --> 00:52:53,168
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I’m okay.

491
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:56,292
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it wasn’t hard. I’m okay.

492
00:52:56,317 --> 00:52:57,318
Alright then...

493
00:52:59,985 --> 00:53:02,738
- Here. Thank you, thank you.
- Alright, thank you.

494
00:53:11,499 --> 00:53:13,001
Let’s check what’s inside.

495
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:16,237
- Hold it, babe, count it.
- Hey, dollars.

496
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:21,362
Nice. This is a lot, babe.

497
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:24,048
You’re really amazing.
Oh, right?

498
00:53:24,971 --> 00:53:28,391
- Now, buy your makeup, okay?
- Yes!

499
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:32,217
- Okay.
- Let’s put it back inside.

500
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:35,852
You’re really amazing.

501
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:38,604
That’s why I choose you.

502
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:41,451
Nice.

503
00:53:48,988 --> 00:53:52,274
Babe, look, the lipstick I bought
at the market is so pretty.

504
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,946
Why are you fixing yourself?
Going somewhere?

505
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:58,711
No. I just want to look good for you.

506
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:05,253
Erase that.

507
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:08,142
- What? What are you doing?
- Erase it!

508
00:54:22,152 --> 00:54:23,618
Who’s that? Captain?

509
00:54:24,297 --> 00:54:26,424
What are you talking about?
Him again?

510
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,791
That’s the buyer of the iPad.

511
00:54:29,072 --> 00:54:31,115
And I thought we were okay now?

512
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:33,651
We already talked about that, right?

513
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:37,752
Fine, whatever.

514
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:42,536
Babe.

515
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,272
Babe...

516
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,004
Ouch! What are you doing?

517
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,100
Ouch! What are you doing?

518
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,607
Ouch! What are you doing?

519
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:45,069
Ouch! Stop...

520
01:01:45,662 --> 01:01:47,308
Stop! It hurts!

521
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,282
Ouch! Ouch!

522
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:58,407
Ouch!

523
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:00,009
Ouch!

524
01:02:02,313 --> 01:02:04,817
Stop it— Stop!

525
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,556
Stop...

526
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:11,930
It hurts.

527
01:02:15,705 --> 01:02:16,706
Stop.

528
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,209
Didn’t you say...

529
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,569
you’d do anything,

530
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,529
because you love me?

531
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:25,706
Ouch! Stop! Ouch! Stop!

532
01:03:47,651 --> 01:03:48,777
Hi, Noli!

533
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:52,250
Noli?

534
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,513
Noli, are you okay?

535
01:03:59,644 --> 01:04:00,645
Noli.

536
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:06,124
Why? What happened?

537
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:13,301
Noli?

538
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:18,791
Maybe it’s better if I take you home.

539
01:04:29,713 --> 01:04:30,713
Come on.

540
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:34,625
Come on, Noli.

541
01:05:16,102 --> 01:05:17,771
I’ll talk to Esme first.

542
01:05:17,973 --> 01:05:20,295
Maybe she needs
to take you to the hospital.

543
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:42,348
Noli?

544
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:53,431
Noli!

545
01:05:56,883 --> 01:05:58,023
Damn you!

546
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,343
Traitor!

547
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:02,812
Noli!

548
01:06:08,337 --> 01:06:09,505
Where’s Captain?

549
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,955
Come on! Tell me where Captain is.

550
01:06:14,285 --> 01:06:18,281
- Where’s Captain?
- What? Captain’s not here!

551
01:06:21,879 --> 01:06:22,922
Noli...

552
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,151
Liar.

553
01:06:28,732 --> 01:06:30,652
This is not true.

554
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:34,910
This isn’t true— No...

555
01:06:35,586 --> 01:06:37,139
No, no...

556
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:42,486
No!

557
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:53,177
Babe, I promise you,
I’ll fix my life.

558
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:57,168
I’ll get rich so
we don’t have to steal again.

559
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:02,977
I don’t want our future kids
to eat from stolen money.

560
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:08,354
Noli.

561
01:07:11,545 --> 01:07:12,545
Hi, ma'am.

562
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:14,855
How is he, nurse?

563
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:20,088
He’s doing better now
compared to the past few days.

564
01:07:20,113 --> 01:07:22,492
His episodes have lessened.

565
01:07:23,941 --> 01:07:27,194
- Alright, ma’am, I’ll get going now.
- Alright, thank you.

566
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:35,327
Noli, how are you?

567
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:40,102
Sorry it took me
a while to visit again.

568
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:45,351
I have a job now at a factory.
It’s nearby.

569
01:07:45,376 --> 01:07:47,437
I have money for your medicine now.

570
01:07:55,653 --> 01:07:56,654
Look.

571
01:07:58,226 --> 01:08:00,186
- What’s that?
- My love gave me this.

572
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,064
I’m sorry for bringing you here.

573
01:08:05,637 --> 01:08:07,561
I had to. But...

574
01:08:08,055 --> 01:08:10,724
once you’re better,
I’ll take you home, okay?

575
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:13,188
Okay?

576
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,889
I really, really miss you.

577
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:23,101
I really, really miss you.
