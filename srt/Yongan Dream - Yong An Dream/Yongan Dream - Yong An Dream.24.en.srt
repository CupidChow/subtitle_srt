(Cheng Garden)

00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:06,132
Spare the formalities.

20
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,860
You've been taking care
of Yan every day.

21
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,692
It must be hard for you.

22
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,021
I don't know if my son is lucky

23
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:20,771
or not.

24
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,931
I believe in him.

25
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:26,051
He will wake up.

26
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:47,171
(The Empress's accomplices
had been eliminated.)

27
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,341
(The guilty ones also)

28
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,092
(had been punished.)

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,120
(Yanchun Palace)

30
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:23,252
(Father has been reinstated.)

31
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:26,140
(There will be good news)

32
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,891
(from Ran and Official Zhou soon.)

33
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,532
I don't feel cold.

34
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:31,611
Miss Man said

35
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,891
you should be careful

36
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:35,852
and not catch a cold.

37
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:39,491
You keep repeating
what Miss Man said day after day.

38
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:43,901
I only listen

39
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:45,741
because she talks

40
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,491
about you.

41
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:50,621
Miss Shen Ran,

42
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:52,372
don't be jealous of me anymore.

43
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,132
I can't take responsibility for it.

44
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:56,661
I am not jealous.

45
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:58,901
All right, I know you are enjoying

46
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:00,451
your playful banter.

47
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,331
Miss Man,

48
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:04,741
where are you going

49
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,252
with your luggage?

50
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,331
Return to my hometown.

51
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,341
Everything is settled.

52
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:12,211
The guilty ones have been punished.

53
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,741
I also want to thank you

54
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:15,580
and Official Lu for finding my sister.

55
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:17,620
I want to take her back home
to worship our ancestors.

56
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,132
So our parents no longer worry.

57
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,492
Then I will reopen Bai Apothecary.

58
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,781
I wish you all the best.

59
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:25,980
If you need anything,

60
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:27,300
you can write to me.

61
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,940
Thank you, Miss Shen Ran.

62
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:31,581
I also wish you and Official Zhou

63
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:33,211
a long and harmonious relationship.

64
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,052
Then I wish you

65
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,692
a safe journey.

66
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:52,341
Since she brought it up,

67
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:53,661
shouldn't we...

68
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:54,732
What?

69
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,300
I don't care

70
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,211
what people think.

71
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,692
You're right.

72
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:05,612
Since ancient times,
true love has been rare.

73
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,940
A marriage contract

74
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,732
is just a piece of paper.

75
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,851
It's not important.

76
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:11,932
Not important?

77
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:13,331
What do you mean?

78
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:14,540
When two people love each other,

79
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,971
they should also marry properly.

80
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:17,692
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,331
Where are you going?

82
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:23,021
Preparing betrothal gifts
to marry in a proper manner.

83
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,701
I... I never said I agree.

84
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:25,461
You did.

85
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:26,300
I did not.

86
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,300
Yes, you did.

87
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,451
Yes,

88
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,651
I heard it.

89
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:32,261
- Father.
- Uncle Shen.

90
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:33,021
You

91
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,740
should prepare two geese quickly.

92
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,060
I'll wait here.

93
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:37,940
I'll go and prepare them right away.

94
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:39,132
Off you go.

95
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:42,620
Father,

96
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:43,781
how could you agree

97
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:44,851
to marry me off like that?

98
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,740
After all, he deeply loves

99
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,612
and is devoted to you.

100
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,821
Qing Li. Qing Li.

101
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:52,692
Coming.

102
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,692
Go and prepare for a grand wedding.

103
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:59,291
For Miss and Official Zhou?

104
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,500
That's great! I'll go right away.

105
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,550
I'll prepare them right away.

106
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:03,451
- I'll go now.
- Hurry.

107
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:09,980
Official Zhou,

108
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,141
why are you so happy?

109
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:13,331
I'm going to prepare
the betrothal gifts for my wedding.

110
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:14,732
Oh, congratulations!

111
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:21,901
(Not forgetting
about Su Heng and Miss Xu,)

112
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:22,940
(I never thought)

113
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:24,300
(they would end up together.)

114
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,461
Go to the border with me?

115
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:26,821
Aren't you being too direct?

116
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:28,851
I'll just say whatever is in my mind.

117
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:31,531
The weather is too harsh.

118
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:34,940
The land is flat.

119
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,252
It's perfect for you to ride freely.

120
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:38,932
I have no relatives or friends.

121
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:41,980
All the soldiers

122
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,549
are your family.

123
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,461
There are always people available
for you to spar with.

124
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:48,132
If you want to drink,
you can drink it from the jar.

125
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,740
So what kind of position
you're planning to give me, Commandant Su?

126
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,100
Position?

127
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,411
You're not going there
to take on any positions.

128
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,420
Then what am I doing there?

129
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:59,692
Since you're going with me, so...

130
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,372
So it's naturally...

131
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,812
It's naturally...

132
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:06,821
Didn't you just say

133
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,211
you speak whatever is on your mind?

134
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,252
Wait!

135
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:15,132
What?

136
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,851
I like you.

137
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:22,012
I want to marry you.

138
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:23,851
All right.

139
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,891
Go to Jibei with me.

140
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,771
To Jibei?

141
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,492
I can't marry into your family.

142
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:37,300
You're not going to Jibei with me
to meet my father.

143
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,211
Do you intend to take his daughter
away directly?

144
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:41,740
Yes, we have to go.

145
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:43,052
We'll go right now.

146
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:44,812
Xu Yiqing.

147
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:47,771
What?

148
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,692
Put me down!

149
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:54,661
We're going to the border!

150
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:55,781
You silly man!

151
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:57,732
Put me down now!

152
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:06,000
(May you be healthy)

153
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:10,932
Lu Shiyan,

154
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:14,932
can I trust you

155
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:20,331
this time?

156
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,381
It's been a few days.

157
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:42,571
Why isn't he waking up yet?

158
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,621
Eldest Princess, don't worry.

159
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:48,901
The Imperial Physician said
he was hit in the head.

160
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,571
So there might be a blood clot.

161
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:52,212
Once the clot disperses,

162
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:53,691
he'll be fine.

163
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:00,691
(Lu Shiyan!)

164
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:02,972
(Lu Shiyan.)

165
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:18,332
She's gone.

166
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:20,531
What did you say to her?

167
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:24,580
Do I need to say anything else to her?

168
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,540
She's just a criminal's daughter.

169
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,852
Staying with you,

170
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,372
Following you,
she'll be a concubine at most.

171
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:31,460
Now, she can

172
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:33,261
become the Marchioness Changping.

173
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,300
What is there for her
to be reluctant about it?

174
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:36,621
That's why she hurries there

175
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:37,781
as fast as she can.

176
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:39,012
She would never do that.

177
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,252
And my wife

178
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,492
can only be her in the end.

179
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,691
I'm getting old now.

180
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,691
In the future,

181
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:52,291
I won't be able to control
anything anymore.

182
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,571
But as long as I'm alive,

183
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:59,612
I will only acknowledge
this marriage arrangement.

184
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,571
You should know this.

185
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,931
Romantic feelings

186
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:08,460
are never as important

187
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,651
as the burden on your shoulders.

188
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:18,852
Lu Shiyan.

189
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:21,372
Yan.

190
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,972
You're awake.

191
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,060
Mother.

192
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,252
Yan.

193
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,411
Who is she?

194
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:53,852
Don't you recognize her?

195
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:00,621
She's your future wife.

196
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:03,171
Our Duke Zhenguo Residence's
daughter-in-law.

197
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,732
(As long as I'm alive,)

198
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:20,972
(I will only acknowledge
this marriage arrangement.)

199
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:21,931
No.

200
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,492
She's not the one I want to marry.

201
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,291
I will not marry you.

202
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:35,012
Did you hit your head silly?

203
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,972
Say no more.

204
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,092
I've made up my mind.

205
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,012
Does it not hurt?

206
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:16,092
Don't worry about it.

207
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:18,372
You can leave.

208
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:22,252
I said, leave.

209
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,051
Zhen!

210
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:30,771
You...

211
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,372
What are you doing?

212
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:39,381
Fine, anything you say.

213
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:40,732
Ran!

214
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:43,141
He said he's not marrying me.

215
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:43,901
What happened?

216
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:46,972
I don't know if he's been hit silly
by that beam.

217
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:50,051
Anyway, he said he would not marry me
even if he had to die.

218
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:51,141
He also said

219
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,940
he no longer suffers from heartbreak
when I cried.

220
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,021
Heartbreak?

221
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,012
What should I do?

222
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:58,531
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Miss Shen Zhen,

223
00:12:58,622 --> 00:12:59,852
don't worry.

224
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:01,580
Official Lu suffered a head injury.

225
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,060
Maybe it's just temporary?

226
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:06,372
How long is "temporary?"

227
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,691
What if he doesn't recognize me

228
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,420
for a lifetime?

229
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:15,411
He laughed at me when I cried.

230
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,891
I'd rather it was me who got hit.

231
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,820
Have you thought it through?

232
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:39,811
It'll backfire
if you do this to make him suffer.

233
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:40,781
The physician said

234
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:42,460
giving him some stimulation at this time

235
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:43,811
might help.

236
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:45,141
Miss,

237
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:45,901
you cried

238
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:47,411
all night yesterday.

239
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,492
Isn't he still fine now?

240
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:52,741
Maybe yesterday's tears

241
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:53,781
weren't enough.

242
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:56,021
We need stronger stimulation this time.

243
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:57,051
Give it to me.

244
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:51,852
Your Highness.

245
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,171
Come with me.

246
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,852
Mother,

247
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:07,180
why did you bring her here again?

248
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:08,612
Why?

249
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,332
To discuss your marriage.

250
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:15,132
I've already made it clear.

251
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,891
I will not marry her.

252
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:17,661
You...

253
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:19,332
I'm not willing to marry her, either.

254
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,291
Fine.

255
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:24,931
I'll make myself clear too.

256
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:26,771
My daughter-in-law

257
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,092
can only be her.

258
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:33,501
Mother, there's no need
to repeat yourself.

259
00:15:33,502 --> 00:15:35,852
If you've made up your mind,

260
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,931
then forgive me for being unfilial.

261
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,291
In this lifetime,

262
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,811
I shall not marry.

263
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:50,411
Zhen!

264
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,021
You'll regret this!

265
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:53,291
Zhen!

266
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:55,291
Zhen!

267
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,651
Zhen.

268
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,411
Don't tell me
you don't want him anymore?

269
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,901
He doesn't want me anymore.

270
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:06,291
Why do I still want him?

271
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,261
Isn't he injured now?

272
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:09,661
He remembers everyone

273
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,180
except me.

274
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,101
Does he not have me

275
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,180
in his heart?

276
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,300
Impossible.

277
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:15,580
Have you forgotten

278
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,220
your resolute words to me back then?

279
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:20,252
Both of you said
neither of you will marry anyone else.

280
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:25,332
My child,

281
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:28,651
I've asked all the Imperial Physicians
at the palace.

282
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:29,901
After such a severe injury,

283
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,540
it's possible for this to happen.

284
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,661
This blood clot

285
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:34,180
might just be pressing on the part

286
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:35,852
where you exist.

287
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:38,171
Once the clot disperses,

288
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,691
you'll appear.

289
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:43,531
Trust me.

290
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:45,771
You will definitely appear.

291
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,420
Look at how difficult
it has been for you two.

292
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:51,861
You've experienced so much.

293
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:55,171
Such deep feelings
are rare in this world.

294
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,820
Besides, life is full

295
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,452
of ups and downs.

296
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,452
Once you've already held hands,

297
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:03,691
then don't let go.

298
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm just a little emotional

299
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,932
and feeling helpless.

300
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:17,932
I will not give up.

301
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:22,571
There, there, my child. I understand.

302
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,371
In that case,

303
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,621
can you be more patient with him?

304
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:28,621
If he makes you angry again

305
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:30,301
in the future,

306
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,212
you can tell me. I'll beat him up.

307
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:38,331
Look how beautiful when you smile.

308
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,652
Master.

309
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,771
Is there any urgent case?

310
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:46,980
You can bring it to me first.

311
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:47,972
There is one.

312
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:49,531
Well, the case is

313
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,220
about a couple

314
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,581
who were a perfect match

315
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:53,661
and betrothed.

316
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:56,732
However, the man suddenly
called off the engagement,

317
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:58,890
causing the woman to be heartbroken

318
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,260
and nearly attempt suicide
several times.

319
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:01,901
Now, the woman's family

320
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:03,732
wants to sue the man

321
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,851
for being heartless.

322
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,611
What are you trying to say?

323
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:15,972
Master,

324
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,220
others might not know what happened

325
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:19,652
between you and Miss Shen Zhen,

326
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,652
but I know everything clearly.

327
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:22,420
You two

328
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:24,652
are really a couple in love.

329
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:29,220
All I know is the person I want to marry

330
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,212
is not the one
my mother wants me to marry.

331
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:33,611
Besides, I don't even remember

332
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,091
who this Miss Shen Zhen is.

333
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:36,901
Then do you remember

334
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:38,771
who you want to marry?

335
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,611
I don't remember.

336
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:48,172
Master,

337
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,420
if you trust me,

338
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:54,180
be kinder to Miss Shen Zhen.

339
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:55,220
If not,

340
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,381
make sure your memory never recovers.

341
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,531
Otherwise,
you'll be in a miserable state.

342
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:02,901
Whether my memory recovers or not,

343
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,692
the thing I can guarantee is

344
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:07,091
you'll be in a
more miserable state than I am.

345
00:19:13,142 --> 00:19:15,091
He has a point.

346
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,901
(It looks like it's time for me)

347
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,732
(to take action.)

348
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
(Jin Money House)

349
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,371
I...

350
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:27,611
Mister,

351
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:29,341
don't worry.

352
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,341
We won't damage

353
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:31,780
any of your things.

354
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,932
We're just temporarily
borrowing the place.

355
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:36,811
I don't mind at all.

356
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,012
Thank you.

357
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:40,101
Is everything ready?

358
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:41,500
Yang Zong has brought him over.

359
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,611
Everything is ready.

360
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:43,811
Where's Zhen?

361
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:46,371
She's been preparing inside
since early this morning.

362
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,420
Let's go.

363
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,131
All right.

364
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,000
(Jin Money House)

365
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:51,420
Hello.

366
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,700
Come and take a look. These are fresh.

367
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:53,811
Come and take a look.

368
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:55,861
That pancake soup shop ahead

369
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,260
has really good business.

370
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,012
Their beef soup is truly fragrant.

371
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:00,172
Really?

372
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:01,012
What...

373
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:02,851
Fire!

374
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:05,200
Fire! Help!

375
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,061
Is there anyone inside?

376
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,180
Yes!

377
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:08,581
There's a young lady

378
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,700
inside the warehouse.

379
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,851
She couldn't escape in time.

380
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:15,492
Is there anyone here?

381
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,531
Help!

382
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:29,851
Help!

383
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:33,012
Help!

384
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:35,252
Help!

385
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:39,291
My foot is stuck!

386
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,932
Help me.

387
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,051
Help.

388
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,652
Official Zhou,

389
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:57,661
I didn't expect you

390
00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:58,811
to behave recklessly like them.

391
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:06,851
Lu Shiyan!

392
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:09,531
Lu Shiyan!

393
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:14,851
Miss,

394
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,821
stop wasting your effort.

395
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,371
I will not marry you.

396
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:20,331
Your persistent pursuit

397
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:22,492
only disgusts me.

398
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:36,861
Help!

399
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,861
Little miss.

400
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:38,901
Help!

401
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:39,541
Stop yelling!

402
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,892
Help!

403
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,212
Come.

404
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:46,381
Help!

405
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:47,732
Little miss...

406
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:10,811
Master, I'll go after him. I'll go.

407
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,412
Miss.

408
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:25,700
Miss, are you all right?

409
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,771
Do you need me to get your family?

410
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:30,932
Miss?

411
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:38,131
You remembered?

412
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:41,500
Miss,

413
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,101
I'll throw you into
the Magistrate Office's prison

414
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:45,692
if you keep harassing me.

415
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:47,740
It's not like I was never there.

416
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,661
I'm not scared of you.

417
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:50,101
Confucius virtues,

418
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,051
I supposed
you've never learned any of it.

419
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,531
You keep doing this.

420
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,252
What else are you planning?

421
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,531
No more, I give up.

422
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:08,692
I dare not do this anymore.

423
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:10,581
Whatever happens in the future,
then so be it.

424
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:12,212
I've finally understood.

425
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:13,771
You endure the suffering,

426
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:15,732
while I bear the blame.

427
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,571
It's all the same in the end.

428
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,412
Where does Miss Shen Zhen live?

429
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,160
I need to make things clear to her.

430
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,141
Baixiang Pavilion.

431
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:24,500
Let's go.

432
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,700
You go ahead. I still need to finish
my horse-stance punishment.

433
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,291
Then keep at it and wait for my return.

434
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:30,611
Miss,

435
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:32,331
Lu Shiyan is here.

436
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:33,692
Lu Shiyan, he remembered.

437
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:34,740
Has his

438
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:36,091
memory returned?

439
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:42,652
Greetings, everyone.

440
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:44,861
Please leave us.

441
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,771
I have something to tell Miss Shen Zhen.

442
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,091
Do you

443
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:07,892
remember now?

444
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:13,172
Miss Shen Zhen,

445
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:15,811
I don't care what happened

446
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,932
between us in the past.

447
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,811
But

448
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:21,892
I don't want to marry you anymore.

449
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,091
I hope you can let go of this idea.

450
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:28,771
All right.

451
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:31,861
I'll give up.

452
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,652
I appreciate it.

453
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,341
This Lu Shiyan.

454
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:39,932
I'm going to teach him.

455
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:45,811
Lu Shiyan!

456
00:24:46,342 --> 00:24:46,780
I...

457
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:48,012
- Are you okay?
- Come, let's go.

458
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:53,811
Lu Shiyan,

459
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:55,212
are you okay?

460
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,692
Lu Shiyan.

461
00:24:58,461 --> 00:24:59,420
Lu Shiyan,

462
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:00,732
what's wrong?

463
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:02,811
Can you hear me?

464
00:25:03,062 --> 00:25:04,252
Lu Shiyan.

465
00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:12,740
Lu Shiyan!

466
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:14,821
- Lu Shiyan, wake up!
- Official Lu.

467
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,061
- Official Lu.
- Lu Shiyan!

468
00:25:16,062 --> 00:25:17,581
- Lu Shiyan!
- Official Lu!

469
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,291
- What should we do?
- Open your eyes!

470
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:31,851
Do you think

471
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:32,621
he'll become

472
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,531
more foolish after he wakes up

473
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:36,101
that he can't even

474
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,652
recognize me anymore?

475
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,091
I don't know.

476
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:42,012
In any case,
he doesn't remember me anymore.

477
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:43,291
It's okay.

478
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:46,061
If he doesn't recognize me,

479
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:47,892
then we don't need him.

480
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:50,571
From now on, you will be my daughter.

481
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:51,972
Sure.

482
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:01,341
Bad news, Your Majesty.

483
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:02,932
A fire broke out!

484
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:04,740
The assassins are here!

485
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:05,531
Protect His Majesty!

486
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:44,252
(For the people,)

487
00:26:44,822 --> 00:26:46,771
(for our duty as officials,)

488
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:48,972
(for the merit of saving the Emperor,)

489
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:53,412
(can I exchange it
for a marriage contract?)

490
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:03,652
It seems

491
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:09,212
I'm really dying.

492
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,531
That's good.

493
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:15,012
I can see you one last time.

494
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,012
It's me.

495
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:31,131
I've returned.

496
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:40,972
Why did you return?

497
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:43,051
To see you.

498
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:45,051
How are you adapting

499
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:49,212
to the cold of the north?

500
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:53,012
Not well.

501
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,091
I'm sorry.

502
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:01,091
I failed to protect you.

503
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:07,492
But

504
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,492
I just want to be with you.

505
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,611
If there's one more chance,

506
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:22,091
would you marry me?

507
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:29,252
It's too late.

508
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:32,771
But if there is a chance?

509
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:48,412
If there is,

510
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:50,212
I'll follow the rites and customs

511
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:53,371
to marry you in a proper manner

512
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:59,371
and will never betray you.

513
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,291
If I die,

514
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:23,091
don't cry

515
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:26,811
or feel sad.

516
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:28,932
Or else

517
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:34,131
my heart will break.

518
00:29:39,622 --> 00:29:41,972
I only have one wish.

519
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,252
I only wish

520
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:49,692
for you to live in peace.

521
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,531
I don't want that.

522
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:54,661
Forgive me.

523
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:56,531
I only want you.

524
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:02,172
You still have a long life ahead of you.

525
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:06,811
Forgive me.

526
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:15,811
I can no longer be with you anymore.

527
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:54,932
Yan?

528
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:57,260
Yan?

529
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:59,091
- Lu Shiyan?
- Are you waking up?

530
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:02,452
(It has been more than 30 years.)

531
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:04,460
(Do you still want to hang on?)

532
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:05,932
(Yes.)

533
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,692
(At least, I want to tell him)

534
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:11,371
(that going to the north)

535
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:13,732
(was not my intention.)

536
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:16,371
(I had)

537
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:18,972
(so much affection for him.)

538
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:21,811
(Even if there was another chance,)

539
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:25,061
(the ending might not be satisfactory.)

540
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:27,531
(But I really want)

541
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:30,012
(to see him one more time.)

542
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:34,051
(Even as strangers.)

543
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:41,492
(Just to see him from afar)

544
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,661
(would be enough.)

545
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:47,301
(Seven thousand candles,)

546
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:49,611
(lit for only one person.)

547
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,692
(With yearning deep down,)

548
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:56,371
(no medicine can heal it.)

549
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,412
(Seven thousand candles,)

550
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:05,012
(lit for only one person.)

551
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:10,932
So that's what happened, Zhen.

552
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:22,131
(Lu Shiyan,)

553
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:23,692
(are you okay?)

554
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,692
(Lu Shiyan!)

555
00:32:33,062 --> 00:32:34,571
Why is he crying?

556
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:49,051
Are you awake?

557
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:51,012
You don't remember me anyway.

558
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,252
Zhen.

559
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:13,091
You're okay now.

560
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:16,732
I'm glad you're okay.

561
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,492
Don't ever leave me again.

562
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:34,172
Have you remembered everything?

563
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:39,652
You!

564
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,220
Have you forgotten

565
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:42,740
what you said to me

566
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:44,611
in front of everyone at Jin Money House?

567
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:47,131
You said,

568
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,500
"Miss,

569
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:51,940
stop wasting your effort.

570
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:53,780
I will not marry you.

571
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,692
Your persistent pursuit

572
00:33:55,941 --> 00:33:59,331
only disgusts me."

573
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:02,091
At the carriage, you said,

574
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:04,531
"Miss,

575
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:06,851
I'll throw you
into the Magistrate Office's prison

576
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:09,972
if you keep harassing me."

577
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:18,812
I was...

578
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,452
Do you really not remember that?

579
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:22,740
Well, it's just right.

580
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:23,780
Doesn't this prove

581
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:24,780
that I'm not promiscuous

582
00:34:24,781 --> 00:34:26,141
and not easily tempted?

583
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:27,492
A true gentleman.

584
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:30,051
A true gentleman, huh?

585
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,171
I've lost my memory too.

586
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:35,332
Mister,

587
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:36,892
who are you?

588
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:40,332
Don't come after me.

589
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:43,772
Son,

590
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,340
didn't I tell you

591
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:47,171
that you'll regret it.

592
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:49,852
Mother,

593
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,492
do you think I still have hope?

594
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,211
I can't remember anything, either.

595
00:34:58,542 --> 00:34:59,691
Mother...

596
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:35,492
Recently, due to a severe injury,

597
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,691
a particularly severe injury,

598
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:40,012
I acted out of character

599
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:42,251
and caused trouble for everyone.

600
00:35:42,462 --> 00:35:43,651
Official Lu,

601
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:45,051
not at all.

602
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:46,740
After this,

603
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,731
you don't have to come
and trouble us anymore.

604
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,452
But my feelings for Zhen are real.

605
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:54,021
They are as vast as the universe.

606
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:56,300
Then you can seek the universe.

607
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:57,412
Why are you here?

608
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,091
Uncle Shen.

609
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,501
Actually, I think Official Lu...

610
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:24,691
Who cares what you think?

611
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,892
This is the Shen family's matter.

612
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:29,332
Yes.

613
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:38,171
Then can I see Zhen?

614
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:39,492
No.

615
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,772
Let me see her once.

616
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:44,820
Give me a chance to make amends.

617
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,141
Zhen lost face

618
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:47,260
because of you

619
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:48,412
in front of the whole city.

620
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:49,900
You said all those harsh words

621
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:51,892
in front of everyone.

622
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:54,211
Now, do you think sending these things,

623
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:55,541
meeting her,

624
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,332
and apologizing can amend this?

625
00:36:58,462 --> 00:36:59,541
Official Lu,

626
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:00,740
you're an important figure.

627
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:02,021
We can't afford to offend you.

628
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,012
But

629
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,812
the daughters of the Shen family
are precious too.

630
00:37:06,582 --> 00:37:07,812
Please leave.

631
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,211
- Miss Shen Ran...
- All right.

632
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,412
Baixiang Pavilion
still has business to run.

633
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,860
Unlike the Duke Zhenguo Residence,
which has vast estates.

634
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:16,131
Take care and see yourself out.

635
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,171
Miss Shen Ran...

636
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:23,571
Uncle...

637
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,220
You're a high-ranking official.

638
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:34,211
But you're also henpecked.

639
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:36,611
henpecked?

640
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:39,820
So you're not henpecked?

641
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:40,700
If you're not henpecked,

642
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:42,492
what's with the pleading
and begging just now?

643
00:37:45,422 --> 00:37:46,492
Tell me

644
00:37:46,821 --> 00:37:48,452
what I should do now.

645
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:53,260
Didn't we just talk about it just now?

646
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:54,571
Face.

647
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:57,501
First, restore

648
00:37:57,502 --> 00:37:59,292
Miss Shen Zhen's face.

649
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:03,012
Face.

650
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:10,900
Duke Zhenguo Residence's heir,
Lu Shiyan,

651
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:13,780
wishes to marry Miss Shen Zhen
of the Shen family,

652
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:15,661
to build a century-long bond.

653
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:17,780
He vows never to marry another
in this lifetime,

654
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:19,731
and never to betray her.

655
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,260
Duke Zhenguo Residence's heir,
Lu Shiyan,

656
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:27,461
wishes to marry Miss Shen Zhen
of the Shen family,

657
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,300
to build a century-long bond.

658
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,421
He vows never to marry another
in this lifetime

659
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,332
and never to betray her.

660
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:38,691
Ran.

661
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,012
Come back inside.

662
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:43,171
Ran,

663
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:44,780
he knows he did wrong.

664
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:45,581
Besides,

665
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:47,651
it wasn't his fault.

666
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:50,571
I know.

667
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:54,220
I know you love each other

668
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:56,412
and I know it hasn't been easy
for you both.

669
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:58,421
But since we're talking about marriage,

670
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,012
it should be a precious one.

671
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:01,421
Why are marriages

672
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,340
dictated by parents and matchmakers,

673
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,691
and require formalities and ceremonies?

674
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,541
All of this signifies

675
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:09,380
your future standing

676
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,661
in their family,

677
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:12,220
the respect and importance
you'll receive

678
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:14,131
from everyone at Duke Zhenguo Residence,

679
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,332
do you understand?

680
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:16,691
I'll go and talk to Father.

681
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,251
Zhen.

682
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,012
Father!

683
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:22,412
I'm here to help you.

684
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:24,892
Me too.

685
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:34,972
You're not angry anymore?

686
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:40,292
Father,

687
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,492
where did you put my agarwood?

688
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:47,932
Ran.

689
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:50,412
Father, why is he here?

690
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:51,892
Ran,

691
00:39:52,942 --> 00:39:54,461
I know what's on your mind.

692
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:55,340
But we also need

693
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:57,012
to understand their feelings.

694
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:59,021
They have been through

695
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,452
so much together.

696
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:02,021
Besides,

697
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:03,220
life

698
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:04,892
is short

699
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:07,051
and must not be wasted.

700
00:40:07,462 --> 00:40:08,492
Uncle Shen.

701
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:10,251
Miss Shen Ran.

702
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:11,812
I, Lu Shiyan,

703
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,051
sincerely request
to marry Miss Shen Zhen.

704
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,531
I vow to only marry one woman
in my lifetime,

705
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:19,492
to have only one wife.

706
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,611
I'll never take concubines

707
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:24,211
and will always cherish her.

708
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:40,581
Okay, I agree

709
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:41,972
with your proposal.

710
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:44,571
Ran.

711
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:51,691
It's not proper

712
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:53,731
for you to discuss marriage.

713
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:00,611
Send someone from the Duke Zhenguo Residence
to discuss it.

714
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,211
I'll discuss this in person.

715
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:09,972
Your Highness.

716
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:13,091
We'll be family after this.

717
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,691
No need for formalities.

718
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:16,820
I completely agree

719
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,452
with what Yan just said.

720
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:21,131
Yan, you must keep this in mind.

721
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,820
If you can't fulfill your promise
in the future,

722
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:26,372
I'll break your legs.

723
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:30,091
Don't worry.

724
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:31,700
After the marriage,

725
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:33,292
I will treat Zhen

726
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,611
like my own daughter.

727
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:38,892
I will not allow anyone

728
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:40,651
to mistreat her.
