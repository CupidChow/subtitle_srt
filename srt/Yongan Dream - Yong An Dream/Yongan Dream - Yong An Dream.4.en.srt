Trust me.

21
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:17,104
What... Is she crying again?

22
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:18,905
It doesn't seem like it.

23
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,193
(In dreams,)

24
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,234
(you missed out on each other,)

25
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,633
(which caused her
to shed too many tears.)

26
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:29,114
(In reality,)

27
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,954
(you should have had a perfect ending.)

28
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:33,905
(But you caused her to shed
too many tears again.)

29
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,905
Miss, do you admire him?

30
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,425
No.

31
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:48,114
I've experienced it before.

32
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:50,425
So you don't have to hide it from me.

33
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,153
Have you cried because of him?

34
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:55,264
No.

35
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,074
Have you experienced heartache
because of him?

36
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,305
Not me, but he did.

37
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,064
Can you tell me

38
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:03,593
why did he make me

39
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:04,984
come here?

40
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,274
To break your destined relationship.

41
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,745
Our destined relationship?

42
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:14,394
He's overthinking it.

43
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,834
To be precise,

44
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:18,145
your destined relationship
in your previous life.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,554
You meant karmic bond, right?

46
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:20,984
You can say that.

47
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:23,593
All right.

48
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,944
Tell me how to break it.

49
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:29,593
Well,

50
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:31,873
give up on him

51
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:32,674
will do the deed.

52
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:33,784
No.

53
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,873
Didn't you say
you have no feelings for him?

54
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:36,954
I did say that.

55
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,585
But I can't give up on him.

56
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:41,834
Unless he saves my father.

57
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:44,465
Naturally, I'll have nothing
to do with him anymore.

58
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,865
I see.

59
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:50,504
You still have such a tie.

60
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:54,264
Please have some tea.

61
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,873
I truly believe that your heart aches.

62
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,384
I can't believe you'd fall for that.

63
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:20,753
Dreamlike ties bind deeply,

64
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:23,544
future karmic bond entanglements.

65
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:26,633
If this karmic bond isn't resolved,

66
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,345
forgive me for not being able to help.

67
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:31,594
What karmic bond?

68
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,424
The karmic bond
that's due to her father.

69
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,073
If this matter

70
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:38,265
isn't resolved properly,

71
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:40,193
I'm afraid

72
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:42,744
you'll be spending
your whole life in tears.

73
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:47,224
The moment people get what they want,

74
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,193
their attachments weaken.

75
00:04:50,194 --> 00:04:53,025
By then, maybe everything will be fine.

76
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:58,114
Maybe everything will be fine?

77
00:04:58,115 --> 00:04:59,193
In the end,

78
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:01,104
we still have to depend on ourselves.

79
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,304
Then shouldn't you refund our money too?

80
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,705
You're...

81
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:07,465
Vulgar.

82
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:08,034
Me?

83
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:09,554
You wanted to solve your problems.

84
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:11,385
Don't you need my guidance too?

85
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:11,994
I...

86
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,624
Listen here, mister.

87
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:15,424
In life,

88
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,825
one shouldn't be too petty.

89
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,705
Me? Petty?

90
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,265
- I'm being petty?
- Yang Zong.

91
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:26,145
Fine.

92
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:33,945
How vulgar.

93
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,953
You're Shen Wenqi's daughter?

94
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,753
You jinx!

95
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:42,184
It's all because of you!

96
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,433
-It's her fault.
-Is everything alright?

97
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:45,114
It's her.

98
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:47,114
The West Canal your father constructed

99
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:50,034
killed my child!

100
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,873
I hope he gets executed soon.

101
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,873
Yes, he should be executed soon!

102
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:56,714
Publicly provoking,
according to the law...

103
00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:59,554
Let them be. Once the verification result
of the construction plans comes out,

104
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,465
they'll naturally understand.

105
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,145
Why are you still here?

106
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:10,424
(Retribution will come sooner or later.)

107
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:21,265
Are you hurt?

108
00:06:22,795 --> 00:06:23,864
I'm fine.

109
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:26,994
Official Lu,

110
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,300
the results are out.

111
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,025
It was an error in the construction plans
that caused the collapse of the West Canal.

112
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:32,313
When the people heard

113
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,273
of this,

114
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:34,994
they started to pressure the court

115
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,664
to execute Shen Wenqi.

116
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,224
What?

117
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,385
How is that possible?

118
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,273
My father's construction plans
are absolutely flawless.

119
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:47,393
We've verified them.

120
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:49,265
My brother-in-law also verified them.

121
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,104
Calm down.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,714
I'll go to the Imperial Censorate.

123
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:53,984
I want to go too.

124
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,265
If you don't cry,

125
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:06,825
I'll take you.

126
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:24,825
Official Zhou,

127
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,664
how did the West Canal case turn out?

128
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:33,104
He will be executed after autumn.

129
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:36,154
Official Zhou,
please make your way inside.

130
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,664
We'll discuss this matter inside.

131
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:48,345
Official Lu,

132
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,594
is there any hope
for my father's situation?

133
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,994
He would never make a mistake.

134
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,945
You go back to Cheng Garden first
and wait for my news.

135
00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:54,433
I...

136
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,345
Be good.

137
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,184
Then I'll wait for your news there.

138
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:14,864
On the street today,

139
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,705
I noticed some refugees.

140
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:18,825
Chengxi is severely affected.

141
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:20,744
There are refugees everywhere
in the city.

142
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,905
But there's something suspicious
about them.

143
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:24,784
They wear ragged clothes.

144
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,184
But their shoes

145
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:27,984
are fine.

146
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,114
Logically,

147
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:31,034
shoes are more likely
to wear out than clothes.

148
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,553
And they're coming from Chengxi,

149
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,984
where it's prone to flooding.

150
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:35,065
Yet, their shoes are clean,

151
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:37,234
without a speck of mud.

152
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:39,425
Because some people
are posing as refugees

153
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,384
to incite the public

154
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:44,553
with the intention
to pressure the court.

155
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:45,913
So they can quickly resolve

156
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:47,474
the West Canal case.

157
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,425
Official Lu, you're meticulous
in your thoughts.

158
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:50,864
It's truly admirable.

159
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:52,074
So Official Zhou,

160
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:54,545
what did you use to convince the Emperor

161
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:57,224
not to immediately execute Shen Wenqi?

162
00:08:57,874 --> 00:08:59,345
How did you know

163
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:01,753
it was me who persuaded the Emperor?

164
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,153
Given the current situation,

165
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:05,474
Official Shen may not be kept alive
until tomorrow.

166
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,465
In this case,
you and I are the main investigators.

167
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,834
If the Emperor issues an edict,

168
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,465
he will either summon for you or me.

169
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:16,345
The person who poisoned Shen Wenqi

170
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:18,065
was a court official.

171
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,913
He claimed he lost his family

172
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:23,033
in the West Canal disaster.

173
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,825
So he sought revenge.

174
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:28,033
But they overlooked one thing.

175
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,673
This poison is very expensive.

176
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:30,673
How could

177
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:32,144
a court official afford it?

178
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,114
The Emperor naturally doesn't allow

179
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,273
anyone to interfere

180
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:39,665
with the Censorate under his nose.

181
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,504
Official Zhou, you sure know

182
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:44,744
what the Emperor thoughts.

183
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:46,185
Thank you for the compliment.

184
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,904
I saw the construction plans

185
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,384
during the audience with the Emperor.

186
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:53,954
They are different

187
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,065
from the ones we verified before.

188
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,074
Someone managed

189
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,553
to order Earl Suning around

190
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:00,393
and switch the construction plans

191
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:01,984
under our noses.

192
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:04,305
This person is not simple.

193
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:05,585
Are you scared?

194
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:07,904
Me? Scared?

195
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,185
I find it very intriguing.

196
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:12,545
Now, I only want to know

197
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:16,144
what you have in mind.

198
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:17,434
First, find out

199
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:19,273
how the construction plans
were switched.

200
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:19,834
Second,

201
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,194
Earl Suning confessed

202
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:22,434
that he had monetary dealings

203
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,224
with the mastermind.

204
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,393
Monetary dealings?

205
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:28,553
The collapse of West Canal is not just

206
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:30,504
to frame Official Shen, right?

207
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:37,185
I'm willing to cooperate with you,
Official Lu.

208
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:40,545
I shall take my leave now.

209
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:46,224
Sir,

210
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:48,665
what's our next move?

211
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,194
Don't we

212
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:51,785
have a direction already?

213
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:56,785
It's because you didn't say anything.

214
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,264
Chuyi,

215
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,785
you must learn to use people
for your purposes.

216
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:02,984
But you still need

217
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:05,945
to walk the path yourself.

218
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:09,234
(Li Residence)
Miss, please hurry.

219
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,933
Official Lu instructed us to return
to Cheng Garden directly.

220
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:11,680
I won't be long.

221
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,305
Zhen.

222
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:14,185
Di?

223
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,314
Where have you been all this time?

224
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:19,984
Your sister is worried sick about you.

225
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:20,994
Where is she?

226
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:23,144
She went searching for you.
She's been doing that every day.

227
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:24,393
She told me she sent people

228
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:25,345
to search for you today.

229
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,345
I'm sorry for making her worry.

230
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:28,314
Di,

231
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,873
they're going to execute my father.

232
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:31,393
They say the construction plans
are flawed.

233
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:33,873
But I heard
you verified the plans personally.

234
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:34,873
Yes, I did

235
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,074
and they're indeed accurate.

236
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,314
But don't worry.

237
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:38,513
I'll go back

238
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:39,834
and compare the drafts left

239
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:40,633
by your father.

240
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:41,864
Drafts?

241
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:43,633
This isn't something
that can be drawn in one go.

242
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,945
The plans can only be finalized
after repeated revisions.

243
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,320
As long as the measurements
and estimates are clear...

244
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,553
Father, look.

245
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:50,314
Are these two?

246
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,024
Yes.

247
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:52,545
Put them aside.

248
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:54,425
Lu Si.

249
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,153
Since you're in a hurry to leave,

250
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:56,994
then

251
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:58,434
I'll hand over the West Canal's drafts

252
00:11:58,435 --> 00:11:59,705
to you.

253
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:01,753
When you get back,
take a look at the drafts

254
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,033
and study them carefully.

255
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:04,513
You can note down
any suggestions you have.

256
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,354
Then you can write to me about it.

257
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,465
Here, Uncle Lu.

258
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,074
Di, I have something urgent.

259
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:14,873
I have to leave now.

260
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:16,074
Tell my sister

261
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,185
that I'm coming tomorrow.

262
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:20,384
What's the rush?

263
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:34,474
I pretty much understood

264
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:35,594
my father-in-law's case now.

265
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,033
Thank you, Official Zhou.

266
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:39,234
I'll still need to count on you
for this case.

267
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:41,345
I hope we have good news

268
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:44,114
before the trial in autumn.

269
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:46,104
It's the responsibility
of the Imperial Censorate.

270
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,074
Official Li, you don't have to thank me.

271
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:50,153
I still need to thank you,
Official Zhou.

272
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:52,114
I heard it was your recommendation

273
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:53,393
that I was fortunate enough

274
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:55,354
to be promoted
to the Ministry of Water Resources.

275
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:57,264
I'm honored

276
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:58,994
to have your attention.

277
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,705
We come from a humble background.

278
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,354
So we should support each other

279
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:03,594
in this complicated world

280
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:05,194
of powerful families.

281
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:06,264
I understand.

282
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:07,994
Official Zhou,

283
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,994
should you ever need

284
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,305
my help in the future,

285
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:13,384
I shall help without hesitation.

286
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:15,345
Sir,

287
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:17,065
Mrs. Li is here.

288
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,024
Again?

289
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:22,065
Does she come here often?

290
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:25,185
Yes.

291
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:33,834
Dear?

292
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:36,065
Dear, why are you here?

293
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,354
I asked Official Zhou earlier

294
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:40,673
to find Zhen's whereabouts.

295
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,074
Since I haven't found Zhen yet,

296
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:43,624
I came to ask Official Zhou again.

297
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,314
You asked Official Zhou

298
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:47,434
to find Zhen's whereabouts?

299
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,425
Yes.

300
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:52,354
I happened to meet Mrs. Li
the other day.

301
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,984
So we talked for a bit.

302
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:57,954
Mrs. Li,

303
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:59,425
I'm truly sorry.

304
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,714
I still haven't found out anything

305
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,024
about your sister.

306
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:03,825
By the way,

307
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:07,104
your father's circumstances
had worsened too.

308
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:08,633
What happened to Father?

309
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,224
I've told Official Li.

310
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:11,785
Let him tell you.

311
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,793
Dear, don't worry.
We'll talk about this at home.

312
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,545
Let's not bother Official Zhou anymore.

313
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,793
Son, you're back.

314
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:35,504
Mother.

315
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:37,705
Mother.

316
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:40,474
Why do you always look

317
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:41,793
so sad every day?

318
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:44,000
Your husband has been promoted
to the Ministry of Water Resources.

319
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,474
Yet, you don't even know
this great news.

320
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:47,354
All you do is run around all day.

321
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:49,234
What kind of wife are you?

322
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:50,024
Mother,

323
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:52,234
father is in trouble.

324
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:53,114
Ran is distressed now.

325
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:54,354
Hold your tongue for a bit.

326
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:56,904
What happened to him again?

327
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:59,624
Son, will it implicate you?

328
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:01,945
No, don't worry.

329
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:03,913
I'm glad to hear that.

330
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,594
Go and get some rest.

331
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:07,393
Don't forget to invite your colleagues

332
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:09,314
to attend the banquet celebration.

333
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:10,434
All right, mother.

334
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:11,585
You can go now.

335
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,744
Ran,

336
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:24,864
I'm sorry.

337
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:26,033
My mother

338
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:28,264
raised me up by herself.

339
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:30,793
So all she thinks is me.

340
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:32,714
Her words may be unpleasant.

341
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:34,024
But don't overthink it.

342
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:36,904
Mother may only care about you.

343
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,194
But it doesn't mean

344
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:40,264
she should lack empathy.

345
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:41,825
I understand.

346
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:43,705
Ran, she...

347
00:15:44,674 --> 00:15:45,665
Dear,

348
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:47,945
I don't want to blame her.

349
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:50,705
I'm happy that you're promoted too.

350
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,545
But whenever I think

351
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:56,705
about my father going to be executed,

352
00:15:57,794 --> 00:16:00,234
I can't help but feel upset.

353
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:01,954
His execution is scheduled after autumn.

354
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:03,744
There's still a trial in autumn
before that.

355
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:05,114
Let's not give up.

356
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,665
I'm sure we'll find new evidence.

357
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:08,553
Besides, I told you

358
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:09,984
that Zhen is fine.

359
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:11,354
She came by today.

360
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:12,945
She said she'll come
and see you tomorrow.

361
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,185
How can you let her see you like this?

362
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,153
Thank you, dear.

363
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,624
This promotion is mainly

364
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,753
to let me rebuild the West Canal.

365
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,984
This task may seem glamorous.

366
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:32,984
But it's actually a tough job.

367
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,744
It's all good if it's done well.

368
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:37,104
If not,

369
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:40,224
the consequences are unimaginable.

370
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,624
That could lead to trouble.

371
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:45,913
Don't worry.

372
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,104
I'll do my best.

373
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,234
When the Emperor is pleased
at that time,

374
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:50,753
I'll plead to the Emperor.

375
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:51,714
Maybe His Majesty

376
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:52,474
might grant leniency

377
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:53,714
to Father's case

378
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,264
in return for my merits.

379
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,025
Official Lu!

380
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:07,194
Official Lu!

381
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:08,704
Where's Miss?

382
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:09,874
Is she not back yet?

383
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,065
No.

384
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:15,065
Could something have happened to her?

385
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:18,144
Yang Zong.

386
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:19,624
Wait here.

387
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,624
What's going on?

388
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:47,033
Xu Wei?

389
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:47,985
Hello, there.

390
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:49,985
We meet again.

391
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:51,904
Don't come near me.

392
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:03,025
Miss, you sure put me
into a lot of trouble.

393
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,785
Do you know whose carriage is this?

394
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,750
(Lu)

395
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,225
Lu Shiyan, so?

396
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,745
Do you think

397
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,985
I'm scared of him?

398
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:17,225
Don't come near me!

399
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:18,914
If Lu Shiyan knows

400
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,474
I haven't returned yet,

401
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,914
he'll surely come looking for me.

402
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:23,273
Let him come, then.

403
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:25,634
I'm afraid when Lu Shiyan comes,

404
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:29,225
we'll have had enough fun.

405
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,864
(Cry. Cry quickly!)

406
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,104
Don't tell me I've scared her wits?

407
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:50,424
(Lu Shiyan, you better
not have lied to me.)

408
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,714
Master,
there was a disturbance on Yong'an Lane.

409
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,384
The street was congested for two hours.

410
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:56,225
It happened when Miss Shen returned
to the residence.

411
00:18:58,354 --> 00:18:59,265
Master?

412
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:00,799
I think she's in trouble.

413
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,874
I'll call for reinforcement.

414
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,714
It'll be too late.

415
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:03,464
But...

416
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,384
We don't even know where she is.

417
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,720
Is there another way back
to Cheng Garden?

418
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,345
- There's a small road.
- Lead the way.

419
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:12,305
Miss, don't be scared.

420
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:13,273
Don't you understand

421
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,674
how I feel about you?

422
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:15,914
Last year, I went to your house

423
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,113
to seek your hand in marriage.

424
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,073
That was me seeking

425
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,033
a legitimate wife.

426
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,194
But unfortunately,

427
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,914
your ungrateful father

428
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:24,434
kicked me out.

429
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:25,265
You...

430
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:26,745
Did you plot

431
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,585
to frame my father?

432
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:31,994
At this point,

433
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:34,624
are you trying
to get information from me?

434
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,144
Just stop it already.

435
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:40,944
Get away from me!

436
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:45,464
Go away!

437
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:58,954
Lu Shiyan! If you're still not here,

438
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:00,985
I'll be done for!

439
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:38,904
Stop crying.

440
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:46,394
Lu Shiyan,

441
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,065
you ruined my plan!

442
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:49,874
If you're interested in her,

443
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,634
you could've just told me.

444
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,664
You don't have to keep opposing me.

445
00:20:56,074 --> 00:20:57,714
I wasn't opposing you.

446
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,874
But you repeatedly break the law!

447
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,745
Why you...

448
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:07,904
In this wilderness,

449
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,384
if you and your servant

450
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,305
were to die from something unfortunate,

451
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:15,753
it would only be an accident.

452
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,073
If you're wise,

453
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,553
leave her with me.

454
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,225
I can pretend

455
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,585
I never met you here.

456
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:28,624
It's all right.

457
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:34,184
You don't know what's good for you.

458
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,345
Get up quickly and attack him!

459
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:37,154
Stop crying already!

460
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,424
If you keep crying, we're going to die!

461
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:45,994
Wait!

462
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:46,634
Official Xu.

463
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:47,545
Stop!

464
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:52,464
Don't stop me later.

465
00:22:57,395 --> 00:23:00,104
Could it be you've come around?

466
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:01,785
Yes.

467
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,305
I've come around.

468
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:06,104
Official Xu,

469
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:08,505
all you want is me, right?

470
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:10,904
If this keeps happening,

471
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:12,704
what's the point?

472
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:14,384
Just not too long ago,

473
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:16,904
I was the daughter of a minister.

474
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,664
With my father around,

475
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:21,424
he could have kept me safe.

476
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,065
But my father is in prison now.

477
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:26,353
I have nowhere to go,

478
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:28,265
vilified by people,

479
00:23:28,435 --> 00:23:32,505
and repeatedly insulted by you.

480
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,954
How... how can that be called an insult?

481
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,825
Nonsense.

482
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:38,864
- Although this world is vast,
- Master...

483
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:40,704
it seems

484
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,345
that there's no place for me.

485
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:45,265
Since all of this started

486
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:47,545
because of me,

487
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:49,225
then

488
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:51,904
I'll end it today.

489
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,353
Miss Shen, don't do it!

490
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,065
No!

491
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:10,985
She's gone.

492
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:14,545
Xu Wei, do you admit your crime?

493
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,585
What crime?

494
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,353
She wanted to die.

495
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:19,434
Everyone saw that.

496
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:20,434
It's not my fault.

497
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:22,033
Rapist is punishable by hanging.

498
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:23,073
Attempted rape

499
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:25,600
that leads to someone's death
is punishable by decapitation!

500
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,714
Lu Shiyan,

501
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,474
as the almighty court official,
are you listening

502
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:29,674
to the nonsense you're spouting?

503
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:30,513
Did you see me doing

504
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:32,073
anything immoral with your own eyes?

505
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:35,073
This woman ran into bad people
in the mountains.

506
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,194
I only help out

507
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:37,033
when I see injustice.

508
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,674
But she couldn't bear the insult

509
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:39,624
and took her own life.

510
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,065
Let's go.

511
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:58,265
What is wrong with you?

512
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,704
I've figured out a way
to save my father.

513
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,184
Wuzhou.

514
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:12,545
Miss Shen!

515
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,350
(Lanyue Pavilion)

516
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:30,345
Qingxi, I'm thirsty.

517
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:05,073
Miss...

518
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:07,154
How could you die?

519
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:09,904
Me? Dead? That's not possible.

520
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:11,545
Qingxi!

521
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,265
Am I really dead?

522
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:37,785
He's real.

523
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:41,593
Lu Shiyan, you tricked me!

524
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:43,424
All right, take everything down!

525
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,474
Also, remove

526
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:48,864
that thing on the ground too.

527
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:52,704
You're unbelievable!

528
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:57,545
Miss,

529
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:59,033
it's your fault this time.

530
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,384
I'm not taking your side this time.

531
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:05,144
Come on, Qingxi.

532
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:10,194
I had my reasons.

533
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,593
What's your reason?

534
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:12,545
I...

535
00:27:16,074 --> 00:27:18,234
You mentioned Wuzhou in the woods.

536
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,025
Yes, Wuzhou.

537
00:27:20,074 --> 00:27:22,033
I stopped by the Li Residence
on the way home

538
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:23,384
and ran into Di.

539
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:24,353
He said

540
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:26,273
he was looking for Father's drafts.

541
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:27,634
So I suddenly remembered

542
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:29,033
that Father had given the plans

543
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:30,073
to Uncle Lu Si from Wuzhou

544
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:31,424
to check them.

545
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:32,745
I'm sure

546
00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:33,513
there's nothing wrong

547
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:35,065
with Father's construction plans.

548
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:39,864
The construction plans we submitted
were indeed tampered with.

549
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,194
Even such crucial evidence

550
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,864
was tampered with.

551
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,313
So

552
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:45,730
if we find Uncle Lu

553
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,154
and get hold
of those construction plans,

554
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:48,154
we might be able

555
00:27:48,155 --> 00:27:49,553
to clear my father's name.

556
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:50,464
Then

557
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:52,234
you put an act trying
to kill yourself today

558
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,234
only to get Xu Wei

559
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:54,500
off your back.

560
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,194
So that you could travel to Wuzhou
to find the plans?

561
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:56,760
That's right.

562
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,180
It's the first time I'm traveling
after staying at Cheng Garden for so long.

563
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,553
I even travel in your carriage.

564
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,144
But he still managed to find me.

565
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:02,914
So why don't

566
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,474
I make him give up altogether?

567
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,914
Aren't you afraid that both of you

568
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:07,505
might die together?

569
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:08,874
Well, I know

570
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:11,265
you're very confident.

571
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:15,664
Wait a minute.

572
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:17,714
I was knocked out.

573
00:28:17,715 --> 00:28:20,104
How could I have hit a tree?

574
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:22,464
No!

575
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:28,674
You pushed me.

576
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:29,634
The distance between you

577
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,394
and my blade was this close.

578
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:33,600
If I didn't push you,
am I supposed to let your neck get slit?

579
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,154
You didn't have to push so hard.

580
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,914
If someone's throat is slit,

581
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,513
they shouldn't fall so hard
to the ground.

582
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:39,273
They should

583
00:28:39,274 --> 00:28:41,434
fall softly to the ground.

584
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:42,513
Gosh, Miss.

585
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,785
Shen Zhen,

586
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:46,194
For me to be able
to figure out your plan in an instant

587
00:28:46,195 --> 00:28:47,113
means you're lucky.

588
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:48,634
The reason you're lying
in front of me alive

589
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:49,553
means you're blessed.

590
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,184
Stop demanding too much.

591
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:52,553
You're right.

592
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:55,184
I can't demand too much
from Official Lu.

593
00:28:57,915 --> 00:28:59,184
Thank you.

594
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:08,073
(Today, she went
to the Imperial Censorate in disguise.)

595
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:09,513
(Then, she went
to Madam Zhuang's house.)

596
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,184
(Later, she stopped by
at the Li Residence.)

597
00:29:11,754 --> 00:29:13,265
(Li Di.)

598
00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:16,753
Where is Lu Si staying in Wuzhou?

599
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,113
I don't know.

600
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:20,225
That's why I'm planning
to find out where he lives.

601
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,545
You stay put.

602
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:24,073
I'll send someone to Wuzhou

603
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:25,273
to find out Lu Si's whereabouts.

604
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:26,353
Thank you, Official Lu.

605
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:27,384
That's great.

606
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:29,753
What's the matter?

607
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:30,833
My face hurts.

608
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:31,954
Your face hurts?

609
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:33,434
When I was in the carriage,

610
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:35,273
I wanted to cry to alert you.

611
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,434
But I couldn't cry
without slapping myself.

612
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:38,954
You're pretty harsh

613
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:40,265
on yourself and others.

614
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:41,753
I know.

615
00:29:41,754 --> 00:29:42,874
I'm sorry.

616
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,994
I should have prepared

617
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:45,184
some mustard greens.

618
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:49,144
Qingxi, prepare more in the future.

619
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:50,944
I have one here.

620
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:56,904
Why did he leave?

621
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,110
(Wenxiang Bordello)

622
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:02,664
Shen Zhen is dead?

623
00:30:03,314 --> 00:30:05,025
I never thought

624
00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:07,704
she would be so strong-willed.

625
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:11,154
It's her fortune
to have caught your eyes, Official Xu.

626
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,745
She really doesn't know
what's good for her.

627
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:14,994
That's enough.

628
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:16,505
Stop mentioning her.

629
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:19,664
I haven't congratulated you
on your promotion, Official Li.

630
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:26,305
Thank you for promoting me, Official Xu.

631
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:34,624
By the way,

632
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:36,273
you must repair

633
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:38,184
the West Canal properly for me.

634
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:40,225
If it is not repaired well,

635
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:42,394
the path I have paved for you

636
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,073
will be all for nothing.

637
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:46,073
I will do my best

638
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:47,864
not to let you down.

639
00:30:50,155 --> 00:30:52,944
But there's one thing...

640
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:54,985
Speak.

641
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:56,753
Have you thought

642
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,753
about Shen Zhen's aftermath?

643
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:00,113
After all, Official Lu

644
00:31:00,114 --> 00:31:02,305
is a relentless person.

645
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:05,225
What are your suggestions?

646
00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:05,994
Recently,

647
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:08,745
many women have gone missing,
haven't they?

648
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:18,585
Official Li,

649
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,553
you truly know

650
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:24,025
what's on my mind.

651
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:36,553
Continuously missing?

652
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:37,634
Exactly.

653
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:39,994
I was reprimanded by the Emperor again.

654
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:40,513
That's why

655
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:42,904
I could only involve you in this.

656
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,113
I've been busy with
some important matters recently.

657
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:45,753
I'm afraid...

658
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,714
This matter
is also particularly important.

659
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:49,073
Miss Wang, Miss Wen, and Miss Fang

660
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,674
have all disappeared
one after another.

661
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,234
Just last night,

662
00:31:51,235 --> 00:31:52,714
Miss Chen was attacked

663
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:53,674
by a bad person

664
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,033
on her way home.

665
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:56,234
After resisting fiercely,

666
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:57,585
she luckily escaped.

667
00:31:57,675 --> 00:31:58,353
Also,

668
00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:00,154
Official Shen's youngest daughter,
Shen Zhen,

669
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:01,474
went missing last night.

670
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:04,154
Shen Zhen? Who reported it?

671
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,313
Two villagers claimed

672
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,785
to have witnessed it.

673
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,194
What clues do we have now?

674
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,434
Only Miss Chen, who escaped by chance,

675
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:12,664
has seen the suspect.

676
00:32:12,715 --> 00:32:13,664
Yang Zong,

677
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,634
please send the painter
to the Chen family's residence

678
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:17,273
and sketch a portrait of the suspect

679
00:32:17,274 --> 00:32:19,144
based on Miss Chen's memory.

680
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:20,065
Yes, sir.

681
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,864
I was raped and abducted?

682
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:27,593
Didn't you want to make it believable?

683
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:29,424
Xu Wei even lent a hand
to make it credible.

684
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:32,664
Jeez.

685
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,634
Can you use your brain

686
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,345
before making any decisions
in the future?

687
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:38,194
You're a young lady.

688
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:39,793
How can you face others in the future?

689
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:41,154
I'm already dead anyway.

690
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:42,144
I don't care.

691
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:44,664
As long as I can save my father.

692
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:46,265
Oh,

693
00:32:46,635 --> 00:32:48,073
my sister must be worried

694
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:49,664
when she finds out I've gone missing.

695
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:51,073
Can you arrange a meeting

696
00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:52,553
for me and my sister?

697
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,674
You went to great lengths

698
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:55,154
to make Xu Wei think you were dead.

699
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:56,313
If he finds out you're alive,

700
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:58,265
won't your efforts be in vain?

701
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:02,585
When this case is solved,

702
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,714
I will find a way

703
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:04,985
for you to meet.

704
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:07,394
Master,
the news from Wuzhou has arrived.

705
00:33:07,395 --> 00:33:09,664
Lu Si's house has been raided.

706
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,225
Raided?

707
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:13,265
How could that happen?

708
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:14,634
We should hurry.

709
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:15,505
Stop right there.

710
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:16,474
I have to solve

711
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:17,904
your missing case first.

712
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:19,634
Yang Zong, go and investigate again.

713
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:20,424
Yes, sir.

714
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:26,234
I have stationed

715
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:27,944
our men in Wuzhou.

716
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:29,154
When they've found Lu Si,

717
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:30,624
they'll keep him safe.

718
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,434
You should go and get some rest.

719
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:34,545
I'll let you know when I have news.

720
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:42,464
What is it?

721
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:43,474
Our spy reported

722
00:33:43,475 --> 00:33:45,745
that Xu Wei went

723
00:33:45,754 --> 00:33:47,225
to Wenxiang Bordello last night.

724
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:48,745
Li Di was there too.

725
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:52,674
Congratulations.

726
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:53,714
Thank you very much.

727
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:54,753
Congratulations, Li.

728
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:55,904
Thank you.

729
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,265
Congratulations, dear.

730
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:04,704
Take a seat, everyone.

731
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:05,545
Please be seated.

732
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:07,345
Sun,

733
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:08,794
we should address Li

734
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,033
by his position now.

735
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:10,713
Please don't.

736
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:12,464
- He's right.
- We should.

737
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,073
Congratulations, Director Li.

738
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:15,625
Thank you for the kind praises.

739
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,553
I'm deeply grateful
for the Emperor's favor

740
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,874
and sincerely apprehensive about this.

741
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,553
Only by serving faithfully

742
00:34:22,554 --> 00:34:25,825
can I repay the favor.

743
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,424
Director Li,

744
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,593
you're really too modest.

745
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:31,354
Everyone knows

746
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,345
Li's abilities are extraordinary.

747
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,954
In my opinion,

748
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:36,713
the position
of Minister of Water Resources

749
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,584
should have been yours long ago.

750
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:39,713
That's right.

751
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:40,834
If you ask me,

752
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:42,874
the position
of Minister of Water Resources

753
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,904
will definitely belong to Li.

754
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:47,305
Hush, Sun.

755
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:48,864
Come.

756
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:49,954
Let's drink.

757
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:50,474
Come.

758
00:34:50,475 --> 00:34:51,713
- All right.
- Let's drink.

759
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,914
- Let's drink.
- Enjoy the alcohol.

760
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:53,625
Please drink.

761
00:34:54,114 --> 00:34:54,984
Here.

762
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:58,745
Mrs. Li,

763
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:00,665
please don't worry too much.

764
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:01,874
Official Shen

765
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,625
has helped us a lot in the past.

766
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:05,713
His abilities

767
00:35:05,714 --> 00:35:07,954
are evident to all of us.

768
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:08,914
I believe

769
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:11,544
there will be a turning point
in this matter.

770
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:13,064
Thank you, Official Liu.

771
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:16,954
I just feel sorry for Miss Shen Zhen.

772
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:18,713
I mean, what kind of beastly human

773
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:20,754
would harm a woman in such a manner?

774
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:21,754
What did you say?

775
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,064
What beastly human?

776
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:27,904
You knew?

777
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:29,904
Tell me what happened to Zhen.

778
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:32,424
Say something!

779
00:35:32,594 --> 00:35:36,665
Recently, there have been missing cases.

780
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,794
Today, someone reported

781
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:41,825
that Zhen was also abducted.

782
00:35:43,114 --> 00:35:44,384
Why...

783
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:49,024
Ran,

784
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,345
I don't want you to be sad.

785
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:52,553
- Madam.
- Ran.

786
00:35:52,554 --> 00:35:53,584
I was...

787
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:55,185
Ran.

788
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,145
Ran!

789
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,265
Take care of Madam.

790
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:07,785
It has already come to this point.

791
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,553
Let my wife go back and rest.

792
00:36:09,554 --> 00:36:10,633
Let's continue drinking.

793
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:11,593
Let's keep drinking.

794
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:12,384
All right.

795
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:42,705
Ran.

796
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,544
As my wife,

797
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:47,754
you made me lose face

798
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:50,305
in front of them.

799
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,944
Why didn't you tell me?

800
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:02,185
If I told you,
what difference would it make?

801
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:06,394
You would be even sadder.

802
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:08,384
That's not what you're worried about.

803
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:10,874
You're afraid I won't attend

804
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,665
your promotion banquet.

805
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:18,354
There has been no news

806
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:20,233
on the missing people in the past month.

807
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:21,474
Not even one.

808
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:22,513
Do you think

809
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:24,625
Zhen can come back alive?

810
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:29,225
Zhen is only missing.

811
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:31,633
You say she's dead/

812
00:37:31,634 --> 00:37:33,553
Then where is her body?

813
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:34,754
Which office is investigating?

814
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:35,713
Is there any clue?

815
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,153
Have you asked?

816
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,113
Not only did you not ask,

817
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:39,713
but you also hid it from me.

818
00:37:39,714 --> 00:37:41,553
What's your intention in doing this?

819
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:43,665
My intention?

820
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,513
First, Father got into trouble.

821
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,145
Now, it's Zhen.

822
00:37:47,154 --> 00:37:48,914
I've already done

823
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:49,754
everything I can do.

824
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:51,665
What else do you want from me?

825
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:53,225
I know

826
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:54,274
your father

827
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:56,345
has been supporting me in my career.

828
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:58,914
If I didn't marry you,

829
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:01,354
I would be nothing.

830
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:03,305
I admit I've been relying
on your family.

831
00:38:04,154 --> 00:38:05,394
But have any one of you seen

832
00:38:05,395 --> 00:38:05,914
how

833
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:07,113
I managed to come all this way?

834
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,625
Who has seen the sacrifices I have made?

835
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:14,553
Are you saying my family

836
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:16,305
has made you suffer?

837
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,464
Ran, that's not what I mean.

838
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,193
I just hope

839
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:26,874
that today,

840
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,105
you could at least be happy

841
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:31,673
at my promotion banquet.

842
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:33,354
I only hope

843
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,233
you are truly happy for me.

844
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,073
But you're...

845
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:37,864
What did you do?

846
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,225
Li Di,

847
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:42,864
they're my family.

848
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:45,625
What about me?

849
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,944
What do you take me for?

850
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:00,105
Yes,

851
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:05,665
I've let you down.

852
00:39:51,674 --> 00:39:53,145
- Master?
- Who's at the door?

853
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,584
Madam, Master is here.

854
00:39:57,435 --> 00:40:00,225
Dear, what are you doing here?

855
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:02,345
I was thinking about you.

856
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,584
Why did you drink so much?

857
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:06,745
Just spend the night here
and don't leave.

858
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:08,113
Go

859
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,553
and get Master some hot tea.

860
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:10,345
Yes, Madam.

861
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,785
Be careful.

862
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:22,345
One and a half years ago,

863
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:24,265
a woman moved into the courtyard.

864
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,633
Occasionally, a man would go

865
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:26,705
and visit her.

866
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:28,474
Although the neighbors

867
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:29,593
couldn't see the man clearly,

868
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,464
the carriage was always the same one,

869
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:33,064
which belonged to Director Li.

870
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:37,033
Anything else?

871
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,033
Apart from Li Di going
to the Wenxiang Bordello once

872
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:40,513
and to the courtyard last night,

873
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:42,145
everything else is normal.

874
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,354
Wenxiang Bordello?

875
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:44,064
Yes.

876
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,265
He came out right after Xu Wei.

877
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:48,785
Continue keeping an eye on him.

878
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:50,064
Yes, sir.

879
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,250
(Magistrate Office)

880
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:01,434
Mrs. Li.

881
00:41:01,435 --> 00:41:02,584
Sir,

882
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:04,904
I heard something happened
to my younger sister, Shen Zhen.

883
00:41:07,194 --> 00:41:08,233
But there's no need to worry.

884
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,633
Currently, it's just reported
as missing.

885
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,394
Moreover,

886
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:12,434
the villagers only said
that the person looked like her.

887
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:13,904
Perhaps they were mistaken.

888
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:15,673
Is there any news now?

889
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,754
This case has been handed over
to our office.

890
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:18,954
If there are any clues,

891
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:21,024
I will send someone to inform you.

892
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,504
Thank you, sir.

893
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,073
Sir.

894
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:28,064
Official Yang,

895
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:29,633
the Imperial Censor wants to

896
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:30,994
interrogate Earl Suning and his wife.

897
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:32,625
I was ordered to take them.

898
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:35,233
Didn't Official Zhou
only interrogate them several days ago?

899
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:36,233
Why interrogating again?

900
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:37,434
I dare not comment

901
00:41:37,435 --> 00:41:39,064
on my superior's thoughts.

902
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:41,233
If you have doubts,

903
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:42,864
you can ask him yourself.

904
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:44,825
I dare not.

905
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:47,705
Sirs,

906
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:48,994
can I visit

907
00:41:48,995 --> 00:41:50,193
my uncle and aunt?

908
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:51,145
Sure.

909
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:55,105
I wonder if it's convenient.

910
00:41:57,034 --> 00:41:58,345
Please follow me.

911
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,145
Aunt.

912
00:42:17,194 --> 00:42:18,504
Ran?

913
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,265
I'm sorry for what I've done
to you and your sister.

914
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,024
Aunt,

915
00:42:31,194 --> 00:42:33,305
Zhen and I lost our mother
at a young age.

916
00:42:34,355 --> 00:42:35,633
You've raised us

917
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:37,305
like a mother.

918
00:42:38,315 --> 00:42:40,185
Even if you've made countless mistakes,

919
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:43,785
as a child, I can't blame you.

920
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:45,504
Ran!

921
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:47,553
I truly regret it, Ran.

922
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:48,754
I was deceived

923
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:50,314
by Earl Suning.

924
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:52,274
I feared that his family
would be implicated.

925
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:55,073
I also fear that my son's career
would be ruined.

926
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:55,553
Ran...

927
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:57,665
Is that why you tried to
give Zhen to Xu Wei?

928
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:01,785
I only wanted Zhen

929
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:04,145
to have someone to protect her.

930
00:43:04,674 --> 00:43:06,354
I didn't expect Xu Wei

931
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:07,633
to be a beast.

932
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:10,225
I didn't expect it, Ran.

933
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:13,464
In fact, Earl Suning
has always been honest.

934
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,193
Although he is obsessed with money,

935
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:16,464
he is timid

936
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:18,274
and does business steadily.

937
00:43:18,275 --> 00:43:20,584
How could he get acquainted
with such a beast?

938
00:43:21,194 --> 00:43:24,665
The person who introduced Xu Wei
to Earn Suning

939
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,345
was Li Di.

940
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:30,665
My husband?

941
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,424
He is a person who only knows
how to draw plans every day.

942
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:42,153
How could he know Xu Wei?

943
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:43,984
Then I don't know about that.

944
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:45,073
But Ran,

945
00:43:45,074 --> 00:43:47,904
these people
are probably birds of a feather.

946
00:43:47,955 --> 00:43:50,145
You need to be more vigilant.

947
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,105
So you won't end up like me.

948
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:54,424
Ran.

949
00:43:54,955 --> 00:43:56,145
Ran.

950
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:02,785
Uncle,

951
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:06,064
that's all I can do for you now.

952
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,185
Please enjoy your meal.

953
00:44:25,074 --> 00:44:26,145
It's poisoned.

954
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:35,105
Sir,

955
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:37,345
would you believe me

956
00:44:37,835 --> 00:44:39,105
if I said I poisoned you?

957
00:44:44,755 --> 00:44:46,233
If he hadn't done such a cruel thing

958
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:48,305
to me and my sister,

959
00:44:49,114 --> 00:44:51,064
why would he panic?

960
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:53,265
If you didn't do anything wrong,

961
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,265
you have nothing to fear.
