Listen, it's not too late

21
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,469
to stop now.

22
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,499
I'll stop

23
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,669
when you confess
and accept your punishment.

24
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,549
Do you really think

25
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,260
you can leave Wuzhou?

26
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:28,909
Get the weapons.

27
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,739
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,299
Thank you for your help, Miss Man.

29
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:35,540
No need to thank me.

30
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,220
I was doing myself a favor too.

31
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,980
Do you have anywhere else to go?

32
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,500
I want to search for someone.

33
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:43,469
In that case,

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,388
I hope you have a smooth journey

35
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,699
and get what you want.

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,820
I also wish you a safe journey.

37
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,820
Take care.

38
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,629
Don't worry, Miss Shen.

39
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,189
Master

40
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,619
will surely return safely.

41
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,419
Yes, he will.

42
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,820
I believe in him.

43
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,260
Hurry up!

44
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,299
Row faster!

45
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,459
Hurry!

46
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,780
Don't get him out of your sight,
and don't lose him!

47
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,828
They're catching up!

48
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:08,859
Row faster!

49
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:21,859
Go!

50
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,299
Useless!

51
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,508
Take the criminals with you first.

52
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,189
But...

53
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,068
I said go!

54
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:01,900
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:03,708
Let's go.

56
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,580
After them!

57
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,789
Wei Xian.

58
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,349
Step aside

59
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,549
if you're wise.

60
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,989
I can spare

61
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,109
your concubine's life.

62
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,148
It depends on

63
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:14,828
whether you have the ability

64
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:16,939
to get past me today.

65
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,340
(Even if you come later,)

66
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,299
(I'll wait for you.)

67
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,508
(If you make me suffer)

68
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,179
(or unhappy,)

69
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,580
(I'll cry.)

70
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,749
(Didn't I follow you here
as your concubine)

71
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,388
(to put up an act?)

72
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,708
(But when you need me,)

73
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,580
(why won't you let me go?)

74
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:16,948
(Are you afraid I'll drag you down?)

75
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,980
(I've tried my best.)

76
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,908
(If you abandon me,)

77
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,299
(who will be your Qing?)

78
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,499
(Shen Zhen,)

79
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,379
(I hope you can leave safely.)

80
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,900
Yang Zong,

81
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:47,140
go and meet up with Official Lu.

82
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:49,869
But Master ordered me
to escort you out of the city.

83
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,148
We're already out of the city.

84
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,468
Later, I'll find a place to hide.

85
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:53,660
I'll be fine.

86
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,468
He's still not here after so long.

87
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:57,220
Something must have delayed him.

88
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:58,859
But...

89
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,499
Go now.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,388
But Master specifically instructed me

91
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,148
that if he hasn't returned
after the appointed time,

92
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:06,300
my priority should be to protect

93
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:07,700
you and the evidence back
to the capital.

94
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:10,148
They're here!

95
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:11,059
They're here!

96
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,179
Official Yang.

97
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,549
Where's Official Lu?

98
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,789
Where's Master?

99
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,908
He's delaying the bad guys

100
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:21,549
and ordered us

101
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,259
to bring the criminals here first.

102
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,789
I want you guys

103
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,828
to find a safe place

104
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:26,549
to detain these two.

105
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,989
Yes, sir.

106
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,588
Go quickly.

107
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,028
Let's go.

108
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,028
Where could Official Lu be?

109
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:30,220
I want to go and find him.

110
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,229
-Miss!
-The rest shall go and search for Master!

111
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,268
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

112
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,739
Miss, wait up!

113
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,019
Watch out!

114
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:50,820
Pang Hu?

115
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,060
Die!

116
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,349
If anyone resists,
kill them on the spot!

117
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,420
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

118
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,700
Stop right there!

119
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,989
Official Yang, are you all right?

120
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,829
Don't move!

121
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,989
- Stay down!
- Behave yourself!

122
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,709
I'm fine.

123
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,268
Thank you.

124
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,539
Tie them up!

125
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,589
Get up!

126
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,060
Miss Shen?

127
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:37,399
I'll leave this to you, General Meng.
I need to search for Master.

128
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,859
All right.

129
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,859
(Seven thousand candles,
lit for only one person.)

130
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,779
(With yearning deep down,
no medicine can heal it.)

131
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,220
Shen Zhen?

132
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:43,619
Shen Zhen.

133
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:45,820
What are you doing?

134
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,019
Why are you crying again?

135
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,700
Why doesn't it hurt?

136
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:57,908
Don't worry.

137
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,619
I won't die.

138
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:03,739
Don't cry.

139
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,619
Shen Zhen!

140
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,940
Shen Zhen!

141
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,739
(You want me to die?)

142
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,460
(Not that easy.)

143
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:47,580
Lu Shiyan! Lu Shiyan! Lu Shiyan!

144
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,180
Lu Shiyan!

145
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,300
Lu Shiyan!

146
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,379
Lu Shiyan!

147
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,019
Lu Shiyan!

148
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:20,739
Lu Shiyan!

149
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,220
Lu Shiyan, open your eyes.

150
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,539
Lu Shiyan.

151
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,980
Lu Shiyan, wake up.

152
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:32,379
Lu Shiyan.

153
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,980
Lu Shiyan.

154
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,700
Lu Shiyan. Lu Shiyan.

155
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,019
I'm sorry. I broke the jade.

156
00:12:58,509 --> 00:12:59,980
It's okay.

157
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:03,340
As long as you're safe.

158
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,060
Don't cry.

159
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,779
My heart will break.

160
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,940
All right, I won't cry.

161
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:22,700
Or your heart will break.

162
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,980
Yang Zong! Yang Zong!

163
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,619
Lu Shiyan, hang in there.

164
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,820
Palace maid, Lan?

165
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,428
When the door was opened,

166
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:49,139
the two sat upright and alert.

167
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,548
But when the door was closed,

168
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,668
they communicated with notes.

169
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,539
They were wary
about others eavesdropping on them.

170
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,400
Their relationship
is definitely not simple.

171
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,859
Besides, Li Di is an official
from the Ministry of Water Resources.

172
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,899
He currently has no accomplishments.

173
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,268
Yet, the palace granted him a concubine.

174
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:05,788
In the past, palace maids
were only released to be married

175
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:07,300
at the year's end.

176
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,499
But it's only the middle
of the year now.

177
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,779
This matter is indeed suspicious.

178
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,428
Moreover, the Li Residence now
has you as the main wife

179
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,659
and a pregnant concubine.

180
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:21,100
This is not an ideal marriage

181
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,859
for a female official.

182
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:25,739
Chuyi.

183
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,060
Yes, sir.

184
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,300
Go and investigate

185
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,300
everything

186
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:32,709
about her past.

187
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,460
Yes, sir.

188
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,420
Have you received the things I sent?

189
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,139
Thank you, Official Zhou.

190
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:42,700
I'll think about it.

191
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:43,548
But Lan

192
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,799
is an important clue.

193
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,548
Give the divorce letter to me
after you signed it.

194
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:47,739
Official Zhou,

195
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,709
my father's case

196
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,340
cannot be delayed any longer.

197
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,069
They framed my father

198
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,829
to cover up

199
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,499
their atrocious crimes.

200
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,940
The Imperial Censorate is investigating.

201
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,420
But will they give up easily?

202
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,340
With each passing day,

203
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,499
my father faces more danger.

204
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:04,989
Now, so long

205
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,619
there's any clue,

206
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,779
I won't give up.

207
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:10,340
I understand.

208
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:17,629
This is

209
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,580
Li Di and Madam He's
marriage certificate.

210
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,739
There's also Li Di's uncle's
handwritten testimony.

211
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,589
They never divorced.

212
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,100
That means Madam He was still his wife

213
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,060
when Li Di married you.

214
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:32,668
If we can prove

215
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,589
that Li Di committed bigamy,

216
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,019
not only will he be punished severely,

217
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:37,820
but he'll also lose his position.

218
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,349
If the mastermind behind this

219
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,100
wants to continue using Li Di,

220
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,300
he will definitely protect him.

221
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,100
(The Li Residence)

222
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,180
(Divorce?)

223
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,899
Never! Are you mad?

224
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,139
To be precise,

225
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:57,859
it's not a divorce.

226
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:00,139
But you committed bigamy.

227
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,788
According to our laws,

228
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:03,148
I'm not your wife.

229
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,308
What... What do you mean by bigamy?

230
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:05,709
Ran,

231
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,069
are you still upset about
my previous marriage

232
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,820
to Madam He in the countryside?

233
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:12,028
Ran,

234
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:12,469
I...

235
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,028
I admit it's my fault
for not telling you about the marriage.

236
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:16,308
But I've explained to you

237
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,308
many times.

238
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,589
Before I met you,

239
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,428
I had already

240
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,859
divorced her.

241
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,379
If you divorced her,

242
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,619
why did you impregnate her?

243
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:27,788
Also,

244
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,779
there's no divorce document
from the government office.

245
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:31,739
Li Di,

246
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:34,308
I can't believe you've been lying to me
for so long.

247
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,379
It's impossible.

248
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,709
There must be a mistake.

249
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,668
Ran, I'll go and ask now.

250
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,180
-After I look into this...
-Li Di,

251
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,940
are you planning to forge evidence?

252
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:43,629
I...

253
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,428
Your marriage certificate with Madam He

254
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,469
and your relatives' testimonies
from the countryside

255
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,700
are already with the Imperial Censorate.

256
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,980
According to the law,

257
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,949
if you commit bigamy,

258
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,739
you'll receive forty-nine lashes

259
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,268
and be demoted from your position
to a commoner.

260
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,308
I believe Official Zhou

261
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,060
will enforce the law impartially.

262
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,869
Ran,

263
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,268
there must be a misunderstanding.

264
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,148
You must believe me.

265
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,860
You have to believe me.

266
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:14,388
Ran,

267
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:15,549
think of the times

268
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,180
when we first got together.

269
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,029
The year I married you,

270
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,188
I don't know how many people

271
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,269
in the capital

272
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,940
were laughing at me.

273
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,900
They laughed at a commoner

274
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:26,908
who fantasized about marrying

275
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,668
the daughter of the wealthy Shen family.

276
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,860
At that moment, I secretly vowed.

277
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,069
I vowed

278
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,988
to elevate my status

279
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:35,789
and make everyone envy you,

280
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,019
to make them think you didn't marry
the wrong person.

281
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,220
Have you forgotten all of these?

282
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,299
The one who forgot everything is you.

283
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,600
(Marriage Alliance Agreement)

284
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,980
Sir, Official Li is here.

285
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,148
Official Zhou, why

286
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:13,900
did you summon me here today?

287
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:18,460
Someone reported you committed bigamy.

288
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,980
Official Li, how do you explain?

289
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:23,549
Who reported it?

290
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,059
I cannot disclose that.

291
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,660
This is the Imperial Censorate's policy.

292
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,869
We never reveal the name

293
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,499
of the informant to outsiders.

294
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,299
You just need to answer me.

295
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,668
Is this true?

296
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,099
Absolutely not.

297
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,388
Madam He and I may have married.

298
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,589
But we have long been divorced.

299
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,869
The accusation of committing bigamy

300
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,309
is absurd.

301
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,779
The marriage certificate exists.

302
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,180
But there's no record of your divorce
with the government office.

303
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,509
Madam He now lives

304
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,829
with you

305
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,509
and is pregnant.

306
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,620
Since you claim to be divorced,

307
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,940
how do you explain

308
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,349
the current situation?

309
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,589
Whether the divorce document
is not on record or not found yet,

310
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,869
I believe you

311
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,259
cannot make such a judgment yourself.

312
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,309
As for Madam He,

313
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,180
that's my family matter.

314
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,069
Official Zhou, you hold a high position.

315
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,069
You don't have to trouble yourself
with my domestic affairs.

316
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,420
Domestic affair?

317
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,700
Are you telling me
this is a domestic affair?

318
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:23,380
A mix-up between a wife and a concubine,
and a bigamous marriage.

319
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,069
This

320
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,180
is a serious violation of the law.

321
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,739
The Imperial Censorate's duty
is to supervise all officials.

322
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:33,059
If the evidence is solid,

323
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,620
we'll not hesitate to act.

324
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:37,509
Official Li,

325
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,748
if you cannot produce evidence

326
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:41,140
to prove your innocence now,

327
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,660
I will report this matter to the Emperor

328
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,099
for a thorough investigation.

329
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,099
Why are you so flustered?

330
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,109
Zhou Shu'an wants to convict me
for committing bigamy.

331
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,708
So someone caught your weakness?

332
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,388
When Ran and I got married,

333
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,789
I indeed had not divorced Madam He.

334
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,789
But later, I deceived her into
signing a divorce document.

335
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,629
I suspect Zhou Shu'an,

336
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,589
that scoundrel discovered it

337
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,789
and tampered with my records,

338
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,900
withdrawing my divorce document.

339
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:19,908
You desire to accomplish great things.

340
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,188
Yet, you can't even handle

341
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:22,620
your trivial matters.

342
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:24,228
Can you ask the noble person

343
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:25,309
to help me with this?

344
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,668
What kind of person do you think he is

345
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:28,349
to help you deal
with these dirty matters?

346
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,188
If I were to be demoted,

347
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,860
who's going to help you raise
the five thousand taels?

348
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:41,668
The noble person won't intervene
in this matter.

349
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,579
I'll go and plead with Master for you

350
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,660
to see if he has any solutions.

351
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,220
What other solution could there be?

352
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,509
The divorce document is missing.

353
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,059
It's not a big deal.

354
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,380
Maybe there was a mistake
at the government office.

355
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,069
As for Madam He,

356
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,660
she can't stay any longer.

357
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:00,188
Every word she says

358
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:02,339
is enough to put you in danger.

359
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,708
But she's pregnant...

360
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,109
You come from a humble background.

361
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,069
It's not easy for you to accomplish
what you have today.

362
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,819
Don't ruin everything
over a small matter.

363
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,589
Besides, you still have a mission.

364
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,789
The noble person

365
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,900
is not satisfied.

366
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,460
Thank you, Miss Lan.

367
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,920
(Longfu Inn)

368
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,629
Mister,

369
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,829
how is he? How are his injuries?

370
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,708
It's fortunate.

371
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,549
If the arrow had gone
half an inch deeper,

372
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,579
even a deity wouldn't be able
to save him.

373
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,829
What about the other injuries?

374
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,660
I see he has lost a lot of blood.

375
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,069
They are just flesh wounds.

376
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,428
But his injuries were exposed to water.

377
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:52,309
Just in case,

378
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,869
he should not be left alone these days.

379
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,948
Check for fever

380
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:56,589
every hour.

381
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,708
If he has a fever,

382
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,589
use warm water to wipe his body.

383
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,739
Don't forget.

384
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,299
Thank you, mister.

385
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,940
I'll take care of him.

386
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:11,188
You're also injured.

387
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:12,188
You should get some rest.

388
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,380
I'll take care of him.

389
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,349
Qingxi, boil some water.

390
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,259
Yes, Miss.

391
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,339
Thank you, Miss Shen.

392
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,420
Thank you, mister. I'll send you.

393
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,589
Don't worry. It's all right now.

394
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,779
We've left Wuzhou.

395
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:16,900
Lu Shiyan, you're awake?

396
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:25,700
(Zhen,)

397
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:28,539
(what's going on?)

398
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,499
(Is this a dream or...)

399
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:44,700
(Passing clouds dissipating in the air,
the past turns to dust.)

400
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,660
(The future is unpredictable.)

401
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,900
Please take care of yourself.

402
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,579
(Don't seek for me, don't meet me,
don't miss me.)

403
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:00,579
Don't go.

404
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,539
What's the matter?

405
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,829
Lu Shiyan.

406
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,579
Don't go.

407
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,940
I'm not dead.

408
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,660
What's wrong?

409
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,980
Lu Shiyan.

410
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,660
You're awake.

Why does your temperature
keep on rising?

420
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,069
The physician said

421
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,309
if you start getting a fever,

422
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,579
we need to wipe your body
with warm water.

423
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:26,980
Yang Zong should be here.

424
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,220
I don't feel good.

425
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:32,380
Forget it.

426
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:41,460
Official Lu,

427
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,509
the physician instructed this.

428
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,460
It's not that I want to see it
on purpose.

429
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,019
You heard that too, right?

430
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,259
When I had a fever as a child,

431
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,460
my sister also took care
of me like this.

432
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,299
Oh, I'm sorry.

433
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:14,460
I must not sleep. Stay awake.

434
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:07,420
Don't worry. Don't worry.

435
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:11,180
Lu Shiyan, are you awake?

436
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:14,579
I will bring back the construction plans

437
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,059
for you.

438
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,420
The construction plans are with me.

439
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,019
Don't worry anymore.

440
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,339
Don't go. Don't go.

441
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,339
I won't go.

442
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:44,499
I'll stay by your side.

443
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,980
I...

444
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,420
I... There were some dregs
at the corner of your mouth.

445
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:37,860
I wanted to help you wipe it off.

446
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,148
Did I reopen the wounds?

447
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:53,099
Let me see.

448
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,869
Fortunately, there is no bleeding.

449
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,059
Let me wipe it for you.

450
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,349
You're seriously injured.

451
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,779
So you can't move around.

452
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,700
Why are you looking at me?

453
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:18,940
I... I'll go and decoct
some medicine for you.

454
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,420
Here.

455
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,140
I... I...

456
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,620
I have no ulterior motive.

457
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,739
I just want to see
if your fever has subsided.

458
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:05,668
Then you had no ulterior motive

459
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:07,259
when your face

460
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,420
was so close to mine?

461
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,660
That's great.

462
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,220
Your fever is gone.

463
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:23,349
Have I had a fever all along?

464
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,339
Yes,

465
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,700
you've had a fever for three days.

466
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:32,140
So you've been taking care of me
all this time?

467
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:35,059
It's good that you're fine now.

468
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,819
Take your medicine.

469
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,180
What happened?

470
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,259
It's just a scratch.

471
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,819
I've already applied medicine.

472
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:01,869
I told you to wait for me.

473
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,579
Why didn't you listen?

474
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,748
Don't do anything dangerous

475
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:07,109
like this again.

476
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,460
First,

477
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,708
take care of your own safety.

478
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,388
Knowing you were in danger,

479
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,180
how could I ignore it?

480
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:16,420
Your safety is also important.

481
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,579
(I think I kissed her.)

482
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,660
(Was it a dream)

483
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:40,900
(or reality?)

484
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:43,779
I want to ask you something.

485
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:45,948
Did anything happen

486
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:48,509
while I was unconscious?

487
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,700
Accident?

488
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,779
(Is he asking about him kissing me?)

489
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:54,948
Accident?

490
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:56,499
What accident?

491
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,819
(She seems to be reacting normally.)

492
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:03,579
(Could it really
have been just a dream?)

493
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,940
It's nothing.

494
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,349
I'm just worried

495
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,460
about the construction plans
and Zhao Chong.

496
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,940
(So he's asking about that.)

497
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,420
They're all here.

498
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,819
It's okay.

499
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,739
Do you not remember

500
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,900
anything at all?

501
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,220
What should I remember?

502
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:31,059
Nothing.

503
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,940
Here, take your medicine.

504
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:36,428
(Everything inside and outside
of this dream)

505
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:38,499
(feels so real.)

506
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,228
(Did I really kiss her just now?)

507
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,220
(He didn't mention that kiss at all.)

508
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:48,660
(Is he really not remembering it)

509
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:50,388
(or pretending?)

510
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:51,988
(What if it did happen?)

511
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,299
(If I don't mention it,)

512
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,380
(she'll be hurt.)

513
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:57,860
(I should just ask her directly.)

514
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,099
Sorry about that.

515
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:03,980
I need to talk to you.

516
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,700
Did

517
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,980
we

518
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,539
just...

519
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,820
You're finally awake. Master.

520
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,900
Official Lu's hands

521
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,148
are no longer hot.

522
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:32,308
He no longer had a fever too.

523
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:33,708
That's great.

524
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:35,109
Master, if you hadn't woken up,

525
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,069
I might have to lose

526
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,539
my head.

527
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,219
You can still lose it now.

528
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,109
Yes, Master.

529
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,980
I may have come at the wrong time.

530
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,900
I... I'll go and prepare the medicine.

531
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,799
How is Zhao Chong now?

532
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,828
He's not eating or drinking.

533
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,099
He probably won't last a few days.

534
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,860
Shen Zhen,

535
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,019
you should go back and rest.

536
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,300
You must be tired from taking care
of me these several days.

537
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,380
I think I'm fine now.

538
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,579
You have to take care.

539
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,539
I want to see him.

540
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,260
Yes, Master.

541
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,699
Get up!

542
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:47,109
What are you doing?

543
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,820
Move it!

544
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,340
What do you want?

545
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:55,380
Who on earth are you?

546
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,060
(Magistrate Office)

547
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,260
Imperial Inspector?

548
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,619
Son of Duke Zhenguo, Lu Shiyan?

549
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,539
What capabilities do I have

550
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:17,420
that make you make such an effort?

551
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:20,059
Zhao, you're so cautious.

552
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:22,308
How can I not make the effort?

553
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:24,539
It must have been hard on you.

554
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,499
Not only risking your life

555
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:31,579
but also putting up an act for so long.

556
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,019
With the crimes you've committed,

557
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,549
it's worth it to pretend

558
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,059
for a few more days.

559
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,900
I've committed a crime?

560
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,940
Do you have evidence?

561
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,139
It's important
to have evidence in a case.

562
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,219
With your cleverness,

563
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,228
it's not difficult to guess

564
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:55,900
how the lumberyard caught fire, right?

565
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,430
(Ministry of Water Resources Inspection.
Verified by Li Di.)

566
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:05,820
I have captured
and taken Li Di into custody.

567
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,828
So do you still think
I have no evidence to arrest you?

568
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,019
I'm nothing

569
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,420
but a merchant who does anything
to amass wealth.

570
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,380
Since I'm caught,

571
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,740
I have nothing else to say.

572
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:24,828
Who's the mastermind

573
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,828
behind the collapse of the West Canal?

574
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,980
Everyone knows

575
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,499
it's Shen Wenqi.

576
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:36,940
Then who told you

577
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,019
that someone is investigating
the West Canal case?

578
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,228
I made a wild guess.

579
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:44,019
The collapse of the West Canal
has affected the people's livelihoods.

580
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:49,380
This is definitely not something
you and Li Di would dare or be able to do.

581
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,748
The person manipulating you from behind

582
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,699
shouldn't be a nobody.

583
00:37:54,669 --> 00:37:55,949
Otherwise, you wouldn't choose

584
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,348
to commit suicide

585
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:59,980
rather than leave yourself some hope.

586
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,539
Since you've guessed it,

587
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,389
you should know

588
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,980
that you wouldn't find out who that is.

589
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,139
Even if you did find out,

590
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:15,949
you are powerless to change it.

591
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,099
I could even sentence
the Empress's nephew,

592
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,940
Deputy Minister Xu, to death.

593
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,820
As long as the evidence is solid,

594
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,940
I am not afraid of any power
as the Imperial Inspector.

595
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,900
I suggest you eat well.

596
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:33,059
As an abandoned pawn,

597
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:37,179
there's a limit to your lifespan.

598
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:42,629
Do you think killing Xu Wei

599
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,099
is a great feat?

600
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,059
Yes,

601
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,788
I'm an abandoned pawn.

602
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:53,619
You're also part of the game!

603
00:38:57,149 --> 00:38:58,900
Master, are you okay?

604
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,109
I just interrogated Li Ji.

605
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,109
He's very tight-lipped.

606
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,579
He didn't say a word.

607
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:09,860
Now, I'm worried

608
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,780
that he'll say Minister Shen ordered him

609
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,699
to set the lumberyard on fire.

610
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,099
It will be troublesome.

611
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,940
Light or heavy punishment
won't make him talk.

612
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,619
Master, what should we do?

613
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,740
Zhao Chong knows a lot.

614
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,380
Those people won't let him off easily.

615
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,300
It's the 99th time, Miss.

616
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,748
What do you mean?

617
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:47,029
Since you came back,

618
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,029
you've been sighing.

619
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,219
Did anything happen?

620
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:50,659
I'm fine.

621
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,300
Go to sleep first.

622
00:39:55,149 --> 00:39:56,940
Something must be wrong.

623
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,509
Let me guess.

624
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,780
You're thinking

625
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:04,619
about Official Lu, right?

626
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,668
No, I'm not.

627
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,148
Just look at your reaction.

628
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:08,199
How can you deny it?

629
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,549
You're blushing and feeling frustrated.

630
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,699
Just like what's written in the story
about a girl in love.

631
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,389
Besides,

632
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,139
didn't Official Lu
do this to you that day?

633
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,509
How did you know?

634
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,989
I saw it.

635
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,668
Besides, I had some sense.

636
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,579
So I deliberately leave you two alone.

637
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:28,539
Don't bring this up anymore.

638
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:31,820
Pretend it never happened.

639
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,179
Pretend it never happened?

640
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,109
Could it be that Official Lu

641
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,539
doesn't want to take responsibility?

642
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,148
Then I'll go and settle
the score with him.

643
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:41,340
Qingxi,

644
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:46,188
he doesn't seem to remember about it.

645
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:47,820
He doesn't remember?

646
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,549
So just pretend it never happened.

647
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,109
How can we pretend it never happened?

648
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,549
We cannot let him
take advantage of you for nothing.

649
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,308
Qingxi, stop it already.

650
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:56,539
Can't you see I'm already troubled?

651
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:57,740
But...

652
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,380
Darn that Lu Shiyan.

653
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:08,499
So, did I really kiss her?

654
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,300
(Longfu Inn)

655
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:20,380
Miss Shen.

656
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:22,460
Official Lu.

657
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:25,828
You get motion sickness.

658
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:27,268
So you should sit in this carriage.

659
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:28,828
No need to trouble you, Official Lu.

660
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:29,429
Qingxi and I

661
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,099
will take the other one.

662
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:33,708
But your law texts
are still in the carriage.

663
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:35,708
With you handling my father's case,

664
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,740
I feel assured.
So I don't need to study.

665
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:58,509
Miss, are you feeling sick?

666
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:58,989
Why don't

667
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,949
I ask Official Lu

668
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,420
to stop for a while?

669
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:03,460
I can still hang on.

670
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:06,260
(Halt!)

671
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,629
Master ordered

672
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,949
everyone to rest!

673
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,868
After one hour,
we'll continue the journey!

674
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,019
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

675
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,740
Drink some more.

676
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,260
I'll go and get some more for you.

677
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,668
Miss Qingxi,

678
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:30,708
can you help me

679
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:31,828
prepare medicine for Master?

680
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:32,549
But I have

681
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,029
to help Miss to fetch some water.

682
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,348
I can do it. You can leave it to me.

683
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:36,549
I'm bad at preparing medicine.

684
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,509
So I'm counting on you.

685
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,509
Please.

686
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,539
This way, please.

687
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,940
Official Lu,
what are you trying to do again?

688
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,179
I'm not trying to do anything.

689
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:11,708
What do you mean by "again?"

690
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:12,380
You...

691
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,260
Stay away from me.

692
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:16,059
You're not Wei Xian anymore,

693
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,860
and I'm not Madam Qin.

694
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,748
You're right about that.

695
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:22,100
There's nothing wrong
with your statement.

696
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,949
(Just admit that you don't want
to be responsible.)

697
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,868
(I'll pretend
I was kissed by the dog at home.)

698
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,219
Stinky dog.

699
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:31,228
I suddenly think

700
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:33,109
of our dog at home.

701
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,699
It loves to jump up
and get close to people.

702
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,619
Dogs are like that.

703
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:39,109
Some people

704
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,139
are clueless like dogs.

705
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,469
That should be...

706
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,389
Where's Qingxi?

707
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,139
Didn't she go to get water for me?

708
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:48,900
I have water.

709
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:19,619
So,

710
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,748
what's the plan
after returning to the capital?

711
00:44:22,749 --> 00:44:24,300
What do you mean?

712
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,148
Naturally,

713
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:26,860
it's to find a way to save my father.

714
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:27,940
What else?

715
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,909
Manage Baixiang Pavilion.

716
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,989
After all, the Shen Residence
has been sealed off.

717
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,980
We still need to find a place to stay.

718
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,019
That's it?

719
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,780
Yes.

720
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:45,539
What about you, Official Lu?

721
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,139
What's your plan

722
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,900
after returning to the capital?

723
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:51,549
Clear your father's name.

724
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,780
After that?

725
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:55,308
Let you return as Miss Shen
of the Shen family.

726
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:56,980
Anything else?

727
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,980
Keep serving and investigating cases
as the Imperial Inspector.

728
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,748
Official Lu, you're diligent, loyal,

729
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:04,989
just, and impartial.

730
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,619
