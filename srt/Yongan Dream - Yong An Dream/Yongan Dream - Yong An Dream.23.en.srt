=Episode 23=

18
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:59,949
Official Zhou, it's rare for you
to act like this.

19
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:02,757
I knew

20
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:03,878
you were no ordinary simpleton

21
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,548
when I first met you

22
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,468
at the Imperial Censorate.

23
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,948
What do you mean?

24
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,188
From the West Canal Case
until the current case,

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,269
everything you did

26
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:15,668
had proven that I was correct.

27
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,989
Am I wrong?

28
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,188
So what?

29
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:26,389
In the end, she still got hurt.

30
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:30,589
And, I haven't found
the antidote for her.

31
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,837
If only

32
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:35,109
I could get my hands
on Eunuch Lou right now.

33
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,589
But now,

34
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,869
I'm still standing here.

35
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,317
If you can save her

36
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:45,748
from the abyss once,

37
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:48,798
you can save her twice.

38
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,029
Trust her.

39
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,709
And trust yourself.

40
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,149
Official Lu, I never expected you

41
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,228
to be this good at consoling people.

42
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,508
The future is unknown.

43
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:05,269
We can only wait for tomorrow to come.

44
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:11,109
May our hearts be as clear
as the bright moon

45
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:14,628
so that we can dispel
the rain clouds in our hearts.

46
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:23,958
Your Majesty!

47
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,549
Your Majesty,
time to take your medicine.

48
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:36,429
Greetings, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,109
Greetings, Empress.

50
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:39,628
You may rise.

51
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,157
Official Zhou,

52
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,198
why did you come here

53
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,589
this early in the morning?

54
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:47,429
Your Majesty,

55
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:51,117
I'm just doing my usual routine.

56
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,429
What is it? Speak up.

57
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,309
Your Majesty,

58
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,437
the evidence we gathered

59
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,277
in Eldest Princess's case
has been conclusive.

60
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:01,238
Eldest Princess is guilty of treason.

61
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,997
We can convict her of her crime

62
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:05,557
after capturing Lu Shiyan.

63
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,389
Are you sure about that?

64
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:08,358
Eldest Princess

65
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:09,557
is His Majesty's sister.

66
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:11,668
This is a serious deal.

67
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:12,869
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:14,829
we've investigated the case
for a long time.

69
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,949
I'm just trying to close the case
as per the law.

70
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:23,709
Why did Sister do such a thing?

71
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,428
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,117
I believe

73
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:31,908
that Sister just took a wrong turn.

74
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:33,117
Please

75
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:35,149
be lenient to her

76
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,069
on account of our ties.

77
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,108
Sister.

78
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,509
Sister, she...

79
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,749
Your Majesty!

80
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:46,997
Your Majesty!

81
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,957
Your Majesty, you must take care!

82
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,358
Your health is the most important.

83
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,749
I'm fine.

84
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,428
Your Majesty,

85
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,749
I have one more thing to report.

86
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:00,868
Crown Prince has been listless lately.

87
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,468
We should let Sixth Prince accompany him

88
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:04,557
for the prayer ceremony.

89
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:06,468
This way, at least
they can take care of each other.

90
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,269
You can make the arrangements.

91
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,308
Yes, Your Majesty.

92
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,468
I wish to rest.

93
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,029
You guys may leave.

94
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:15,228
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,757
Mr. Ge lives at the westernmost quarters
within the palace.

96
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:38,589
He lives at Chenghong Hall,
Tianqian Palace.

97
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,637
(Chenghong Palace)
Many imperial guards

98
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,348
patrol the place.

99
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,149
Miss Xu, please be extra careful.

100
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,069
Mr. Ge,

101
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:56,749
Her Majesty requests your presence.

102
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,149
Got it.

103
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,468
Who's there?

104
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,308
What are you doing here?

105
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,398
Save me.

106
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,149
All right.

107
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,278
What's wrong?

108
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,548
Hurry. I'm stuck.

109
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,228
What are you doing here?

110
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,317
Do you know

111
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:54,548
that there are imperial guards
everywhere?

112
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,718
I can't explain myself to you
at this moment.

113
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,149
We can talk after we leave the place.

114
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,308
Can you walk?

115
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,348
I'm afraid not.

116
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:09,108
I'll carry you.

117
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:22,548
To be honest,

118
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,029
you were quite heavy.

119
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:26,517
That's why you couldn't defeat me.

120
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,069
Besides, who told you...

121
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:31,949
Who told you to carry me?

122
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:33,357
How can you leave the palace

123
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:34,437
if I don't carry you?

124
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:36,828
You were limping, you know?
People will get suspicious.

125
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,469
What are you doing?

126
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,038
I'm checking

127
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,629
if your ankle is dislocated.

128
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,597
No.

129
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:47,437
It got numb as it was stuck
for some time.

130
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:48,869
That's why it hurts when you touch it.

131
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,038
If so, is your leg okay?

132
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,668
I'm fine now. Look.

133
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:56,469
I'm glad that you're fine.

134
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,758
Why didn't you tell me
that you were back?

135
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,837
I have been observing you
for a long time on the roof.

136
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:02,790
I was afraid that
I might recognize the wrong person.

137
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,077
I have to find an excuse

138
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,199
to bring my troops here.

139
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,678
My troops are still outside of the city.

140
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,308
I came back to report this
to His Majesty.

141
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,597
Besides,

142
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:12,357
I wanted

143
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,437
to give you guys a surprise.

144
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:14,357
But you?

145
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:16,029
You gave me a shock instead.

146
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,548
I went there for official business,
you know?

147
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,990
What type of official business?

148
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:24,149
Look.

149
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,678
This is the true proof of

150
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,788
the illegal purchase of iron ores.

151
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:31,588
What happened?

152
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
(Zhao Chong)

153
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:36,389
How's Miss Shen Ran doing?

154
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,908
Her condition has worsened.

155
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,668
And,

156
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,308
Miss Man hasn't come back yet.

157
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:47,469
By the way,

158
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:50,188
you sent your men to tell us

159
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,957
that you were ready, right?

160
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,749
That's right.

161
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,308
What did you find out

162
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:56,788
after seeing His Majesty in the palace?

163
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,629
It's just like what we've predicted.

164
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,828
Her Majesty wants Sixth Prince

165
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,948
to attend the prayer ceremony
with Crown Prince.

166
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,038
His Majesty already agreed to it.

167
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,869
Okay.

168
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:09,278
Everything is proceeding
according to our prediction.

169
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,308
Official Zhou.

170
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:11,469
Official Lu.

171
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,518
Official Su.

172
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,158
My troops are stationed

173
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,317
outside of the city.

174
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,349
Leave the refugees to me.

175
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,149
Thank you, Official Su.

176
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,437
You two came back

177
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,588
together, huh?

178
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,357
I reached the palace first.

179
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,828
In the end, I saw her stuck at...

180
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:33,509
Let's get back to business.

181
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,197
This is the proof of

182
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:38,109
Mr. Ge's illegal purchase of iron ores.

183
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,278
I believe that we can

184
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,597
prove Eldest Princess's innocence

185
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:48,869
with this.

186
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,269
Once tomorrow's event is over,

187
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,269
I'll go and pick up my mother.

188
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,109
Leave Eunuch Lou to me.

189
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,437
I'll deal with Mr. Ge.

190
00:10:58,438 --> 00:10:59,918
Since he loves to play tricks so much,

191
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,629
I'll show him my bags of tricks.

192
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,278
Now,

193
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,798
Pang Hu has written a letter

194
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,798
as per my request

195
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,998
and handed it to Eunuch Lou.

196
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,269
I assume

197
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,989
Her Majesty has already read it by now.

198
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,389
We just need

199
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:13,109
to wait for their next step.

200
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,948
Pang Hu is pretty capable, isn't he?

201
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,998
Not only did he kill Lu Shiyan,

202
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,197
but Shen Zhen is also
under his control now.

203
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:29,668
Tomorrow, we'll use the Shen family

204
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,188
to restrain Zhou Shu'an

205
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:35,389
so that he won't foil our plan.

206
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,477
Your Majesty, you don't need to worry.

207
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:39,837
Now, everything is

208
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,998
under your control.

209
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,918
Firstly,

210
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,717
there's no way for Duke Zhenguo Residence
to make a comeback.

211
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:46,638
Secondly,

212
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,317
many of the important subjects

213
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:50,229
are on your side, Your Majesty.

214
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,477
Thirdly,

215
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,678
Crown Prince already lost
the people's support.

216
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,317
In addition, His Majesty

217
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:58,837
is almost dead.

218
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,197
Tomorrow,

219
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:02,118
when Sixth Prince
becomes the next crown prince

220
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,918
and His Majesty falls unconscious,

221
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,638
the world will belong to you

222
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,068
and Sixth Prince.

223
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,597
You do know how to please me
with your words.

224
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,828
Your Majesty, it's because
you taught me well.

225
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:17,597
All right.

226
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:20,038
You can reveal our plan

227
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,957
to our subjects.

228
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,109
Yes, Your Majesty.

229
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,269
Eunuch Lou.

230
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,548
Eunuch Lou,

231
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,389
are we ready to act?

232
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,588
Are you guys ready?

233
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,349
Eunuch Lou, please give us your order.

234
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,068
Tomorrow...

235
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,597
You're drunk.

236
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,749
Your wife will blame me for this again.

237
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:21,837
This! What are you guys doing?

238
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,317
-Who are you guys?
-What are you doing?

239
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,548
What are you guys trying to do?

240
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,678
Do you guys know

241
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,758
that we're imperial officials?

242
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,548
We know that.

243
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,428
However, all of you

244
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,828
are suspected of treason.

245
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:33,077
(Magistrate Office)

246
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:33,908
This...

247
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,040
(Zhao Wengao)

248
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,749
Shen Ran!

249
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,118
- Miss!
- Miss!

250
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,869
- Shen Ran!
- Sister!

251
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,638
Ran!

252
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,197
Miss!

253
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:03,278
Ran, what's wrong with you?

254
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,998
-Please don't scare me.
-Sister!

255
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,068
Ran!

256
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:09,278
Sister!

257
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,509
Ran!

258
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,948
I'm back.

259
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:27,229
Father.

260
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,749
Sister will definitely be fine.

261
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,428
I hope so.

262
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,749
How's my sister doing?

263
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,100
She's fine now.

264
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,518
She just needs to rest and recuperate.

265
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,788
She'll be fine once she wakes up.

266
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,068
Thank you, Miss Man.

267
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,948
Father, slow down.

268
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,588
Official Zhou,

269
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,229
you don't need to worry now.

270
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,149
Thank you.

271
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,788
Official Zhou is thoughtful indeed.

272
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,428
He brought Miss Shen Ran and the rest
into the Su Residence.

273
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,188
I never expected Sister

274
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,437
to look so pale

275
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:28,668
only after a few days.

276
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:30,918
Luckily, she's fine.

277
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,678
If not, there'll be another
pitiful couple

278
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,597
separated by death.

279
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:36,908
A couple?

280
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,109
Who are you referring to?

281
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:40,798
Official Zhou and Miss Shen Ran.

282
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,428
Them?

283
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:44,068
Don't you know?

284
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:45,278
How should I know?

285
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,188
You didn't write a letter to me.

286
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,317
I'm not you.

287
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:50,629
I have nothing to write about.

288
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,638
I wrote so many letters to you.

289
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,668
You could've at least replied to me.

290
00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:58,948
I didn't even read them.
How could I reply to you?

291
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,749
You didn't even read them?

292
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,317
I spent so much effort

293
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:03,948
writing them, you know?

294
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,788
You think it's tough?

295
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,158
You can stop writing them, then.

296
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,197
Wait.

297
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:10,788
That's not what I mean.

298
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,509
You should at least read them, you know?

299
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,029
Tell me, then.

300
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,469
Why did you write to me?

301
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,828
I...

302
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,068
I wanted to share
all those fun experiences

303
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,548
with you.

304
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,118
There are plenty of people here.

305
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,389
Why did you have to write to me?

306
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,029
I...

307
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,948
I...

308
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,308
I have to prepare for tomorrow.

309
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,828
You must read those letters, okay?

310
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:05,628
What a silly guy.

311
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,348
The future is unknown.

312
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:27,749
Initially, I wanted
to leave a letter behind

313
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,548
so that I could

314
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,318
tell you all those things

315
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,868
I couldn't tell you

316
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,588
in time.

317
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,909
But after giving it some thought,

318
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,669
I gave up.

319
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,308
Once you wake up,

320
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,788
and once I return,

321
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,788
we shall be together forever.

322
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:15,628
Shen Ran.

323
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:18,588

That was terrifying.

337
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:38,269
It felt like we survived
another calamity.

338
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,828
This year

339
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,548
is a harrowing year indeed.

340
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,788
It'll end soon.

341
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,148
Everything will get better.

342
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:50,949
It'll definitely get better.

343
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,989
I have a surprise for you.

344
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,348
You got it back?

345
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:05,429
Let me put it on for you.

346
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,277
Miss Xu found the proof of

347
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:11,388
Mr. Ge's illegal purchase of iron ores.

348
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,477
My mother's name

349
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,638
can finally be cleared now.

350
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,318
Therefore, I retrieved it

351
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,709
from Official Zhou.

352
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,709
What do you think?

353
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,108
Are you happy?

354
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,709
Yeah.

355
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,068
Thank you.

356
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:27,348
Don't mention it.

357
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,108
I'm glad to hear that.

358
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,108
I still remember how fierce you looked

359
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,078
when you saw my jade bangle
for the first time

360
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,509
at Jin Money House.

361
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,269
I never expected you

362
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:42,949
to become like this now.

363
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,868
Like what?

364
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:50,348
Like this.

365
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:52,757
Say something

366
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,509
that I can understand.

367
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,348
I'm fine with whatever you end up like

368
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,669
as long as we can stay together forever.

369
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,909
I don't want the Shen family
to be in trouble.

370
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,598
However,

371
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,828
would we not encounter each other

372
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,828
had these incidents
not happened in the first place?

373
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:20,709
Say,

374
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,918
is this a blessing in disguise?

375
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,628
We're destined to be together.

376
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,229
No matter how many obstacles we face,

377
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,348
we'll encounter each other eventually.

378
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:30,878
You do have a point.

379
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,437
Maybe we were predestined to meet

380
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:34,277
because the story of our past lives
hadn't ended yet.

381
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:35,398
Maybe

382
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,548
we don't even know each other
in our past lives.

383
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,429
(Affinity in one's dream,
calamity in one's life.)

384
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,398
(Those visions in my dreams)

385
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,029
(must be parts of our past lives.)

386
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,509
What's wrong?

387
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:58,308
No matter what happened
in our past lives,

388
00:21:58,478 --> 00:21:59,709
in this life,

389
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,548
we're in love with each other.

390
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,669
We'll have our happily ever after

391
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,229
as long as we don't submit to fate.

392
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:07,229
From now on, I hope

393
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,788
that you'll always stay in my life.

394
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,240
(Yanchun Palace)

395
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,158
All done.

396
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,868
Get up.

397
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,029
Come here.

398
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,308
Come and take a look in the mirror.

399
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:42,868
Today's a big day for you.

400
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,158
I made this ceremonial attire

401
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,398
for you myself.

402
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,949
I even smoked it with fragrance.
Do you like it?

403
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:50,197
I don't think

404
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:51,709
I've smelled this fragrance before.

405
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:52,838
But it smells great.

406
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,509
Thank you, Mother.

407
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,237
My son, today's your first time

408
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:58,878
attending such a prayer ceremony.

409
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,269
It's worth it.

410
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,828
I hope everything
can proceed smoothly today.

411
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:07,797
I hope our people and society
can be blessed

412
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:09,437
so that Brother can dispel

413
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:11,148
those needless rumors.

414
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:12,909
Don't worry.

415
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,757
My son, you have the look of an emperor.

416
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:18,348
I'm sure you'll be
blessed with fortune today.

417
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:19,628
Mother,

418
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:21,158
as the crown prince,

419
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:23,437
Brother was always filial to you.

420
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:25,189
He loved and protected me too.

421
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,598
You're crossing the line

422
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,237
for saying that I have
the look of an emperor.

423
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,989
You shouldn't say that in the future.

424
00:23:31,998 --> 00:23:34,277
Yeah, yeah. I understand.

425
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:35,598
Just follow Crown Prince

426
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,308
to the prayer ceremony.

427
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,828
After this, we can leave it to fate.

428
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,828
Okay.

429
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,308
All right now. You should go.

430
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,757
You shouldn't delay the ceremony.

431
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,398
Mother, I'll have a meal with you

432
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,229
once I return from the ceremony.

433
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,757
Mother, it's been a long time

434
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:51,797
since we chatted.

435
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,068
All right.

436
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,949
I shall take my leave.

437
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,148
Go now.

438
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,148
I've been waiting for this day

439
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,788
for a long, long time.

440
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,669
Pray!

441
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,398
Sacrifice!

442
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:30,989
That fool and his tricks.

443
00:24:30,998 --> 00:24:32,997
Last time might be an accident.

444
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:34,037
They're doing this

445
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,949
to dispel the rumors.

446
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,029
Brother?

447
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:43,669
It's fine.

448
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:52,628
Strange phenomena
had been occurring in the capital.

449
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:54,628
Sixth Prince and I are here
to pray together

450
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:57,709
with Mr. Ge under imperial order.

451
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,709
May the azure skies protect our nation

452
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,108
and our people!

453
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,189
Look!

454
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:08,997
There's a sunbird!

455
00:25:08,998 --> 00:25:09,997
There's a sunbird!

456
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:11,269
The sunbird has returned!

457
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,429
Brother!

458
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:18,517
Brother!

459
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,709
Protect the crown prince!

460
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:44,558
Sunbirds, you all are parts of

461
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,788
an auspicious phenomenon.

462
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,237
Why are you bothering the crown prince?

463
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:50,588
You guys better leave!

464
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,189
Look!

465
00:25:53,438 --> 00:25:54,318
Look!

466
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,358
Those sunbirds are actually following

467
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,838
Sixth Prince's order.

468
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,878
Sixth Prince is the chosen one!

469
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:00,678
That's right!

470
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,358
Sixth Prince has great virtues!

471
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,277
Long live Sixth Prince!

472
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:06,037
Sixth Prince has great virtues!

473
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:07,918
Long live Sixth Prince!

474
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,757
Sixth Prince has great virtues!

475
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:11,757
Long live Sixth Prince!

476
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,678
Sixth Prince has great virtues!

477
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,678
Long live Sixth Prince!

478
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,108
Sixth Prince has great virtues!

479
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:26,628
Your Majesty?

480
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,757
Why are you still reading the folds?

481
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:29,628
Come.

482
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:31,548
Give it to me.

483
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:35,318
You didn't finish your medicine either.

484
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,509
What are those servants doing?

485
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,388
Here.

486
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:40,949
Your Majesty, let me feed you.

487
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,749
It's been 20 years

488
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,029
since I entered the palace.

489
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:13,878
Your Majesty, you must
rest and recuperate.

490
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,469
You must recover soon

491
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:18,749
so that I can keep you company.

492
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,277
Your Majesty!

493
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:22,429
Something bad has happened!

494
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,598
Your Majesty!

495
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,517
Your Majesty!

496
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,118
Something bad has happened!

497
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,237
Why the rush? Speak slowly.

498
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:29,909
During the prayer ceremony,

499
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,638
for some reason,

500
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:34,398
a flock of sunbirds appeared again

501
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,909
and attacked the crown prince!

502
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,957
How's the crown prince?

503
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,037
Although His Highness was rescued,

504
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,878
he fell into a coma.

505
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:47,788
I'm afraid he won't be able to survive!

506
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,509
How could that happen?

507
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:51,918
What about Sixth Prince, then?

508
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,037
Sixth Prince was protected
by the auspicious phenomenon.

509
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,558
He's unharmed.

510
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,918
All of the people

511
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,429
were saying

512
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,189
that Sixth Prince was the chosen one.

513
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,068
Nonsense!

514
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,269
How dare they utter such words?

515
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,909
Your Majesty, look.

516
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,588
If fate allows it and
the people support him,

517
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:18,709
I have nothing to say about that.

518
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,388
Where's the crown prince right now?

519
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,918
He's still at the altar.

520
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,717
However,

521
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:32,429
the imperial physicians are there too.

522
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:35,318
Go there and keep an eye on them.

523
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,868
Escort the crown prince
and Sixth Prince here.

524
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,558
Tell our subjects to enter the palace.

525
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,709
Yes, Your Majesty.

526
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,989
Hao?

527
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,868
Hao, why are you back?

528
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,429
Are you okay?

529
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,588
Is the crown prince back too?

530
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:55,838
What's wrong with you?

531
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,437
Were you...

532
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:57,269
Mother.

533
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,269
Were you the one

534
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:02,509
behind the attack on Brother?

535
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:05,308
What nonsense are you talking about?

536
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:07,797
Sunbirds are parts of
the auspicious phenomena.

537
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:09,197
How can I manipulate them?

538
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,437
If so, why did those sunbirds

539
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:11,757
ignore me

540
00:29:11,758 --> 00:29:13,469
and only attack Brother?

541
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,237
Why did you suddenly suggest me

542
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:16,918
to join Brother for the prayer ceremony?

543
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:17,757
And, why did you use

544
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,469
a different fragrance
on my attire today?

545
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,318
What are you up to?

546
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,477
I have no idea

547
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:23,918
why you're doing this.

548
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,997
Why are you doing this?

549
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:26,189
You scoundrel!

550
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:27,558
How could a son

551
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,558
slander his own mother like this?

552
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,108
Being chosen by the heavens

553
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,669
and winning the people's support
are important indeed.

554
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,189
However, they cannot be manipulated

555
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:40,348
by an individual.

556
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:43,949
Your Majesty,

557
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,318
right now,

558
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,957
the people acknowledge Sixth Prince

559
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,828
as the chosen one.

560
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,558
I haven't died yet, you know?

561
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,909
Look at how impatient you are.

562
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:28,388
Husband and wife
turning against each other,

563
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,068
siblings killing each other,

564
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:34,029
are those the things you desire?

565
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,148
Mother.

566
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,477
Mother, you're wrong.

567
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:37,437
You're utterly wrong.

568
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:38,957
I never wanted

569
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,308
to be the crown prince.

570
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,797
I never wanted to harm my own siblings

571
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,189
and jeopardize our harmony.

572
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:44,068
Father!

573
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:45,429
Father!

574
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:46,517
Sixth Prince.

575
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:47,189
Father!

576
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:48,558
Father!

577
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,348
Your Majesty,
it must've been tough for you.

578
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,638
You're the ruler of the nation,

579
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,189
yet you have to feign illness
for my sake.

580
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:58,197
What a shame.

581
00:30:58,198 --> 00:31:00,628
In order to make sure
everything proceeds as expected,

582
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:03,638
the medicine you drink just now,

583
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,388
that's the real

584
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:08,348
life-taking drug.

585
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,509
Is that so?

586
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:17,068
If that's the case,

587
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:20,997
I'll enjoy the big show

588
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,548
you guys have prepared for me.

589
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,068
Why are all of you still alive?

590
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:43,548
Brother!

591
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,949
Mother, you were always close to me.

592
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:51,957
And, I always thought of you

593
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,388
as my real mother.

594
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:55,398
Even if I inherit the throne
in the future,

595
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:57,400
Mother, you can still enjoy everything
you enjoy right now.

596
00:31:57,401 --> 00:31:58,277
Why must you

597
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,078
resort to this?

598
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,388
Stop pretending!

599
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,118
Back then, your mother

600
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,318
was selected as the empress

601
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,437
just because of her noble background.

602
00:32:09,438 --> 00:32:10,158
She suppressed me

603
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,749
in the imperial harem for ten years.

604
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,548
And you,

605
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,909
you became the crown prince

606
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,828
just because you were a few years older
than my son.

607
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,477
My son has no choice
but to be your subordinate.

608
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,600
Once he turns into an adult,
he'll be sent to a foreign state

609
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,269
and be separated from me.

610
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,399
What gives?

611
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,318
Mother, if you don't wish
to part ways with Sixth Brother,

612
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,318
I could've requested Father

613
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,558
to allow Sixth Brother

614
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,108
to remain in the capital.

615
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,638
Stop pretending

616
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:35,989
to be all high and mighty.

617
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,788
I don't need your sympathy.

618
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:40,469
This place

619
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,348
is mine in the first place.

620
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:45,868
I just need to take it back.

621
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,800
(Imperial Study)

622
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:20,469
Mother!

623
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,318
Mother, please don't
persist in your errors!

624
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,957
Mother, it's not too late for you

625
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,700
to plead guilty
in front of Father and Brother.

626
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:26,158
Mother!

627
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,628
You want me to plead guilty?

628
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,749
I've plotted this for many years.

629
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,517
Crown Prince, do you know

630
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:36,797
how many subjects are my men?

631
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:38,638
Do you know how many of them

632
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:40,509
are on my side?

633
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:42,989
I even stationed my private troops
outside of the city.

634
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,628
Why should I plead guilty?

635
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,229
Mother?

636
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,828
Hao,

637
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:55,788
no matter if you're willing or not,

638
00:33:56,718 --> 00:34:00,669
you have to inherit the throne.

639
00:34:03,438 --> 00:34:06,828
Mother, why are you doing this?

640
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,958
Your father is poisoned.

641
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,989
He won't be able to survive.

642
00:34:13,758 --> 00:34:16,469
Once we seize the palace,

643
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,429
this world...

644
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,397
This world

645
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:23,309
will belong to us!

646
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,949
Empress, that was ambitious of you.

647
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:31,429
Crown Prince,

648
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,228
have you learned something
from this encounter?

649
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,158
If you have,

650
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,397
how will you

651
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:40,429
deal with this situation?

652
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,837
Kill them!

653
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:53,588
Take all of them down!

654
00:34:58,398 --> 00:34:59,389
Mother!

655
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,708
- Don't move!
- Mother!

656
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:09,628
Mother!

657
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:11,228
Don't move!

658
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:16,668
Execute all those

659
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:18,588
who try to rebel!

660
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,038
(Imperial Study)

661
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,558
Attack!

662
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,628
Attack!

663
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:48,700
Your Majesty,

664
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:50,917
most of her private troops
outside the city have been arrested.

665
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:51,558
Right now,

666
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,237
the army

667
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:53,558
I brought back from the border areas

668
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:56,188
are dealing with the rebels
within the palace.

669
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,869
Your Majesty,

670
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,357
last night, we've arrested

671
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,837
all of the subjects who tried to rebel.

672
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,349
They've confessed to their crimes too.

673
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:18,989
Emperor,

674
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,558
you set up

675
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,357
this net long ago.

676
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:24,668
You were just waiting for me
to be ensnared.

677
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:30,598
Now, everything has settled down.

678
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,588
You eliminated
all of your threats in one go.

679
00:36:33,798 --> 00:36:38,789
Your Majesty, Crown Prince,
you two are capable indeed.

680
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:40,148
Empress,

681
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,909
you were predestined

682
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,148
to fail.

683
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:50,188
It's a shame that you ruined

684
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,829
Sixth Prince's life as well.

685
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,068
Sixth Prince?

686
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:06,509
Winner makes the rules,
and losers live by them.

687
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,837
You can do whatever you want to me.

688
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:10,158
But Hao,

689
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,668
he knows nothing!

690
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,700
Father, I know I've sinned.

691
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,118
There's no way for me to explain myself.

692
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,700
I'm willing to be imprisoned
and interrogated.

693
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:19,797
Hao!

694
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:20,837
It's all my fault.

695
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:21,757
It's all my fault.

696
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:23,200
I couldn't stop Mother in time.

697
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,638
That's why she caused this disaster.

698
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,877
The nation's foundation
was shaken because of her act.

699
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,628
Even my death isn't enough
to atone for her sin.

700
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:31,748
Father, Brother, I'm being presumptuous,

701
00:37:31,758 --> 00:37:33,829
but I hope that you two
can show her mercy

702
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,349
and leave her body intact!

703
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:42,789
Father! Brother!

704
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:56,068
Father!

705
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:57,789
Brother!

706
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,708
Father!

707
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:13,949
Someone!

708
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:14,829
Yes, Your Highness.

709
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:18,078
Take the empress and Sixth Prince away.

710
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,108
Yes, Your Highness!

711
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,909
You two are excellent actors indeed.

712
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:41,228
I'll make sure you two regret it!

713
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,588
This is bad.

714
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,389
Shen Zhen is in trouble.

715
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,349
It's on fire!

716
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:00,469
There's a fire!

717
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,354
(Su Residence)

718
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:04,598
Go and get help!

719
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,958
Father, are you okay?

720
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:06,598
Miss Shen Ran!

721
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,068
Miss Shen Zhen is still inside!

722
00:39:08,198 --> 00:39:09,158
Take good care of Master.

723
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,909
-I'll go and save Zhen.
-I'll go!

724
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,068
Master!

725
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:13,518
Miss Shen Zhen, let me go instead.

726
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,317
Where's Zhen?

727
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,949
Zhen is still in the side hall!

728
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:19,877
Official Lu!

729
00:39:19,878 --> 00:39:20,998
I want to tag along!

730
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:22,268
Just trust Lu Shiyan.

731
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:23,397
What happened?

732
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:24,438
We were inside the residence.

733
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,757
For some reason, our gate was locked.

734
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:27,748
I think someone did it on purpose.

735
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,518
I'll go and get help.

736
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,558
Take good care of yourself.

737
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,598
Take good care of yourself.

738
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,789
Okay, Zhou Shu'an!

739
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:35,789
Zhen!

740
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:37,268
Zhen, where are you?

741
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,158
Zhen, where are you?

742
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:39,757
Zhen!

743
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:40,708
I'm over here!

744
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:47,588
Zhen!

745
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,678
Just forget about me.

746
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,038
It's too late.

747
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,518
Zhen, don't move!

748
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,309
I'll definitely save you!

749
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,708
Lu Shiyan!

750
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,429
Lu Shiyan!

751
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:09,628
Lu Shiyan!

752
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:10,998
Don't come here!

753
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:12,228
Lu Shiyan!

754
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:23,469
Lu Shiyan!

755
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:34,078
Lu Shiyan, are you okay?

756
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,268
Lu Shiyan!

757
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:36,949
Lu Shiyan?

Are you okay?

759
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:40,108
Lu Shiyan!

760
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,188
(If the afterlife does exist,)

761
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,558
(may you smile with your brows,)

762
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:45,708
Lu Shiyan!

763
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:48,429
(and your dreams come true,)

764
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,068
(just like what I saw in my dream.)

765
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,757
Lu Shiyan,

766
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:54,029
are you okay?

767
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:56,078
Lu Shiyan!

768
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:56,917
Lu Shiyan!

769
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:57,789
Lu Shiyan!

770
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,158
Lu Shiyan.

771
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,078
(No matter what happened in my dreams,)

772
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,909
(I'll never give up.)

773
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:04,789
Are you okay?

774
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:07,188
Let's go!

775
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:12,668
Come.

777
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,638
Zhen, are you okay?

778
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,469
Are you okay?

779
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:21,268
Zhen, are you okay?

780
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:33,797
Lu Shiyan!

781
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:34,558

There's blood.
