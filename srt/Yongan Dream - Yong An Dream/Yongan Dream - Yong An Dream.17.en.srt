18
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:41,633
The West Canal case

19
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,312
led to the suffering of the people

20
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:44,943
and the destruction of good farmland.

21
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:47,392
I feel deeply ashamed.

22
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:48,872
I'm ashamed.

23
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,032
The evildoers' deeds

24
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,144
harmed the people.

25
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:53,312
They also prevented you,

26
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,433
a great architect,

27
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,103
from showcasing your talents,

28
00:01:56,794 --> 00:01:58,424
which was a loss for our dynasty.

29
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:00,784
Official Lu, you're flattering me.

30
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:05,223
I'm indeed at fault
for inadequate supervision.

31
00:02:06,313 --> 00:02:08,392
Thanks to the help of all of you

32
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:10,183
and the Emperor's mercy,

33
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,783
I can now live out my old age in peace.

34
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:16,303
I am content.

35
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:17,672
Uncle Shen...

36
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:18,793
Qingxi! Qing Li!

37
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:20,063
Please help.

38
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:21,583
- Let me help.
- Allow me.

39
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:24,832
Give it to me.

40
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,353
Bring it to me.

41
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,104
Let me take that.

42
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:29,952
Official Zhou, you're our guest.

43
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,063
It's not right
to have a guest do the work.

44
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:36,264
The food is ready.

45
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:37,384
Come.

46
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:45,704
Father.

47
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:47,424
Zhen.

48
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,704
- Ran.
- Father.

49
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:53,033
It was my fault
that both of you have suffered.

50
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,264
It's already over, Father.

51
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,104
She's right, Father.

52
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:58,512
The most important thing now

53
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,272
is that our family can be together.

54
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:01,873
Yes, you're right.

55
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:02,664
Come.

56
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:05,704
Sit.

57
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:07,463
Sit.

58
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:12,824
Ran, your face...

59
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:17,664
You don't need to worry about me.

60
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:20,913
It's time to consider Zhen.

61
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:21,712
It's also time

62
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,463
to find a suitable husband for her.

63
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:25,863
Yes, you're right.

64
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,232
But I wonder

65
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:27,992
if Zhen

66
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,023
has someone in mind now.

67
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:33,432
Me.

68
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:34,264
It's me!

69
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:38,952
When I learned you were released today,

70
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,353
I prepared food and drinks

71
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,144
to congratulate you on your safe return.

72
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:44,153
It's you, Heng.

73
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:45,992
Take a seat.

74
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,144
Sit and talk.

75
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:49,272
Heng went to Xingyue Restaurant

76
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:50,313
and bought Zhen and Father's

77
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,832
favorite food.

78
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,824
He has grown up
and become more sensible.

79
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:03,353
I heard

80
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,832
the Magistrate Office is busy today.

81
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,623
Official Lu, you unexpectedly
have free time.

82
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,424
Official Lu, you're busy?

83
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:12,593
Even if he's busy,

84
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:14,463
he still has to eat, right?

85
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:15,704
Right, Father?

86
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,672
Yes, she's right.

87
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:20,064
How much can a meal delay?

88
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:21,112
Besides,

89
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:22,232
everyone here today

90
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,463
is my family and benefactors.

91
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:25,944
Here.

92
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,432
To express my gratitude,

93
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,064
let's drink together.

94
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:36,504
Zhen.

95
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:38,432
Earlier, you said

96
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,192
after Uncle Shen is released
from prison...

97
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,384
We would gather more often.

98
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:45,023
By the way,

99
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:47,752
I heard you're brave
and valiant in battle,

100
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,064
famous for your prowess.

101
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:50,513
I

102
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:51,552
admire you greatly.

103
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:52,264
Here,

104
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:56,384
a toast to you, Commandant Su.

105
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,264
Official Lu, I'm glad you know that.

106
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:09,744
Commandant Su,

107
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,872
your bravery on the battlefield

108
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,384
is well-known.

109
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:17,504
I also drink to you as respect.

110
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,384
You're flattering me.

111
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:20,463
Let's drink.

112
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,384
I'll fill your cup, Commandant Su.

113
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,192
Su Heng, you're so amazing.

114
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,103
I also want to give you a toast.

115
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:32,264
Zhen, then I'll drink it.

116
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,072
You don't have to drink.

117
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,144
Heng...

118
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,913
Ran, no rush.

119
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:40,752
I'm definitely

120
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:41,983
to give you a toast too.

121
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:43,312
Heng,

122
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,632
you've drunk a lot.

123
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,632
Ran,

124
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:46,552
no worries.

125
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:47,304
Here.

126
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,343
I'll drink on her behalf.

127
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:49,913
Commandant Su, a toast to you.

128
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:50,543
Here.

129
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:55,184
Fill it up.

130
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:55,983
Here.

131
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:00,593
This is for the care you've shown

132
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,752
to Zhen during this time.

133
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:03,432
It's my duty.

134
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,103
Cheers.

135
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:06,450
You're indeed frank.

136
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,513
Let me fill up your cup again.

137
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,072
- Here.
- I'm just happy.

138
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:09,793
A toast to you.

139
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:10,704
Cheers.

140
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,064
Commandant Su, come.

141
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,153
Let me fill your cup.

142
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:14,504
A toast to you.

143
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:18,953
-Cheers!
-Drink more.

144
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:19,900
Drink again, Commandant Su.

145
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,223
Let's fill it up.

146
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:24,504
It's such a happy day today.

147
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,273
Cheers!

148
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:26,023
Cheers.

149
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,632
That should be enough.

150
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,192
We need to make him drunk

151
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,864
to prevent him
from saying anything nonsense.

152
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,384
Uncle Shen,

153
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:37,864
I want to marry Zhen.

154
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,423
Qingxi.

155
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,992
Commandant Su has had too much to drink.

156
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:48,663
Let's go.

157
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,103
Come with me.

158
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:51,473
It's all your fault.

159
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:52,872
Who would have known he would act up

160
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,264
even after he's this drunk?

161
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,223
Could he be drunk?

162
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,384
Su Heng,

163
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:00,353
you're drunk.

164
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,583
I'm not drunk!

165
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:02,983
In the past,

166
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:05,384
my father and Uncle Shen joked
about us getting married.

167
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:07,552
Now that we're grown up,

168
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,944
we can get married.

169
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:09,944
Zhen,

170
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:11,384
I like you.

171
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,033
I will only marry you

172
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,744
in this lifetime!

173
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:22,423
Get me the green mustard.

174
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:27,033
Back then, Zhen wasn't even born yet.

175
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:27,992
It was just a joke.

176
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:29,513
It doesn't count. It doesn't count.

177
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:30,112
Come,

178
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:31,543
let's drink.

179
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,504
Father.

180
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,312
Although it was a joke,

181
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:36,663
I think

182
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,153
Heng's feelings for Zhen

183
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:39,384
are real.

184
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,223
If that's the case,

185
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,184
I won't object.

186
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,473
But

187
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,752
marriage

188
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:48,953
requires mutual understanding

189
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:50,312
between two people

190
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:51,872
to last a lifetime.

191
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:53,593
What are you doing?

192
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,064
Bear with it.

193
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:56,793
Zhen,

194
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:58,144
what do you think.

195
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,223
Father,

196
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,793
you didn't see

197
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:02,713
how happy Zhen was

198
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:03,872
with Heng.

199
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,872
She was smiling all the time.

200
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:06,793
Is that so?

201
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:07,793
Yes, she was.

202
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:09,144
She was really happy.

203
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,463
Zhen, really?

204
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:20,632
- Official Lu?
- Official Lu.

205
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,273
Official Lu.

206
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:21,833
What's wrong?

207
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,543
- Official Lu?
- Official Lu?

208
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:24,663
Official Lu.

209
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,393
I only wish to see him once more...

210
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:29,543
Zhen?

211
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,583
And have a perfect encounter.

212
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,352
Even if it's just a dream,

213
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:38,264
it still leaves one with ponders.

214
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,703
If there is another life,

215
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:45,063
I hope you can be
as you are in my dreams,

216
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,072
with a smile on your face.

217
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,033
Zhen,

218
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:49,633
what's wrong?

219
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,624
May everything go smoothly.

220
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,703
Why are you crying again?

221
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:02,104
(It's been more than 30 years.)

222
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:04,783
(Do you still want to hang on?)

223
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:06,584
(Yes.)

224
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:12,504
(I really want
to see him one more time.)

225
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,344
(With yearning deep down,)

226
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,943
(no medicine can heal it.)

227
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:20,984
Mother,

228
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,633
please help me break off this marriage.

229
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,384
What do you mean?

230
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:28,472
This is a marriage granted
by the Emperor.

231
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:31,823
I have someone I want to marry.

232
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,472
Who?

233
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,144
The daughter of the Shen family.

234
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:41,943
You're capable now.

235
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,183
You even deceived me.

236
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:45,952
No wonder you've been keeping

237
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,543
a group of singers
in the other courtyard.

238
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:48,832
It turns out

239
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,352
you were hiding
a daughter of a criminal.

240
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,432
It was me

241
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:52,984
who betrayed your trust.

242
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:55,023
It's my fault.

243
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,504
Your fault?

244
00:09:58,673 --> 00:09:59,393
Do you think

245
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,624
it's just a marriage?

246
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:02,952
Do you not see

247
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,464
the current situation?

248
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,464
What's behind you?

249
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:09,703
The entire Lu family is behind you.

250
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:13,233
The future and lives of the second
and third branches of the family

251
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,033
are in your hands.

252
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,783
Making a wrong move...

253
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,113
If you make one wrong move,

254
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,832
what will happen to them?

255
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,113
I will find a way
to persuade the Emperor

256
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:23,864
to revoke the decree.

257
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:27,543
It won't implicate the Lu family.

258
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,423
You've heard what he said.

259
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:48,823
If you're still here,

260
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,984
he will never marry anyone else.

261
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:00,303
I know what to do now.

262
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:10,864
Zhen... Zhen...

263
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:12,584
Trust me.

264
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:39,072
(Fate in dreams, calamity in destiny.)

265
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,273
(In dreams,
you missed out on each other,)

266
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:44,903
(which caused her
to shed too many tears.)

267
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:48,183
(Her tears are your pain.)

268
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:50,384
Zhen,

269
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,943
I don't care if it's a dream or reality.

270
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:56,504
In this life,

271
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:59,783
I'll never be separated from you

272
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,224
no matter what happened.

273
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:10,543
- Yan.
- Mother.

274
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,393
You're here.

275
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,224
Spare the formality.

276
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:13,873
You're finally awake.

277
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,384
Come and sit down.

278
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,984
Do you still feel unwell?

279
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,072
I feel better

280
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,183
after a good sleep.

281
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,264
I'm glad to hear that.

282
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:26,393
When you fainted yesterday,

283
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:28,783
I was scared to death.

284
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,063
Put on your cloak.

285
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:35,799
Mother.

286
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,952
Be careful not to catch a cold.

287
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:37,984
Let me wear it myself.

288
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:42,943
Mother, you sit down.

289
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:46,584
I'm fine.

290
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:48,584
Sorry for making you worry.

291
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:51,264
Do you think I've been worried less
about you?

292
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:54,183
Fainting now is not a big deal.

293
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,663
But I heard from the palace

294
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,192
that you using your own life
as a guarantee

295
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:00,793
in front of the Emperor

296
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:03,663
and risked your life
for a woman in prison.

297
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:04,943
Yan,

298
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,352
did you

299
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,984
not think of me

300
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:09,793
when you were being reckless

301
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:12,063
with your life?

302
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:13,744
Mother,

303
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,312
I am in this position

304
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,192
and must fulfill my duties.

305
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:18,592
During an investigation,

306
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,584
we must uncover the truth.

307
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:22,864
But I promise you,

308
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:24,464
I will never

309
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,233
treat my life

310
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,543
as a joke again.

311
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:29,943
Good.

312
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,943
But tell me,

313
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:35,104
who is this woman

314
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:36,913
that you're willing

315
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,344
to risk your life for?

316
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,663
Minister Shen's daughter,

317
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,303
Shen Zhen.

318
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:48,984
Shen Zhen?

319
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,344
Yan,

320
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,513
I won't comment more

321
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:00,663
if it was for your investigation.

322
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,823
But remember,

323
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,993
don't let those

324
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,832
with ulterior motives

325
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,624
confuse you.

326
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,352
Always remember

327
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:13,224
that you're the heir
of the Duke of Zhenguo.

328
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,663
Mother,

329
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:20,783
Shen Zhen is not someone
with ulterior motives.

330
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,672
She is just a simple woman

331
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,793
who refuses to submit to power and fate,

332
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:27,063
doing everything she can
to clear her father's name.

333
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:28,703
Mother,

334
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:31,663
please don't misunderstand her.

335
00:14:32,593 --> 00:14:33,823
All right.

336
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:36,183
Take your medicine first.

337
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,224
Zhen,

338
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:52,504
are you leaving today?

339
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:54,552
Now that Father and Ran

340
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,033
have returned to Baixiang Pavilion,

341
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,543
I should leave.

342
00:14:58,073 --> 00:14:59,504
During this time,

343
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:01,584
thank you for taking care of me.

344
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:02,913
Zhen,

345
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:04,663
don't be so polite.

346
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,113
Now,

347
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,432
I'm preparing the betrothal gifts

348
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,192
and will soon go to your house
to propose

349
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:10,303
and marry you.

350
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,432
Miss, I'll put away the luggage first.

351
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,903
Let's go.

352
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,943
Su Heng,

353
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,352
there's something

354
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:26,264
I've been wanting to tell you honestly.

355
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:28,352
Due to some circumstances,

356
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:30,624
I didn't have the chance
to make it clear to you,

357
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:32,033
which caused

358
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,663
such a big misunderstanding.

359
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:35,384
Misunderstanding?

360
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,793
The Shen family was in trouble.

361
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,504
I'm grateful to the Su family

362
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,384
for not abandoning us.

363
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,312
Also,

364
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:43,192
I really enjoy

365
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,783
being with you.

366
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,384
But

367
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:50,344
it's because I've always seen you
as a brother,

368
00:15:50,713 --> 00:15:52,183
nothing more.

369
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:54,224
It was like that before,

370
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,344
and it will be the same in the future.

371
00:15:57,274 --> 00:15:58,744
So

372
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,703
we will not get married.

373
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:06,423
Su Heng,

374
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:07,312
if my words

375
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,472
have hurt you,

376
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:09,712
I apologize.

377
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:10,823
Maybe...

378
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:11,450
Is it because

379
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:12,920
we haven't seen each other
in so many years

380
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,303
that we feel like strangers?

381
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:17,192
Zhen, I don't blame you
for seeing me as a brother

382
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,104
at this moment.

383
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:19,993
But in my heart,

384
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:21,712
you are more than just a sister.

385
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,233
I can wait for you, Zhen.

386
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:23,984
I...

387
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:28,552
I have no right to change how you feel.

388
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:29,672
But I believe

389
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:30,993
that for two people to marry,

390
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:32,552
they must have mutual understanding

391
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:34,793
and experience many things together.

392
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,552
Haven't we experienced

393
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:38,183
enough together?

394
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:40,033
The streets and lanes outside.

395
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,273
There were so many incidents

396
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:42,472
and so many memories.

397
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:44,344
Those are all our shared memories.

398
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:45,952
They are all unforgettable

399
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:47,033
and happy,

400
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:47,952
aren't they?

401
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,472
Those memories are indeed beautiful.

402
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:52,663
But they are all from our childhood.

403
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:54,472
It's the affection between siblings,

404
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,104
not romantic love.

405
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,703
So

406
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,832
it's not possible for us.

407
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,312
So, is your relationship

408
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:01,984
with Lu Shiyan love?

409
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,344
Yes.

410
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:12,784
Zhen,

411
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,072
I won't force you to choose.

412
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,624
But Lu Shiyan

413
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:18,584
is also not a suitable match.

414
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:20,903
I don't understand what you mean.

415
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,384
Lu Shiyan

416
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,152
is a member of the royal family.

417
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:26,112
He's not as simple

418
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,033
as you think.

419
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,152
Behind the family,

420
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:29,632
there are complex
and intertwined forces.

421
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:30,872
He can't be away
from the connections.

422
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:33,273
If he makes a slight mistake,
there is a danger of falling from grace.

423
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:34,793
Then he won't be able
to protect himself.

424
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:35,953
How can he protect you,

425
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:36,943
Zhen?

426
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,903
He cannot choose his background.

427
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:41,592
But he can choose

428
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,183
what kind of person to become.

429
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,832
I have experienced so much with him.

430
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,344
So I know him.

431
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:48,064
I believe in him.

432
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,544
No matter how difficult
the road ahead may be,

433
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:52,503
he can handle it.

434
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:57,233
Miss,

435
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,592
the luggage has been loaded.

436
00:17:58,593 --> 00:17:59,864
We can leave now.

437
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:03,384
Su Heng,

438
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,183
take care of yourself.

439
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:09,183
I shall take my leave now, Mr. Su.

440
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:10,423
Qingxi,

441
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:13,713
Lu Shiyan

442
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:14,632
is really not simple.

443
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:15,993
Zhen is simple-minded.

444
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,673
You're with her every day.

445
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,263
You must be careful.

446
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:21,753
Trust me.

447
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:23,152
If something happens in the future,

448
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:24,673
it will definitely implicate Zhen.

449
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:26,024
Keep it in mind.

450
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,352
Okay, I'll remember.

451
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:27,713
Good.

452
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:28,943
Then I'll leave first.

453
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:32,064
You must be careful.

454
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:37,953
I can't believe Su Heng, this brat

455
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,943
brought up things from childhood.

456
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,072
I often dreamed of playing with Chang'e
when I was a child.

457
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:45,864
Fine, then you marry Chang'e.

458
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:46,953
I was just...

459
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,584
I was just saying.

460
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:49,592
You see,

461
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:50,673
he's always gossiping

462
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:51,632
behind my back,

463
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,193
fabricating all kinds
of scandals against me.

464
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,943
He's just brazen and unreasonable.

465
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:56,312
Yes,

466
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:57,912
he's brazen and unreasonable.

467
00:18:57,913 --> 00:18:59,552
Didn't you say

468
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:02,024
that Su Heng is just a brat?

469
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:05,273
You're stable and dignified.

470
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,713
Don't bother arguing with him.

471
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,352
Besides, we didn't come here today

472
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:10,624
to scold him.

473
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,112
When will you stop

474
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,463
sending me flowers?

475
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,352
Every day from now on,

476
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:28,793
until we marry

477
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,183
and have children.

478
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:34,544
Who said I would marry you?

479
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:37,144
If you don't want to...

480
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,183
Who said I don't want to?

481
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,864
That bangle

482
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,993
is a keepsake from your mother.

483
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:59,064
Don't worry.

484
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,223
I will definitely help you find it.

485
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:05,983
It's even more precious

486
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:08,152
because you repaired it.

487
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:09,144
Zhen.

488
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,263
So,

489
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,503
does that mean you agree?

490
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:16,104
I can agree,

491
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:18,152
but with conditions.

492
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:18,993
In the future,

493
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:21,072
you are not allowed to repair bracelets
for others casually,

494
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:21,793
you are not allowed

495
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,312
to send flowers to others casually,

496
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:24,832
and you cannot say the same things

497
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,273
to other ladies.

498
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:27,864
If I find out,

499
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,632
I will make you suffer every day.

500
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:31,943
Can you accept that?

501
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:39,423
Even if I don't suffer,

502
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:41,064
I will always

503
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:45,584
listen to you.

504
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:11,663
Sir.

505
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,544
Sir,

506
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,344
look at this.

507
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:20,832
Commandant Su's statement

508
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,993
about the garrisoning in Jizhou

509
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:24,233
and the iron ores in Wuzhou
is indeed true.

510
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:26,312
Moreover, the total funds flowing
into both places

511
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:27,953
tally with the ledger recorded

512
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:28,943
by Zhao Chong.

513
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,872
It seems

514
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,193
that the West Canal case

515
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:32,872
is indeed related to the affairs

516
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:33,943
in Jizhou and Wuzhou.

517
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:39,784
Buying so much iron ore in Wuzhou.

518
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:43,064
Could it be that the Eldest Princess
is really planning to forge weapons

519
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:44,864
and garrison troops in secret?

520
00:21:44,994 --> 00:21:46,983
But as a woman,

521
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,943
she cannot inherit the throne.

522
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:51,304
Why would she do these things?

523
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,144
Yes, she cannot inherit it.

524
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:54,624
What if

525
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:57,463
she is doing it for her son?

526
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:59,024
You mean Official Lu?

527
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,352
In that case,

528
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:04,592
is Official Lu investigating
so diligently

529
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,864
to cover up something?

530
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,423
This matter is of great importance.

531
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:12,912
Whether it was done
by the Eldest Princess

532
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:14,033
or

533
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:16,663
if Official Lu was aware of it,

534
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,624
we still have no conclusion.

535
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:22,384
However,

536
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,864
now that Zhao Chong has died

537
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:27,263
and Li Di is unconscious,

538
00:22:28,393 --> 00:22:31,072
who else would know

539
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,024
anything about this?

540
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:34,423
Sir,

541
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,912
do you think

542
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:37,344
Minister Shen knows something?

543
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:42,072
Yes, let's go to Baixiang Pavilion.

544
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:42,784
Okay.

545
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:47,352
What's wrong?

546
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:48,263
Chuyi,

547
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:50,584
this outfit doesn't seem appropriate.

548
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:52,983
I'll go and change my clothes.

549
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:55,750
There's no need to get changed
when we're going to Baixiang Pavilion.

550
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,824
Take your time.

551
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:02,943
No hurry.

552
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:03,983
Okay.

553
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:04,872
Wait for me.

554
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:05,584
All right.

555
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:15,943
Father,

556
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:18,033
are you all right?

557
00:23:18,034 --> 00:23:20,433
I guess spending time in prison
for so long without doing any work

558
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:22,584
makes my legs and feet weak.

559
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:24,433
Then let me help you inside to rest.

560
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:25,384
What's wrong?

561
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:27,423
My father sprained his waist.

562
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:29,552
Uncle, get on my back.

563
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:30,450
How can I?

564
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,033
It's all right.

565
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,233
Uncle,

566
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:33,273
let's do this together.

567
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:34,673
-Official Zhou.
-One, two, three.

568
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:35,352
Be careful.

569
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:36,513
Official Zhou,

570
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,072
thank you so much.

571
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:38,953
No problem.

572
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:39,943
It's my duty.

573
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:52,824
Uncle,

574
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,503
are you feeling more comfortable now?

575
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:56,903
It's a lot better.

576
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,584
Thank you, Official Zhou.

577
00:23:58,714 --> 00:23:59,943
You're welcome.

578
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,552
Official Zhou

579
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:05,544
is really considerate.

580
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:07,993
It's okay.

581
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:09,423
You can stop now.

582
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,144
Ran,

583
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:16,673
the shop

584
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:18,233
is quite crowded with customers.

585
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:21,064
Why don't you go to the front
and take a look?

586
00:24:21,274 --> 00:24:22,632
But your waist...

587
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:23,864
Don't worry.

588
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:25,503
I'll stay with him.

589
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,503
Okay.

590
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:39,953
Official Zhou,

591
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:41,793
are you here to see me

592
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,624
or to see Ran?

593
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:54,872
I do have a question

594
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:56,024
to ask you.

595
00:24:57,754 --> 00:24:58,703
Uncle,

596
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,183
have you ever noticed

597
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,263
anything unusual about Li Di before?

598
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:04,824
Li Di?

599
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,903
I only heard that he was poisoned
and fell into a coma.

600
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:11,273
I don't know

601
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,384
if he is in danger right now.

602
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:15,104
We're doing our best to save him.

603
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:18,463
At first,

604
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:21,753
he was quite steady and stable.

605
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,872
But later on,

606
00:25:22,873 --> 00:25:23,793
he became more

607
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:26,033
and more impatient,

608
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:27,193
trying every means

609
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,503
to win over some officials

610
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:32,273
and frequently interacting with them.

611
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:33,552
He never thought

612
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:34,592
that those people

613
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:37,344
would never befriend him sincerely.

614
00:25:37,393 --> 00:25:39,592
I have advised him several times.

615
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:40,384
Originally,

616
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:44,943
after the incident at West Canal,

617
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:46,943
I don't know

618
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:48,584
what he did afterward.

619
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,703
Could I trouble you

620
00:25:51,754 --> 00:25:54,233
to list the names of the officials
Li Di has tried to win over

621
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:55,784
for me?

622
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:56,993
Of course.

623
00:25:56,994 --> 00:25:59,463
I hope it can help you.

624
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:00,824
Thank you, Uncle.

625
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,152
However,

626
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,983
Ran is exhausted

627
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:09,584
after this incident.

628
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,072
I hope

629
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,104
you don't mind me asking.

630
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:17,703
Are you interested in Ran?

631
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:25,824
Official Zhou,

632
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:30,392
Ran's mother passed away early.

633
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:31,433
So

634
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:32,832
she's been independent

635
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,584
and reserved since childhood.

636
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:35,912
She's also cautious

637
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:37,304
and strong-willed.

638
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:40,183
With the situation involving Li Di,

639
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,903
it has made it even harder
for her to trust others.

640
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:46,433
If you truly

641
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:48,503
have feelings for her,

642
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,824
it might take some effort

643
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,903
and time.

644
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,024
Uncle, don't worry.

645
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:57,784
I understand.

646
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,304
I'll keep waiting for her.

647
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:02,793
I trust

648
00:27:02,794 --> 00:27:04,033
your character.

649
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:05,703
I feel assured.

650
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:07,673
There's not much I can do.

651
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:08,392
But

652
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,352
if you ever feel troubled,

653
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:12,183
feel free to come to me.

654
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,624
Thank you, Uncle Shen.

655
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:25,993
I heard that Shiyan fainted

656
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,592
from exhaustion.

657
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:29,263
Is he feeling better now?

658
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:30,912
Right after he recovered,

659
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:32,584
he went back to the Magistrate Office.

660
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:37,144
Is the Magistrate Office always so busy?

661
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,832
All he cares about
is investigating cases.

662
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,193
As a mother,

663
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:41,703
I hardly ever see him.

664
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,513
It's so boring being alone

665
00:27:43,514 --> 00:27:45,104
in the mansion.

666
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:46,713
It seems

667
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:48,112
you need some company.

668
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:49,344
How fortunate.

669
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:50,592
I wanted to introduce someone

670
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:51,943
to you today.

671
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,784
Who?

672
00:27:54,994 --> 00:27:57,943
General Xu's youngest daughter,

673
00:27:58,073 --> 00:27:59,903
Xu Yiqing.

674
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,903
General Xu has retired
and returned home.

675
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:03,872
His three sons

676
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,473
are still serving in the military.

677
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:06,953
So she's his only daughter

678
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:08,344
and especially being doted on.

679
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:11,112
It's just that after spending
a long time in the military,

680
00:28:11,113 --> 00:28:13,983
her personality
is no different from a boy's.

681
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:16,033
General Xu has a close relationship

682
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,352
with my father.

683
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:19,112
So he asked me to teach her

684
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:21,384
while she's back in the capital.

685
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:24,673
It's understandable
for a girl raised in the military

686
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:25,753
to have such a personality.

687
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,072
Yes, indeed.

688
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:29,033
But when she reaches a marriageable age,

689
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:30,392
General Xu is worried

690
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:31,592
that if he lets her be,

691
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:33,663
she no longer behaves like a woman.

692
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:38,183
Is there anything you need me to do?

693
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,993
The affairs of the harem
are keeping me busy.

694
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:42,463
I don't have time to spare.

695
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,064
If Yiqing is willing to follow you,

696
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:48,223
that would be perfect.

697
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,473
This way,

698
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,953
I can fulfill General Xu's request,

699
00:28:51,954 --> 00:28:53,273
and perhaps

700
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,903
Yiqing and Shiyan will get along well.

701
00:28:56,913 --> 00:28:58,344
I see.

702
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,312
Your Majesty,

703
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:02,152
Miss Xu Yiqing has arrived.

704
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:03,463
Let her come in.

705
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:11,304
Greetings, Your Majesty.

706
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:13,832
Come here.

707
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,663
Greet the Eldest Princess.

708
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:19,263
Greetings, Your Highness.

709
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:24,503
Look.

710
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:26,584
This child

711
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:29,223
is so lovely.

712
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:32,953
If you like her, then it's good.

713
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:34,233
I do like her.

714
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:36,824
But she doesn't seem like
what you described at all.

715
00:29:37,913 --> 00:29:38,872
Yiqing,

716
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:40,793
would you like to come with me

717
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:42,423
to learn etiquette
at the Duke's residence?

718
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:44,473
I'll follow the Empress

719
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:46,064
and Eldest Princess's arrangements.

720
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:52,824
Zhao Chong, Li Di, and Lan

721
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:55,784
all had incidents on the same day.

722
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,152
However, the wealth they amassed

723
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:59,663
from their rampant profiteering
is nowhere to be found.

724
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:01,983
It's very suspicious.

725
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,743
Any news from Official Zhou?

726
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:07,513
Official Zhou said he's tied up
with official duties

727
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,784
and hasn't shown up.

728
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:10,673
Zhou Shu'an

729
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:12,793
has been acting strange lately.

730
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:14,864
He seems to be hiding something from me

731
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:16,793
avoiding mentioning the West Canal case,

732
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:18,624
and even avoiding meeting me.

733
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:22,544
The only one who might know something

734
00:30:22,794 --> 00:30:24,943
is the poisoned Li Di.

735
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,703
But he's still
in Official Zhou's custody.

736
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:29,312
Both Li Di and Lan

737
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,392
are Xu Wei's subordinates.

738
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:33,104
But Xu Wei is already dead.

739
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:38,824
Who are they still working for?

740
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:40,304
Could it be

741
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:42,423
that someone

742
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,433
is using Xu Wei's identity

743
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:45,864
to force them to do things?

744
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:53,624
What if Xu Wei isn't actually dead?

745
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:55,392
Investigate

746
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:56,392
the court officials

747
00:30:56,393 --> 00:30:57,400
who escorted Xu Wei.

748
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:58,552
See if there's anything unusual.

749
00:30:58,553 --> 00:30:59,384
I'll do it right away.

750
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,500
(Magistrate Office)

751
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:11,943
Greetings, Miss Shen.

752
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:13,743
This is for Official Lu.

753
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:15,993
Miss Shen, you're just in time.

754
00:31:15,994 --> 00:31:17,352
Master will definitely like this.

755
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:18,233
I'll deliver it to him.

756
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:19,144
Wait.

757
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:20,743
This too.

758
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:24,743
I'll get going first.

759
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:27,433
Remind him to take his meal.

760
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:28,552
Don't worry, Miss Shen.

761
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,849
Qingxi, enjoy your meal.

762
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,993
I don't need you to tell me that.

763
00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:32,384
I enjoy my meal a lot!

764
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:39,903
Greetings, Your Highness.

765
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,832
The woman whom you called
Miss Shen earlier,

766
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,943
is she the daughter of Shen Wenqi,
Shen Zhen?

767
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,423
Yes.

768
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,872
The one I met at Cheng Garden

769
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:53,784
was also her.

770
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,263
What is she doing here?

771
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:56,624
She's...

772
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:58,183
For a case.

773
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:00,953
Master has recently taken on
a particularly tricky case

774
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:01,983
and needs her cooperation.

775
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:04,584
That better be the truth.

776
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:07,033
We must not let that woman

777
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,713
bewitch Yan.

778
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:09,943
I need to talk to him about this.

779
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:11,144
Your Highness,

780
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:12,999
Master is busy with official duties.

781
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,423
He instructed me to guard the entrance
and not let anyone disturb him.

782
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,983
Not even me?

783
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:18,112
Your Highness,

784
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:19,392
you know what Master is like

785
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:20,392
when he's busy

786
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:21,983
with official duties.

787
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:23,824
All right, then.

788
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:25,864
I'll discuss this with him back at home.

789
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,233
Don't let him overwork himself.

790
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:28,503
Yes, Your Highness.

791
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:29,903
Let's head back.

792
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:32,463
Farewell, Your Highness.

793
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,260
(Duke Zhenguo Residence)

794
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:44,312
Your walking posture

795
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:45,233
is already good.

796
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:46,983
But you need to practice more.

797
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:51,864
I originally wanted to invite Yan
to have a meal with me.

798
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:54,503
But I didn't even get to see him.

799
00:32:54,674 --> 00:32:56,673
Well, you still have me as your company.

800
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,592
At the same time,

801
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:58,312
you can teach me

802
00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,503
the etiquette of dining.

803
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:01,263
You're right.

804
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:02,953
Then let's learn

805
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:04,584
the etiquette of eating now.

806
00:33:04,994 --> 00:33:06,423
Hold the bowl up.

807
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,743
When holding the bowl,

808
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,624
there must be space within the palm.

809
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,344
Sit up straight.

810
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:19,513
When eating,

811
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:21,384
chew slowly and carefully.

812
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,223
Come, try it.

813
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:32,104
Are you hungry?

814
00:33:32,474 --> 00:33:33,864
Eat up.

815
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:54,903
Miss Xu, rest well.

816
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:07,872
Why do women

817
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:09,432
have to learn these things

818
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:10,753
instead of going to battle

819
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:11,904
like Father and my brothers?

820
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,073
I've been ignoring you these days.

821
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:26,624
Please forgive me,

822
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:28,624
my dear.

823
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,104
Miss Xu,

824
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:45,872
we've prepared the incense.

825
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:47,544
Would you like to change?

826
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:48,912
No,

827
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:49,944
thank you.

828
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:06,679
Master, the Imperial Censorate said

829
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,863
they wanted to interrogate Li Ji.

830
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,153
Postpone a little longer.

831
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:13,024
Okay.

832
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:18,863
By the way,

833
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:22,312
when Miss Shen came to see you today,

834
00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:24,753
Eldest Princess happened
to come to see you too.

835
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,064
Eldest Princess saw her.

836
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:27,793
Did my mother

837
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:28,793
say anything to her?

838
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,104
No, not really.

839
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:32,144
It's just that...

840
00:35:36,274 --> 00:35:37,703
What?

841
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:40,432
It's just
when the Eldest Princess saw her back,

842
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:41,673
she recognized her right away

843
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:42,633
that she

844
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:43,944
was the lady

845
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:45,904
at Cheng Garden before.

846
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:47,553
Eldest Princess also said

847
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:49,673
she would never let such a woman

848
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:51,303
bewitch you.

849
00:35:51,353 --> 00:35:52,472
I need to explain things

850
00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:53,233
to my mother

851
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,673
and clear up these misunderstandings.

852
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:56,424
I should propose
to the Shen family soon.

853
00:35:56,993 --> 00:35:58,343
That's it.

854
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:13,783
Zhen,

855
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:14,872
are you still awake?

856
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:15,783
Ran.

857
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,193
I want to talk to you

858
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,863
about Official Lu.

859
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,343
Zhen,

860
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:24,863
it's not that I don't like him.

861
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:26,673
Official Lu is a good person.

862
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:27,872
I can tell

863
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:29,593
he has deep feelings for you.

864
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:31,424
But have you ever thought

865
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:32,713
that he might not be

866
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:33,832
the best match for you?

867
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,753
But we love each other.

868
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:38,113
How can he not be the best match?

869
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:40,392
Lu Shiyan is Duke Zhenguo's heir.

870
00:36:40,393 --> 00:36:42,593
The Eldest Princess
has always been close to the Emperor.

871
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:43,793
If the Eldest Princess arranges

872
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:46,233
a marriage for Official Lu one day,

873
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:47,352
how can we

874
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:48,113
compare

875
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:49,233
to those royal families?

876
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,032
He doesn't care about those things.

877
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:53,024
Can he not care
about the Eldest Princess, then?

878
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,512
Besides, families like theirs

879
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,064
have many wives and concubines.

880
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,584
Can you guarantee

881
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:58,912
that he will be faithful

882
00:36:58,913 --> 00:37:00,153
to only you?

883
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:01,504
I know he will.

884
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,823
Even if he is,

885
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:06,153
Lu Shiyan is busy
with official duties every day.

886
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:08,500
And the mother-in-law you have
to deal with is the Eldest Princess.

887
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,352
Can you handle

888
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,783
your relationship with her?

889
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:12,312
How much do you know

890
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,633
about the rules of the royal family?

891
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,153
Any misstep

892
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:16,624
could be extremely dangerous.

893
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,743
Do you understand the implications?

894
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:20,984
Zhen,

895
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,392
marriage is not just about love.

896
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:24,912
I just hope

897
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:27,343
you can live a simple and happy life.

898
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:29,633
As long as he has me in his heart,

899
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:31,713
I won't fear

900
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:33,303
or retreat from these things.

901
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:37,624
Do you really have to choose him?

902
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:40,383
What about Su Heng?

903
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:42,273
Su Heng is very good.

904
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:44,032
I just don't have

905
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:45,863
any romantic feelings for him.

906
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:48,432
Su Heng has known you since childhood

907
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,863
and has always treated you sincerely
and protected you.

908
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:53,073
Moreover, the Su family is simple.

909
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:54,624
If you marry him,

910
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:57,024
you won't have many worries in the future.

911
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:58,944
Don't you agree with me?

912
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:00,464
Ran,

913
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:01,944
I'm sleepy.

914
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:09,624
Sir,

915
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:11,392
the physician said

916
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:13,183
the medicine he prescribed
seems to be effective.

917
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:15,343
He should be fine now.

918
00:38:24,674 --> 00:38:26,584
He only wants to see his wife.

919
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:49,584
Ran...

920
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:56,104
Ran.

921
00:38:57,913 --> 00:38:59,464
Thank you.

922
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:02,673
Thank you for coming to see me.

923
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,073
If this is all you have to say,

924
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:05,223
I'll leave.

925
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:06,984
Don't go. Please don't go.

926
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:08,504
I...

927
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:12,584
I don't expect you to forgive me.

928
00:39:13,194 --> 00:39:15,223
I just want to see you

929
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,984
and talk to you

930
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,783
because this might be

931
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:22,263
the last time we meet.

932
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:24,624
When I was unconscious
these past few days,

933
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:26,663
I've been dreaming.

934
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,512
In my dreams,

935
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:31,544
there was no wealth, fame, or power,

936
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:32,432
no Madam He,

937
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:33,432
nothing at all.

938
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,863
There's only you

939
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:37,464
and our children and grandchildren.

940
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,713
Every time I wake up,

941
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:42,464
I feel that's the real thing.

942
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:44,703
That's how

943
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:47,233
we should be.

944
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:48,703
What you're saying

945
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:51,793
can only be in dreams.

946
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:52,944
Yes.

947
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:55,872
I know I've caused you

948
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:57,544
a lot of suffering.

949
00:39:58,274 --> 00:39:59,713
I know there's nothing I can do

950
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,624
to make up for it.

951
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:03,872
But now,

952
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:06,263
I just want you to be well.

953
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:11,424
I want you to live the rest
of your life in peace.

954
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:14,904
I'm sorry.

955
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:17,343
In this lifetime,

956
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:21,104
not meeting each other again

957
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:23,904
is enough.

958
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:29,944
Wait.

959
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:34,343
Wait.

960
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,000
(Divorce Letter)

961
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
(Contractor, Li Di
Contract Holder, Shen Ran)

962
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,223
Take care.

963
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:51,223
Ran.

964
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:54,024
If you want to cry,

965
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:56,383
just cry it out.

966
00:41:59,794 --> 00:42:00,984
Father.

967
00:42:10,313 --> 00:42:11,823
It's already in the past.

968
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:13,464
Come and sit down.

969
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,343
Ran,

970
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:21,312
Li Di's future

971
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:22,633
has nothing to do

972
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:24,383
with our Shen family anymore.

973
00:42:25,634 --> 00:42:27,144
But Ran,

974
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:29,663
your own life

975
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,703
still has to go on.

976
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:33,584
Don't dwell on the past.

977
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:35,113
You have to believe

978
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,863
that as long as there is sunshine
in your heart,

979
00:42:37,873 --> 00:42:38,912
you can grow again

980
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:40,984
wherever you go.

981
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,464
I know

982
00:42:43,554 --> 00:42:44,832
you once tried

983
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,584
to stop Zhen and Official Lu.

984
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:51,153
But everyone has their own path

985
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:53,383
to walk.

986
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:55,273
Once you have made a choice,

987
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:57,464
you should not give up lightly.

988
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:01,713
For me,

989
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:03,073
my greatest happiness

990
00:43:03,074 --> 00:43:05,153
is to see you and Zhen

991
00:43:05,154 --> 00:43:07,223
happy and content.

992
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,593
I hope

993
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:11,823
you can open your heart in the future.

994
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:13,273
Laugh when you're happy.

995
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:14,904
Cry when you're sad.

996
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,904
Dare to love when there is love.

997
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:26,104
Father,

998
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:28,183
I'm all right now.

999
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:31,303
Great.

1000
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:34,424
As long as you're okay.

1001
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:05,703
Master.

1002
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:07,553
How did the investigation go?

1003
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:08,392
On that day,

1004
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:09,952
from the prison to the execution site,

1005
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:11,312
all the court officials

1006
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:13,183
