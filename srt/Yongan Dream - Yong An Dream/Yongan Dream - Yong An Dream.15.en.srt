=Episode 15=

18
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,438
Official Li,
why were you looking for me?

19
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,047
Official Zhou,
I wish to ask you something.

20
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:58,119
Please go ahead.

21
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:01,158
If my wife doesn't obey
the female virtues,

22
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:04,598
can I drown her in the pond
as per our clan rules?

23
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:11,718
You need to prove it with evidence.

24
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,479
I think my clansfolk

25
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,359
can be our judges.

26
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:23,278
After all, it's difficult for a just official
to settle a family affair.

27
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:25,599
Why are you asking me

28
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:28,599
when it's a family affair.

29
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,528
The Censor-in-chief supervises
all officials.

30
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:33,447
Official Zhou, you might
complain about me

31
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:36,639
if I'm not wary about it.

32
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:39,767
Official Zhou, since you've acknowledged

33
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,528
that it's just a family affair

34
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,518
and that I can handle it myself,

35
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,359
I can rest at ease now.

36
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,199
Farewell.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,120
(Baixiang Pavilion)

38
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,008
Discard

39
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,088
all of these useless things.

40
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:10,528
Hurry.

41
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:11,359
Wait.

42
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,439
Who are you?

43
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:15,998
I'm from the Imperial Censorate.

44
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:17,838
Sir.

45
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,479
Is your owner around?

46
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:20,327
I need to check

47
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:21,248
the deed of this shop.

48
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:22,408
I have it here.

49
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,327
I'll find it for you.

50
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,159
Go.

51
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,880
(Shen Ran)

52
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,759
Did you guys see the previous owner,

53
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:34,047
Shen Ran,

54
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,128
before you took the deed?

55
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,238
I didn't.

56
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,678
Her husband gave me the deed.

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
(Li Residence)

58
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,278
Official Zhou,

59
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:51,998
why are you panicking?

60
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,248
There's a case

61
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,728
which requires Mrs. Li's assistance.

62
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:55,879
Where is she right now?

63
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,568
What case?
Do you have the official documents?

64
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,199
The Imperial Censorate
is handling this case.

65
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,039
I don't need to explain myself to you.

66
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:02,447
Is she inside?

67
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:03,927
Official Zhou!

68
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,099
As the Censor-in-chief,

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,047
don't you think you need to

70
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:07,128
explain yourself to His Majesty

71
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,600
for intruding upon
one's private property?

72
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:09,767
Moreover, my clansfolk

73
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,678
have already taken Ran away.

74
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,607
Where did they bring her?

75
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:13,808
I don't know

76
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:14,899
about the details.

77
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,968
They took her away in a hurry.

78
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,158
I'm also heartbroken about it.

79
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:19,127
Li Di!

80
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,478
Official Zhou, don't be impatient.

81
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,288
I can send my men to inquire about it.

82
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,838
However, I have one request.

83
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:26,838
Speak.

84
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:30,999
Return my stuff to me.

85
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,199
Just you wish.

86
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,398
Those are evidence of your crime.

87
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:41,918
Official Zhou,

88
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,007
now,

89
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,367
you only have evidence of my crime.

90
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,879
You don't have any witnesses.

91
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,648
At most, I'll just be imprisoned.

92
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,247
But you can't be sure

93
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,888
if you're capable enough

94
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,918
to solve this case.

95
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,278
As for Ran,

96
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,879
I don't know how long she can last.

97
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:00,759
Come to Mount Xicheng

98
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,439
in four hours

99
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:05,999
and bring the stuff I need.

100
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:27,918
My lord.

101
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,398
You're so annoying.

102
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,607
Official Zhou is waiting for you
in the study room.

103
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,600
He said he had important matters
to discuss with you.

104
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,119
Did you make them?

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,127
I'm afraid Official Zhou
is in an emergency.

106
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,319
I'll meet him first.

107
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,439
Come back quickly, then.

108
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:52,999
Wait for me.

109
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:01,088
Miss,

110
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,208
I've already prepared the materials
you told me to.

111
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,679
When are we heading to
Baixiang Pavilion?

112
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:06,408
We can head there after lunch.

113
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,127
Sister is usually in the shop
at that time.

114
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,119
Zhen!

115
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,079
Zhen!

116
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,958
I knew you were here.

117
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:14,848
Brother Su Heng,

118
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:16,999
how did you know that I was here?

119
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:18,648
I delivered meatball soup

120
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,408
to the Imperial Censorate this morning.

121
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:21,567
In the end, they told me

122
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:23,247
you weren't living there.

123
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,167
Zhen,

124
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,567
how could you live here?

125
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:28,007
This is Duke Zhengguo's side chamber,
you know?

126
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,208
Calm down.

127
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,607
Listen to me.

128
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:31,918
Calm down.

129
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:33,119
Give me the meatball soup.

130
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:34,639
The meatball soup.

131
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:37,127
Back then, I did so out of desperation.

132
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:39,968
I was in a hurry to look for evidence
when Father got in trouble.

133
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,807
After that, I encountered Xu Wei.

134
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:43,958
Xu Wei?

135
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:45,439
Who's Xu Wei?

136
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,439
He captured Mrs. Li.

137
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:48,358
That's right.

138
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:49,968
We have to reel the net

139
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,288
as soon as possible.

140
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,518
I'll meet up with Li Di.

141
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:53,958
Official Lu,

142
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,007
please enter the Li Residence
and capture Lan.

143
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:57,478
Are you sure you can handle him?

144
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,639
Chuyi already went to Mount Xicheng.

145
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:03,999
Li Di hasn't gotten
the stuff he wanted yet.

146
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:05,718
Mrs. Li

147
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,478
will be fine.

148
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:12,158
I'll make a move first.

149
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,679
Zhen,

150
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:18,759
you must've suffered.

151
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:20,999
However,

152
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:22,927
Xu Wei is dead.

153
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,478
But you're still staying here.

154
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,759
It's inappropriate.

155
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,478
It's just

156
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,888
that there's something else here.

157
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,598
What is it?

158
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,639
Did Lu Shiyan...

159
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:42,288
Did he force you?

160
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,127
That's not it.

161
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,047
That's not it.

162
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,687
Official Lu is a good person.

163
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:47,079
There's no need to be afraid.

164
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,127
Although the Shen family is in trouble,

165
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:50,247
the Su family

166
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,879
will always be there for you.

167
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,127
That Lu Shiyan,

168
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,888
don't think that he can
do whatever he wants

169
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:56,607
just because he's

170
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,007
the heir of Duke Zhengguo

171
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:59,408
and the presiding judge of your case.

172
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,478
Official Su,

173
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,088
I know you're from the military

174
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,600
and that you're frank
and straightforward.

175
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,079
But even so, you shouldn't
be so blunt about it.

176
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,047
Miss Shen is staying here

177
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,607
because she's related to the case.

178
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,149
Official Lu, everyone knows

179
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,718
that you're focused
on the case investigation.

180
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:14,648
However, you're detaining

181
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,127
your witness in the side chamber

182
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,567
just to assist with your investigation.

183
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:19,278
You're abusing your power here.

184
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,559
I'm warning you here.

185
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,398
Do not obstruct me
from investigating my case.

186
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:30,278
Shen Zhen.

187
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:33,208
I need to leave for an emergency.

188
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,559
You can pack your belongings first.

189
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:35,527
I'll tell someone

190
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:36,998
to send you to the Magistrate Office.

191
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,647
The Magistrate Office?

192
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,199
Did something happen?

193
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,878
We can talk about it when we come back.

194
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,159
Official Su, please.

195
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:48,688
I...

196
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:49,887
Brother Su Heng,

197
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:51,279
it's fine.

198
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,127
Official Lu

199
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,758
is truly doing this to protect me.

200
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:56,998
Let me send you there, then.

201
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:58,838
Hurry and sit down.

202
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,079
Finish the meatball soup.

203
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,767
I traveled across half of the city

204
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:04,519
just to buy it for you.

205
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,319
Hurry. Try it.

206
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,039
See if it still tastes the same.

207
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,703
(Li Mansion)

208
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:16,598
Search the area.

209
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,808
Search every corner.

210
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,247
Yes, sir!

211
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:19,998
Search the area!

212
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:21,400
What are you guys doing?

213
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:22,127
What are you doing?

214
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,088
What are you guys doing?

215
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,767
My son is an official!

216
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:26,919
How dare you wreak havoc
in the Li Residence?

217
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:29,079
Someone reported that Mrs. Li
went missing.

218
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,100
The Magistrate Office is here
to investigate the case.

219
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:31,688
Missing?

220
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:32,848
This...

221
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,728
This Shen Ran is a troublemaker indeed.

222
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,399
She's a jinx!

223
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:37,448
Sir,

224
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:38,728
since Shen Ran is missing,

225
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,367
you guys should search outside.

226
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,007
Why are you guys searching my residence?

227
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:43,367
Yeah, search outside.

228
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:44,279
Official Lu,

229
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,279
we found a female corpse
in the backyard.

230
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,519
You guys may rest here.

231
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:58,399
Zhen,

232
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:02,048
why do you obey his words so much

233
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,279
and come to the Magistrate Office?

234
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:06,168
I'm sure he made such arrangements
for his own reason.

235
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,039
Brother Su Heng, have a seat.

236
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,279
We're out of tea leaves.

237
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:14,838
I'll get some for you.

238
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,598
Seems like you're very familiar
with the place.

239
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:19,048
I often bothered Official Lu

240
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:20,367
because of Father's case.

241
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:21,598
I'll be back in a second.

242
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:39,958
Official Lu?

243
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,998
Official Lu.

244
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,679
Official Lu?

245
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,319
Official Lu.

246
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:18,439
Zhen!

247
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,958
Zhen!

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,928
Someone barged into the cell
without permission!

249
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:27,238
Hurry and notify Official Lu!

250
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,048
Put the Magistrate Office on lockdown!

251
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:39,127
No one is to leave the place!

252
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:40,000
Protect the crime scene!

253
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:40,838
Yes, sir!

254
00:11:58,329 --> 00:11:59,638
How could this happen?

255
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:08,958
Why would there be a dead body
in the residence?

256
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:12,358
Lan.

257
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:15,758
Old Madam!

258
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:17,287
Official Lu,

259
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,848
we found Qingxi in the woodshed.

260
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:19,838
Official Lu.

261
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:22,519
Where's your missus?

262
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,799
She was abducted by Li Di.

263
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:26,088
Qingli!

264
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,247
Do not spout nonsense!

265
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,247
Say one more word,
and I'll treat you as an accomplice.

266
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,250
I will arrest you and send you
to the Magistrate Office.

267
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,407
When was the last time
you saw your missus?

268
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:34,559
It was two days ago.

269
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:35,407
Official Lu,

270
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:36,127
you must save

271
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:37,799
my missus.

272
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:39,928
Official Lu,
we've searched the entire Li Residence.

273
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,799
We didn't discover the tracks of
Mrs. Li.

274
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,279
Yang Zong,

275
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,487
take everyone from Li Residence away.

276
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,238
Yes, sir.

277
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:46,848
Arrest them!

278
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,598
Yes, sir!

279
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:50,007
-Don't capture me!
-What gives you the right to capture us?

280
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:51,208
Don't capture me!

281
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:51,887
Old Madam!

282
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:52,647
Don't capture me!

283
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,358
Official Lu, we're in trouble!

284
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:01,127
Zhen, don't worry.

285
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,199
I'm here with you.

286
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:03,679
Zhen.

287
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:05,487
Zhen, don't be afraid.

288
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:06,878
I'll be here for you.

289
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:09,600
Lu Shiyan!

290
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:10,367
No one is to interrupt

291
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:12,200
the Censor-in-chief from
investigating the case.

292
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,519
Lu Shiyan!

293
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:25,638
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

294
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:29,998
They said I killed someone.

295
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:32,399
Everything will be fine.

296
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:35,079
I trust you.

297
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:45,079
But...

298
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,199
Zhen, don't be afraid.

299
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:56,048
No matter what happens,

300
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:57,638
I'll resolve everything for you.

301
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,358
I won't let you get in trouble.

302
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,319
Let her calm down.

303
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,319
You want her to calm down?

304
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:09,279
How can she calm down?

305
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:11,887
This actually happened
within the Magistrate Office's cell.

306
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:13,887
You actually said you could protect her?

307
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,168
Listen.

308
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,247
I won't let Zhen

309
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:17,319
stay here any longer.

310
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,878
-Zhen, let's go.
-Where are you going to take her?

311
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,328
Do you want
the Cavalry General Residence

312
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:22,638
to be doubted for hiding a criminal?

313
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,100
Or do you want to take her
to the borders

314
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,700
and make a risky bet
with your 50,000 troops?

315
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:26,527
Or do you want her

316
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:27,899
to live with the tainted mark forever?

317
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,799
So what if you can escape with her?

318
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,367
The culprit framed Zhen

319
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:33,598
in the Magistrate Office
in broad daylight.

320
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,499
If you can't find any evidence
to prove her innocence

321
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,878
and they try to pressure you,

322
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:38,279
Official Lu, do you think

323
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,319
you can handle the consequences?

324
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:41,887
No matter what happens,

325
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,519
we'll endure this together.

326
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:50,958
Zhen,

327
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,519
no matter how capable the culprit is,

328
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:56,358
what's fake will never be true.

329
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,527
I can definitely
get to the bottom of this case.

330
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,279
I'm sure you can hang in there,

331
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:01,478
am I right?

332
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,439
Brother Su Heng,

333
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:13,808
Official Lu has a point.

334
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:15,607
Father is still imprisoned.

335
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:16,887
I can't just let people malign me

336
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,159
without any reason.

337
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:20,478
What should I do

338
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,039
if this implicates Father?

339
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:29,919
If so, I'll keep you company.

340
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,159
Zhen, Official Su,

341
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:35,168
tell me

342
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,039
everything that happened

343
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,887
after you two entered
the Magistrate Office.

344
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,328
Back then, I saw someone.

345
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:41,527
I think he was wearing

346
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:43,799
the same uniform as you.

347
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:45,367
I thought you came back.

348
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:47,199
That's why I tried to call you.

349
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,878
But after that,

350
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:50,519
I fainted.

351
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:56,039
When the yamen runners were here,

352
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,168
a bloody sword

353
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,559
was in my hand.

354
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,159
If so, did you encounter

355
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,199
anyone else during the process?

356
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:06,758
I vaguely remember

357
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:07,928
that there was someone

358
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,838
clad in black.

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,079
I reached the cell one step earlier
than the yamen runners.

360
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:16,039
But back then,
Zhen was already unconscious.

361
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,919
Zhao Chong was dead too.

362
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:22,039
Were there any other discoveries?

363
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,358
No.

364
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:25,199
After the incident,

365
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:27,958
the Magistrate Office
went into lockdown.

366
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,319
It's likely that the culprit

367
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:32,279
is still hiding in the residence.

368
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,728
I'll investigate the case
together with you.

369
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,007
No one is to interrupt

370
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,838
the Magistrate Office
from investigating a case.

371
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:39,919
I'm worried about Zhen.

372
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:41,358
Brother Su Heng,

373
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:43,118
I'll be fine.

374
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:44,519
Zhen,

375
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:46,808
the Su family are best friends with
the Shen family.

376
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,300
Although the Shen family is in trouble,

377
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:48,968
the Su family

378
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,287
can't just stand idly by.

379
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,758
Right now, I have to ensure your safety.

380
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,519
Now, Zhen is a suspect.

381
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:57,919
I will bail her out before the trial.

382
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,439
The Su family will bet our entire family
at stake here.

383
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:04,527
Official Su, I'm impressed by
the brave gesture of

384
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:05,899
and you and General Su.

385
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,128
However, there are no
questionable points in the case yet.

386
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,800
You cannot bail her
before the upcoming trial.

387
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:11,408
Please give me some time.

388
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,287
Questionable points?

389
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,158
That's right.

390
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,039
Brother Su Heng,

391
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,838
thank you for your gesture.

392
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,079
But this isn't the time

393
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:27,479
for us to argue.

394
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:28,968
You should let Official Lu

395
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,438
investigate the case
as soon as possible.

396
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:31,878
This way,

397
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,398
my innocence can be proved.

398
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,358
Logically speaking,

399
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,448
now,

400
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:40,598
I should be imprisoned.

401
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:41,918
Let's go.

402
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,728
I'm just taking it out for show.

403
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,079
I just want to admire it.

404
00:17:58,568 --> 00:17:59,519
Zhen,

405
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:01,079
where's your jade bangle?

406
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,598
It was still around this morning.

407
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:06,039
Where did it go?

408
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:07,519
It's fine.

409
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:09,559
We can find it later.

410
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,279
Just wait for my news first.

411
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:18,438
Please.

412
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:22,999
Mind your steps.

413
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,878
Shen Ran went missing.

414
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:39,968
Li Di lured Official Zhou

415
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,327
to Mount Xicheng.

416
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,128
We searched the Li Residence.

417
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:44,128
At the same time, Lan died.

418
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:44,928
Zhao Chong was killed.

419
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,959
And, Shen Zhen was framed as well.

420
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,678
Don't you think all of these

421
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:51,699
are too much of a coincidence?

422
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,767
Lan was an important lead
for the case in the first place.

423
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:55,087
I assume the mastermind

424
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:56,319
silenced Lan as well

425
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:57,368
to prevent Li Di

426
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,918
from being exposed.

427
00:18:59,169 --> 00:18:59,918
However,

428
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,047
why did he frame

429
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,567
Miss Shen?

430
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,959
I'm afraid the thing I feared the most
has come true.

431
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,888
Do you mean the conviction of
Minister Shen Wenqi?

432
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,087
The collapse of the West Canal

433
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:11,300
due to the usage of inferior wood

434
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,327
has complete evidence chain.

435
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:13,900
However, we don't know
who the mastermind is.

436
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:15,007
Coincidentally,

437
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:16,688
Shen Zhen, the daughter of Shen Wenqi,

438
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,598
killed an important witness.

439
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:22,047
Therefore, can we deduct

440
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:22,847
that Shen Wenqi

441
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:24,799
silenced Zhao Chong as he's afraid

442
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,168
that he might rat him out?

443
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:28,567
Now, all of the evidence

444
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,479
is pointing toward Miss Shen.

445
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,928
If we can't find evidence

446
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,198
to prove her innocence,

447
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:34,448
that will mean that she killed

448
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:36,007
an important witness
in the Magistrate Office.

449
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,039
According to the law,

450
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:38,598
she is to be executed for it.

451
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:40,287
And, the Censor-in-chief
will be implicated

452
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:41,519
due to his negligence.

453
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,999
He might even be removed from office.

454
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:46,007
Official Lu,

455
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,200
His Majesty summons you
to the palace for an urgent meeting.

456
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:52,608
Got it. You may leave first.

457
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,319
Yes, sir.

458
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,959
His Majesty found out already?

459
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:00,928
I'll enter the palace first.

460
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,087
Protect Miss Shen.

461
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,838
Do not allow anyone to visit her.

462
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,847
The Magistrate Office is to
continue with its investigation.

463
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:06,888
No one is allowed to leave.

464
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,559
Do a roll call every two hours.

465
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,519
Got it.

466
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:32,678
Li Di!

467
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:33,928
Li Di!

468
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:34,767
You despicable scum!

469
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,158
Show yourself!

470
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:37,398
Li Di!

471
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:27,118
Enough.

472
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:33,519
Official Zhou, I never expected you

473
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,719
to end up like this.

474
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:48,959
I already brought you the stuff
you asked for.

475
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:50,398
Where's Shen Ran?

476
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:54,208
You do care a lot

477
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,638
about my wife, huh?

478
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,327
Should I feel happy

479
00:21:58,328 --> 00:22:00,239
or sad about it?

480
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,158
Cut the crap!

481
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:05,039
Where's Shen Ran?

482
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,408
Not only did you covet my wife

483
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,007
because you have a higher rank than me,

484
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,168
but you also colluded with her
to investigate me.

485
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,759
What kind of behavior is that?

486
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,767
It infuriates me to no end.

487
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:22,728
Disgusting!

488
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,319
Mrs. Li and I

489
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:26,719
never did anything
that crossed the line.

490
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:28,567
You were the one

491
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:30,408
who was sinking into the abyss.

492
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:32,728
It's your just desserts!

493
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:33,247
Fine.

494
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:34,007
Li Di,

495
00:22:34,008 --> 00:22:35,487
tell me where Shen Ran is.

496
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,527
If not,

497
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:38,799
I will never give you the ledger!

498
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,527
I don't think you're in any condition

499
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:51,358
to negotiate a deal with me.

500
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:56,878
At most, you can kill me.

501
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:00,368
You came to look for me
all because you were afraid

502
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:02,719
that I would submit the ledger
to the authorities.

503
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:07,479
Let me tell you something, then.

504
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,168
Because of you,

505
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:11,648
my wife said she regretted

506
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:14,319
not killing me any sooner.

507
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:16,208
What can I do about it?

508
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:17,247
I had no choice

509
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,327
but to lock her in a box.

510
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:20,168
It's been a few hours since then.

511
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,807
I don't know how long
she can last inside.

512
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:24,118
If you keep wasting my time here,

513
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:25,448
no one knows

514
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:26,888
how long she can survive!

515
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,838
You despicable and shameless scum!

516
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:30,807
Li Di,

517
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:33,039
if anything happens to Shen Ran,

518
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:35,079
I will

519
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:36,527
never let you off

520
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:37,888
no matter where you escape to!

521
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:40,128
Choose between the ledger and Shen Ran!

522
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:41,239
Make your choice!

523
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:47,878
Fine.

524
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:50,239
Fine.

525
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:53,319
I'll give you the ledger.

526
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:54,438
Give it to me!

527
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,648
Zhou Shu'an, what are you doing?

528
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:27,398
Don't move!

529
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,519
Where exactly is Shen Ran?

530
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,598
Li Di,

531
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:32,847
if you don't tell me

532
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:33,847
where Shen Ran is,

533
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,567
you won't be able to get the ledger

534
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:36,688
or the stuff you desire!

535
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:39,079
Travel two li along the mountain path.

536
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:40,327
I hid her

537
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,799
inside a cave.

538
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,448
Why should I trust you?

539
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,678
We're just fulfilling our needs here.

540
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:46,638
Give it to me.

541
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:48,959
Give it to me!

542
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,118
Chuyi!

543
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:14,239
Zhou Shu'an!

544
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:16,087
You and your cursed lover!

545
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:16,968
Mount Xicheng

546
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:19,598
will be your burial ground!

547
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:25,228
(Ledger)

548
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:35,678
Shen Ran!

549
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,608
Shen Ran!

550
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:40,678
Shen Ran!

551
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,728
Can you hear me?

552
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:43,968
Shen Ran!

553
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:45,039
Answer me!

554
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,368
Answer me!

555
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:47,479
Answer me!

556
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:49,759
Shen Ran!

557
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,719
Shen Ran!

558
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:56,039
Shen Ran!

559
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:58,198
Shen Ran!

560
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:31,039
Shen Ran.

561
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:35,678
Shen Ran!

562
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,940
♪The old scenes entering my sight as the wind blows♪

563
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:29,650
♪Reminded of the past,

Your Majesty,

602
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,398
Official Lu has arrived.

603
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:29,838
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:37,598
Your Majesty.

00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,559
Official Lu,

00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,678
don't you have anything to tell me?

607
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:50,959
Your Majesty, I request punishment.

608
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,648
Zhao Chong, an important witness
of the West Canal case,

609
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:56,198
was harmed
in the Magistrate Office's cell.

610
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,928
He was pronounced dead on the spot.

611
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,168
Who was the culprit?

612
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:01,438
I'm still trying to find out.

613
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:05,047
Why did I hear

614
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:08,158
that it was the doing of
Shen Wenqi's daughter?

615
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:10,438
Your Majesty,

616
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:13,007
although Shen Zhen,
the daughter of Shen Wenqi, was there,

617
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:14,807
she could never be the culprit.

618
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:16,408
Shen Zhen is weak and frail.

619
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:18,198
How could she kill Zhao Chong?

620
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:20,247
The Magistrate Office's cell
has a tight security.

621
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:21,487
She couldn't even enter

622
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,368
the cell without making
meticulous arrangement.

623
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,039
How could she kill him?

624
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,878
How would you know that
she didn't make any arrangements?

625
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,767
How would you know
that she didn't approach you

626
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,327
with an ulterior motive?

627
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:36,358
Your Majesty,

628
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,678
that's impossible.

629
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:44,888
If Shen Wenqi was truly the mastermind

630
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:46,959
behind the West Canal Case,

631
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,878
I'm sure he has the ability
to construct such a plot.

632
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:53,327
It's not impossible for him

633
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,728
to sacrifice his daughter

634
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,648
just to eliminate an important witness.

635
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,479
But Your Majesty...

636
00:31:58,568 --> 00:31:59,648
Yan,

637
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:01,638
you have your deduction.

638
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:03,368
But don't you think my deduction

639
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:05,519
makes sense as well?

640
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,287
Shen Wenqi is definitely not
the mastermind behind the West Canal Case.

641
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:10,398
And, Shen Zhen wasn't the one
who killed Zhao Chong.

642
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,878
I'm willing to make a guarantee.

643
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:16,759
How?

644
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,959
If he's the mastermind,
I shall be guilty by association.

645
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,598
The severity of this case
will trigger an execution.

646
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:27,928
Even I cannot cover your back

647
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:30,358
without concrete evidence.

648
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:32,168
You should know

649
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:34,047
the reason

650
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,959
I summoned you.

651
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:44,047
How much time do I have left?

652
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:46,319
Until tomorrow's morning court.

653
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,999
Official Lu, all of our men are here.

654
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:01,100
Our only mission today
is to capture the man clad in black

655
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:03,047
who infiltrated the Magistrate Court
this morning.

656
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,719
A team will consist of four men.

657
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:06,728
Inspect every corner you can find
in the office.

658
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:09,039
Do not miss out on any leads.

659
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:10,638
You must accomplish your mission

660
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:11,968
before the sixth watch.

661
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:13,039
Yes, sir.

662
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:14,039
Move out.

663
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:24,208
Official Lu,

664
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:25,918
there was nothing abnormal
about the backyard.

665
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,047
Official Lu, there was nothing abnormal

666
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:34,279
about the entrances and exits.

667
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:38,567
Official Lu, there was nothing abnormal

668
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:39,799
about the windows.

669
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,408
It's the hour of Hai
of the second watch!

670
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:46,327
Close your doors and windows

671
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,959
to prevent burglars from entering!

672
00:33:56,808 --> 00:33:57,487
We've searched

673
00:33:57,488 --> 00:33:58,648
the entire Magistrate Office.

674
00:33:58,649 --> 00:33:59,567
Could it be that Miss Shen

675
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:00,527
was tricking us all along?

676
00:34:00,528 --> 00:34:02,519
I heard that Official Lu
guaranteed her innocence.

677
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:04,319
If he can't find the culprit,

678
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:06,198
both of them will be convicted together.

679
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:07,519
Convicted together?

680
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:09,208
They will be executed if we can't find

681
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:10,479
any questionable points.

682
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:11,407
This won't do.

683
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:13,008
We have to find the culprit
no matter what.

684
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,959
Let's go.

685
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:19,488
Official Lu.

686
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,638
Where were the three of you

687
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:22,407
when the incident happened?

688
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:23,758
We went to the loo.

689
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:24,999
Together?

690
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,247
That's right.

691
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:27,447
Back then,

692
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:28,728
we had a stomachache.

693
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,198
- Stomachache?
- That's right.

694
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:32,927
If so, what food

695
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:33,847
did you guys have?

696
00:34:33,848 --> 00:34:36,247
We had the same food as everyone else

697
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:37,287
in the Magistrate Office.

698
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,088
The only thing different
was the drinks we had

699
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:40,758
in the cell.

700
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:43,879
The drinks, huh?

701
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:46,638
Understood.

702
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,079
If so, did you guys
notice anything abnormal

703
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:51,359
when you left the cell?

704
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:52,447
Not at all.

705
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:53,168
We would never leave

706
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:54,688
if we noticed something abnormal.

707
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:56,648
We were thinking that
there were guards out there

708
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:58,049
and this was the Magistrate Office.

709
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,079
We thought it would be fine
if we left for a short while.

710
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,278
My lord,

711
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:16,919
The drinks were laced with
croton powder.

712
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:19,008
- Croton powder?
- Croton powder?

713
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,318
Who else handled the drinks

714
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:22,758
besides you three?

715
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:23,847
I only met you two

716
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,048
before you two.

717
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:26,048
Did you two see anyone else?

718
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,447
Only the three of us were on duty today.

719
00:35:27,448 --> 00:35:28,099
No one else came.

720
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,327
I didn't see anyone else either.

721
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:30,728
If so, who changed the drinks?

722
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,238
It was you, right?

723
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:33,728
Wasn't it you?

724
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:34,688
It was you.

725
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:35,678
Shut up!

726
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:38,927
I'm sure a living person
who infiltrated the office

727
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,798
will leave some traces behind.

728
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:42,399
Go and find them.

729
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,048
If not,

730
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:44,807
I'll convict all of you
for negligence of duty!

731
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:45,648
Yes, sir!

732
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:46,359
Let's go!

733
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,927

738
00:36:41,328 --> 00:36:44,088
I'm afraid the Magistrate Office
will be in trouble this time.

739
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:44,699
Cut the crap.

740
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,447
Talk too much,
and you'll get yourself in trouble.

741
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:47,247
Hurry and prepare

742
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,959
Miss Shen's last meal for her.

743
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:22,798

I...

745
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:30,519
I'm just here to check on you.

746
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:32,158
You'll be fine.

747
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:35,758
I understand.

748
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,399
If I die here,

749
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:44,479
promise me

750
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:48,638
that you won't tell
Sister and Father about it.

751
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:51,318
Keep it from them
for as long as you can.

752
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,598
I don't want them to be heartbroken.

753
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:56,278
What nonsense are you talking about?

754
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,648
You've been following me
on my investigations for some time.

755
00:37:58,649 --> 00:38:00,367
You've been through
so many setbacks too.

756
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:02,158
You did all those brave deeds

757
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:03,287
because you had conviction

758
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:04,528
in your heart.

759
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:05,528
It's because you believed

760
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:06,999
that your father was framed.

761
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:08,367
Now, it's the same.

762
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:09,367
You didn't kill anyone.

763
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,407
That means you didn't do it.

764
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:13,439
We must resist until the end.

765
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:17,559
I'm not afraid.

766
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,758
Even if

767
00:38:20,169 --> 00:38:21,479
there's no lead,

768
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:24,118
even if

769
00:38:25,448 --> 00:38:26,879
I were to be executed,

770
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:30,318
I will never admit
to a crime that I didn't commit.

771
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:33,118
You must stay strong.

772
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:35,278
I, Lu Shiyan,

773
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:38,198
will not let anyone be wronged.

774
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:43,039
Do you know something?

775
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:46,598
When we were in Wuzhou,

776
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:51,168
I truly hoped that
I could continue our lives

777
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,919
as Wei and Miss Qin.

778
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:55,999
No matter where we went,

779
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,399
Miss Qin and Wei

780
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:01,798
didn't need to know what was going on.

781
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,638
we could just be together forever.

782
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,198
I like that.

783
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:15,238
Only Wei and Miss Qin?

784
00:39:15,408 --> 00:39:18,439
What about Lu Shiyan and Shen Zhen?

785
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:29,479
I'm bad at expressing my feelings.

786
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:31,767
Naturally,

787
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:34,198
I fancy you.

788
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:36,359
Is that all?

789
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,959
"I'm bad at expressing my feelings."

790
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:40,638
"Don't be angry."

791
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,238
So, you heard me

792
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:01,439
that night.

793
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:03,758
Although I was drunk,

794
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:05,598
I heard every word

795
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:07,718
very clearly.

796
00:40:08,888 --> 00:40:10,118
And,

797
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,519
I knew that the paintings

798
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:14,367
you placed in the garden

799
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:15,919
were all portraits of me.

800
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:20,519
You were jealous of Brother Su Heng

801
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,919
because of me.

802
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,559
Actually, I was happy about them.

803
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:32,158
It's all my fault.

804
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,839
It's my fault for
not making things clear.

805
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,399
I wish to take responsibility

806
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:42,118
because I like you.

807
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:45,079
I want to marry you too

808
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:50,559
because I like you.

809
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:09,879
Since I've already told you,

810
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:13,678
from now on,

811
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:16,198
you need to consider it seriously.

812
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,718
If so, you should promise me one thing.

813
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:28,919
What is it?

814
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:31,079
If you can't find the culprit,

815
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:34,758
apologize to His Majesty.

816
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,439
Don't implicate yourself.

817
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,399
It's too late.

818
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:49,919
I, Lu Shiyan,

819
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:55,479
cannot live without Shen Zhen's tears.

820
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:01,678
The ache in my heart
originates from your tears.

821
00:42:05,328 --> 00:42:06,598
My heart aches.

822
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:11,839
If you die,

823
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,439
my heart will die off too.

824
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:19,999
Zhen,

825
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:23,318
you're already in my heart.

826
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:32,399
But now,

827
00:42:35,408 --> 00:42:38,559
if you're implicated because of me,

828
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,638
I would rather

829
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,158
to not encounter you in the first place.

830
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:51,039
As long as I can be with you,

831
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:54,879
I will never change my decision.

832
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:11,999
Are you dumb?

833
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:23,598
Does it hurt?

834
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:28,118
If my heart can only ache

835
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:32,999
because of your tears,

836
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:37,999
I'm willing to bear the pain
for the rest of my life.

837
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:49,559
Zhen,

838
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:51,278
