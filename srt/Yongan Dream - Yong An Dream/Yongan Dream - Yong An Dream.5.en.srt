18
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,770
(Xu Wei was introduced to Earl Suning)

19
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,220
(by Li Di.)

20
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,560
Ran,

21
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,650
I brought you

22
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,080
some treats from Yanhua Inn.

23
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,760
Come and have a bite to eat.

24
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,720
I drank a little too much yesterday.

25
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,810
I was too selfish.

26
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,040
It was all my fault.

27
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,130
I didn't tell you about

28
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,170
Zhen,

29
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,080
because I was worried that you
will feel worse.

30
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,180
I know.

31
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,930
It was my fault as well,
please don't take it the wrong way.

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,050
Why would I?

33
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,680
It's the thought that counts.

34
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,850
Don't worry,

35
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,050
I will find every possible way
to save my father-in-law.

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,090
Regarding Zhen,

37
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,440
I will go to the governor's office today
to make an inquiry.

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,560
That won't be necessary.

39
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,970
Yesterday, I went
to the magistrate's office.

40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,240
This case has been transferred
to the magistrate office.

41
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,170
They say,

42
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,930
she might not be missing.

43
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,090
The kidnapped wife

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,680
might not be Zhen.

45
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,800
Is that so? That is a relief.

46
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,520
After that,

47
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,330
I also went

48
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,240
to see aunt and uncle.

49
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,760
I never thought
that uncle was in cahoots with Xu Wei.

50
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,520
My father treated them so well
for nothing.

51
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,720
Xu Wei?

52
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,280
Is he the assistant minister
of the revenue section?

53
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,360
He is.

54
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,120
Do you know him?

55
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,130
I am just an official.

56
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,970
How could I possibly know
the assistant minister?

57
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,320
What about aunt and uncle?
How are they doing in there?

58
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,410
Both of them were subjected
to physical punishment.

59
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,760
They were bloody all over,

60
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,720
but the magistrate office
will continue their review of this case.

61
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,770
But we don't know

62
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,800
what else can they possibly find still?

63
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,120
They are truly guilty

64
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,040
for such terrible crimes.

65
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,840
Now that father-in-law is in this state,
they are trying to harm Zhen.

66
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,480
Serves them right.

67
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,880
Exactly.

68
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,360
People like that should be
severely punished.

69
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,800
Here, drink some tea.

70
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,160
Missing?

71
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,240
How could Uncle Lu go missing?

72
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,800
The reason is still under investigation.

73
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,010
Official Lu, we cannot postpone
Wuzhou's plans any longer.

74
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,250
We have to depart now.

75
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,200
No, master, the missing person's case
has yet to be solved.

76
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,960
Do you have the portrait
of the criminal?

77
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,330
If this suspect

78
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,250
really looked like this,

79
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,880
I guess he would have been caught
the first time when he did the deed.

80
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,490
I guess it was because Miss Chen

81
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,010
was in too much shock
when giving her a description.

82
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,050
It was all over the place

83
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,000
and the artist simply didn't know
where to begin.

84
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,170
I even thought
of following up on questioning today,

85
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,530
but the Chen Residence wouldn't even
let me through their main gate.

86
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,250
They just said the suspect had two eyes,

87
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,930
one nose,

88
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,080
and a mouth.

89
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,090
If we find the suspect,

90
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,760
then we can depart for Wuzhou?

91
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,520
Let me try then.

92
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,130
What are you trying?

93
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,770
Miss Chen is in shock,

94
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,960
so she might feel frightened
at the sight of men.

95
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,250
If I am the artist,

96
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,970
I might be able to make her
feel less defensive

97
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,290
and remember more of the details.

98
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,490
You can then catch the suspect sooner.

99
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,570
You?

100
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,810
I have been drawing since young.

101
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,840
I am Li Mo's student.

102
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,240
It's done.

103
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,160
What do you think, Official Lu?

104
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,800
But master,

105
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,250
the magistrate office

106
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,640
never had a female artist.

107
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,490
When you searched me last time,

108
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,970
the female court official told me

109
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,990
that Official Lu thought

110
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,690
that men and women each
have their own strengths.

111
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,930
Anyone who is willing
and passes the tests

112
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,400
would be able to handle the tasks.

113
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,130
Oh right,

114
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,000
hold on.

115
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,160
Let me go!

116
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,170
Let me go!

117
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,850
Stop shouting, missy.

118
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,850
Let go of me!

119
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,000
Come here.

120
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,000
Ling'er.

121
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,330
Go away.

122
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,250
Go away, all of you!

123
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,090
I don't know.

124
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,890
All of you, go away!

125
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,570
Leave!

126
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,570
I don't know.

127
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,850
I know nothing of it.

128
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,530
I don't know anything.

129
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,050
Master, hopefully, Miss Chen won't get into
a state of frenzy

130
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,280
and hurt her.

131
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,330
Drink some water.

132
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,280
Go away.

133
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,760
You filthy woman!

134
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,680
I have experienced the same.

135
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,600
One day before my birthday,

136
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,600
my father had been sent to jail.

137
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,760
Our house has been sealed off.

138
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,410
It should have been

139
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,920
a day of celebration,

140
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,440
but in just one day,

141
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,680
I have lost everything.

142
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,330
All that I hear

143
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,210
were the meanest words

144
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,160
that I have never heard before
in my life.

145
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,530
Even my closest aunt

146
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,720
has sent me away to be a concubine
for an evil man.

147
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,850
I managed to flee from one's evil grasp,

148
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,930
just to be confined in the courtyard

149
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,960
by another fierce villian.

150
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,400
What I felt

151
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,600
was the same as yours.

152
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,170
I never knew
that someone this unfortunate

153
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,680
works in the magistrate's office.

154
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,280
Official Lu,

155
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,650
have you tried

156
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,640
to seek justice for her yet?

157
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,290
If you are weighed down by work,

158
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,130
the Governor's Office
could be of assistance.

159
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,170
Official Lu has already

160
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,130
sought justice for her,

161
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,240
so worry not, sir.

162
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,770
How fortunate this lady is

163
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,560
to have met Official Lu.

164
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,480
Although I was the one getting hurt,

165
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,530
I had to pretend that

166
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,280
I was fine.

167
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,090
I did not have a choice.

168
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,240
I must save my father.

169
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,640
I have to let those who hurt me

170
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,800
get the punishment that they deserve.

171
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,160
Although that might be
a difficult path to take,

172
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,160
I am determined to go down that road.

173
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,400
Yet what good does it bring

174
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,440
when they are punished?

175
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,280
Ling'er, you are not in the wrong.

176
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,040
What is right and wrong is clear
to our souls.

177
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,160
If our hearts don't waver,

178
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,920
nothing can change.

179
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,080
Do not live for the lives of others.

180
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,800
Do it for yourself.

181
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,880
For the things that you like,

182
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,040
and also

183
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,480
for your parents
who are worried about you.

184
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,650
How is my daughter?

185
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,240
Ling'er is alright now.

186
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,640
Thank you.

187
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,400
Get investigating.

188
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,210
I have heard of your

189
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,600
tragic circumstances,

190
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,250
luckily Official Lu

191
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,530
has sought justice for you.

192
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,650
Don't worry, young lady,

193
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,050
if you meet anyone evil again,

194
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,890
please come to the Governor's Office.

195
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,600
All of you heard what I said?

196
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,960
We were just separated by a door.

197
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,610
Official Lu!

198
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:14,890
Miss.

199
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,410
- Official Lu! - The Governor's Office has

200
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,380
an undeniable responsibility
in catching evil-doers!

201
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,080
Official Lu, your pen.

202
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,130
I made that story up only for the purpose
of helping little Miss Chen

203
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,930
to let her guard down.

204
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,650
I do admit

205
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,920
that I was exaggerating a little.

206
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,960
If I wasn't at Cheng Garden,

207
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,530
I might have already been kidnapped

208
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,810
by Xu Wei.

209
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,800
You were the one to save me
and protect me, Official Lu.

210
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,130
I was the one who can't tell
the good from the bad and

211
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,640
misunderstood you.

212
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,760
We have arrived, master.

213
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,000
Fine.

214
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,760
You can hold on to that pen first.

215
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,080
Official Lu, I have made a mistake.

216
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,240
I'll let Yang Zong send you back to
Cheng Garden.

217
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,800
What a grudge-holder.

218
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,990
This prescription is for...

219
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,690
Our family has been treating people
for years,

220
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,170
and would like to compile a medicine book.

221
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,920
We are buying these herbs
to test out our medicinal recipes.

222
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,480
I see.

223
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,760
Chun'er,

224
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,840
go get the medicine.

225
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,720
We need one last herb.

226
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,560
Give me that.

227
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,360
Give you this?

228
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,160
Official Zhou!

229
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,180
The imperial censorate
is working on a case.

230
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,360
Official Zhou.

231
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,020
What are these?

232
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,880
These are just some ordinary herbs.

233
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,250
Have I broken

234
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,330
any laws?

235
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,720
We know that Mrs. Li is known to be
the city's top fragrance master,

236
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,320
little did we know,

237
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,300
you're making poison.

238
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,040
The imperial censorate
treats their suspects

239
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,380
pretty well.

240
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,320
They are received as honored guests,

241
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,080
and given hot tea.

242
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,650
I did not treat you

243
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,120
like a suspect.

244
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,520
But all that you have said

245
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,560
sounded exactly like that.

246
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,240
If I don't do this,

247
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,400
would you

248
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,200
have come here with me?

249
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,040
What is it really, Official Zhou?

250
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,480
As the lady of the Li residence,

251
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,880
I don't think it is appropriate for me

252
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,920
to be alone with Official Zhou.

253
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,320
You know that you are the lady of
Li residence,

254
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,640
yet you try to poison your husband.

255
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,560
Is that appropriate then?

256
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,570
Official Zhou,
you are such a highly-ranked official

257
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,000
who holds so much power,

258
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,170
how could you say such nonsense?

259
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,920
If you don't want others to know,

260
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,920
better to have never done it.

261
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,480
Official Zhou,
you can either lock me up now,

262
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,920
or I would have to leave.

263
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,610
You knew that Li Di and Xu Wei

264
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,810
are in cahoots.

265
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,360
They plan to kill your sister Shen Zhen
through the hands of Earl Suning.

266
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,120
But you had no proof,

267
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,600
so you wanted to slice up Li Di
with your own hands,

268
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,880
to get revenge for your little sister.

269
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,450
Yet, Mrs. Li, you have only

270
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,680
some parts of the story.

271
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,480
Do you know why the construction plans
are at the Earl of Suning's residence?

272
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,360
I would like to know.

273
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,480
Earl Sunning only confessed that

274
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,130
he knew the construction plans
of your father

275
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,840
was kept at Jin Money House.

276
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,010
He took it out

277
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,440
to save your father.

278
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,930
He wouldn't be so kind.

279
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,040
That is why.

280
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,360
There is still a lot more to this case.

281
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,650
Why are you telling me all this?

282
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,040
I fear you may die
before avenging yourself.

283
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,000
I won't say more.

284
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,680
Mrs. Li, you are a clever person,

285
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,440
you would know what next to do.

286
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,440
I will take leave now.

287
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,530
My dear lady girl.

288
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,360
You are late.

289
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,640
Waiter.

290
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,240
Sir, the usual?

291
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,890
Sure.

292
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,720
We'll go upstairs.

293
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,890
Waiter, wine.

294
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,840
Coming.

295
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:15,930
You get going.

296
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,680
Alright.

297
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,640
He is inside.

298
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,650
There is a secret door.

299
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,290
Search for it.

300
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,360
Yes, sir.

301
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,490
Why are these vase cabinets

302
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,440
not pushed back to the wall?

303
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,010
Deputy Minister Xu,

304
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,370
you came pretty early today.

305
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,880
We have prepared some snacks.

306
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,410
Magistrate Office on the case.

307
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,220
Anyone resisting will be
executed on the spot.

308
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,800
Untie them.

309
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,320
Mr. Xu.

310
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,920
What are you doing?

311
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,360
Stay still.

312
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,600
Lu Shiyan.

313
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,480
Deputy Minister Xu.

314
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,880
We haven't met in a while.

315
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,330
Well, as the empress,

316
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,530
do you not have access
to the best fabrics?

317
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,490
You had to have me

318
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,120
find these for you?

319
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,330
Not everything from the palace
is the best.

320
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,360
A lot are there to fill the numbers.

321
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,690
They thought we were kept here

322
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,610
and knew nothing about

323
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,520
what good quality looks like.

324
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,890
You're living your life now.

325
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,680
You married into
the Duke Zhengguo residence,

326
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,810
and you can go anywhere that you like,

327
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,680
and do whatever you want to do.

328
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,690
What is this that you are saying?

329
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,090
You've been the empress for so long,

330
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,850
why do you still

331
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,800
have these kinds of childish thoughts?

332
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,770
If the emperor hears this,

333
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,440
I wonder what His Majesty would think.

334
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,810
His Majesty handles so many affairs
each day,

335
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,330
I don't even

336
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,090
get to see him once a month.

337
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,920
He wouldn't bother himself with this.

338
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,880
Your Highness.

339
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,200
Your Royal Highness.

340
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,160
What is it?

341
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,450
You can tell us.

342
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,400
The eldest princess
is no stranger to us.

343
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,720
Your Royal Highness,

344
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,250
Deputy Minister Xu
got into trouble again.

345
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,010
What horrible trouble did he get into?

346
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,970
He was arrested

347
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,520
by the magistrate's office.

348
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,050
It is about him forcibly abducting
the commoners' daughters.

349
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,400
It is not a small matter either.

350
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,170
Let me go check with
the magistrate office

351
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,810
and understand what's going on.

352
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,760
Sister,

353
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,290
although Yan is in charge
of the magistrate's office,

354
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,960
but as his mother, you better not
be involved in this.

355
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,890
Xu Wei is getting himself into
so much trouble these days,

356
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,800
I am getting tired of it.

357
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,370
Just let him be then.

358
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,210
But Earl Ning'an is here already.

359
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,960
He is waiting outside.

360
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,240
I am not seeing him.

361
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,520
Come, let's sit down.

362
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,290
He thought that since I am the empress,

363
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,840
his son is then well-shielded

364
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,530
to do whatever he liked.

365
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,160
Have him go home.

366
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,440
Tea, please.

367
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,210
The Earl of Ning'an's residence
has only this son.

368
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,400
I think they must be very worried.

369
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,210
I remember when he was young,

370
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,930
he was quite the good boy.

371
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,800
He studied well too.

372
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,920
Perhaps he is just making
temporary mistakes.

373
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,090
Did you not hear, sister?

374
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,770
He abducted the commoners' daughters.

375
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,600
It is not the first time.

376
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,560
Eunuch Lou, deliver my verbal decree.

377
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,760
Have the magistrate's office enforce
the law impartially.

378
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

379
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,210
What a pity.

380
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,800
He had potential.

381
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,040
Let's drink tea.

382
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,800
Lu Shiyan!

383
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,040
Enough now.

384
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,680
Eunuch Lou is here.

385
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,250
Eunuch Lou, save me, please.

386
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,730
Eunuch Lou, save me!

387
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,720
Eunuch Lou.

388
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,010
I pay my respects, Eunuch Lou.

389
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,000
You are exempt from formalities.

390
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,930
I am here to deliver a message

391
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,160
to you from the Empress.

392
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,130
Although the empress is compassionate
towards her relatives and descendants,

393
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,800
she will never tolerate wickedness.

394
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,570
Since knowing that Deputy Minster Xu

395
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,690
has been committing such harmful deeds,

396
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,480
her heart is broken, and

397
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,120
wishes the magistrate's office to
punish him without mercy.

398
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,250
Impossible.

399
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,010
Impossible!

400
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,170
That's impossible, Eunuch Lou!

401
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,410
There must be a misunderstanding.

402
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,390
My aunt wouldn't!

403
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,690
She wouldn't leave me in this state.

404
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,190
Something must have went
wrong, Eunuch Lou.

405
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,960
I wouldn't dare deliver the empress's
decree wrongly.

406
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,170
Since Deputy Minster Xu is in the wrong,

407
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,610
you should admit to your crimes
and receive punishment.

408
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,200
Cease your futile pleas.

409
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,880
I have delivered the message.

410
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,160
I would let you carry on
with the hearing.

411
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,000
Goodbye, Eunuch Lou.

412
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,440
Do you plead guilty

413
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,680
or not guilty?

414
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,760
Bring them over.

415
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,040
Kneel.

416
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,640
What he said just now,

417
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,080
you heard it, right?

418
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,560
So what now?

419
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,040
Are you going to

420
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,160
confess or not?

421
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,280
I will, I will.

422
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,930
Sir, sir,

423
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,730
I will confess.

424
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,770
I will confess to everything.
I will confess to everything.

425
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,840
Stop him!

426
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,520
How ungrateful!

427
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,960
Days before,

428
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,810
he told me that

429
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,530
he wanted some young girls

430
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,160
to be sent to Wuzhou.

431
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,760
It was all his idea.

432
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,410
It was all his, sir.

433
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,170
It was all him.

434
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,770
He made me do this.

435
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,170
Sir, it was him.

436
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,560
Wuzhou.

437
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,480
He made me do it.

438
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,650
Xu Wei thought

439
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,330
he had the empress to support him
and could do whatever he liked,

440
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,560
and go beyond the law.

441
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,490
Little did they know, the empress
has always been fair,

442
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,920
how would she show favoritism?

443
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,970
Judging by Xu Wei's crime of
forcing people into prostitution

444
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,760
and abducting young women,

445
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,840
I feel that the death penalty is considered
a light sentence for him.

446
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,360
He is the empress's nephew,

447
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,640
and yet he dared commit such deeds.

448
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,930
Regarding Earl Suning,

449
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,490
who gave him orders

450
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,770
till he would risk being beheaded
to steal the construction plans,

451
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,720
and gifted Shen Zhen to Xu Wei?

452
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,770
Lu Si's residence has been
raided in Wuzhou,

453
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,810
he is currently missing.

454
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,600
The girls that Xu Wei abducted

455
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,450
were to be sent to Wuzhou as well.

456
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,360
What you meant is

457
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,640
there are still hidden factors
in this case?

458
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,160
Wuzhou seems

459
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,960
to be quite a piece of the puzzle.

460
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,600
Official Lu, I am sorry.

461
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,080
Please have some tea.

462
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,560
Did you catch the suspect?

463
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,240
We did.

464
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,960
Who was it?

465
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,410
The main culprit is Xu Wei.

466
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,840
Xu Wei?

467
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,560
That Xu Wei again?

468
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,240
What was his punishment?

469
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,050
Death penalty.

470
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,200
Really?

471
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,360
I can then be free!

472
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,250
I can go see my sister,

473
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,040
we can go to Wuzhou now!

474
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,690
Don't meet her at Li Residence.

475
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,090
You can go to Baixiang Pavilion instead.

476
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,770
You cannot tell your sister

477
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,410
any news

478
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,010
that came from our side,

479
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,600
including the trip to Wuzhou.

480
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,160
Do you understand?

481
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,440
Why?

482
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,720
What are your concerns?

483
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,250
Did you mean

484
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,010
that my brother-in-law introduced
the Earl of Suning to Xu Wei,

485
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,490
and worked together
to sell me to Xu Wei?

486
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,400
But he is my brother-in-law!

487
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,570
They were your paternal aunt

488
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,080
and your uncle too.

489
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,960
Human nature could

490
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,120
be this evil sometimes.

491
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,040
We all have to be careful.

492
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,210
My sister wouldn't be like that.

493
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,400
That I believe.

494
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,240
However,

495
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,810
if she knew about all these,

496
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,080
what would she do?

497
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,160
I guess my sister

498
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,800
would be extremely heartbroken.

499
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't cry, I mean...

500
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,720
Don't cry, don't cry.

501
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,530
Please don't cry,

502
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,410
I am begging you.

503
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,280
Shen Zhen, I am begging you.

504
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,850
Don't cry, Shen Zhen.

505
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,610
If you keep on crying, I will...

506
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,560
I am going to faint now I guess.

507
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,450
What you are saying is real?

508
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,330
I am certain.

509
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,560
Where is Zhen now?

510
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,120
Ran!

511
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,440
Zhen!

512
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,960
Ran.

513
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,250
Zhen,

514
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,730
I am so worried about you.

515
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,690
Ran, I am well.

516
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,930
I heard from the magistrate that
you have been abducted.

517
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,360
Are you in any way hurt?

518
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,530
No.

519
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,800
I was in his secondary residence
this whole time.

520
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,640
You and Official Lu?

521
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,410
Zhen, even if you are doing
this for father,

522
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,370
you shouldn't just marry him simply.

523
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,530
What are you saying, Ran?

524
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,170
I almost

525
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,610
got abducted by Xu Wei.

526
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,130
Official Lu saved me twice

527
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,520
from Xu Wei's hands.

528
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,520
He let me stay in his
secondary residence just to protect me.

529
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,160
I see.

530
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,200
I would have to thank him properly then.

531
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,040
It was all my fault

532
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,120
that you had to endure
all these hardships.

533
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,080
How have you been, Ran?

534
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,000
Same old, same old.

535
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,840
I am just worried about you and father.

536
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,210
Do the people in Li Residence
treat you well?

537
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,560
Is my brother-in-law good towards you?

538
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,200
Everything is good.

539
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,480
Don't worry.

540
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,450
I made a new fragrance,

541
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,600
come and have a look.

542
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,160
I've heard that my brother-in-law
had been promoted,

543
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,040
so he should be treating you
even better, right?

544
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,970
You were the one who had gone missing,

545
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,160
how are you asking so much about me?

546
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,530
What are your coming plans?

547
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,010
I plan to stay on
at the secondary residence.

548
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,130
When Official Lu is working on cases,

549
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,450
I will then go with him.

550
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,120
He will protect me.

551
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,730
When the magistrate's office
is working on cases,

552
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,120
it wouldn't be appropriate for a woman
to tag along.

553
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,970
Ran,

554
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,570
let me tell you about it.

555
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,890
The magistrate office has working women.

556
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,970
Anyone with an expertise

557
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,310
who is able to contribute

558
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,050
will be allowed to
assist them in investigations.

559
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,570
There was a missing case not long ago,

560
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,490
and the suspect's drawing
was drawn by me.

561
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,800
The magistrate's office found him
that very night.

562
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,240
You are so great, Zhen.

563
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,200
Alright then.

564
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,840
Investigating cases is dangerous.

565
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,680
You must pay attention to safety.

566
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,210
Don't worry, Ran.

567
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,880
I am very smart.

568
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,080
Look at our Zhen, all grown up.

569
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,360
(Alright then,)

570
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,490
(just stay safe and sound)

571
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,290
(beside Official Lu.)

572
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,880
(Let me handle all the other affairs.)

573
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,130
(I wonder when will I see you next time)

574
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,680
(after we depart for Wuzhou.)

575
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,330
(I hope that you)

576
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,520
(would be able to protect yourself.)

577
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,320
What is up with all of you?

578
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,160
You didn't cry?

579
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,320
Why would I cry?

580
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,880
My sister knows nothing.

581
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,970
On top of that,

582
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,930
regardless of what my brother-in-law
did to me,

583
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,010
he treats my sister

584
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,520
pretty well on the usual days.

585
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,680
This way I am not worried.

586
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,480
When are we leaving for Wuzhou?

587
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,650
I said Yang Zong
and I will go to Wuzhou,

588
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,080
but I didn't say that you could come.

589
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,450
Official Lu, how could you be a man that
eats your words?

590
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,040
These were all just your thoughts.

591
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,560
Master,

592
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,530
why not let her come

593
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,800
with us to Wuzhou?

594
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,240
This trip is dangerous.

595
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,200
It is not a trip that she should make.

596
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,400
Give me my medicine.

597
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,120
Fine.

598
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,760
I guess

599
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,000
I have to support her
for the rest of my life.

600
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,760
I have lost in this round.

601
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,490
I had fun.

602
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,240
Yan, you have improved in playing Go.

603
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,210
Thank you for the compliment,
Your Majesty.

604
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,290
How are you still acting so formally?

605
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,560
Have a seat.

606
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,470
We can do away with these formalities
when in private.

607
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

608
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,770
How is your mother?

609
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,400
My mother is well,

610
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,850
thank you for asking, Your Majesty.

611
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,160
Great, great.

612
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,450
Eunuch Gao.

613
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,690
I am here.

614
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,610
Go and get

615
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,410
the snacks that Wuzhou presented
as tribute.

616
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,450
Your mother

618
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,410
loved these snacks since she was little.

619
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,600
Bring some of these along for her
when you go home.

620
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,760
I am aging, perhaps,

621
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,210
and I think of my youth a lot.

622
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,850
I feel very nostalgic.

623
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,410
Your Majesty is in the prime of life,

624
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,770
not even yet close to aging.

625
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,650
Is that so?

626
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

627
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,970
I guess some people

628
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,760
might see me as old and decrepit.

629
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,570
You have done well in Xu Wei's case.

630
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,160
These kinds of parasites
are better off dead.

631
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

632
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,490
You have made a great contribution.

633
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,210
What would you like as a reward?

634
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,120
I am just doing my job,

635
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,600
so it is not anything great.

636
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,960
However, I do have a favour to ask,

637
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,210
and would like to get Your Majesty's
permission to do it.

638
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,240
Tell me.

639
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,280
I would like to make a trip to Wuzhou.

640
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,970
Before this,

641
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,290
I had some questions regarding
the presented construction plans.

642
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,530
After finding out that there is a copy
of Shen Wenqi's plan

643
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,650
at Lu Si's residence in Wuzhou,

644
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,970
I have sent people out to get it,

645
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,920
but I have yet to receive a reply.

646
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,330
It has been puzzling me for a while,

647
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,800
so I would like to make a trip myself.

648
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,010
I have heard of

649
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,120
news regarding Wuzhou.

650
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,050
It would be good for you to make a trip.

651
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,520
You can handle
the specifics on your own.

652
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,680
I obey Your Majesty's orders.

653
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:36,250
Master, The identification document
for Wei Jian the merchant

654
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,610
is ready.

655
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,410
Regarding

656
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,790
his wife, Qin Qing, however,

657
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,690
I wonder if Master
has any suitable candidate in mind.

658
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,840
His wife?

659
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,890
Go and look into our female officials,

660
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,080
compile and send in their names and
portrait drawings.

661
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,280
Yes, master.

662
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,680
Official,

663
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,170
what wife?

664
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,520
What was the wife about?

665
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,450
Tell me.

666
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,520
I could be of help.

667
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,530
Stop bothering me all the time,

668
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,210
and you would have had helped me enough.

669
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,610
If you won't tell me,

670
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,770
I'll start crying.

671
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,010
When I cry,

672
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,960
your master will feel sorry for me.

673
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,930
So,

674
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,570
our master, wants me to find him a wife
as his identity disguise.

675
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,730
That is all to it.

676
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,810
So Miss Shen,

677
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,280
can I leave now?

678
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,880
What do you think about me then?

679
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,970
Miss Shen, have you been
someone's wife before?

680
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,770
Do you know how it is to be a wife?

681
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,930
To avoid being noticed,

682
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,370
you would have to stay in the same room
with our master,

683
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,680
would you be willing to do that?

684
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,290
If I could save my father,

685
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,480
I am willing to...

686
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,040
I am willing to learn.

687
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:10,990
Madam.

688
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,770
Did Sir sleep in his study chamber
again last night?

689
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,410
Yes, Madam.

690
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,450
He has been working tirelessly
on the West Canal,

691
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,780
so from night to dawn, he had been busy
in the study chamber.

692
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,730
Alright.

693
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,570
You can go.

694
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,400
Yes, Madam.

695
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,240
(Chunxin fragrance?)

696
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,360
Madam,

697
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,640
these are the accounts
for Chunxin fragrance.

698
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,360
Who's knocking?

699
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,250
Madam,

700
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,120
master sent you some fragrance powder.

701
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,840
Let me have a look.

702
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,920
It's my favourite Chunxin fragrance!

703
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,920
He knows me well.

704
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,010
Master has been

705
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,370
coming over pretty frequently.

706
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,290
I think it won't be long

707
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:00,880
before he

708
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,290
brings you back to his residence.

709
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,760
Of course.

710
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,610
Shen Ran causes trouble for him
every day,

711
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,730
and that made him
irritated and distracted.

712
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,650
He could only relax whenever he
comes over.

713
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,730
I just wonder

714
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,610
when will he

715
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,690
make the decision

716
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,760
to kick Shen Ran out of Li's Residence.

717
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,370
I am not even in a rush,

718
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,880
why are you being impatient?

719
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,250
Didn't master just say,

720
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,170
Shen Wenqi just got into an accident.

721
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,290
If we do that,

722
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,840
we would be seized of our weakness.

723
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,000
However,

724
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,280
what would Shen Ran think of

725
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,170
the master buying me my favourite
fragrance

726
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,360
from her shop?

727
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,640
How would she react?

728
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,560
Madam.

729
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,160
You can go home.

730
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,280
I would like some alone time.

731
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,680
Official Zhou.

732
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,760
I was here to report to you,

733
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,920
but you found your way here.

734
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,200
Did you know this all along?

735
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,080
That's interesting.

736
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,480
All I knew was

737
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,080
what you have already known all along.

738
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,560
Perhaps

739
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,690
I can give Mrs. Li

740
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,560
a better suggestion.

741
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,120
Leave this man.

742
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,760
No need for Official Zhou

743
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,760
to concern yourself with our
household affairs.

744
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,640
If you have the time and energy,

745
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,960
please direct it
towards solving my father's case.

746
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,540
(Wenxiang Bordello)

747
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,160
Sir, they are here.

748
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,450
Do a little walk for me.

749
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,880
Sure.

750
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,800
Do you like that, young sir?

751
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,090
I do.

752
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,250
Young sir,

753
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,240
we know how to do that as well.

754
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,250
Young sir.

755
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:36,730
Alright.

756
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,770
These two can go and rest.

757
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,330
We only need one.

758
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:39,970
No, but...

759
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,280
We don't have money for the rest of you.

760
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,800
How annoying.

761
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,560
He's poor!

762
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,080
I will help you change, sir.

763
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,560
Just sit down and have a chat with me.

764
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,480
Miss, you can stop pretending.

765
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,410
We have learn to read people
from experience.

766
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,490
You saw through my disguise.

767
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,490
I guess you are here

768
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,130
to ask

769
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,040
how could you please a man, right?

770
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,560
I...

771
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,680
All I wanted to know was

772
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,400
how to be someone's wife.

773
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,400
This is easy!

774
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,720
First of all...

775
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,770
If you can teach her well,

776
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,120
this is all yours.

777
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,360
Please have a seat, miss.

778
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,600
Come.

779
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,120
Hello, sir.

780
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,610
Is this your idea?

781
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,190
No, not mine.

782
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,210
I will look for someone else.

783
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,160
I'll look again.

784
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,200
I have yet to finish my dance.

785
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,730
What a pity that there's no qin player.

786
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,600
The atmosphere will be lacking,

787
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,000
but that isn't too big a problem.

788
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,440
I said I won't bring you.

789
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,770
Maybe you will change your mind

790
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,720
after watching me dance.

791
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,530
It's such a beautiful dance,

792
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,080
even I, as a woman, was mesmerized.

793
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,010
I was looking for a wife,

794
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,920
not the kind who you have learn from.

795
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,920
So all I have learn was for nothing?

796
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,450
You don't have to
waste your time anymore.

797
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,890
This trip is dangerous.

798
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,650
Just stay put and wait for me
in Cheng Garden,

799
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,560
please?

800
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,440
Have you found a suitable candidate?

801
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,210
Even if the candidate is a suitable one,

802
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:46,850
you might not

803
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,190
trust her fully.

804
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,330
When you are secretly looking
for the construction plan,

805
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,600
that could pose danger.

806
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,130
The magistrate office's goal,
I know it very well.

807
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,490
This also concerns

808
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,530
my father's innocence.

809
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,170
I will do my best.

810
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,850
I already have a plan.

811
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,050
Are you trying to navigate

812
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,010
through Wuzhou's
dangerous people and places

813
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,000
while handling the people around you?

814
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,770
Also,

815
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,490
Official Lu, if you leave,

816
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,330
I am left alone in Cheng Garden,

817
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:12,850
who knows

818
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,450
if Xu Wei has an accomplice?

819
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,050
What if I am in danger,

820
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,760
who would protect me?

821
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,730
Since my father's incident,

822
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,720
troubles have never left my side.

823
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,810
Thanks to you that I lived safe and soundly

824
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,360
till this day.

825
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,320
You kept on saying that Wuzhou
is dangerous,

826
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,890
but why do I feel that

827
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,600
being by your side

828
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,640
is the safest place where I can be?

829
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,920
Do you really have to go?

830
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,130
Unless you found

831
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,600
a suitable female official.

832
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:46,530
However, you

833
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,160
couldn't even find one.

834
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,740
So why not pick me?

835
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,120
First of all, I know how to draw.

836
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,760
If you want to make investigations,
I can draw you suspect portraits.

837
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,810
Second of all, Uncle Lu recognizes me.

838
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,790
When he sees me,

839
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,650
he will surely hand over the
construction plans to me.

840
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,730
Am I right?

841
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,520
Yes.

842
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,560
Official Lu,

843
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,240
do you think my reason is sound?

844
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,560
Master, it sounds pretty logical.

845
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,440
Get packing then.

846
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,320
Thank you, Official Lu.

847
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,080
Guess my lessons paid off.

848
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,320
Your wife shall now leave.

849
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,360
Qingxi.

850
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,120
- Qing Xi!
- Miss!

851
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,450
Official Lu said yes!

852
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,250
He agreed.

853
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,320
Really?

854
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:51,400
I did this and this and this,

855
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,280
and this,

856
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,880
and this.

857
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,770
Miss, are you sure

858
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,890
that Official Lu
promised you wholeheartedly?

859
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,410
He wasn't just reacting out of shock?

860
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,530
Of course not.

861
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,970
He is the great commanding

862
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,090
Official Lu.

863
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,370
How could he be surprised by anything?

864
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,360
He must think that I am
suitable for him.

865
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,680
Suitable for him?

866
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,330
Even if I am not suitable for him,

867
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,290
it must be

868
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,000
my efforts that he witnessed.

869
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,290
Anyway, given time,

870
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,920
I will become the best candidate.

871
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,980
Why are you not paying your respects
to the Eldest Princess?

872
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,520
I pay my respects, Eldest Princess.

873
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,320
You are...

874
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,320
We are staying here temporarily.

875
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,770
I don't care if you are
staying temporarily

876
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,840
or even permanently,

877
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,250
you would have to pack up immediately

878
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,000
and leave this place.

879
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,760
This place belongs to Duke Zhengguo,

880
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,080
which does not accommodate

881
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,560
vile individuals like you.

882
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,010
Eldest Princess,
there must be a misunderstanding.

883
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,440
What happened was...

884
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,440
Miss,

885
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,450
Her Highness has requested
that you leave,

886
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,240
so you have to leave now.

887
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,530
Don't try to talk back.

888
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,560
Leave.

889
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,600
Don't dirty Duke Zhengguo's place.

890
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,440
Miss.
