18
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:42,793
When I see you,

19
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,383
it's like I'm seeing my kin.

20
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:45,592
A few days ago,

21
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:47,192
I was trapped within
Duke Zhenguo Residence

22
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:49,224
as I had to learn all those
troublesome etiquette.

23
00:01:49,313 --> 00:01:51,103
It was so boring.

24
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,312
Now, I can finally

25
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,504
come out and take a breather.

26
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,633
You're not someone

27
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:57,232
who can stay put in a residence.

28
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,592
That's right.

29
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,713
Now, I feel like riding horses,

30
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:01,913
doing archery,

31
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,224
and having a satisfying fight.

32
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,344
I won't expect too much.

33
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:10,273
Now, I'm already content

34
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:11,304
if I can walk on the streets

35
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:12,943
and do some shopping.

36
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:15,592
Speaking of which,

37
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,464
Miss Man,

38
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:17,792
you're new to the place.

39
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:18,912
You must tell me

40
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:19,752
if you need anything.

41
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:20,912
Miss Xu, I'm already grateful

42
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:22,113
that you're helping me

43
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:24,344
to locate my younger sister.

44
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:26,032
Fate has led us to each other after all.

45
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,399
There's no need to be this courteous.

46
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:29,472
Try out my perfumed sachet.

47
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:30,624
It's very fragrant.

48
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:31,792
Yeah.

49
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,192
I love the perfumed sachet they sell.

50
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:33,912
Me too.

51
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:34,433
Oh yeah.

52
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:35,273
I need to select a gift

53
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:36,032
for Eldest Princess.

54
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,464
I'll take a look inside.

55
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:38,553
Okay,

56
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,433
I'll go and find you
after buying some snacks.

57
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:41,224
Okay.

58
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:46,393
Someone!

59
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:47,703
Catch the thief!

60
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:53,553
Darned thief!

61
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:54,632
How dare you rob someone

62
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,993
in broad daylight?

63
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:56,983
Give it to me!

64
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:11,663
Boss, run!

65
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,512
Your boss

66
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:31,584
is pretty useless.

67
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,352
Brother Su Heng!

68
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,072
Zhen, wait.

69
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:36,663
We can talk
after I'm done dealing with her!

70
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:40,024
Stop fighting!

71
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:48,663
Hand over the money!

72
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:16,103
Are you okay?

73
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:27,512
Miss,

74
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:28,983
thank you for helping us.

75
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,863
But Mr. Su

76
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,584
is someone we know.

77
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:34,200
He didn't tell me about it.

78
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:35,312
I didn't have time to tell you.

79
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:36,700
Now, you know how quick my fists are.

80
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,904
Oh please.

81
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:40,272
Brother Su Heng,

82
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,264
this lady did help me out after all.

83
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,384
My name is Shen Zhen.

84
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:47,503
Miss, may I know your name?

85
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:50,752
I'm Xu Yiqing. Miss Shen, you don't need
to be so courteous.

86
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:52,584
Miss Xu, you have excellent skills.

87
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,913
She assaulted me without
knowing what was going on.

88
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,199
That was cheap of her.

89
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,072
Let's do it again, then!

90
00:04:57,073 --> 00:04:57,632
Fine with me!

91
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,464
Stop!

92
00:04:58,674 --> 00:04:59,863
Brother Su Heng,

93
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:01,632
Father is looking for you.

94
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,952
Uncle Shen is looking for me?

95
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:03,952
What does he need from me?

96
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:05,464
It's something urgent.

97
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:08,473
Fine.

98
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,433
I'll go, then.

99
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,224
Here.

100
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:13,824
Go now.

101
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,303
Just you wait!

102
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:19,752
Miss Xu,

103
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,264
this is Official Lu.

104
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,904
Miss Xu.

105
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:26,784
Official Lu.

106
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,144
Zhen,

107
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,632
what happened just now?

108
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,824
Someone tried to
steal our money just now.

109
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:34,024
Miss Xu saved us.

110
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,743
Thank you, Miss Xu.

111
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,824
Zhen, don't worry.

112
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:42,993
I'll make sure Yang Zong

113
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:44,623
arrest that thief.

114
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:50,863
Official Lu?

115
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,743
Miss Man?

116
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,863
Miss Shen?

117
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:59,384
Miss Fuman.

118
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:00,743
Do you guys know each other?

119
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,743
It's a long story.

120
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,384
What are you doing here in the capital?

121
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:05,752
I came to the capital

122
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:07,584
to look for my sister.

123
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:08,832
I didn't expect

124
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,384
to see you and Official Lu here.

125
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:17,663
Uncle Shen!

126
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:19,543
Heng.

127
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:20,663
Uncle Shen,

128
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:21,832
Zhen told me

129
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,144
that you were looking for me.

130
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,904
I was looking for you?

131
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,113
That's right.

132
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:29,423
I was looking for you.

133
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:34,264
Uncle Shen,

134
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:36,144
you can tell me what you need.

135
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,152
Actually, it's nothing much.

136
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:40,904
This is the situation.

137
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:45,712
What was it again?

138
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:46,800
It was on the tip of my tongue.

139
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:47,873
But I forgot about it.

140
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,900
It's easy to forget things
when you're as old as me.

141
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,144
Let me think about it.

142
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,553
What is it again?

143
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:53,673
Uncle Shen, it's fine.

144
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:54,673
You can look for me

145
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:55,904
when you need me.

146
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:57,144
Okay.

147
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,224
Uncle Shen,

148
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,433
I do have something

149
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:04,353
I have to ask you.

150
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:05,103
Ask away.

151
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:06,793
Uncle Shen, I wonder

152
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:07,673
when you...

153
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:08,584
Uncle Shen.

154
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:09,793
What's wrong?

155
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:10,712
It's fine.

156
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,103
I sprained my waist.

157
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:13,033
Are you okay?

158
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:13,832
I'm okay.

159
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,464
I'll be fine after doing some stretches.

160
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,543
Zhen was worried about your safety

161
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,152
before this.

162
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,873
Now, you're fine.

163
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:23,904
Uncle.

164
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:24,983
Father.

165
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:26,712
Are you okay?

166
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,704
Ran, I'm fine.

167
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:29,993
By the way,

168
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:31,192
why is the shop closed?

169
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:31,913
Where's Zhen?

170
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:33,224
The shop is closed?

171
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,072
I thought Zhen was in the shop?

172
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:35,712
It's like this.

173
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:36,873
Uncle Shen, Sister,

174
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,832
don't worry.

175
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,512
There was

176
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,392
a thief in the shop just now.

177
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,384
However, the issue has been dealt with.

178
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:45,993
I think Zhen was shocked.

179
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:47,353
That's why she closed the shop.

180
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:50,623
And, Lu Shiyan is back too.

181
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:52,752
Lu Shiyan?

182
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:53,752
I...

183
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,192
I have to go and take a look.

184
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,183
Heng.

185
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,824
Li Di said Xu Wei was still alive.

186
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:04,944
By the way,

187
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:08,144
tell Zhou Shu'an

188
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:10,384
that it was Xu Wei.

189
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,584
Xu Wei isn't dead yet.

190
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:15,663
Xu Wei?

191
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,272
I thought he was dead

192
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:18,543
after that incident.

193
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,103
But after that, he sent his men
to look for me.

194
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,033
He was even more arrogant
than he was before.

195
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,743
Since he could rise from the dead,

196
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:27,584
it makes me fear the forces behind him
even more.

197
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:28,673
That's why I had no choice

198
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,063
but to bring Lan back.

199
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:32,993
Xu Wei harbored ill intention

200
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,304
toward Zhen many times.

201
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:35,152
Keep an eye on Zhen

202
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,873
on my behalf.

203
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:38,103
Sister, don't worry.

204
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:39,983
You can leave Zhen's safety to me.

205
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:41,993
You can keep this a secret for now.

206
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:42,792
Official Zhou told me

207
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:44,344
not to tell anyone about it.

208
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:47,304
You just need to protect Zhen.

209
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:49,792
Zhou Shu'an, that old fox.

210
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:50,713
Heng.

211
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:51,353
Sister,

212
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:52,873
I need to return to the shop.

213
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:53,593
What is Lu Shiyan

214
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,713
doing?

215
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,664
He even closed the shop, huh?

216
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,424
Wenxiang Bordello?

217
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:05,593
How did you manage to trace it

218
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:06,783
to Wenxiang Bordello?

219
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:08,593
I returned to Wuzhou City in secret

220
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:10,903
after Zhao Chong got into trouble.

221
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:13,032
I realized that one of
Zhao Chong's accomplices

222
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,193
was tailing him.

223
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,143
And, I reached Wenxiang Bordello
in the capital.

224
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:19,143
If so, have you found your sister?

225
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:20,983
Not yet.

226
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,193
I dare not enter Wenxiang Bordello
recklessly.

227
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:25,064
I had no choice but to look around.

228
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,184
But I haven't discovered
anything unusual yet.

229
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,863
Zhao Chong's accomplice,
whom you tailed,

230
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:33,344
did he appear again?

231
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,664
He did.

232
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,233
Several times,

233
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,552
I saw a person wearing a hat

234
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:41,833
entering and exiting Wenxiang Bordello.

235
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,833
He was always escorted.

236
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,593
He was wary and mysterious.

237
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:46,672
Zhao Chong's accomplice

238
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:47,983
was always one of them.

239
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:51,023
He didn't dare to show his true face.

240
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:52,313
That day,

241
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:53,912
all the yamen runners
who escorted Xu Wei

242
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:56,983
from the prison to the execution field
all vanished.

243
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,424
Xu Wei.

244
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:02,944
Do you suspect that it's...

245
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:05,143
I will get to the bottom of this.

246
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,184
Miss Man,

247
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,304
do not act recklessly.

248
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:09,544
Okay.

249
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,672
By the way, Miss Man,

250
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:14,464
which place are you
staying in the capital?

251
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,424
I'm staying in the inn for now.

252
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,073
You should move to
Baixiang Pavilion, then.

253
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:21,743
Miss Man excels at making chicken soup.

254
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:25,824
If so, why did you
pour it away back then?

255
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:26,873
I...

256
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:28,743
Were you guys enemies
before becoming friends too?

257
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:29,993
Yeah.

258
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:31,623
We were on bad terms with each other.

259
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:33,993
Fuman and I

260
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:35,623
were the same.

261
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:36,833
But it seems like

262
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,704
your story is much more interesting
than ours.

263
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:45,103
Wenxiang Bordello.

264
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,752
(Imperial Censorate)

265
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:49,170
Who are you?

266
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:50,820
- This is the Imperial Censorate!
- Official Zhou!

267
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:51,552
You cannot go inside!

268
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:52,899
- Official Zhou!
- You cannot go inside!

269
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,432
Let go of me!

270
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,512
Let go of me!

271
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:55,824
You cannot go inside!

272
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:57,824
Official Zhou! It's me!

273
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:00,704
It's me, Su Heng.

274
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,824
Let go of me!

275
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:04,353
Official Su,

276
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:05,552
do you know that intruding upon

277
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:06,983
the Imperial Censorate is a crime?

278
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:16,304
Yes, sir.

279
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,184
Lately,

280
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,424
I've been investigating
Duke Zhenguo Residence.

281
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,064
I realized

282
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,593
that someone transported goods into the
residence in the middle of the night.

283
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,750
After many days of investigation,

284
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:37,672
we finally confirmed

285
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:38,432
that these goods

286
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,023
were transported here from the dock.

287
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:42,912
I infiltrated the dock tonight.

288
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:44,152
I realized that the boxes

289
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:45,584
contained firearms.

290
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,983
And, all these boxes

291
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:51,464
were carved with
half of the word "Zhang."

292
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:58,704
Half of the word "Zhang?"

293
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:02,863
According to the institution,

294
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:03,672
Duke Zhenguo's guards

295
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,424
are allowed to possess firearms.

296
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,713
That doesn't prove anything.

297
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:08,023
This...

298
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:08,399
But,

299
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,473
does Duke Zhenguo Residence

300
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:10,713
need that many guards

301
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:12,424
and firearms?

302
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:14,584
Fine.

303
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,792
Even if these firearms

304
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,073
cannot be used as evidence,

305
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,073
what about Zhao Chong's

306
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:19,424
bloodied shirt?

307
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,833
It's too much of a coincidence.

308
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,912
At least we have reason to believe

309
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:26,503
that Eldest Princess
is the mastermind behind the case.

310
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,184
Official Zhou,

311
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:32,593
we can definitely make discoveries
if we search Duke Zhenguo Residence.

312
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:33,743
You know that too.

313
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,313
It's just suspicious.

314
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:36,113
A questionable point.

315
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,623
It's not a piece of evidence.

316
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:38,953
How can one

317
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:40,184
search Duke Zhenguo Residence

318
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,512
recklessly without

319
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:42,623
solid evidence?

320
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:46,983
There's one more thing.

321
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,383
Xu Wei is still alive.

322
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,383
How did you know?

323
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:59,143
Because you know that very well,
Official Zhou.

324
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,304
Official Zhou,

325
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,353
this case is a huge deal.

326
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,432
I hope you can tell me

327
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,544
all the clues you have.

328
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:12,432
Xu Wei

329
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,424
might still be in Wenxiang Bordello.

330
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,193
I'll keep guard over there myself.

331
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,064
If I can capture Xu Wei,

332
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:18,912
I should become

333
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,272
an important witness too.

334
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:21,193
It depends on

335
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:22,743
what he confesses.

336
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:27,944
By the way,

337
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,113
last night, Lu Shiyan

338
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,623
encountered a lady called Fuman.

339
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:35,313
I think they made acquaintances
in Wuzhou.

340
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,584
Zhen let her stay in Baixiang Pavilion.

341
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:39,584
Baixiang Pavilion?

342
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:44,143
Official Zhou,
you can launch an investigation

343
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:46,064
and see if there are other things

344
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,432
you don't need

345
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,143
in Wuzhou.

346
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,143
Lu Shiyan,

347
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:09,664
hope that you were really kept in the dark.

348
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:12,953
There was indeed a man

349
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:14,432
with a similar figure like Xu Wei

350
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,900
coming and going at Wenxiang Bordello.

351
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:17,584
Did you track down his whereabouts?

352
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:18,800
He was very wary.

353
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:20,272
We didn't dare to alert him
to our presence

354
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,313
and follow him too closely.

355
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:22,032
And,

356
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,233
he didn't appear often.

357
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,152
Therefore,

358
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,632
we still can't track him down.

359
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,032
Keep a close eye on Wenxiang Bordello.

360
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,512
If he appears again,

361
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:29,473
arrest him immediately.

362
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:30,304
Yes, sir.

363
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,593
(Make the country prosperous and stable)

364
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:35,432
Miss,

365
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,392
this isn't the way to our residence.

366
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:38,272
I'm taking this path

367
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:40,143
to see if I can encounter Lu Shiyan.

368
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,344
You're hopeless.

369
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,464
Mrs. Zhuang?

370
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,953
Miss Qin?

371
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:48,743
Let's go.

372
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,353
(Magistrate Office)

373
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,193
Mrs. Zhuang,

374
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,512
what are you doing here?

375
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:53,912
I always wanted to look for you guys.

376
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:55,392
But I didn't know
where you were staying.

377
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,903
That's why I was trying my luck
to see if I could meet you guys here.

378
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,272
Did something happen?

379
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,193
It's nothing.

380
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:01,873
Sun and I moved to the capital.

381
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:03,833
We opened a bun shop on Shili Street.

382
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,792
Luckily, we encountered you and Mr. Wei.

383
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:06,632
That's how we were able

384
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:07,953
to start a new life.

385
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,512
That's why we made some buns
for you guys as thanks.

386
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:11,912
I made them personally.

387
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:13,473
Hopefully, you guys will like it.

388
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:14,664
Of course we will.

389
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:17,193
Tell me

390
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:18,552
how you came to the capital.

391
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:19,432
Maybe next time.

392
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,152
I still need

393
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,544
to make some purchases today.

394
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:23,500
All right. I live at Baixiang Pavilion.

395
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,833
You can come and find me at any time.

396
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:25,593
And,

397
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:27,032
stop calling me Miss Qin.

398
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,473
Call me Miss Shen.

399
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,993
Okay, Miss Shen.

400
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,263
We can have our chat in the future.

401
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,143
Be careful, okay?

402
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,752
They've been through so much together.

403
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:42,752
They can finally

404
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,103
start a new life together.

405
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:46,584
Let's go home.

406
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,544
Why are you learning this?

407
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:12,863
Stop learning.

408
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:17,432
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

409
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,664
How long have you been here?

410
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,983
Just now, I saw that you were...

411
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,392
My reputation is ruined.

412
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:26,032
What's the matter?

413
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,023
Eldest Princess has arrived!

414
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,263
You saw nothing just now.

415
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:39,824
Be careful.

416
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:42,503
Are you okay?

417
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:44,503
Thank you, Official Lu.

418
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,184
Greetings, Eldest Princess.

419
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:51,464
You must be exhausted.

420
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,944
You should take a break.

421
00:16:58,633 --> 00:16:59,544
Mother.

422
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:01,383
You're finally willing to come back.

423
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:04,343
Mother.

424
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,704
Are you the heir of Duke Zhenguo?

425
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,224
Do you two know each other?

426
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:13,952
We only met each other once.

427
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:15,392
Before this, I didn't know

428
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:16,743
he was the heir of Duke Zhenguo.

429
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,023
Greetings, my lord. I'm Yiqing.

430
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:24,503
Greetings, Miss Xu.

431
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,983
Seems like you two
have an affinity with each other.

432
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,543
Mother, why did you summon me back?

433
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:38,632
You didn't want to come back.

434
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,904
I have no choice but to summon you.

435
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,873
Our residence

436
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:44,113
is cold and obsolete.

437
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:45,833
It's running out of vitality.

438
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,952
Luckily, Her Majesty was understanding.

439
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:48,952
She arranged for Yiqing

440
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:50,793
to stay in our residence
for the time being.

441
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:52,624
At least she's here to keep me company.

442
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:58,184
What do you think about Yiqing?

443
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,063
You mean Miss Xu?

444
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,353
Miss Xu is pretty nice.

445
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:02,553
She's brave, decisive,

446
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:03,624
and kind.

447
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:04,992
Mother, I'm sure you'll be happy

448
00:18:04,993 --> 00:18:06,583
now that she's keeping you company.

449
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,232
Even you're full of praise for her.

450
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:10,033
Seems like

451
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,263
my taste is quite good.

452
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,743
Eldest Princess,

453
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:20,232
I already learned how to make fragrances
as per your request.

454
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,113
Please take a look.

455
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,583
Good.

456
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:32,593
Yiqing, you're intelligent indeed.

457
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:33,944
It's her first time.

458
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:35,793
She did such a great job

459
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:37,823
even though it was her first time.

460
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:43,104
Yan was praising you just now.

461
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:49,664
It's a shame

462
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,303
that Yiqing has to leave eventually.

463
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:56,944
What about this?

464
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:01,313
You two can know each other better
in private.

465
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,632
Yiqing can even marry into our residence
if fate is willing.

466
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:07,063
Wouldn't that be great?

467
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:11,833
Mother,

468
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,313
such a thought has never occurred to me.

469
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:14,793
Stop it right now.

470
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:17,232
You'll ruin her reputation.

471
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,392
Weren't you saying

472
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,184
that Yiqing was a good lady?

473
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:23,553
A fine lady like Yiqing

474
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,113
is dashing, charming,

475
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,712
and generous.

476
00:19:26,713 --> 00:19:28,033
Everyone loves to marry

477
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,033
a lady like her.

478
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,864
I already have someone I fancy.

479
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:34,712
Who is it?

480
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:35,513
Mother,

481
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:37,113
I'll bring her here some other day.

482
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:39,192
Mother, if you summoned me back

483
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:40,464
just for this matter,

484
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,712
I think I'll proceed with
official matters.

485
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:44,184
Mother, take care.

486
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:45,464
Farewell.

487
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,073
I'm not done yet.

488
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:48,424
Come back.

489
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,704
Yiqing, I'm sorry about this.

490
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,033
I wouldn't have mentioned that

491
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,632
in front of you

492
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,263
had I known

493
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:02,823
about Yan's attitude.

494
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:06,543
Here, have some water.

495
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:12,392
Eldest Princess, that's fine.

496
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:13,690
You don't need to take it to heart.

497
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,113
You're actually this magnanimous

498
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,144
when you're this young.

499
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:21,033
I'm getting fonder and fonder of you.

500
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,664
Eldest Princess,

501
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,912
are you fond of me because of
my father's military strength?

502
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,704
Or are you fond of me
because of my personality?

503
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:33,353
Of course I'm fond of your personality

504
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:34,983
and character.

505
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:38,543
If so, Eldest Princess,
let me tell you what I think.

506
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,303
I have no interest in the heir.

507
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:45,392
Although the Xu family
possesses strong military strength,

508
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:48,104
we have no one to back us
in the imperial court.

509
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:50,712
Our military strength

510
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:52,384
is a double-edged sword for us.

511
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:53,873
If my marriage

512
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:54,833
can help the Xu family

513
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,104
to find a backer,

514
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:57,823
I'll gladly accept the result

515
00:20:57,874 --> 00:21:00,983
no matter who I need to get married to.

516
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:10,184
You're indeed the daughter-in-law
of my choice.

517
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:11,583
Don't worry.

518
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,313
Although Yan

519
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,593
is cold on the surface,

520
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:16,833
I promise you

521
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:17,753
that he's someone

522
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,313
you can entrust your life to.

523
00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:20,823
However,

524
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,632
if he already has someone he fancies,

525
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:23,912
the marriage

526
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,192
will start with a grudge.

527
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:26,353
If so, how can this make sure

528
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:27,904
the Xu family
has someone to depend on?

529
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,864
It's all my fault

530
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:31,873
for mentioning this matter
out of the blue today.

531
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,992
Yan might have said that

532
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,873
out of spite.

533
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,743
Don't take it to heart.

534
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:39,624
Have some water.

535
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:41,472
I'll discuss it with him again

536
00:21:41,473 --> 00:21:43,583
when there's a chance.

537
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:52,503
My lord,

538
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:54,664
you must hang in there.

539
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,392
(Baixiang Pavilion)

540
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:00,303
Qingli.

541
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:02,200
Madam, you're back.

542
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,152
These are the sandalwood
and agarwood I just purchased.

543
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:04,950
Keep them away for me.

544
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:05,704
All right.

545
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:07,464
Madam,

546
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:08,983
Official Zhou is here.

547
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,583
Where is he?

548
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:16,783
If he asks about me,

549
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:18,543
tell him that I haven't returned.

550
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:19,543
Madam,

551
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,992
he's not here to look for you.

552
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:22,624
He said he was here
to look for Miss Man.

553
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:24,303
Do you mean Fuman,

554
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:26,513
the lady whom Zhen brought back?

555
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:27,224
That's right.

556
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:36,593
Are you Miss Fuman?

557
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:37,624
I am.

558
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:40,184
You are?

559
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,873
I'm Zhou Shu'an,
the Vice Censor-in-chief.

560
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:44,543
Official Zhou,

561
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,232
what do you need from me?

562
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,263
Don't be nervous.

563
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:49,144
I just have some questions for you.

564
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:50,353
Please ask away.

565
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:51,553
Did you make acquaintances

566
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:53,184
with Official Lu

567
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:55,063
and Miss Shen in Wuzhou?

568
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,273
That's right.

569
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,753
Can you tell me

570
00:22:57,754 --> 00:22:58,823
about the entire process?

571
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,073
The entire process?

572
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:02,632
Official Lu knows what happened.

573
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,823
Official Lu is from
the Magistrate Office.

574
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:06,783
I'm from the Imperial Censorate.

575
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:08,513
He's an official.

576
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,113
You're an official too.

577
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:11,353
Why didn't you ask him directly

578
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,100
when you had questions?

579
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,543
The way we investigate cases
is different.

580
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,700
Therefore, the things
we pay attention to are different.

581
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:17,904
Miss Fuman,

582
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:20,743
I have the authority to bring you
to the Imperial Censorate and interrogate you.

583
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:27,583
Official Zhou,

584
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,503
please come inside.

585
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:34,823
Be careful.

586
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:41,864
Are you okay?

587
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,023
I'm fine.

588
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:47,944
Thank you.

589
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:04,944
Madam Shen,

590
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:07,063
why are you doing your own laundry?

591
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:07,873
All ladies

592
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:09,343
do their own laundry.

593
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,432
You did such a great job.

594
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,424
Let me dry it for you.

595
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:13,833
Your hands are dirty.

596
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,464
I just washed them, you know?

597
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:29,983
Just leave it there.

598
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:31,104
No, I won't.

599
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,472
Official Zhou,
you do like to help people out, huh?

600
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,303
I'm helping myself out here.

601
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,783
I came here to ask her some questions.

602
00:24:39,554 --> 00:24:40,833
Fuman and Official Lu

603
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:42,583
made acquaintances in Wuzhou.

604
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:45,624
It turns out that Fuman possesses
knowledge about medicine

605
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:46,992
and poison.

606
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,033
You don't need to tell me

607
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:49,624
about your work affairs.

608
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:57,472
But didn't Official Lu tell you everything

609
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:58,712
that happened in Wuzhou?

610
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:00,624
I was afraid that he might have
left something out.

611
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,384
I'm done.

612
00:25:13,953 --> 00:25:15,063
You're done?

613
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,912
Thank you, Official Zhou.

614
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:19,263
You may proceed with your stuff.

615
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:31,224
It's lunchtime.

616
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:43,224
Let's go, then.

617
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:45,303
I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

618
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,543
All right.

619
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:54,944
What?

620
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:56,753
You said Eldest Princess

621
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:58,664
wanted you to marry Miss Xu?

622
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:02,593
I will never marry her.

623
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,303
I already have someone I fancy.

624
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,432
But to her,

625
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,864
I might be inferior to Miss Xu.

626
00:26:08,953 --> 00:26:10,912
Miss Xu is straightforward, carefree,

627
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:12,303
and unrestrained.

628
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:14,704
She has the marks of a heroine.

629
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:17,152
I admire ladies like her.

630
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:18,793
I'm the one you're getting married to,

631
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,583
not my mother.

632
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:21,904
Besides,

633
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:22,992
did you forget

634
00:26:22,993 --> 00:26:24,743
the things we went through together?

635
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:28,033
You identified the fragrances,
found clues,

636
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:30,192
and solved the case
with your drawing skills.

637
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:31,192
All of those

638
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:32,944
were your talents.

639
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:34,593
Everyone

640
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:35,833
has their own flaws

641
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:36,833
and strengths.

642
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,553
If we have to compare our flaws

643
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:40,353
to the strengths of other people,

644
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:42,392
it'll be tough to survive.

645
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,224
Am I right?

646
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,664
But your mother

647
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:51,503
has a bad impression of me.

648
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:54,783
Why don't we go and see her?

649
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:59,152
She'll know how good you are

650
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,983
when she sees you.

651
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,184
You won't be able

652
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,023
to change her mind without seeing her.

653
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:05,224
I believe

654
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:07,543
that she'll definitely like you too.

655
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:09,104
Okay.

656
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:10,392
I, Shen Zhen,

657
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:11,944
am not timid either.

658
00:27:12,274 --> 00:27:14,384
I'll definitely
make your mother satisfied.

659
00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:17,343
Even if everyone objects to
our relationship,

660
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,539
I will never let you go.

661
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,199
♪I'm willing to endure hardships♪

662
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,199

Qingli.

668
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,184
Miss Xu.

669
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,543
I'm looking for Miss Man.

670
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:58,952
She went out just now.

671
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:00,472
You can tell me what you need.

672
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:01,743
I'll relay the message to her.

673
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:02,632
It's nothing.

674
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,033
I just wish to chat with her.

675
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:05,023
Qingli,

676
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:06,432
come and help me out.

677
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:07,343
All right.

678
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:08,513
Miss Xu.

679
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:09,864
I'll proceed with my work first.

680
00:28:19,274 --> 00:28:20,232
It's you again?

681
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,224
You took the words out of my mouth.

682
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:24,672
I'm in a bad mood today.

683
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:25,672
I have no time for you.

684
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:26,503
Get out of the way.

685
00:28:27,193 --> 00:28:29,472
I'm the one in a bad mood here.

686
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:30,952
You should get out of the way.

687
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:32,593
How dare a loser like you

688
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,313
dare to provoke me?

689
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:35,033
That day,

690
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:36,249
I went easy on you

691
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,823
as I was afraid
that I might destroy the shop.

692
00:28:37,874 --> 00:28:39,152
If not,

693
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:41,144
I would never lose to a person like you.

694
00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:43,833
A loss is a loss.

695
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:44,992
There's no need to find excuses.

696
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:47,632
I know how capable you are
once I feel you out.

697
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:48,999
How dare you still try to be arrogant?

698
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:51,384
Loser.

699
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,392
Fight me again if you dare.

700
00:28:56,393 --> 00:28:57,873
Sure.
I need to vent my frustrations too.

701
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:58,904
Bring it on.

702
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:54,273
You played dirty!

703
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:55,904
All is fair in war.

704
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:57,823
Do you yield or not?

705
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,303
I do!

706
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:12,503
I will never yield to that!

707
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:15,192
Enough. I'm exhausted.

708
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:16,424
I quit.

709
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:26,303
I didn't expect you

710
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:27,864
to be this good.

711
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,224
You're pretty good yourself.

712
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:31,263
It's just that
you're a tad bit weaker than me.

713
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,152
But it feels pretty good

714
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:36,864
to spar like that.

715
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:38,023
Seems like

716
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:39,664
you're pretty useful.

717
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:42,432
I'm more useful than you think.

718
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:43,600
In the future,
you may look for me

719
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:46,152
no matter what kind of sparring
you wish to hold.

720
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:48,224
I will spar with you anytime.

721
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,464
Days like these are fun indeed.

722
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:53,864
However,

723
00:30:54,473 --> 00:30:55,783
I don't think it'll last.

724
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:57,023
What's the matter?

725
00:30:57,713 --> 00:30:58,793
Are you going to leave?

726
00:30:58,794 --> 00:31:00,303
If only I could leave.

727
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:02,353
I'm just afraid that I could
never leave this place.

728
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:04,503
I'm stuck within this residence.

729
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:08,023
The heiress of Duke Zhenguo Residence?

730
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:10,624
Who cares about that?

731
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,063
Duke Zhenguo Residence?

732
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:15,513
Are you getting married to Lu Shiyan?

733
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:18,424
To put it more accurately, it's a
marriage alliance between two families.

734
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,104
If so,

735
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:23,543
why should they form a marriage alliance
with your family?

736
00:31:23,993 --> 00:31:24,873
My father is Xu Binghui,

737
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:26,912
the Jibei Chariot General.

738
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:28,704
You can figure that out yourself.

739
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,113
So, you're the Military Beau

740
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:32,543
from the Xu Family Camp.

741
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,353
My father is Su Rui,
the Jizhou Cavalry General.

742
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,184
Seems like we have an affinity
with each other.

743
00:31:38,874 --> 00:31:39,672
So,

744
00:31:39,673 --> 00:31:40,513
you're the mighty

745
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:41,704
Official Su?

746
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,632
A pleasure to meet you.

747
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:43,600
A pleasure to meet you too.

748
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,023
However,

749
00:31:46,193 --> 00:31:48,023
it feels like

750
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:49,873
you're not happy about
getting married to Lu Shiyan.

751
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,073
It doesn't matter what I think,

752
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:52,783
and it doesn't matter
whom I get married to.

753
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:54,313
Don't tell me you think

754
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,303
that people of our status

755
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:58,384
have the right to choose?

756
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:00,263
Now,

757
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:02,033
I'm enjoying my days

758
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:03,783
as a last attempt to enjoy my freedom.

759
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,343
At least I won't have any regrets.

760
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:08,073
I'll cross the bridge

761
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:09,664
when I come to it.

762
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:16,184
Now, I'm not worried about myself.

763
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:18,833
Mainly, it's Official Lu and Miss Shen.

764
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,353
They're in love with each other.

765
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:21,712
Why should I

766
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:22,753
separate

767
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:24,023
a loving couple like them?

768
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:25,952
From where could you tell

769
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:27,313
that they were in love?

770
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:28,632
How are they a loving couple?

771
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:29,952
How are they

772
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:30,952
suitable for each other?

773
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:32,392
Miss Shen is intelligent, witty,

774
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:33,593
and understanding.

775
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:35,753
Official Lu is soft-spoken, elegant,
and polite.

776
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,600
She's a fine lady while he's a gentleman.

777
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,273
It's obvious that they're perfect
for each other.

778
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:40,192
Don't say something

779
00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:41,353
as biased as that

780
00:32:41,354 --> 00:32:42,873
after stepping into
Duke Zhenguo Residence.

781
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:45,232
You're just trying to shield yourself
from seeing the truth.

782
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,553
I'm clearly intelligent

783
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:47,704
and I know what's going on.

784
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:48,833
To think

785
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,503
that I thought we were
birds of a feather.

786
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:51,992
Talking to you is a waste of time.

787
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:52,983
I'll make a move first.

788
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:57,152
Stop deceiving yourself.

789
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,353
They're perfect for each other

790
00:32:58,354 --> 00:32:59,864
no matter how you see it.

791
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:03,823
What?

792
00:33:05,514 --> 00:33:07,983
Eldest Princess is forming
a marriage alliance with General Xu?

793
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:10,144
Where did you hear that from?

794
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,192
Today,

795
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:12,353
I met Miss Xu by accident

796
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:13,632
when I was looking for Miss Shen.

797
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:14,400
She told me personally

798
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:16,593
that Eldest Princess wanted to form
a marriage alliance with them.

799
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,464
Official Zhou,

800
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:19,392
when we were interrogating Li Ji,

801
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:20,313
he also mentioned

802
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:22,113
that some of the cash flow
went to Jizhou.

803
00:33:22,114 --> 00:33:24,232
If we include the firearms we found
several days ago,

804
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,273
maybe Eldest Princess

805
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:27,100
is trying to acquire
the Xu family's military power.

806
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:30,263
Military power?

807
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:32,823
Official Zhou, I assume
you know how serious

808
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:35,543
this issue is.

809
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:39,464
Understood.

810
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,672
I will run through the leads,
organize the evidence,

811
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:43,624
and report it to His Majesty
as soon as possible.

812
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:44,664
There's one more thing.

813
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:45,353
I sent my men

814
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:46,664
to keep an eye on Wenxiang Bordello.

815
00:33:47,274 --> 00:33:48,232
Now, it looks like

816
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,063
Xu Wei is our only witness.

817
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:52,303
We have to get him in any way possible.

818
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,033
Sister, the fabric you chose

819
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:03,303
is truly to my liking.

820
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,624
Your Majesty, as long as you like it.

821
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:10,432
Has Yiqing been obedient
in your residence?

822
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,592
Did she trouble you?

823
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:12,673
Not at all.

824
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:14,912
She's obedient and intelligent.

825
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:17,024
I like her so much.

826
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:17,952
I'm glad to hear that.

827
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:18,823
Come.

828
00:34:21,314 --> 00:34:23,263
Has she already met Shiyan?

829
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,024
She has, but...

830
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:28,943
What's the matter?

831
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:31,032
That son of mine

832
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:33,303
doesn't intend to marry her at all.

833
00:34:34,513 --> 00:34:36,673
He's still young and ignorant.

834
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,263
Just let nature take its course.

835
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:39,793
How is he young?

836
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:41,072
Guys at his age

837
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:43,233
already have kids by now.

838
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:44,064
If so,

839
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:46,512
you should be more insistent about it
and try to convince him.

840
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:49,313
Maybe he'll accept it.

841
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:50,512
What if he refuses to do so?

842
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:51,833
You're doing it for his own good.

843
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,750
It's better than letting him
regret his decision.

844
00:34:54,794 --> 00:34:55,783
Mother.

845
00:34:58,393 --> 00:34:59,263
Mother.

846
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:02,263
Greetings, Aunt.

847
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:03,633
It's been a long time.

848
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,353
But now, Sixth Prince does look like

849
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,144
he has the air of His Majesty himself.

850
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,024
Sister, you're such a jokester.

851
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:10,912
He's still a child after all.

852
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:11,753
Mother,

853
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:13,392
you're underestimating me, then.

854
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:15,392
Father even praised me today.

855
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:16,624
Is that so?

856
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:18,263
Tell us about it.

857
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:19,700
During today's
horseback archery session,

858
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,992
I almost defeated my brother.

859
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:22,753
Father said

860
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:23,952
I had great potential.

861
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:25,153
Father even said

862
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:27,753
that if I were the same age
as the crown prince,

863
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:28,873
he might not be

864
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,353
the winner today.

865
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:31,673
Do not spout nonsense.

866
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:33,153
You would never defeat the crown prince.

867
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:35,104
Return to your room
and do your homework.

868
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,823
Why were you so fierce to him?

869
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,952
Isn't it great for him to be capable?

870
00:35:47,953 --> 00:35:49,273
Maybe he'll be

871
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,392
a great aid

872
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:52,064
to the crown prince in the future.

873
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,912
I would rather he be an ordinary boy

874
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:57,833
so that he could be a carefree lord

875
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,950
and not involve himself
in the imperial power struggle.

876
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:01,912
Power and status

877
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,144
will consume us eventually.

878
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:06,544
Sister,

879
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:07,753
you grew up

880
00:36:07,754 --> 00:36:09,313
in the palace.

881
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:10,753
I'm sure you know this better

882
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:11,704
than me.

883
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:15,984
Although you're right,

884
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:17,392
you can't just expect

885
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:19,584
everyone to be ordinary, right?

886
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:20,512
Someone has to stand

887
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,463
at the forefront, am I right?

888
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,423
I'm fine with that

889
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,184
as long as it isn't my son.

890
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:29,992
Enough.

891
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:32,104
Let's not talk about
such worrisome topics.

892
00:36:32,113 --> 00:36:33,273
Eunuch Lou,

893
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,024
bring the jade bangle
I obtained not long ago here.

894
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:38,992
You spent

895
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,912
a lot of time to pick out
the fabric for me.

896
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:42,504
It must've been tough on you.

897
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:43,392
Today,

898
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:45,783
I have to gift you
an excellent jade bangle.

899
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,343
Here. Take a look.

900
00:36:57,473 --> 00:36:59,704
Look at the shining jade.

901
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:01,664
I'm sure it's very expensive.

902
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,072
Seems like

903
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:04,713
I have to purchase a few more batches

904
00:37:04,714 --> 00:37:05,823
of fabric for you.

905
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:08,263
We're a family.
There's no need to be this courteous.

906
00:37:08,314 --> 00:37:10,472
I'm just giving you a gift
that I received from someone else.

907
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,472
The crown prince gifted this to me.

908
00:37:12,473 --> 00:37:14,104
The crown prince?

909
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,343
If so, I have to keep it properly.

910
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,400
(Duke Zhenguo Residence)

911
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
(Duke Zhenguo Residence)

912
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:48,624
What is Zhen doing there?

913
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:55,783
Are you nervous?

914
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:58,704
I'm not.

915
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,750
You shouldn't hide it

916
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:04,823
when you've prepared such
a thoughtful gift for my mother.

917
00:38:05,113 --> 00:38:06,392
I have to let my mother know

918
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:07,552
how much effort

919
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,303
you've spent on her son.

920
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:14,903
Let's go.

921
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:20,184
Lu Shiyan,

922
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,624
I'll definitely reveal your true colors.

923
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,504
Eldest Princess,

924
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:27,943
these are the invoices for the fabrics
that we intend to purchase.

925
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:32,600
Do not send the fabrics

926
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,193
into the palace directly
after purchasing them.

927
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:35,353
Send them here

928
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,713
so that I can check the quality.

929
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:37,584
Yes, Your Highness.

930
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,863
Keep the seal away.

931
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:44,303
I shall take my leave.

932
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:53,064
Greetings, my lord.

933
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:54,104
Housekeeper Zhao.

934
00:38:57,913 --> 00:38:59,072
This is something new.

935
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:00,900
You came back of your own accord
for the first time.

936
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:02,224
Mother.

937
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:06,624
Mother,

938
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:09,303
this is Zhen.

939
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,064
She's here to visit you today.

940
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:13,833
Greetings, Eldest Princess.

941
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,383
Greetings, Miss Xu.

942
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:17,224
What are you doing here?

943
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:20,072
So, you two know each other too?

944
00:39:20,073 --> 00:39:21,100
Fate led us to each other,

945
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:22,592
and we had an affinity
with each other too.

946
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,793
Miss Shen's ability to draw and write

947
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:26,584
is very impressive.

948
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:31,713
Eldest Princess,

949
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:33,392
I'm not done with my embroidery yet.

950
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:34,793
I'll return to my room first.

951
00:39:34,794 --> 00:39:35,783
Go ahead.

952
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:41,263
Mother,

953
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:43,383
I brought Zhen here
to visit you for two reasons.

954
00:39:43,393 --> 00:39:45,032
First, I'm here to clarify

955
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:45,833
the misunderstanding

956
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,432
we had in Cheng Garden.

957
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:48,353
Back then,

958
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:50,100
I was still investigating
the West Canal Case.

959
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:51,313
I pretended to be a wealthy merchant

960
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:52,704
in Wuzhou for the case investigation.

961
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:55,000
In order to clear her father's name,

962
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,153
Shen Zhen

963
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:58,273
pretended to be my concubine
of her own accord

964
00:39:58,274 --> 00:39:59,544
and joined me in my investigation.

965
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:02,144
Back then, it was just an act.

966
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:04,544
But you saw it by coincidence.

967
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,144
I was indeed reckless

968
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:08,783
when I was in Cheng Garden back then.

969
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,584
Eldest Princess, I must've offended you.

970
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:12,544
Please forgive me.

971
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:14,383
This is a token of apology.

972
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:16,224
I hope you will like it.

973
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:24,704
Show it to me.

974
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,064
It's pretty exquisite.

975
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:33,184
So, it was a misunderstanding.

976
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:36,664
I would've forgotten about it
had you not mentioned it.

977
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:39,743
I told you already.
There's no need to worry.

978
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,193
That was the first reason, right?

979
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,753
What's the second reason, then?

980
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:47,432
Secondly, it's...

981
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:48,303
My lord.

982
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,064
Greetings, Eldest Princess.

983
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:53,504
Xu Wei has appeared.

984
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,743
Seems like you have official matters
to deal with.

985
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,273
You may go ahead.

986
00:40:59,274 --> 00:41:01,263
I'll have a chat with Miss Shen.

987
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:03,863
If so, Mother,

988
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:05,633
please take care of Shen Zhen.

989
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:07,064
I'll be back soon.

990
00:41:09,314 --> 00:41:10,263
Zhen,

991
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:12,184
have a chat with Mother.

992
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:14,303
You're the best.

993
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:15,713
Go now.

994
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:17,072
Official matters are more important.

995
00:41:17,073 --> 00:41:18,504
You should go.

996
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:21,064
Let's go.

997
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:25,743
Miss Shen.

998
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,144
Yes, Eldest Princess.

999
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:28,992
Yan brought you here

1000
00:41:28,993 --> 00:41:30,032
to see me

1001
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:32,463
to express his intention.

1002
00:41:32,913 --> 00:41:35,783
That means both of you have decided

1003
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:38,423
to be together
for the rest of your lives, huh?

1004
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:41,943
Official Lu and I truly love each other.

1005
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:42,432
We...

1006
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,184
So what?

1007
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:46,313
Yan

1008
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:48,753
is the heir of Duke Zhenguo Residence.

1009
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:49,984
Why do you think

1010
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:51,552
he'll marry

1011
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,544
the daughter of a criminal?

1012
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:55,472
My father isn't a criminal.

1013
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:56,992
Official Lu has proven

1014
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:58,233
that my father was framed

1015
00:41:58,234 --> 00:42:00,024
in the West Canal Case.

1016
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:01,743
I heard

1017
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:02,552
that you were treated

1018
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,823
as a suspect who murdered someone

1019
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:06,624
and was imprisoned.

1020
00:42:07,113 --> 00:42:08,592
Yan almost lost his life

1021
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,584
because of you too.

1022
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,432
The way you do things

1023
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,184
is reckless and impulsive.

1024
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,992
Do you always put him at risks

1025
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:16,673
because of

1026
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:18,432
your so-called "true love?"

1027
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:19,823
That's not true.

1028
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,793
The Shen family

1029
00:42:28,794 --> 00:42:30,463
are commoners now.

1030
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,544
What makes you think

1031
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:34,193
that you're good enough

1032
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:36,423
for the heir of Duke Zhenguo?

1033
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:40,104
I admit.

1034
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,903
Everyone is envious of

1035
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:47,024
people who are born
in the imperial family.

1036
00:42:47,073 --> 00:42:48,463
However, they have no idea

1037
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:50,833
that living with power

1038
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,704
is a double-edged sword.

1039
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:55,984
Therefore, Yan's future wife

1040
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:59,153
must be and only will be

1041
00:42:59,154 --> 00:42:59,952
the noble daughter of

1042
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:01,992
a powerful

1043
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:03,903
and strong family.

1044
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:05,633
Only then, he'll be able

1045
00:43:05,634 --> 00:43:07,704
to have a great future.

1046
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,624
You have nothing.

1047
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:13,584
Your so-called "true love,"

1048
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:17,112
how will it

1049
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:19,504
benefit him in any way?

1050
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:21,233
No matter if we're nobles

1051
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:22,704
or commoners,

1052
00:43:22,993 --> 00:43:25,423
there's no way one can
lead a stable life

1053
00:43:25,553 --> 00:43:28,224
without ups and downs.

1054
00:43:28,354 --> 00:43:29,952
People might complicate issues

1055
00:43:29,953 --> 00:43:32,112
due to their personal interest

1056
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:34,024
when it comes to benefits.

1057
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:36,343
Eldest Princess,

1058
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,664
do you truly think
you can retain a stable position

1059
00:43:40,314 --> 00:43:42,863
by depending on a powerful family

1060
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:44,863
with great status?

1061
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:46,833
In my opinion,

1062
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:48,952
people will only stay together
without leaving each other

1063
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:51,383
if they truly love each other.

1064
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:53,863
If you act on your own initiative

1065
00:43:53,913 --> 00:43:55,783
and make him marry
the candidate you choose for him,

1066
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:57,392
do you think

1067
00:43:57,393 --> 00:43:59,104
he'll truly be happy?

1068
00:43:59,274 --> 00:44:00,584
Such audacity!

1069
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,463
I was rude

1070
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:05,024
for coming here today.

1071
00:44:05,674 --> 00:44:06,783
Farewell.

1072
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,263
She does have a feisty personality.

1073
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
(Duke Zhenguo Residence)

1074
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:30,544
Official Su,

1075
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,383
Xu Wei has entered Wenxiang Bordello.

1076
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:35,713
I'll head there.

1077
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,463
Notify Official Zhou immediately.

1078
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:38,184
All right.

1079
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:03,664
Miss Shen, please wait.

1080
00:45:06,113 --> 00:45:08,383
Eldest Princess is inviting you
to the residence again.

1081
00:45:21,154 --> 00:45:22,153
Lu Shiyan?

1082
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:23,504
Stop him!

1083
00:45:46,073 --> 00:45:47,423
Help!

1084
00:46:11,553 --> 00:46:12,624
(Duke Zhenguo Residence)
I knew it!

1085
00:46:37,113 --> 00:46:39,024
Xu Wei, let go of her!

1086
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:40,300
- Let go of her!
- Lu Shiyan!

1087
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:42,903
You better play nice.

1088
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:44,783
