=Episode 1=

3
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,730
(Who are you?)

4
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,639
Official Lu, we're in trouble.

5
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,650
His Majesty is summoning you
for an urgent request.

6
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,910
(Yong'an City)

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,590
(Baixiang Pavilion)
Clean this up.

8
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,279
All right. Move it over there.

9
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,679
Okay.

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,519
Two liang, two qian and three fen.

11
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,839
Qingli, arrange the fragrances
according to their concentration.

12
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,598
Don't get them wrong.

13
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,870
Got it, Miss.

14
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,359
Qingxi, mind your safety, okay?

15
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,119
Don't worry, Miss.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,109
Just leave it to me.

17
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,870
- Miss.
- Miss.

18
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,119
Take good care of these fragrances.

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,239
Don't let them get damp.

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,590
- Understood.
- Understood.

21
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,478
Sister, you're already married.

22
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,000
Why are you still trying to open a shop?

23
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,500
I still need to make a living
after getting married, you know?

24
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,430
Wasn't Brother-in-law nice to you?

25
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,700
It's better not to
depend on anyone else.

26
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,918
That's precisely because

27
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,199
I need to work hard.

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,638
Why do you still have to depend
on yourself after getting married?

29
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,799
What should I do, then?

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,430
I don't know anything.

31
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,150
Silly girl, you have me.

32
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,758
I knew it.

33
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,310
Sister, you dote on me the most.

34
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,669
Is that...

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,598
This sandalwood incense

36
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,399
will be delivered to
Earl Suning Residence later.

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,239
Aunt prepared this

38
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,870
especially for Uncle.

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,478
Hurry and go now.

40
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,198
I thought

41
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,718
it was my birthday gift.

42
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,870
(Don't tell me they forgot about it?)

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,119
The moon sets at the second watch,
the night grows darker.

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,590
The silent drizzle might make you slip.

45
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,710
The guest is unaware of his identity
in a dream.

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,829
Waking up, he realizes
that he's the person in the dream.

47
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,870
(Minister Office)

48
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,749
Father.

49
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,318
You're still awake at this late hour?

50
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,039
Father, you should be the one sleeping.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,150
You've been working tirelessly

52
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,838
to manage the West Canal
for the past two years.

53
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,590
Now that you've finally retired,

54
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,189
what are you up to again?

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,119
Right now,

56
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,789
I'm doing something

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,590
very important.

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,350
Do you know what this is?

59
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,470
This is a heater.

60
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,799
A heater?

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,669
That's right.

62
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,510
It's so tiny.

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,039
Last time, when I went to
Minister Chen's Residence,

64
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,278
this was installed in

65
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,438
one of their rooms.

66
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,350
And, the floor was warm.

67
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,838
But I think

68
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,989
I can improve upon the design.

69
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,278
That's why I wanted to study it.

70
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,198
By then, I'll make you the best heater I can.

71
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,239
Father,

72
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,270
how are you so good at making things?

73
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,198
You make everything in the house

74
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,030
by yourself.

75
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,719
It's the same for Sister.

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,950
She's capable too.

77
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,309
She already owns eight shops.

78
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,309
But how come I don't know
how to do anything?

79
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,270
Did I take after Mother?

80
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,510
Your mother was an intelligent woman.

81
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,470
If only Mother was still here.

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,710
Zhen,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,078
although your mother passed away
at an early age,

84
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,119
your sister and I

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,239
are still around.

86
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,559
You just need to stay happy every day

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,479
and infect our house

88
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,150
with your jovial attitude.

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,590
If so, Father,

90
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,629
do you have anything to do tomorrow?

91
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,749
Tomorrow?

92
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,799
I don't have anything to do tomorrow.

93
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,189
I'll continue to study this heater.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,189
I think someone is celebrating
her birthday tomorrow.

95
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,398
Father, you still remember my birthday?

96
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,958
Of course.

97
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,119
Zhen, how could I forget about

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,479
your birthday?

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,078
That was your sister's idea.

100
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,838
She said

101
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,919
she wanted to give you a surprise.

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,309
What surprise?

103
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,039
Search the place!

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,390
(Minister Office)

105
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,949
You guys!
This is the Minister Office!

106
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,990
Do not speak! This is an investigation!
Don't move!

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,239
Who are you guys?

108
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,438
- Get out of the way!
- What are you guys doing?

109
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,838
- This is an investigation!
- What are you doing?

110
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,749
Get out of the way!

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,070
Official Lu, what are you guys doing?

112
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,599
The West Canal collapsed today.

113
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,095
There was a breach in the embankment,
and calamity befell the capital.

114
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,479
According to His Majesty's oral order,

115
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,638
the Magistrate Office is to
seal off the Minister's Residence

116
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,838
and detain Minister Shen Wenqi

117
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,198
for further interrogation.

118
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,189
The West Canal collapsed?

119
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,429
No. How is that possible?

120
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,838
I drew the construction plan
of the West Canal myself.

121
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,078
How could such a disaster happen

122
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,679
only after a few days of rain?

123
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,758
This doesn't make sense at all.

124
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,719
I wish to find out the cause

125
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,518
before the situation worsens.

126
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,198
Official Lu, please give me some time.

127
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,420
Area within 100 li of West Canal
has already been flooded.

128
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,599
Minister Shen, it's too late

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,590
for you to investigate the case.

130
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,198
Area within 100 li of West Canal
was flooded?

131
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,229
If so, the people must...

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,278
No, I have to take a look.

133
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,398
I have to take a look myself.

134
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,499
- Father! What are you guys doing?
- I have to take a look myself!

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,579
He's resisting imperial order.

136
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,930
According to the law,
he will receive additional punishment.

137
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,078
My father barely came home
for the past two years

138
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,869
all because he was
managing the West Canal.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,679
He just can't

140
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,919
accept the sudden fact.

141
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,679
Official Lu, why are you forcing him?

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,758
I'm just abiding by the law.
How am I forcing him?

143
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,039
Say no more.

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,989
We'll know the cause
after the interrogation.

145
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,318
Father!

146
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,758
Zhen!

147
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,438
Let go of him!

148
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,999
Let go of my father!

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,758
Official Lu, let go of my father!

150
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,869
Yang Zong.

151
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,398
Father!

152
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,638
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

153
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,390
I'm sure there's nothing wrong
with my construction plan.

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,198
Official Lu will definitely
get to the bottom of this.

155
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,239
By then,

156
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,479
I'll be released.

157
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,318
Take him away.

158
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,270
Take him away!

159
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,800
Zhen!

160
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:06,999
- Father!
- Don't worry about me!

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,270
Don't worry about me!

162
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,030
Father!

163
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,669
Let go of him!

164
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,438
Stop right there!

165
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:13,999
Father!

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,600
Zhen, go back!

167
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:15,239
Hurry and leave!

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,438
Let go of my father!

169
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,150
Leave!

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,789
Father!

171
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,070
Master!

172
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:22,919
Don't move.

173
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,869
Master!

174
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,509
My lord!

175
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,470
It's late at night!
Take care of your safety!

176
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
(Magistrate Office)

177
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,760
(Magistrate Office)

178
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,749
Physician Wang, how is he doing?

179
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,989
There's nothing wrong with his body.

180
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,389
If so...

181
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,909
If so, why did our lord
fall unconscious all of a sudden?

182
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,749
Here.

183
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,758
I'll give it a try.

184
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,038
All right. Be careful.

185
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,790
That's right.

186
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,158
Geez.

187
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,109
Why are you so careless?

188
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,678
Father, you should rest early.

189
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,558
Got it.

190
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,319
But I have to finish
this design by tonight.

191
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,439
I have to use it tomorrow.

192
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,119
All right. Stop worrying about me.
Just go.

193
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,359
Remember to rest early.

194
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,149
Got it.

195
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,278
Look.

196
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,700
This is the canal that I designed.

197
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:28,398
There's a supporting plane
inside the canal.

198
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,680
There's a rule we must follow
to build a supporting plane.

199
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,149
Can you understand it?

200
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,029
I can't.

201
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,999
You're a girl.

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,678
- There's no point in learning this.
- I want to learn.

203
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,389
This way, I can help you out.

204
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,509
I don't need you to help me.

205
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,989
Just go back.

206
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,758
Just teach me.

207
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,599
I won't. Go back to sleep.

208
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,719
I won't leave.

209
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,359
I'll give you a beating if you don't go.

210
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,269
Father, you can't bear to hit me.

211
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,310
Miss.

212
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,629
Miss.

213
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,710
Qingxi,

214
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,550
am I dreaming?

215
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,389
No, Miss.

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,989
Master was captured for real.

217
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,119
Miss, don't cry.

218
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,638
I kept some family possessions

219
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,710
in the backyard.

220
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,199
Later,

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,359
you should leave

222
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,830
after the government soldiers leave.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Father will come back.

224
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,949
There won't be anything wrong
with the construction plan.

225
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,239
What if something does happen to Master?
What should we do, then?

226
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,398
You'll be forced to be a servant, Miss.

227
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,509
What should you do by then?

228
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,869
Jin Money House?

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,029
Take this.

230
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,470
The item that Father left behind for me,

231
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,950
was it related to the West Canal?

232
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,959
My lord, since my lord has feelings
for Miss Shen,

233
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,119
why didn't he

234
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,790
read her letters, then?

235
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,070
Words of farewell

236
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,509
always pierce the heart.

237
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,869
(It pierces the heart.)

238
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,029
My lord, you're awake.

239
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,190
My lord.

240
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,790
I...

241
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,430
What's wrong with me?

242
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,638
The physician read your pulse.

243
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,518
He said you have a troubled mind.

244
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,999
However, he cannot identify the cause.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,678
Maybe

246
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,710
it was caused by overexhaustion.

247
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,638
What about the issue
related to the Shen Residence?

248
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,638
Minister Shen Wenqi

249
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,600
has been imprisoned.

250
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,439
All materials and documents
related to the West Canal

251
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,439
within Shen Residence

252
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,670
have been brought back.

253
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,670
Send someone
to keep an eye on Shen Zhen.

254
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:12,909
Yes, my lord.

255
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,590
Sister!

256
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,079
Open the door!

257
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,678
(Li Residence)

258
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,149
Miss Shen?

259
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,200
Miss Shen, you...

260
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,079
Sorry for bothering you.

261
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,479
But I'm in a hurry to see my sister.

262
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,319
Madam isn't home.

263
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,199
My sister

264
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,790
isn't at home right now?

265
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,638
No.

266
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,650
Let me wait inside, then.

267
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,278
Miss Shen, please don't put me
on the spot here.

268
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,190
Don't put our madam on the spot too.

269
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,070
It's already tough enough on her.

270
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,149
Miss, they...

271
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,790
That's right.

272
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,350
My sister has already
married into Li Residence.

273
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,149
Brother-in-law is also working
under Father.

274
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,599
If something does happen to Father...

275
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,798
But after all, they're our in-laws.

276
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,638
How could they

277
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,229
just leave us in the lurch?

278
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,430
I won't put Sister on the spot here.

279
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,070
Let's go.

280
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,359
She came here to look for Madam.

281
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,629
She already left.

282
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,869
I knew it.

283
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,758
All right. I got it.

284
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,599
Leave now.

285
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,430
Yes, Madam.

286
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,758
Initially, I thought the Shen family
was strong and dependable

287
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,590
and that my son could depend on them.

288
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,119
Who would expect

289
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,239
such an unfortunate event to happen?

290
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,670
My son mustn't be implicated.

291
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,158
Daughter-in-law, where are you going?

292
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:01,719
Mother-in-law,

293
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,678
my father is in trouble.

294
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,950
I need to check on him.

295
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,479
Logically speaking, you should.

296
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,918
It's just that you're a woman.

297
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,918
And, it's dangerous to go out at night.

298
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,239
It'll damage your reputation too.

299
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
Why don't you wait for Di
to come back first

300
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,000
before you make your decision?

301
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,819
Mother-in-law, thank you
for being understanding.

302
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,079
But my family is in trouble.

303
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,070
As the eldest daughter, I have to go.

304
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,199
But now, you're our daughter-in-law.

305
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,038
At least

306
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,878
you have a shelter here.

307
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,479
It's better for you to remain here.

308
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,638
I'm worried

309
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,900
for my husband's sake too.

310
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:32,599
My husband is the son-in-law
of the Shen family,

311
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,158
and he's working under Father too.

312
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,038
When one prospers, all prosper.
When one suffers, all suffer.

313
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,439
I'm worried about my husband...

314
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,319
If you're truly worried about him,

315
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,989
you should wait for him to come back.

316
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,758
Di is working in
the Ministry of Water Resources.

317
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sure he knows the situation

318
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,999
better than the Shen Residence
if there's any.

319
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,719
Even so, I have to check on Zhen.

320
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,199
She's still young. I'm afraid she can't
handle the pressure.

321
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,500
Life and death are predestined.

322
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,038
You're the daughter-in-law
of the Li family.

323
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,629
She's a member of the Shen family.

324
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,830
Keep an eye on Madam.
Do not allow her to leave.

325
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,918
It's dangerous
to leave the house at night.

326
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,650
But Mother-in-law...

327
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:04,070
Yes, Old Madam.

328
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,909
Monitor the gate.

329
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,189
Yes, ma'am.

330
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,990
(Earl Suning Residence)

331
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,550
Zhen!

332
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,479
Aunt.

333
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,719
Poor child.

334
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,358
Aunt,

335
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,358
is Jin Money House

336
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,518
one of Uncle's enterprises?

337
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,439
That's right.

338
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,758
Father gave me this before he left.

339
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,598
I'm afraid
there's something important inside.

340
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,629
Aunt, can you bring me there
to retrieve it?

341
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,919
Silly girl,

342
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,518
this is the key to our safe.

343
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,199
Although

344
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,679
we have the key to our money vault,

345
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,719
we need Shopkeeper Jin's key

346
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,239
before we can gain access

347
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,399
to the safe.

348
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,278
If so, can we request
Shopkeeper Jin to open the safe?

349
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,598
Shopkeeper Jin left the town on a business trip a few days ago.

350
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,350
He'll only return by tomorrow.

351
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,070
Zhen, calm down.

352
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,600
You can spend the night
in my house tonight.

353
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,909
I'll travel to the money house
together with you tomorrow.

354
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,838
All right, then.

355
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,469
Don't worry.

356
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,550
Your father was always a prudent person.

357
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,510
I think there's a misunderstanding.

358
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,590
Rest well tonight.

359
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,469
Keep this with you.

360
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,358
Let's go.

361
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,030
I'll take you to the guest room.

362
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,479
All of the survey documents
related to the West Canal are here.

363
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,230
But where's the construction plan?

364
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,350
Did you overlook it
when you were searching the residence?

365
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,669
No.

366
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,189
I'll search the residence again.

367
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,639
Shen Wenqi did a detailed job

368
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,030
even if they were just survey documents.

369
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,318
It's obvious

370
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,709
that he's serious and prudent.

371
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,590
Where did the construction plan
go wrong, then?

372
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,590
Find someone reliable

373
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,149
to test the date again.

374
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,109
Understood.

375
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,429
My lord,

376
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,790
is your heart aching again?

377
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,510
My lord!

378
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,270
(39)

379
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,909
Miss, don't cry.

380
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,439
Maybe Master will be saved

381
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,700
after we retrieved the item
at the money house.

382
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,959
Father treats the West Canal

383
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,990
more important than his own life.

384
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,399
He was always proud of

385
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,750
the fact that his work benefited
the people here.

386
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,990
But this actually happened.

387
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,830
How could Father accept this?

388
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,070
Miss.

389
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,189
My lord, do you feel better now?

390
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,469
What exactly is going on?

391
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,358
My lord, it's fine.

392
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,038
At most,

393
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,250
I'll hire more physicians
to give you a diagnosis.

394
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,830
Official Lu, Official Zhou is here.

395
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,038
Official Zhou,

396
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,469
what's with the sudden visit?

397
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm here to bring back Shen Wenqi,
the Minister of Justice.

398
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:59,278
According to His Majesty's oral order,

399
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,038
the Magistrate Office

400
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,350
is to handle the case
related to the West Canal.

401
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,719
According to His Majesty's
written order,

402
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,318
the case related to the West Canal

403
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,318
involves many personnel.

404
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,264
The Imperial Censorate may
bring back and interrogate

405
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:15,669
the officials who are involved.

406
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,419
(Report to me immediately
once you find any clues)

407
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,630
(Eight day of the third month,
third year of Yong'an's reign)

408
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,798
Since His Majesty has already
issued a written order,

409
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,429
Official Zhou, please go ahead.

410
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,869
Official Lu,

411
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,318
you look very pale.

412
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,590
Seems like the case
must've taken a toll on you.

413
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,469
The Imperial Censorate will surely
assist you with everything we have.

414
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,070
Official Zhou, thank you.

415
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,869
Farewell, Official Zhou.

416
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,700
We just arrested him yesterday.

417
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,358
But now, he's able to take him away.
He even has His Majesty's written order.

418
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,429
Zhou Shu'an is extremely devious.

419
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,758
He was His Majesty's favorite subject
for the past few years.

420
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:15,500
I can understand why he was able
to get His Majesty's written order.

421
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,109
However, his goal is unclear to me.

422
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,439
The construction plan is vital.

423
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,350
How did it vanish all of a sudden?

424
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,830
Did Shen Wenqi destroy it himself?

425
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,990
Or is there another reason behind it?

426
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,070
This case is pretty interesting.

427
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,830
What did Deputy Minister Xu say?

428
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,399
They're transporting your brother
to the Imperial Censorate.

429
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,030
I'm afraid he's in trouble.

430
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,518
To maintain the peace of
Earl Suning Residence,

431
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,758
you should deliver Shen Zhen

432
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,399
to Deputy Minister Xu.

433
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,078
Miss!

434
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,879
But Zhen

435
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,558
is my niece!

436
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,469
This is your home, you know?

437
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,199
Even if you don't care about our safety,

438
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,159
you should consider your son's safety.

439
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,869
He just got a post.

440
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,990
Once they convict your brother of his crime,
everything will go down the drain!

441
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,429
We might also lose our lives.

442
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,558
Zhen is such a poor girl.

443
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,879
She's the daughter of a criminal.

444
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,798
If she wanders outside,

445
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,510
people will definitely bully her.

446
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,389
Don't you feel sorry for her, then?

447
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,999
Deputy Minister Xu has a high post.

448
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,919
And, he asked for her hands long ago.

449
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,750
I'm sure he'll treat her nicely.

450
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,318
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

451
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,109
Why shouldn't we do it?

452
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,429
Dear, you're right.

453
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,990
Later, I'll travel to the money house
together with Zhen.

454
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,109
Why don't we use that to our advantage?

455
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,429
Dear, seems like you've figured it out.

456
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,118
Miss, let's go!

457
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:54,990
No.

458
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:55,700
If we leave now,

459
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,879
they'll surely keep away the item we need
in the money house.

460
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,879
What should we do, then?

461
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,959
They said

462
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,558
that you were going to be married

463
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,118
to Deputy Minister Xu.

464
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,070
I don't care anymore.

465
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,510
I have to retrieve Father's item.

466
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,679
Isn't the money house located at
the East City?

467
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,429
Why are we heading North?

468
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,510
It poured last night.

469
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,479
The road was flooded.

470
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,358
We're taking a detour

471
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,310
through the North.
We'll go through Jiayi Street.

472
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,270
Jiayi Street?

473
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,118
Aunt,

474
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,239
do you still remember

475
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,299
that there's a restaurant

476
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,959
called Niu's Beef Soup on that street?

477
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,758
You always brought me there.

478
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,719
Niu's Beef Soup?

479
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,919
Have you forgotten about it?

480
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,000
I love the flatbread they serve.

481
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:47,879
I always keep two of them in my pocket
before I leave the restaurant.

482
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,030
You always teased me for it
when I was young.

483
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,318
I do remember.

484
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,719
You have been a glutton since young.

485
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,439
Aunt, since we'll be passing by
the restaurant anyway,

486
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,949
why don't we go and have something?

487
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,469
Zhen, I think we should
focus on our priorities first.

488
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,278
Aunt, we're just having breakfast.

489
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,518
You haven't had breakfast either.

490
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,919
We left the house so early
in the morning.

491
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,070
I think Shopkeeper Jin
hasn't arrived yet.

492
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,909
It'll only take us half a quarter
to have breakfast.

493
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,199
But...

494
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,990
Aunt.

495
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,439
Fine. I'll follow your will.

496
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,830
Aunt, I knew you doted on me the most.

497
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,479
Waiter, give me the bill.

498
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,278
Coming.

499
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,078
Miss, when did you
visit this restaurant before?

500
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,758
Why do I have no impression
of the place at all?

501
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,350
I haven't visited
this restaurant before.

502
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,518
But you said you missed the place.

503
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,669
I missed the relationship
I once had with her.

504
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,990
It's a shame that Aunt
doesn't remember anything about it.

505
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,469
- Aunt.
- Miss.

506
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,709
Over here.

507
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,959
Boss, give us three bowls of beef soup.

508
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,719
All right.

509
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,469
Boss.

510
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,239
Give us two bowls of soup
and four flatbreads.

511
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,669
All right. Please wait a moment.

512
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,558
These are our signature dishes.

513
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,669
I'll take a look.

514
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,879
Aunt,

515
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,598
do you think
the collapse of the West Canal

516
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,709
is truly related to Father?

517
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,719
Father only
drew the construction plan for it.

518
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,479
My lord,

519
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,030
it's Miss Shen.

520
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,909
It's the girl from
the Shen family indeed.

521
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,550
How dare she come here?

522
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:13,879
Zhen,

523
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,038
don't say such things in public.

524
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,230
I'm just worried about Father.

525
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,558
I wonder how he's doing

526
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,350
after he was arrested.

527
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,280
Do you know how many people have died

528
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,159
and how many acres of land
have been destroyed

529
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,278
because of that incident?

530
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:27,959
That's right.

531
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,990
Refugees were everywhere.

532
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,399
It's not related to his family.

533
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,949
She's innocent too.

534
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,159
What about the refugees, then?

535
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,550
Aren't they innocent too?

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,558
The conclusion hasn't been decided yet.

537
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,709
You guys have no right to criticize him.

538
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,358
We have no right to criticize him, huh?

539
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,719
Do you know how many families

540
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,719
in the West City

541
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,558
were shattered because of your father?

542
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,199
My father is only related to the case
and was brought back for interrogation.

543
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,798
You don't have any evidence to prove

544
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,318
that my father was the one
behind the collapse of the West Canal.

545
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,479
It's your father's fault!

546
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,899
Because your father
is the Minister of Justice.

547
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,798
He was the one
who drew the construction plan.

548
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,520
Even now, you're still
trying to deny the fact?

549
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,750
Explain yourself!

550
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,109
You better explain yourself.

551
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,719
Everyone in the West City

552
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,479
knows about this incident.

553
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,999
How dare you argue with us?

554
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,230
Give us an account!

555
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,439
I won't let you leave
unless you explain yourself!

556
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,389
Official Lu,

557
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,879
you're here as well.

558
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,758
Tell us, then.

559
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,550
Is there already
a conclusion to the case?

560
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,199
The case is still under investigation.

561
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,830
There's no conclusion yet.

562
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,879
Did you hear that?

563
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,558
Official Lu himself said the case
was still under investigation.

564
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,590
What gives you the right
to criticize my father?

565
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,078
You officials are covering up
for each other.

566
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,838
No one knows
what the verdict will be for sure.

567
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,358
- That's right.
- Yeah.

568
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,990
Official Lu, look at them.

569
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,399
They're making bold accusations.

570
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,310
It's obvious that
they're slandering my father.

571
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,479
Listen to me.

572
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,830
That's not the case.

573
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,838
Everyone.

574
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,310
Madam!

575
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,798
The Magistrate Office will
get to the bottom of this case

576
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,590
and give you guys an account.

577
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,429
But...

578
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,230
Enough!

579
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,000
You guys will be obstructing us
from carrying out public duties

580
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,000
if you keep up the ruckus.

581
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,879
All of you are dismissed.

582
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,758
Where's Shen Zhen?

583
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,399
Dismissed.

584
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,838
I don't know either.

585
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,429
Where were you guys going?

586
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,949
We...

587
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,999
Official Lu,

588
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,999
Miss could only stay in

589
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,959
Earl Suning Residence

590
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,679
after you arrested

591
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,598
Master.

592
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,199
She didn't dare to step out
of the residence.

593
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,199
She left the house

594
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,598
just to have some soup,

595
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,669
yet she was verbally assaulted
by all those people.

596
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,199
I'm afraid
that she might attempt something silly.

597
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,999
Official Lu, please help us out.

598
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,798
Can you send your men to find her?

599
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,469
Shut up.

600
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,510
Let go of me.

601
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,758
Miss Shen staged this act
so that she could make a run for it.

602
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,038
She might be related

603
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,558
to the case related to the West Canal.

604
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,070
If you guys don't tell me the truth,

605
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,689
I'll arrest you guys and bring you
back to the Magistrate Office.

606
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,230
Speak. Where were you guys going?

607
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,469
Speak!

608
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,590
I...

609
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,598
Perfumed sachet
and fresh flowers for sale!

610
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,550
Perfumed sachet for sale!

611
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,949
Perfumed sachet for sale!

612
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,399
Can you send me to Jin Money House?

613
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,479
Miss,

614
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,550
we're in a hurry to
deliver our goods too.

615
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,879
You can have this.

616
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,719
I'm begging you.

617
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,798
I'm in an emergency.

618
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,230
I'm begging you.

619
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,109
All right, then. You may hop on.

620
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,270
(Jin Money House)

621
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,350
Father.

622
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,190
(Jin Money House)

623
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm here to retrieve an item!

624
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,639
Good boy, don't be scared.

625
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,838
What was that?

626
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,038
Are you Shopkeeper Jin?

627
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,030
I'm Jin Shiba.

628
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,390
I'm here to retrieve the item
that belonged to Minister Shen Wenqi.

629
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,830
It's me.

630
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,669
Girl!

631
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,159
Girl,

632
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,070
how could you be so rude?

633
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,669
I'm sorry.

634
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,189
Follow me.

635
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,550
Let go.

636
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,798
Of all the hours to come,

637
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,358
you just had to come at this hour.

638
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,270
You're interrupting me
from having a pleasant dream.

639
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,758
Shopkeeper Jin, sorry for the trouble.

640
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,709
Over here.

641
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,230
Why can't you unlock it?

642
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,270
Five, six, seven, eight.

643
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,830
Safe 39 doesn't exist.

644
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,750
No. 39.

645
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,078
But I remember

646
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,679
that Minister Shen kept his items here.

647
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,919
Where's Safe 39?

648
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,879
Bring me there.

649
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,278
Why the rush?

650
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,350
Follow me.

651
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,399
Help yourself to it.

652
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,790
Thank you, Shopkeeper Jin.

653
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,709
Shen Zhen!

654
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,149
Official Lu?

655
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,310
I suspect that the item in your hand

656
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,479
is related

657
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,149
to the West Canal case.

658
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,479
Take it out.

659
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,038
This is my father's personal belonging.

660
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,600
You're hiding evidence of his crime.

661
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,318
According to the law, you should
be arrested and interrogated.

662
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,959
My father is in the Imperial Censorate now,
not the Magistrate Office.

663
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,118
Why should I give it to you?

664
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,600
Which law are you referring to?

665
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:56,439
Why don't you tell the Imperial Censorate
to arrest me instead?

666
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,590
Give it to me!

667
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,869
(Dear daughter, this is a letter
I wrote to you.)

668
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,709
(You should be reading this)

669
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,909
(on your birthday.)

670
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,598
(I wish that you can shine eternally
like the moon)

671
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,550
(and rise as high as the sun.)

672
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,990
(After the age of 20,
you'll face obstacles in life gradually.)

673
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,189
(I'm worried about you.)

674
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,750
(This jade bangle is my gift for you.
May you stay alert.)

675
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,879
This is the item that my mother
left behind for me.

676
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,479
Is this the evidence you're looking for?

677
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,798
I destroyed your item by accident.

678
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,429
According to the law,
I should compensate you. I will do it.

679
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,038
Official Lu, do you think every item

680
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:31,798
in the world

681
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,439
has a price that you can compensate for?

682
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,109
If so, Official Lu,

683
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,629
how much do you think this is worth?

684
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,310
It was indeed my fault

685
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,510
for behaving as such.

686
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,550
This is top-quality white jade
granted to me by His Majesty.

687
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:47,550
It should be good enough
to serve as compensation.

688
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,199
Take it.

689
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,750
I don't want your stuff!

690
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,550
Zhen!

691
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:54,999
Sister!

692
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,869
Zhen!

693
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,070
Are you okay?

694
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,629
I'm fine.

695
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,278
But the jade bangle that Mother
left behind for me was...

696
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,709
What happened to it?

697
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,429
It's shattered?

698
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,949
It's fine. I'm here for you.

699
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,110
Official Lu?

700
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,799
This item will serve as
Miss Shen's compensation.

701
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,750
Take it.

702
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,670
Do you want it?

703
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,190
My sister doesn't want it.

704
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,190
Do you need anything else?

705
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,630
I, Lu Shiyan,
never owe people any favors.

706
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,879
I'll surely make it up to you.

707
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,439
Since there's nothing else,

708
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,909
we'll make a move first.

709
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,190
Let's go.

710
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,150
(The perfumed sachet!)

711
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:01,678
My lord,

712
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,158
since you have feelings for Miss Shen,

713
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,319
why didn't you

714
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,069
read her letters?

715
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,150
(Jin Money House)

716
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,750
(Could she be the person in my dream?)

717
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,630
Zhen,

718
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,830
did you look for me before this?

719
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,509
You must remember this.

720
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,630
I'm your sister.

721
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,158
No matter what other people say

722
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,790
or what happened,

723
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,479
I'll always

724
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,469
be there for you.

725
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,710
Understood?

726
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,830
My lord!

727
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,190
My lord!

728
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,850
(Baixiang Pavilion)

729
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,710
Sister,

730
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,830
how did you manage
to leave the residence after that?

731
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,230
I told someone to notify
my husband long ago.

732
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,919
Although he was sent to the West City,

733
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,799
he relayed his message to me
through a messenger.

734
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,890
He said he had to intervene
when Father was involved.

735
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,479
Brother-in-law is nice indeed.

736
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,429
He received plenty of Father's help
before this.

737
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,389
He should repay his kindness.

738
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,439
Right now, this shop isn't opened yet.

739
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,630
It can serve as your shelter.

740
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,678
And, this shop is located
along the street.

741
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,118
Even if Aunt does look for you,

742
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,869
she won't be overstepping
her boundaries.

743
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,630
Thank you, Sister.

744
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,799
It's a shame that
I couldn't help Father out

745
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,198
after all that effort.

746
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,238
Just leave this

747
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,479
to me and my husband.

748
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,399
Just stay here
and wait for everything to settle down.

749
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,110
I'll think of a way

750
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,638
to visit Father.

751
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,759
I want to tag along.

752
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,549
I don't know if it'll work or not.

753
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,509
Let me give it a try first.

754
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,238
The prison cell is a terrible place.

755
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,069
And, Father has old ailments too.

756
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,038
Sister, you must prepare

757
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,638
his usual medicine before visiting him.

758
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,310
I've already prepared everything.

759
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,509
Madam.

760
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,150
Everything is ready.

761
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,989
Come with me.

762
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,989
Zhen, today's your birthday.

763
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,558
Zhen, you're all grown up now.

764
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,678
But remember this,

765
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,350
you don't need to act tough

766
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,270
as long as I'm around.

767
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,790
Sister.

768
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,198
Birthday girl,

769
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,750
happy birthday.

770
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,509
Everything will get better.

771
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,230
Miss.

772
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,830
Happy birthday.

773
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,909
Miss, happy birthday.

774
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,270
Hurry, finish the noodles.

775
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,750
Miss, eat up.

776
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,429
Have it while it's hot.

777
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,949
It's only delicious when it's hot.

778
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,598
How is it? Is it nice?

779
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,359
Is it nice?

780
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,879
Miss, I picked up this recipe
not long ago. It's a new dish I learned.

781
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,029
I fried the egg myself.

782
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,399
The shopkeeper of Jin Money House

783
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,750
has a grievance to address.

784
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,158
He said the criminal, Miss Shen,

785
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,879
escaped without repaying her debt.

786
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,038
And now, she has left the city.

787
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,389
She's the daughter of a criminal.
How could she leave the city?

788
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,919
She must've changed her
household registration

789
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,350
and forged the checkpoint documents.

790
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,029
Arrest her.

791
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,790
Who gave you the checkpoint documents?

792
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,110
Answer my question.

793
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,750
Were you the one who set the fire?

794
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,389
I alone was the culprit.

795
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,150
I was the culprit for
the forged checkpoint documents

796
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,469
household registration,

797
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,909
even the fire itself.

798
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,198
I confess to my crime.

799
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,029
The Magistrate Office
always acts impartially.

800
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,439
You should confess to the crimes
you've committed.

801
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,390
However, there's no need
to confess to the crimes

802
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,069
that you didn't commit.

803
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,750
You're the daughter of a criminal.

804
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,118
Who was daring enough to help you
break the law?

805
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,150
My father isn't a criminal!

806
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:11,549
He was framed!

807
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,750
Miss Shen,

808
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,389
the punishment we serve
isn't something to be taken lightly.

809
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,469
I suggest you answer me honestly.

810
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,750
Speak!

811
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,150
Official Lu,

812
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,549
no matter how many times
you ask me the same question,

813
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,270
I'll only give you the same answer.

814
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,949
I alone was the culprit.

815
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,350
Execute the punishment.

816
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,469
Miss Shen!

817
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,869
My lord.

818
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,389
My lord, what's wrong?

819
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,158
Did you just dream about

820
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,270
Miss Shen just now?

821
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,949
You called her name just now.

822
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,830
I dreamt that Miss Shen
was trying to escape from the city.

823
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,909
I captured her and tortured her.

824
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,670
After that, she stabbed me.

825
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:44,638
Before this, I dreamt

826
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,110
that I was about to die.

827
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,230
Was it because of her?

828
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,549
And, the piercing pain in my heart,

829
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,750
could it be that Miss Shen

830
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,678
used some sort of sorcery to curse me?

831
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,549
Where is Miss Shen right now?

832
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,518
Baixiang Pavilion.

833
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,389
Let's go.
