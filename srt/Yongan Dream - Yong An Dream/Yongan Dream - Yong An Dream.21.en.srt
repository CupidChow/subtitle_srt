18
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:01,076
Mr. Zhao.

19
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:03,916
My lord?

20
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,124
Duke Zhenguo Residence

21
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,796
always treated you well.

22
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:08,635
I never expected you

23
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:11,236
to betray your master.

24
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:16,676
Speak.

25
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,556
Who's the mastermind?

26
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,996
I...

27
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,676
You're caught red-handed.

28
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,595
Tell me everything you know.

29
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,795
Just like what you said.

30
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:36,765
Even if you do obtain certain items,

31
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:39,996
it's only useful when you're able
to use them without dying.

32
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:41,475
Speak!

33
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,560
My lord,

34
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:47,081
I'll talk.

35
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,280
Before this,

36
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,921
someone gave me

37
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:50,801
a large sum.

38
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:52,801
After that, he told me

39
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:54,321
to facilitate the process.

40
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:55,672
What else did you do?

41
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:57,041
I just helped him

42
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,400
to transport those boxes

43
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,641
into the residence.

44
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:00,552
After that, I...

45
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:02,641
Regarding that seal...

46
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:05,361
So, the receipt of iron ore purchase
they found in Duke Zhenguo Residence

47
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:07,272
were stamped by you with the fake seal?

48
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,871
That's right.

49
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,161
I didn't dare

50
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,761
to use Eldest Princess's true seal.

51
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,161
That's why I...

52
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:16,041
I forged a seal.

53
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,361
My lord.

54
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:18,881
I know my fault now.

55
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,161
I was bewitched before this.

56
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:21,601
Please spare me!

57
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,801
Who was your contact?

58
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,240
I don't know him.

59
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,361
I have no idea who he is.

60
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,801
I just heard from

61
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:28,680
their underling

62
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:29,840
that his name was Lord Pang.

63
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,152
You don't know him?

64
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,881
You betrayed Duke Zhenguo Residence,

65
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:34,090
who employed you for so many years

66
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:35,440
for the sake of someone

67
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,432
you didn't even know?

68
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,400
Wait!

69
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,280
My lord!

70
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:45,081
My lord, please spare me!

71
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,201
I know my fault now!

72
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,120
My lord, please spare me!

73
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:49,911
I know my fault now!

74
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,952
Send him to the Imperial Censorate
tomorrow morning.

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,200
(Zhao Shifeng)

76
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:05,591
Official Zhou.

77
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,000
This is Mr. Zhao, housekeeper of

78
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:10,952
Duke Zhenguo Residence.

79
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,081
These items

80
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:13,000
were found

81
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,351
on him.

82
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,040
(I, Zhao Shifeng,
was deceived and lured by Pang Hu.)

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,000
(Zhao Shifeng)

84
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:28,712
Bring him to the torture room

85
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:30,041
and interrogate him.

86
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:30,911
Take him away.

87
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:31,832
Yes, sir.

88
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:32,760
Come!

89
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:33,601
Official Zhou!

90
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,080
Please give me a chance!

91
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,801
Official Zhou! Please give me a chance!

92
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:37,591
Come!

93
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,920
(Zhuang's Bun Shop)

94
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:43,841
Enjoy your meal.

95
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:44,791
Thank you.

96
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:55,512
You see,

97
00:04:57,482 --> 00:04:58,872
actually,

98
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,272
Su Heng, he...

99
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:04,192
He overheard the conversation

100
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,000
between Pang Hu

101
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,671
and his men at the pier.

102
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,401
Now, he understands

103
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,872
that he misunderstood Official Lu.

104
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,791
He regretted it too.

105
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:14,832
Why don't you forgive him?

106
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:18,392
I was too agitated back then.

107
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,721
Brother Su Heng

108
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:21,120
did so out of obligation.

109
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,791
He did so for my sake.

110
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,440
I never hated him for it.

111
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,392
Really?

112
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:26,601
This is great.

113
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,721
That fool was worried that
you wouldn't forgive him.

114
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:29,930
He didn't dare to come and see you.

115
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,272
How could that be?

116
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm glad to hear that.

117
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,712
Your buns are here.
Have them while they're hot.

118
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:37,801
Miss Shen,

119
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:38,841
we ran out of meat.

120
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:40,240
I have to buy some meat.

121
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,560
Can you head to the kitchen

122
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,640
and tend to the stove?

123
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:43,760
You're in a hurry, huh?

124
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:44,760
I'll buy the meat for you.

125
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,080
You don't know how to do it.

126
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:47,041
I'll go.

127
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,512
You just need to tend to the stove.

128
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,512
There's already someone here.

129
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:03,471
Mister?

130
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,231
Mister?

131
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:10,231
Why is he ignoring me?

132
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:12,591
Mister?

133
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:19,591
Lu Shiyan!

134
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:23,900
What are you doing here?

135
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,361
Did Madam Zhuang
arrange for you to come?

136
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:26,120
You don't say?

137
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,090
Did you think she brought you here
just to try her buns?

138
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:29,240
Official Lu,

139
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,721
you're pretty capable, huh?

140
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,591
Look at your beard.

141
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,880
That hurts!

142
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,312
Be gentle.

143
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,272
I spent a lot of time to stick them on.

144
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,192
Don't mess with them.

145
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:41,481
You can

146
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:43,601
actually cook, huh?

147
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:44,401
I didn't even know...

148
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,431
Don't underestimate me.

149
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:48,591
The buns you had just now

150
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:50,120
were made by me.

151
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,231
Really?

152
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,401
I want more.

153
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:54,712
I'll steam another batch for you.

154
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:00,591
Why did you appear all of a sudden?

155
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:05,961
I found out

156
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,560
that Mr. Zhao of Duke Zhenguo Residence

157
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,120
forged my mother's seal.

158
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:10,680
Now, both evidence and witness

159
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,192
are at the Imperial Censorate.

160
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,072
With all of those evidence,

161
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:17,192
the time limit on my mother's case
will be extended.

162
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:18,801
I knew

163
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:20,192
you could do it.

164
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:22,760
Look at you.

165
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:24,080
Your face is full of flour

166
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,192
just from making buns alone.

167
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,152
Miss Shen!

168
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:41,551
Official Lu?

169
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:42,841
You really

170
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,512
resorted to the worst

171
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,152
just to see Miss Shen, huh?

172
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:51,601
Sorry about that.

173
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:52,712
Sorry for bothering you guys.

174
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:54,752
But since you're here,

175
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,000
I have a message from a fool
that I need to relay to you.

176
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,952
Is it related to Pang Hu?

177
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,632
Yes, and no.

178
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,281
Official Su and I

179
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,281
found Pang Hu at the pier.

180
00:08:05,282 --> 00:08:08,080
We heard Pang Hu saying that
they needed to find you as soon as possible

181
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,072
to convict Eldest Princess
of the fake crime.

182
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:11,880
After hearing that,

183
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:13,481
he finally understood

184
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:14,440
that he misunderstood you,

185
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,481
Official Lu.

186
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,312
He regretted it.

187
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:18,832
Official Lu,

188
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,000
I wonder

189
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,791
if you're willing to see him?

190
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,312
He's willing to atone for his mistake.

191
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:28,872
All right.

192
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:31,791
I'll tell Yang Zong to contact you.

193
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:33,152
Okay.

194
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,200
You guys can continue.

195
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:38,232
I'll make a move first.

196
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:46,671
Let's continue, then.

197
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,112
My lord!

198
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:05,752
Official Lu.

199
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:07,352
Official Lu.

200
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:13,472
Official Lu.

201
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,031
I was biased

202
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,992
before this.

203
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:17,960
I actually fell for

204
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,311
the villain's trick.

205
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:21,881
I landed you and
Eldest Princess in trouble.

206
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,632
It's all my fault.

207
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,512
Let me apologize.

208
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,671
Official Su, it's not that severe.

209
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:31,911
Please get up first.

210
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,121
They plotted for this long ago.

211
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:37,512
And, it was a meticulous plot.

212
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,752
It's hard for me to not get suspicious

213
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:41,600
if I obtain the same evidence.

214
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:42,632
However,

215
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:43,801
if I chose

216
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,071
to believe you

217
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:46,352
and hand over the evidence,

218
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:48,472
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

219
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,551
It's still my fault.

220
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,831
Official Su, don't blame yourself.

221
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,790
When it comes to investigating a case,

222
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:58,791
we must only trust the evidence.

223
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:01,801
This case is quite serious.

224
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,232
I'll surely get to the bottom of this.

225
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,241
Pang Hu had already dealt with

226
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:07,560
the goods he mentioned.

227
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,671
Those goods of his

228
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,512
should be weapons too.

229
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:16,200
You guys should retreat first.

230
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:33,881
Escort Official Lu.

231
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,071
I'll help Yang Zong out.

232
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,921
I'm a better fighter than you.

233
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:38,191
You can escort Official Lu.

234
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:41,711
Rest at ease.

235
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,041
Take them down!

236
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:53,911
Yes, sir!

237
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,711
Why is Zhou Shu'an here?

238
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:03,551
Were we followed?

239
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,560
Pang Hu?

240
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:25,161
After him!

241
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,392
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

242
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:27,831
Stop right there!

243
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:33,831
Official Zhou,

244
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:36,191
Official Lu was framed.

245
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,960
I heard Pang Hu saying

246
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,512
that he wanted to frame Eldest Princess.

247
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:41,671
I can testify for him.

248
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:44,031
Official Zhou?

249
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:50,551
This...

250
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,161
Official Zhou, you came

251
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:56,360
at the right timing.

252
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:57,320
Official Lu,

253
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:59,401
I'm sure you've already taken that
into account, am I right?

254
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,150
Yang Zong knew he was tailed.

255
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,680
He suspected that it was
Pang Hu and his men.

256
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,041
Therefore, he used this chance
to lead you here

257
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,431
so that you could intercept him.

258
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:07,859
If we can continue

259
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,281
to track down people related to Pang Hu,

260
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,680
at least it can prove

261
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:13,191
that there are more questionable points
about the case.

262
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:14,161
And,

263
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:15,840
we found another clue too.

264
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,281
Official Zhou, I wonder

265
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:18,632
what discoveries you've made.

266
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:19,801
The testimony

267
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:21,071
is already in front of us.

268
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,872
What other discoveries
do you think I've made?

269
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,232
I've already reported to His Majesty

270
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:28,161
that there are questionable points
related to Eldest Princess's case

271
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:30,272
and that we need to
continue the investigation.

272
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:34,911
Official Zhou, you always helped me out

273
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,671
in secret.

274
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:41,521
When I went to the Imperial Censorate's cell
to visit my mother,

275
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:43,152
not only was the security there lax,

276
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:46,031
but I also saw bug-repelling incense
in the cell.

277
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,720
Official Zhou,

278
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:49,232
I think that was part of

279
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:50,551
your thoughtful arrangement.

280
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:53,121
That night,
after I left Baixiang Pavilion,

281
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:54,161
I was attacked.

282
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:55,761
Someone came to my rescue.

283
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,232
Chuyi, although I'm not observant,

284
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,311
I could recognize that it was you.

285
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,551
Official Lu, you flatter me.

286
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:12,992
The bloodied shirt is missing.

287
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:20,352
I understand now.

288
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:22,281
Understand what?

289
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:23,400
You let Official Lu

290
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:24,801
steal the bloodied shirt on purpose.

291
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:25,720
Maybe

292
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,560
you never thought

293
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,480
that Official Lu

294
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:28,831
was guilty in the first place.

295
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,311
You've grown indeed.

296
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:35,401
You can figure out my thoughts now.

297
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:36,200
Mainly, it's because

298
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,711
I'm doubtful about the case too.

299
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,521
If that's the case,

300
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:40,001
Eldest Princess might have been framed,

301
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,152
then.

302
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,592
That's right.

303
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,352
If Lu Shiyan intended to gather
military forces,

304
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:46,951
judging from his capability,

305
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:47,921
he wouldn't

306
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,311
show us all these flaws and loopholes.

307
00:13:49,922 --> 00:13:52,031
If he did intend to kill Zhao Chong,

308
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,352
he would've done it
before Zhao Chong reaches the capital.

309
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:55,600
He wouldn't have told me

310
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,152
about how Li Di was cutting corners

311
00:13:57,162 --> 00:13:58,352
either.

312
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,791
And,

313
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:01,401
the evidence-gathering process

314
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:02,720
in Eldest Princess's case

315
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:04,711
was too smooth to be true.

316
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:06,512
Follow Lu Shiyan

317
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,152
and protect him in secret.

318
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,440
You see,

319
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,440
if we protect Lu Shiyan,

320
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:13,872
we'll be protecting our evidence.

321
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,752
That's vital to the case.

322
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:17,191
Yes, sir.

323
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:18,360
Investigating cases

324
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,311
is the duty of the Imperial Censorate.

325
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,720
Protecting those who are involved

326
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,112
is part of my duty.

327
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,951
So,

328
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,872
you two are...

329
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,512
Official Zhou,

330
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,360
why didn't you tell me in advance

331
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:33,191
when you had doubts about the case?

332
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:35,200
Ever since the West Canal Case,

333
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,152
the true culprit linked up his plot

334
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:38,641
and every step of his plot was fatal.

335
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,560
I assume he has
plotted for this long ago.

336
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,560
There are too many people

337
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,071
involved in this case.

338
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:43,960
Therefore,

339
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:45,200
Official Su,

340
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:46,472
I didn't want you to take the risk.

341
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:55,472
Chen?

342
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:57,401
The other parts of the bloodied shirt

343
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:58,872
wasn't written with blood.

344
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,352
Zhao Chong wrote the word "Chen"

345
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,272
before his death.

346
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:04,191
So,

347
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:05,161
they've been using me

348
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:06,791
ever since they showed me
the bloodied shirt.

349
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:08,521
If so, does the word "Chen"

350
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:10,152
represent the prince?

351
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,951
The intel we have now

352
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,711
is getting clearer as we proceed.

353
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,320
Their motive is getting
more and more apparent too.

354
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,521
Which prince

355
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:21,232
is daring enough to do such a thing?

356
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,232
Our enemies are lurking in the dark

357
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,551
while we're out in the open.

358
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:27,560
We need to proceed with

359
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,560
the next plan.

360
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,761
Please investigate the movements

361
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,150
inside and outside of the city
in secret.

362
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:31,992
Don't worry.

363
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:33,560
I've already made
the necessary arrangements.

364
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,831
Since there are weapons,

365
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm sure there are
private soldiers as well.

366
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,512
Official Zhou, can you return to Jizhou

367
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:41,352
and request General Su
to bring his troops here?

368
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:43,761
Bring his troops here?

369
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:44,921
Is the case that serious?

370
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:45,840
If General Su

371
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,080
is willing to help us out,

372
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:48,320
that means

373
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:49,281
we have a capable backer

374
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,152
in the capital.

375
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:52,711
Official Su,

376
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:54,191
if you help us out,

377
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,031
we'll be even stronger.

378
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:57,992
But

379
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,752
what about Pang Hu?

380
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,632
-Just leave him to us.
-Just leave him to us.

381
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:07,992
Brother Su Heng?

382
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,551
What's with the getup?

383
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:13,921
I'm heading to Jizhou.

384
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,071
Jizhou?

385
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,551
You and Official Lu

386
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,232
must stay happy.

387
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:22,431
Before this,

388
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,152
I couldn't figure it out.

389
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,161
We were childhood friends,

390
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:28,720
but you chose him

391
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,031
instead of me.

392
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:31,840
Until the incident

393
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,551
with Duke Zhenguo Residence.

394
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,992
I witnessed the chemistry and trust

395
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:37,352
between you

396
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:38,360
and Official Lu

397
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,831
without needing to say a word.

398
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,951
Only then did I realize

399
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,911
the meaning of true love.

400
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,831
Only then did I realize
the meaning of mutual love.

401
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:48,472
Unlike me.

402
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,161
I always thought of myself
as your guardian.

403
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:52,911
However, I never truly considered

404
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,431
the things you desired.

405
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,752
Brother Su Heng,

406
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,031
Thank you.

407
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,512
I know you're nice to me.

408
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:03,521
You've always been protecting me

409
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,801
like my brother.

410
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,792
You didn't want me to suffer.

411
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:08,911
No matter what happens,

412
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:10,352
we'll always be

413
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:11,761
best friends.

414
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,191
Of course.

415
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:14,640
With me as your brother,

416
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:17,431
I doubt that Lu Shiyan is daring enough
to bully you.

417
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,152
You don't need to worry too much

418
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:23,832
about Eldest Princess's case.

419
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,751
I believe Official Lu

420
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,152
will definitely overcome his obstacles.

421
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:32,191
You should head to the Su Residence.

422
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:35,431
Someone's been waiting for you
for a long time.

423
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:40,832
Thank you, Brother Su Heng.

424
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,471
You must take care.

425
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,471
Thank you for being concerned
about my safety.

426
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,032
Be careful.

427
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:01,880
You're in such a hurry.

428
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:02,880
Where are you going?

429
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,711
I...

430
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,112
I'm heading outside to buy things.

431
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,991
Go ahead. Come back early.

432
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,360
(Baixiang Pavilion)

433
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:32,920
What are you doing here?

434
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:33,761
What?

435
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:34,840
Do you plan to run away

436
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:35,920
after bidding farewell

437
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:37,191
to your beloved Zhen?

438
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,120
I was just about to look for you.

439
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,320
Lo and behold, here you are.

440
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,600
At least you still have a conscience.

441
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,281
I guess our drinking sessions
weren't in vain.

442
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:45,160
Don't worry,

443
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,792
Military Beau of the Xu family.

444
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,552
We'll spar again

445
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,231
when I'm back.

446
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,271
I hope you won't
lose too terribly next time.

447
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:53,481
No one knows

448
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,431
who'll be the loser next time.

449
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:57,352
See you.

450
00:18:58,802 --> 00:18:59,632
By the way,

451
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,761
I've already talked it over with Zhen.

452
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:05,041
From now on, I'll be her brother.

453
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,271
I've put down

454
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,832
my obsession.

455
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:11,711
Why did he tell me that?

456
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:16,592
Wait for my return.

457
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:24,872
Lu Shiyan.

458
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:42,312
Look.

459
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:46,352
Let's go.

460
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,032
Open it.

461
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,350
This painting was supposed
to be at Cheng Garden.

462
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:04,032
How did you get it?

463
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,241
Official Zhou was delivering medicine
to my father a few days ago.

464
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:08,100
He delivered it to me
when he went to my residence.

465
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,511
I see.

466
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,360
That old fox.

467
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:13,360
Since Official Zhou is helping you out,

468
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,352
can we pick up Eldest Princess
from the cell, then?

469
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:18,112
We shouldn't rush things.

470
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:20,001
It's better if we don't

471
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,120
alert our enemies.

472
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,112
Understood?

473
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,160
If so, can we at least

474
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,471
visit her?

475
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,681
Now, you're concerned about
your future mother-in-law, huh?

476
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:29,281
You!

477
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:30,072
What?

478
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,152
You must

479
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:35,801
be careful.

480
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,152
If you want to look for me,

481
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:38,560
you should notify Miss Xu.

482
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,961
She's living at Su Residence too.

483
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:40,521
All right.

484
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,832
I was wondering
who was talking about me.

485
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,400
Let me make this clear.

486
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,201
I'm only responsible for
relaying messages.

487
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:47,671
I don't relay love messages.

488
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:50,152
Miss Xu, I'll be in your debt, then.

489
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:51,471
You guys may continue.

490
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:04,072
Do you like it?

491
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,352
I do.

492
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:14,441
You put a lot of fragrances

493
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,160
in this perfumed sachet.

494
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:18,671
I'm sure Eldest Princess will like it.

495
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:22,320
But you have to be careful.

496
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:23,792
Don't stuff too much into the sachet

497
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:25,552
so that it won't rupture.

498
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,191
By the way,

499
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:37,711
do you know

500
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,500
whether Official Zhou
has visited Baixiang Pavilion

501
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,120
in the past few days or not?

502
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,471
He didn't.

503
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,560
I'm sure he's too busy.

504
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,751
If not,

505
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,441
I'm sure he can
find all kinds of excuses

506
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:48,792
to come here.

507
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:51,441
How's their progress?

508
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:52,951
What else do you think?

509
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,312
He's still waiting for your sister
to make the move.

510
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:56,751
Official Zhou

511
00:21:56,762 --> 00:21:58,761
is just waiting for that.

512
00:21:58,762 --> 00:22:00,241
But my sister is

513
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:02,511
a very determined person, you know?

514
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:06,832
Sister.

515
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,632
Miss Shen Ran.

516
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:14,160
The weather is turning cold.

517
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:15,600
Fuman and I

518
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,312
were preparing some blankets.

519
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,792
You should put some poria cocos

520
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,231
in the perfumed sachet.

521
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:25,152
Sister,

522
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,872
you knew what I was doing?

523
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,352
I could smell it at the entrance.

524
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,880
Poria cocos can repel bugs
and soothe one's nerves.

525
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,951
It should be good in places like a cell.

526
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,201
You're being thoughtful
to an outsider, huh?

527
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:39,840
To avoid attention,

528
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:42,191
you made it with the same material
as the blankets in the cell.

529
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,160
Sister,

530
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,721
Official Zhou agreed to it.

531
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:47,312
I won't cause any trouble.

532
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:49,991
I didn't agree
to your relationship with him

533
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,271
because I didn't want you to suffer.

534
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,241
But since you're having
such a sweet relationship,

535
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,832
I'll give you my support.

536
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:58,320
I knew it.

537
00:22:58,321 --> 00:22:59,951
Sister, I knew you loved me the most.

538
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:18,991
Miss Man.

539
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:22,360
Official Zhou and Lu Shiyan

540
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,312
still remember your sister's existence.

541
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,560
I'm sure they can locate

542
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:26,751
your sister.

543
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:31,632
I trust them.

544
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:40,471
Sister.

545
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,392
Miss Shen Ran.

546
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:53,160
Miss Man,

547
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:55,112
teach me how to do this.

548
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:55,880
I'll teach you.

549
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:56,840
Add this.

550
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:57,632
This?

551
00:23:58,641 --> 00:23:59,911
What about this?

552
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:01,160
It's pretty good.

553
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:01,840
That's the way.

554
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:02,832
It's pretty good.

555
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:05,112
Let's go.

556
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:08,832
Miss Shen Ran,

557
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,360
I was thinking that Uncle Shen
should be finishing his medicine by now.

558
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:13,352
That's why I brought him a new batch.

559
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:17,201
You're busy with official matters.

560
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:18,400
We shouldn't trouble you

561
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:19,560
with my father's medicine.

562
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,112
I'll retrieve them myself next time.

563
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:22,671
It's fine.

564
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:25,792
I wanted to visit the place anyway.

565
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,481
Speak of the devil.

566
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:37,792
Official Zhou is here.

567
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:39,041
Maybe

568
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,392
it's because your sister
was longing for him.

569
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,112
That's why he came.

570
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:44,681
I always leave hastily

571
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,152
after visiting your residence.

572
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:47,951
Maybe

573
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:49,120
it's because the noodles

574
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,120
you made for me

575
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,271
was too delicious.

576
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:55,671
I'll make you another bowl, then.

577
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,112
Okay.

578
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:07,072
Good things are on the way.

579
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,521
This is the new appetizer I made.

580
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:14,552
Try it.

581
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:18,241
Thank you, Miss Shen Ran.

582
00:25:18,242 --> 00:25:19,552
Don't mention it.

583
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:20,560
Official Zhou,

584
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,080
we feel bad for troubling you

585
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:24,072
with Father's medicine.

586
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:28,032
Eat up, then.

587
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:55,072
Let me help you out.

588
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,792
It's fine. You should eat.

589
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:59,032
I can do it myself.

590
00:26:18,522 --> 00:26:19,632
I'm done.

Official Zhou, if you're done,
you should proceed with work matters.

605
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,711
You shouldn't delay them.

606
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,032
If so, I'll make a move first.

607
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:12,032
Why did I eat so fast?

608
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:15,552
If you like noodles,

609
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:18,792
I'll make it for you again next time.

610
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:25,792
Okay!

611
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,112
Yan?

612
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:46,552
I will wait for you outside.

613
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:52,920
Yan.

614
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:53,872
Mother.

615
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:56,080
Yan.

616
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:57,552
Mother, how are you doing?

617
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,911
I'm doing fine.

618
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,431
Yan.

619
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,671
Let me take a look at you.

620
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:07,951
By the way, Mother...

621
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,152
Come inside.

622
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:18,711
Greetings, Eldest Princess.

623
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:20,711
Miss Shen Zhen.

624
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:21,872
Mother,

625
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,400
when I was a fugitive,

626
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,441
Zhen risked her life

627
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,032
to find clues for me.

628
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:29,191
And these.

629
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,320
Zhen prepared them

630
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:32,152
for you.

631
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:34,320
I already heard about that
from Official Zhou.

632
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:36,041
Thank you, Miss Shen Zhen.

633
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,751
Eldest Princess, you're too courteous.

634
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,360
I put some fragrances

635
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,080
that can soothe the nerves

636
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,481
and repel bugs.

637
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:46,231
Maybe it can help you to sleep better.

638
00:29:48,242 --> 00:29:50,521
Since I'm in the Imperial Censorate,

639
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,592
I should follow the rules here.

640
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:53,320
I shouldn't receive

641
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:55,471
such special treatment.

642
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:02,160
This blanket is the same as the one
they have in the cell.

643
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,761
It's just that
the interior is different.

644
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,072
It's warmer.

645
00:30:05,242 --> 00:30:06,160
After all,

646
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,112
I was once imprisoned too.

647
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:09,721
I know the things

648
00:30:09,722 --> 00:30:11,180
that we can't make do with.

649
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:12,360
If you don't swap the blanket out,

650
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:14,072
you won't be able
to sleep well at night.

651
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,320
As time passes,

652
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:16,872
your body won't be able to handle it.

653
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:19,152
These are knee warmers.

654
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,711
The cell is very cold.

655
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:23,072
Your knees won't hurt

656
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:25,152
if you wear them.

657
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:27,392
I said something rude to you

658
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,120
before this.

659
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,880
Back then, I talked back to you too.

660
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,711
I even left without
observing the proper rites.

661
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,152
What happened to you two that day?

662
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:42,281
Although you suffered

663
00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:44,072
back then,

664
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,552
you didn't mention it to Yan.

665
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:47,560
And, you were willing

666
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:48,721
to take such a huge risk

667
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,592
just to locate evidence for my sake.

668
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:53,392
You're heroic and generous indeed.

669
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:56,681
If Duke Zhenguo Residence
is able to clear its name,

670
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:59,152
I'll acknowledge you
as my daughter-in-law.

671
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:01,400
Now,

672
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,792
we're involved in a case of treason.

673
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,560
I know you're repaying
my hostility with kindness.

674
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:07,201
Even so,

675
00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:09,041
I can't just implicate you.

676
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,271
Eldest Princess,

677
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:12,041
I'm sure

678
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:14,152
the journey will be perilous.

679
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,001
However, we won't give up.

680
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:18,231
We'll definitely clear your name.

681
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:20,872
Mother,

682
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:22,671
I'll definitely

683
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,560
get to the bottom of this.

684
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:25,761
Yan,

685
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:28,832
this case isn't as simple as it seems.

686
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,231
I have confidence in myself.

687
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:33,072
Mother, don't worry.

688
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:34,632
It won't take long.

689
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:39,352
Thank you, my son.

690
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:47,032
Zhen, thank you

691
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,471
for everything.

692
00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:59,072
By the way, Mother,

693
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:01,592
I need to confirm something with you.

694
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:03,080
They found a jade bangle

695
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:04,120
in your room

696
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,711
when they were searching the residence.

697
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,911
It was the item left behind
by Zhen's mother for her.

698
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:09,880
Why did it

699
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:11,471
appear in your room?

700
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:13,241
Official Zhou

701
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:14,241
asked me the same question

702
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:15,632
a few days ago.

703
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,991
Back then, I told him
that I hadn't seen it before.

704
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:18,961
But after some

705
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:20,471
recalling,

706
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:23,120
I think Her Majesty

707
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:24,761
gave it to me

708
00:32:24,762 --> 00:32:26,160
when I delivered fabrics to her

709
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:27,991
in the palace.

710
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,281
She said she liked it

711
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,721
when the crown prince showed it to her.

712
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:33,560
Thus, His Highness gave it to her.

713
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:37,001
Yan, you knew that I didn't
care about fancy items like that.

714
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,721
I forgot about it

715
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:40,481
after taking a random look.

716
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:43,112
That's why I couldn't remember
where I saw it before.

717
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:49,640
So, Eldest Princess, according to you,

718
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:51,112
His Highness's men

719
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,592
were the ones who stole my jade bangle.

720
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:55,001
Could it be

721
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:56,481
that the word "Chen"

722
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:58,152
is referring to the crown prince?

723
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:01,880
His Majesty

724
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:04,090
has been unsatisfied with His Highness
for the past few years.

725
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,632
He reprimanded him constantly.

726
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:10,640
It's not impossible for His Highness...

727
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:13,471
To consolidate his position

728
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:15,511
in advance.

729
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,991
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

730
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,431
We have to gather
the necessary evidence.

731
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:38,400
Last year,

732
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:39,481
the droughts were terrible.

733
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:41,160
Luckily, Mr. Ge did

734
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:43,471
a rain ritual for us.

735
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:46,600
As long as Mr. Ge prays for us,

736
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:48,241
everything will go smoothly

737
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:49,840
and we'll get what we wish for.

738
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:50,911
That's amazing.

739
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:51,761
Say,

740
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:53,832
do Mr. Ge's prayers truly work?

741
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:55,281
Mr. Ge

742
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:57,290
is capable of summoning
auspicious phenomena, you know?

743
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:58,600
Auspicious phenomena?

744
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,521
Doesn't that mean

745
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,592
he can ensure
the country's peace and safety?

746
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:04,681
Mr. Ge, please summon
auspicious phenomena

747
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:06,160
to ensure
the country's peace and safety.

748
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:09,201
Mr. Ge, please summon
auspicious phenomena

749
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:11,711
to ensure
the country's peace and safety.

750
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:40,320
Amazing!

751
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:41,960
I actually saw a phoenix!

752
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:42,520
It's a phoenix!

753
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:43,632
He's a celestial Taoist indeed!

754
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,960
It's a real phoenix!

755
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,601
Mr. Ge has great fortune!

756
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:48,751
Mr. Ge has great fortune!

757
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:10,632
A phoenix?

758
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:13,711
That's nonsense.

759
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,831
Your Majesty, we've already changed
your prescriptions several times,

760
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,480
but your condition

761
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:21,311
never improved.

762
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:25,072
Bad things have been happening
one after another

763
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:27,400
after the collapse of the West Canal.

764
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:29,072
The people are
worried about their future.

765
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:31,391
And, it's bothering me.

766
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,912
How can I recover from this condition?

767
00:35:34,162 --> 00:35:35,311
Your Majesty.

768
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,632
It's because you're concerned about
the nation and its people.

769
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,681
Why don't I invite Mr. Ge

770
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:46,271
to hold a praying ceremony

771
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,681
to seek blessings for you

772
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:49,552
and your people, Your Majesty?

773
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:52,801
I heard that he was successful in
seeking rain for dry land last year.

774
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:54,360
And, he saved a lot of disaster victims.

775
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,912
I assume he's capable
to a certain extent.

776
00:35:57,562 --> 00:36:00,391
I'm sure it's just a mere coincidence.

777
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:03,000
Your Majesty,

778
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,920
you should give it a try.

779
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:07,311
This way, the people can rest at ease.

780
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:10,592
All right, then.

781
00:36:10,642 --> 00:36:12,271
You can make the arrangements.

782
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:15,191
Let the crown prince
host the ceremony by then.

783
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:19,601
If so, why don't we let Official Zhou

784
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:21,281
invite Mr. Ge here?

785
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:22,440
Your Majesty, what do you think?

786
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,311
I'll follow your arrangements.

787
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:25,632
Yes, Your Majesty.

788
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:42,241
Seems like someone has become listless

789
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,440
ever since

790
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:45,831
Official Su left the county.

791
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:47,681
What?

792
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:48,880
I promised Su Heng

793
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:50,681
that I would capture Pang Hu.

794
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:51,400
In the end,

795
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:53,552
he's nowhere to be found.

796
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:56,032
So, it's because of Heng, huh?

797
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:59,152
We're unrelated!

798
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,121
Have you guys heard of

799
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:05,351
Mr. Ge before?

800
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:07,081
I heard that he could summon
auspicious phenomena

801
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:08,472
and that his prayers did work.

802
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:10,281
I think Official Zhou was sent out

803
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:12,081
to receive Mr. Ge.

804
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:14,231
I heard that they'd holding
a prayer ceremony for the people.

805
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:15,480
Auspicious phenomena?

806
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:16,632
I'm interested in that.

807
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:24,472
Miss Xu,

808
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,032
do you know

809
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:27,721
whether Official Zhou

810
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:29,472
is engaged or not?

811
00:37:30,441 --> 00:37:31,081
Don't tell me

812
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,552
you fell for Official Zhou?

813
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:35,641
Official Zhou is good-looking

814
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:37,072
and honest.

815
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:39,152
What's so bad about him?

816
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:41,480
Yeah.

817
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:42,840
Official Zhou is a great guy.

818
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:43,960
I'll inquire about it

819
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,231
later.

820
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:46,440
By the way,

821
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:48,161
speaking of Mr. Ge,

822
00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:49,040
I want him

823
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,601
to pray for my sister

824
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,871
so that we can be reunited soon.

825
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,751
Miss Shen Ran,

826
00:37:54,802 --> 00:37:55,681
why don't we

827
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:57,721
join Miss Man?

828
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:59,040
Maybe it'll work better that way.

829
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,400
Miss Shen Ran,

830
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:02,320
why don't we head there together?

831
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,201
Come on.

832
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:04,311
Let's head there together.

833
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:10,191
All right. Let's head there together.

834
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:16,681
I don't think the carriage can be fixed

835
00:38:16,682 --> 00:38:17,992
in a short time.

836
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:19,191
Yeah.

837
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:24,791
What should we do, then?

838
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:27,671
Mr. Zhang,

839
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,561
you can stay here and fix the carriage.

840
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:30,990
I'll take them
to the top of the mountain.

841
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:31,632
All right.

842
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:32,992
Let's go.

843
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:38,992
Miss Shen Ran.

844
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,432
Isn't that Official Zhou?

845
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:55,912
Official Zhou.

846
00:38:57,242 --> 00:38:58,552
Miss Shen Ran,

847
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,391
where are you guys going?

848
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:02,912
We plan to seek Mr. Ge out
for his prayers.

849
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:06,400
Your carriage has broken down.

850
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:07,761
If you don't mind,

851
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,850
you guys can take my carriage.

852
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:09,952
We're going

853
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,152
in the same direction anyway.

854
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:12,632
I don't mind.

855
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:14,671
Please.

856
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:21,632
Miss Shen Ran?

857
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,831
Thank you, Official Zhou.

858
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:26,641
Official Zhou,

859
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,641
do you desire something too?

860
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:30,952
Is that why you're seeking Mr. Ge out
for his prayers?

861
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,231
Although I do desire something,

862
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:36,552
I don't depend on superstition.

863
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,432
I only depend on myself.

864
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,000
You see,

865
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:41,320
you can obtain most of the things

866
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:43,391
in the world through effort alone.

867
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,191
However,
when it comes to a relationship,

868
00:40:45,202 --> 00:40:46,711
you require affinity.

869
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:48,391
Official Zhou,

870
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:50,711
do you have anyone you fancy?

871
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:52,201
Why don't you pray to the heavens

872
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,721
so that you two can become a couple?

873
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:54,912
I just do my best.

874
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:57,072
If so, I won't regret it.

875
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:58,880
Official Zhou, sounds like

876
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:01,472
you have someone you fancy.

877
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:02,320
If so,

878
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:04,512
may I know the type of person

879
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,552
you fancy?

880
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,751
She's gentle, kind,

881
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,231
intelligent, and resilient.

882
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:16,400
She's the best woman

883
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:17,641
I've ever seen

884
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,751
in my life.

885
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:21,032
However,

886
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:23,351
she often takes care of other people

887
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:25,552
without taking care of herself.

888
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,112
Therefore,

889
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:30,391
I wish to go to her side
and take care of her.

890
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:50,351
It's raining.

891
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:52,231
Official Zhou,

892
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:53,201
why don't we

893
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:55,112
resume our journey
after the rain has stopped?

894
00:41:57,122 --> 00:41:58,152
What do you think?

895
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,072
Anything is fine.

896
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,200
(Yanyu Teahouse)

897
00:42:25,722 --> 00:42:26,711
Go now.

898
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,632
Have some warm tea. It'll keep you warm.

899
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:08,432
Thank you.

900
00:43:10,682 --> 00:43:12,711
Miss Shen Ran,
are you seeking Mr. Ge out

901
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:14,320
so that you can pray for your father

902
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:15,871
and your sister?

903
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:17,751
Yes,

904
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:20,831
but not entirely.

905
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:27,992
Official Zhou,
I wish to pray for you too.

906
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:53,360
Stay inside. Don't come out.

907
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:54,032
All right.

908
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:20,351
Run!

909
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:21,231
Run!

910
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:28,271
Run!

911
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:36,512
Zhou Shu'an!

912
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:42,391
Shen Ran!

913
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:46,791
Shen Ran!

914
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:49,791
Official Zhou!

915
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:50,520
After him!

916
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:50,960
Yes, sir!

917
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:51,952
Shen Ran!

918
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:57,791
Shen Ran!

919
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,472
Shen Ran!

920
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,032
Shen Ran!

921
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:02,751
Shen Ran!

922
00:45:03,921 --> 00:45:05,512
Why were you so silly?

923
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,632
Because I didn't want you

924
00:45:10,122 --> 00:45:11,952
to get hurt.

925
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:21,351
