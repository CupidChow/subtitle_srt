Okay.

20

Father.

21
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:13,129
How's Ran?

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,337
The blade was laced with poison.

23
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:15,457
The poison is unknown.

24
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,088
I need to investigate further.

25
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,208
What?

26
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:19,129
Father.

27
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,248
Father.

28
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:23,329
Miss Man,

29
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,928
no matter what method

30
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:28,528
or the cost,

31
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,849
save her.

32
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,538
Official Zhou, you can rest assured.

33
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,248
I will do my best.

34
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,337
Miss Shen Zhen. Miss Xu.

35
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,329
Can you stay and help me?

36
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:42,778
Official Zhou. Official Lu.

37
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:43,938
Take Uncle Shen

38
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,208
outside to wait.

39
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:47,248
Come.

40
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:49,968
Uncle,

41
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,889
let's go and get some fresh air.

42
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,528
I'll be right back.

43
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:22,409
Everything will be all right.

44
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:25,049
Miss Man's medical skills

45
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,329
are very impressive.

46
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:34,857
She took the blow for me.

47
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:36,729
She has you in her heart.

48
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,329
Where the heart goes,

49
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,889
so does the will.

50
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:43,569
I...

51
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:45,457
I would rather have taken that blow

52
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,849
myself.

53
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,129
She is suffering now.

54
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,889
Yet, I can't do anything.

55
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,609
Don't say that.

56
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,009
If it were you inside

57
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,208
and her waiting outside,

58
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,088
do you think she would feel at ease?

59
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:08,818
When two hearts are in tune,

60
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,409
if anything happens to either one,

61
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:14,368
it brings pain to both.

62
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,289
Who wanted to kill me?

63
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:22,248
It should be Pang Hu's people.

64
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:24,049
Pang Hu?

65
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,849
Then he must have the antidote.

66
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,248
Where is he now?

67
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:30,769
Don't worry.

68
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,209
I will find their whereabouts.

69
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:51,688
Official Lu!

70
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:52,818
Don't you want

71
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,368
to call a physician to check on him?

72
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:56,738
Oh, he's all right.

73
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:57,888
All right?

74
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,298
The last time we had dinner

75
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,657
with Uncle Shen,

76
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:02,498
Official Lu

77
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,017
suddenly fainted just like this.

78
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:06,089
He might have some hidden illness.

79
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,537
It's considered an old ailment.

80
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:10,577
But it's nothing serious.

81
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:12,049
Don't worry, Official Zhou.

82
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,049
Well, anything you say.

83
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:20,498
But

84
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,169
if he keeps lying down like this,

85
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,698
when can we discuss

86
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,498
catching Pang Hu?

87
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:26,769
He'll wake up soon.

88
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,537
It's true. I'm not lying, Official Zhou.

89
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,928
He'll wake up soon?

90
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,488
(When you read this letter,)

91
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:48,649
(I may be heading to the north.)

92
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,137
(The tragedy
of the Shen family years ago)

93
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:52,928
(is still vivid in my mind.)

94
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,448
(My safety and that of my family)

95
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,808
(are all thanks to your care.)

96
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,568
(I have nothing to repay you with,)

97
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:01,808
(but I know you will not abandon me.)

98
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,888
(I once wanted)

99
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:06,049
(to be a lowly servant by your side.)

100
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:11,529
(Upon hearing of your betrothal,)

101
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:14,217
(I realized my hopes were in vain.)

102
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:17,289
(I know that none of this
was your intention,)

103
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:20,808
(but I also know
that fate is hard to change.)

104
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,058
(Time passes like smoke,)

105
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,808
(and the past turns to dust.)

106
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,928
(We cannot predict the future.)

107
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,888
(Please take care of yourself.)

108
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:38,888
Official Lu,

109
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,649
did you have a nightmare just now?

110
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,649
Are you all right?

111
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:47,649
I'm all right.

112
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,248
What's the plan

113
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,849
for tomorrow?

114
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,049
Don't worry.

115
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,169
I've made the arrangements.

116
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:57,529
All right, then.

117
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,849
If you're all right,

118
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:01,858
I'm going to check on Miss Shen Ran.

119
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:02,858
Miss Shen Ran

120
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,529
should be fine now.

121
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,089
How do you know?

122
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:11,248
Connections of hearts.

123
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,378
The eternal Crown Prince!

124
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,169
The sage of great blessings!

125
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:31,977
The eternal Crown Prince!

126
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:34,849
The sage of great blessings!

127
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,337
You delayed my mother's case

128
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:46,618
on purpose

129
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,209
and went after Pang Hu.

130
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,498
They won't let you go that easily.

131
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:51,969
The prayer ceremony

132
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,137
is the best opportunity.

133
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,609
I'll go with you.

134
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:58,008
First, to protect you.

135
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:01,128
Second, to capture Pang Hu.

136
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,128
Pray for blessings!

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,938
During last year's drought,

138
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:22,657
it was Mr. Ge

139
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:24,178
who prayed for rain

140
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,217
that

141
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,328
saved our people.

142
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,058
Yes.

143
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,769
We are considered fortunate.

144
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,328
Pray!

145
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:40,129
Offerings!

146
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:45,848
Today,

147
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:48,889
I pray with Mr. Ge

148
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:53,289
for national prosperity and peace,
and for favorable weather.

149
00:08:58,258 --> 00:08:58,977
Look.

150
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:00,538
- Look!
- Crows!

151
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,457
They're truly crows.

152
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,217
So many crows.

153
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:03,289
How can this be?

154
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,529
Crows?

155
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,097
Protect the Crown Prince!

156
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,208
Don't panic.

157
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:33,649
The Crown Prince is blocking
the nation's fortune!

158
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:36,898
How ominous!

159
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:37,857
It's a bad omen!

160
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:38,337
That's right.

161
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:39,769
What's going on here?

162
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:48,497
What should we do now?

163
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:49,968
What now?

164
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,249
Mister, Ge,

165
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:02,489
what's going on?

166
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:13,577
Your Highness,

167
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:16,289
someone has blocked your fortune.

168
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:19,418
The Crown Prince is the future
of the country.

169
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,658
If his fortune is not good,

170
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,208
it will affect the fortune
of the entire country.

171
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:24,529
Who is that person?

172
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:26,818
Your Highness,

173
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:29,328
it's an ominous girl

174
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,457
who was born in the year of Guisi,

175
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,489
the month of Yisi, the day of Guiwei,
and the hour of Jiayin.

176
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:37,769
(It's Zhen's birth chart.)

177
00:10:58,819 --> 00:10:59,928
Miss Shen Zhen,

178
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,377
are Guisi, Yisi, Guiwei, and Jiayin

179
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:05,457
on your birth chart?

180
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,377
Yes.

181
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:07,818
Did anything happen?

182
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:10,138
Mr. Ge made a divine calculation
that there is an ominous woman

183
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,497
blocking the Crown Prince's fortune

184
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:12,848
and has revealed her birth chart.

185
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,217
Official Lu realized it was you

186
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,769
and asked me to warn you.

187
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,328
Target me?

188
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,049
Could this be a coincidence?

189
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,337
I think Mr. Ge

190
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:22,298
is suspicious.

191
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,818
This move is not favorable to you.

192
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:25,328
You must be very careful.

193
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,448
All right, I understand.

194
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,208
I'll go and inform them.

195
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,178
I heard this is Baixiang Pavilion, right?

196
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:32,938
Yes.

197
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,658
The ominous woman lives here.

198
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:35,577
That's right.

199
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,290
That is what I heard too.
She lives right here.

200
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,898
It's really unlucky.

201
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,568
Come out quickly.

202
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:42,808
Miss,

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,457
there is a group of people outside

204
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,138
pointing fingers at our shop.

205
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,938
Do you know what's going on?

206
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,298
Mr. Ge said

207
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,889
I'm the ominous woman.

208
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,337
I will go and close the shop now.

209
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,169
No, wait.

210
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,018
The news spread so quickly.

211
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,298
There must be something fishy.

212
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,577
Closing the shop now

213
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,018
will make me look guilty.

214
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,049
You're right.

215
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,298
Deliver the medicine to Ran first.

216
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,049
All right.

217
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,938
As soon as Shen Zhen comes out,

218
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,169
grab her

219
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:20,289
to lure Lu Shiyan out.

220
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,529
- Yes.
- Yes.

221
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,178
If Miss Shen Zhen

222
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,448
is really the ominous person
Mr. Ge mentioned,

223
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:29,489
then this is probably

224
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:31,848
their next move.

225
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,208
They framed the Eldest Princess

226
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:38,208
and turned you into a wanted criminal.

227
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,129
This was their first move.

228
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,728
They stopped me
from investigating the case further

229
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,769
and sent someone to secretly kill me

230
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:46,369
was their second move.

231
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,457
Now, putting Miss Shen Zhen in danger

232
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,088
is their third move.

233
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,337
They are probably trying

234
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,658
to lure you out.

235
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,848
Their goal is
to delay the investigation.

236
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,688
They put us into predicaments
so we'd be too busy to take care of ourselves.

237
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,688
They are probably acting soon.

238
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,138
But during the prayer ceremony today,

239
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,497
that Mr. Ge could mention

240
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:03,857
Miss Shen Zhen's birth chart

241
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:04,857
is not that difficult.

242
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:07,337
It's just a matter of secretly investigating
and informing him of it.

243
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,448
However,

244
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,617
how do we explain

245
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:12,818
the countless crows attacking

246
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:14,138
the altar and the Crown Prince

247
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,337
so precisely?

248
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,178
It should be Mr. Ge

249
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:17,608
using deceptive methods.

250
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:20,249
Did you find anything?

251
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,418
I was curious about this subject before.

252
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,497
So I studied this matter.

253
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:25,377
In this world,

254
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:27,457
there is no such thing
as immortal magic.

255
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,049
It's just some tricks.

256
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,097
When Mr. Ge summoned

257
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,377
the phoenix previously,

258
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,848
it was just an illusion.

259
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,178
Praying for rain

260
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,049
is just observing celestial phenomena.

261
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:37,257
But this time,

262
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:39,088
I haven't figured it out

263
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:42,009
about the crows yet.

264
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:45,009
If this is true,

265
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:45,857
they want

266
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,217
to use this prayer ceremony

267
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:50,249
to damage the Crown Prince's image
in the hearts of the people.

268
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:53,489
They're making the Crown Prince
lose the people's hearts.

269
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,568
From the looks of it,

270
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,728
the character "Chen"

271
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,369
can rule out the Crown Prince.

272
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,898
If the Crown Prince had planned it,

273
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:04,698
he would not

274
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,298
have made himself appear inauspicious

275
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:07,737
during his own ceremony

276
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,289
and tarnished his reputation
for no reason.

277
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:12,608
Looking at the planning
of this prayer ceremony,

278
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,649
there may be even greater conspiracies.

279
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:18,938
Master,

280
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:20,298
what do you think we should do?

281
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:20,778
Now,

282
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,377
only Mr. Ge and Pang Hu
are in the light.

283
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:23,778
We should start with them

284
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,698
to get clues.

285
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,058
Miss Xu, you can go to the altar first

286
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:27,497
to see if there's anything unusual.

287
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:28,400
Yang Zong and Chuyi

288
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,658
will take some men to secretly search
for Pang Hu's whereabouts.

289
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:31,257
Yes, sir.

290
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:33,409
The altar is now guarded
by the Imperial Censorate.

291
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:35,249
I'll have Chuyi take you there.

292
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,337
I'll return to the palace first

293
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:39,568
and report the prayer ceremony
to the Emperor.

294
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:16,529
Did you find anything?

295
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,608
The smell of the incense is suspicious.

296
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,577
(Su Residence)

297
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:37,418
Master,

298
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,097
we have not yet found
Pang Hu's whereabouts.

299
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:41,058
He's hiding quite well.

300
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,129
Official Lu.

301
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:45,818
Is there any news from the palace?

302
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,217
The Emperor is not feeling well.

303
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,058
The Empress is taking care of him.

304
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:49,938
After I reported

305
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,337
to the Emperor,

306
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,658
the Empress suggested

307
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:53,938
holding another prayer ceremony

308
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,138
in three days,

309
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,538
saying it was an undeserved calamity

310
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,600
for the prayer ceremony
to have caused the Crown Prince

311
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:00,898
to lose the people's hearts.

312
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,018
Hold another praying ceremony?

313
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:02,737
Yes.

314
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,538
She said it was to help the Crown Prince

315
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,409
to dispel the omen.

316
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,009
The Empress

317
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:09,938
really does think

318
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,928
about the Crown Prince all the time.

319
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,457
You mean...

320
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,649
Do you still remember

321
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,658
the bangle found
at the Duke Zhenguo Residence?

322
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,257
I asked my mother about it after that.

323
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,698
She said the Empress gave it to her.

324
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,058
But the Empress said

325
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,818
it was the Crown Prince
who gave it to her.

326
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,728
I was suspicious
of the Crown Prince before.

327
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,298
But judging from today's incident...

328
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,049
The character "Chen"

329
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:31,928
is pointing at the Sixth Prince.

330
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,138
But the Sixth Prince is simple-minded,

331
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,257
young,

332
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:39,808
and close with the Crown Prince.

333
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,369
So

334
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:44,208
the mastermind

335
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:49,088
is the Empress?

336
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:58,769
She framed and used

337
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,497
my mother

338
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:02,129
to take the fall of her crimes

339
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:05,249
to buy time so she could make her move.

340
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,618
The prayer ceremony

341
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,098
was used to taint
the Crown Prince's image

342
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,969
so he would lose
the hearts of the people.

343
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:14,368
She wants to hold
another prayer ceremony.

344
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:16,929
What is she up to?

345
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:19,689
By the way,

346
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,009
Commandment Su sent a letter saying

347
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:24,408
there are many refugees in the suburbs.

348
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:25,888
Refugees?

349
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,328
There was indeed a disaster this year.

350
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,618
But the court has provided relief.

351
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,808
So there shouldn't be so many refugees.

352
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,088
So those aren't refugees

353
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:39,777
but private troops?

354
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:42,168
With the Crown Prince's
position in jeopardy,

355
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:44,737
the Empress will surely take action.

356
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,529
To usurp the position
for the Sixth Prince.

357
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:48,249
Usurp position?

358
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:51,418
I didn't expect that.

359
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,457
I always thought

360
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,618
the Empress's biggest dream

361
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,249
was to become a seamstress.

362
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:56,098
I didn't expect her

363
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:57,568
to have such ambitions.

364
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,777
How's it going on your end?

365
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,328
I looked around the altar.

366
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:01,817
The smell of the incense

367
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:02,969
was suspicious.

368
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,209
As for the crows,

369
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:05,098
I suspect

370
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,457
they've been trained by someone.

371
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,689
But I need to investigate further.

372
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,399
The Empress is probably going to act
in three days during the prayer ceremony.

373
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,888
We need to speed up.

374
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:12,888
Miss Xu,

375
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:14,217
continue investigating Mr. Ge.

376
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,378
Yang Zong and Chuyi,
go and find out about those refugees.

377
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:17,200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:18,969
I'll search for Pang Hu with you.

379
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:19,817
Now,

380
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:20,898
Miss Shen Ran's condition

381
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:21,858
hasn't improved.

382
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:23,497
You should go
to Baixiang Pavilion first.

383
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:24,769
Maybe you can protect them.

384
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:26,368
You know

385
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:28,769
that's where our weaknesses are.

386
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,168
All right.

387
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:34,249
If there are any developments,

388
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:36,017
we'll meet here.

389
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:36,808
Okay.

390
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:45,769
Miss Xu,

391
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:49,689
Commandant Su has a letter for you.

392
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,209
Why did he write a letter to me?

393
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,368
Forget it if you don't want it.

394
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,848
I never said I don't want it.

395
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,858
(Xu Yiqing Only)

396
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,098
I'm sure this brat

397
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,529
is going to nag at me again.

398
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,408
Let me see what it is
that you have to nag about.

399
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,777
(I've never seen)

400
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,178
(such beautiful scenery along the way.)

401
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,217
(Like you said,)

402
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,737
(open my heart)

403
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:22,608
(and feel everything around me
with sincerity.)

404
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:23,977
(It would be great)

405
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:25,578
(if we could travel together.)

406
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:27,049
(After this matter is settled,)

407
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,769
(how about we can go south together?)

408
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:32,009
I don't want to travel with you.

409
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,178
Is this where Shen Zhen is living?

410
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:42,977
Yes.

411
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:44,777
The ominous girl is right here.

412
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:47,618
She caused her mother's death
when she was born.

413
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,378
That's intense.

414
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,938
Then she caused her father
to be imprisoned

415
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,200
and the Shen family fell.

416
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:52,497
She's really a star of ill fortune.

417
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:53,057
That's right.

418
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,618
Exactly.

419
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:55,500
Say, if there's someone like her
in the family,

420
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,098
it's like being unlucky
for eight generations.

421
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:57,578
That's right.

422
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,529
That's sure bad luck
for eight generations.

423
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:00,888
Go away!

424
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,297
Are you done?

425
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,689
We're the ones who have bad luck
to run into all of you!

426
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:05,618
What are you saying?

427
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,898
How could you scold us?

428
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:08,217
You call her the ominous woman.

429
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,449
Do you have any evidence?

430
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:13,418
- Sir.
- Sir.

431
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,938
This news is spreading like wildfire.

432
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,858
Shouldn't you explain this to everyone?

433
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,578
- That's right.
- He should explain, right?

434
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:19,898
Or maybe

435
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,929
she can come out and confirm it.

436
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:23,817
At the Imperial Censorate,

437
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:26,009
we emphasize evidence.

438
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,098
Without any evidence,

439
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,457
you're here

440
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,888
falsely accusing others!

441
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,497
Do you know this is an offense?

442
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,178
Let's stop talking.

443
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,209
If there's really a problem in the city,

444
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:38,737
the Imperial Censorate
and the Magistrate Office

445
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,888
will ensure the safety of the people.

446
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,328
- Let's go.
- Come on.

447
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:47,408
Come on, let's go.

448
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:48,969
Let's go.

449
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:10,808
How is she?

450
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:12,858
I've learned

451
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:13,737
about this poison

452
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,297
and need some rare herbs.

453
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:16,800
I need to go out of the city
to find them.

454
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:17,497
Leave the city?

455
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:19,497
I've asked all the apothecaries
in the city.

456
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:21,368
But none of them
have the three herbs I want.

457
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,750
These people
would really stop at nothing.

458
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,578
It's really hard to find this medicine,
to begin with.

459
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,529
I'll hurry out of the city to find it.

460
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:30,737
Thank you, Miss Man.

461
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:31,888
You're welcome.

462
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:33,817
I've given her some medicine

463
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:34,817
that can temporarily

464
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:35,888
slow down the poison.

465
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,289
It should delay it

466
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:39,769
for a few days.

467
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:40,969
A few days?

468
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,729
What do you mean?

469
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,209
We must find the antidote

470
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:48,368
within three days.

471
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,648
I'll go and search
for the medicine first.

472
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:55,128
Miss Man, I'll see you out.

473
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:18,457
Are you trying

474
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,128
to push my hand away

475
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:22,938
and then politely say

476
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:24,408
this to me,

477
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,608
"No need to trouble you, Official Zhou"?

478
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:33,009
I'm going to hold on to you.

479
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,049
I'll firmly grab hold of you.

480
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,017
Before this,

481
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,457
you always acted indifferent

482
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,368
toward me.

483
00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:49,848
Thankfully,

484
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:53,328
I now understand your feelings.

485
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:57,168
When you said

486
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,769
you were praying for me that day,

487
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,408
do you know

488
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:09,929
how happy I was?

489
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:15,698
These past few years,

490
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:18,249
I've never been so happy.

491
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:22,289
I finally waited for you to reciprocate.

492
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:29,168
I'm sure

493
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:31,888
you're not happy
to be in this state, right?

494
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:34,289
Shen Ran,

495
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,769
you're strong.

496
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:38,698
I believe

497
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:41,209
you'll get through this.

498
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:43,529
There are still

499
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,328
many things

500
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,289
we haven't done

501
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:57,929
and many things we haven't said.

502
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,088
I can't live without you

503
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,648
in this life.

504
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,049
Let's go.

505
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,049
Come here.

506
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,858
The crows flew

507
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:09,489
from this direction.

508
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:19,088
Test their skills.

509
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,777
This is my ancestral home.

510
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:23,977
What are you doing here?

511
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:24,898
Leave! Get out of here!

512
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,098
We're resting here.

513
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,977
Who says you can rest here?
This is my ancestral home.

514
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:28,977
You can't rest here.

515
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:30,449
I'm taking you to the officials!

516
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,618
I said I'm taking you
to report this to the officials!

517
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,049
Do you hear me?

518
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:36,408
I said...

519
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,560
All right. You can rest here.

520
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:41,817
Go on resting.

521
00:25:41,818 --> 00:25:44,057
Fine, I'm reporting this
to the officials!

522
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:44,457
Let's go.

523
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,658
Just you wait!

524
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,209
A bunch of unreasonable rogues!

525
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,457
They come from a military background.

526
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,850
That was military combat skill too.

527
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:52,969
(It's the same incense from the altar.)

528
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,489
So that explains everything.

529
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:35,418
I was the midwife

530
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,017
who delivered Shen Zhen back then.

531
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:38,737
The birth chart that Mr. Ge mentioned

532
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:39,817
is hers.

533
00:27:39,818 --> 00:27:41,378
- It's hers.
- It's really hers.

534
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:42,418
If you ask me,

535
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:43,698
as long as she's around,

536
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:46,168
her family will land
into trouble sooner or later.

537
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:48,529
What a disaster.

538
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:51,698
Not only is Shen Zhen ill-fated

539
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:53,338
and brings harm to her family,

540
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,057
but she also harms the country
and the people.

541
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:56,537
- You're right!
- She's harming us!

542
00:27:56,538 --> 00:27:57,898
We need to think of a solution.

543
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,328
Many people will be implicated, then.

544
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:00,938
Miss,

545
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:01,898
it's too noisy outside.

546
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:03,297
Do you want me to chase them away?

547
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:04,098
Ran is inside.

548
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,618
She shouldn't be disturbed.

549
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,017
If I don't go out,

550
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,529
they'll keep making a ruckus.

551
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,537
She's coming out.

552
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:11,700
- She's coming out.
- That's her.

553
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:12,689
- That's her.
- That's her.

554
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:16,698
You keep saying

555
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:18,017
I'm the ominous girl mentioned.

556
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:19,328
Do you have any evidence?

557
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,990
You were born with Guisi, Yisi,
Guiwei, and Jiayin in your birth chart.

558
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,737
It's your birth chart. So it's you!

559
00:28:23,738 --> 00:28:25,858
You said you delivered me.

560
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:26,698
Then tell me

561
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:27,777
where I was born?

562
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:28,990
Of course, at the Shen Residence.

563
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,378
Where else could it be?

564
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,858
- That's right.
- It has to be at the Shen Residence.

565
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:34,537
Then what does my birthmark

566
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:35,777
look like?

567
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:38,138
I don't know the shape of the birthmark.

568
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:39,178
Who can remember

569
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:40,888
such a small birthmark?

570
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:43,977
I don't have any birthmarks on my arm.

571
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:45,929
You were clearly lying.

572
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:47,737
Maybe I was mistaken.

573
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:49,017
It's a tiny birthmark.

574
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,138
Who can remember that clearly?

575
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,168
You've been lying.

576
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:53,729
I forgot to tell you something.

577
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:55,178
The midwife who delivered me

578
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,168
had passed away two years ago.

579
00:28:57,978 --> 00:28:59,057
- What?
- Passed away?

580
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:00,457
So you're saying you were the midwife.

581
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,257
Don't tell me

582
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:03,168
you climbed out from the pit.

583
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:04,950
-What are you saying?
-Don't listen to her nonsense.

584
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,977
Capture this cursed woman!

585
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,537
Yes, capture her!

586
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,138
Capture her!

587
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:09,929
-What are you doing?
-Capture her!

588
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,729
What are you doing?

589
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,729
Let her go!

590
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,328
Let her go!

591
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:29,138
It's him.

592
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:30,338
He's the wanted criminal.

593
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:30,938
Wanted criminal!

594
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,969
Catch him! Catch him!

595
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,190
Don't run!

596
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:35,057
- Don't run!
- After them!

597
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:35,858
What are you doing?

598
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:36,457
Run!

599
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,888
- Stop right there!
- Catch him!

600
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:39,689
Stop!

601
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:42,138
Get him!

602
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:42,969
Out of the way!

603
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,858
-Stop right there!
-Make way! Make way!

604
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:45,378
Stop!

605
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:45,977
Run!

606
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:46,929
Stop!

607
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:52,689
After him! Get him!

608
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:54,328
Over here, quickly!

609
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:55,578
Stop!

610
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:56,368
Over here.

611
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:57,777
Wanted criminal!

612
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:58,689
Over there!

613
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,249
It was so dangerous.

614
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:07,088
You shouldn't have shown up.

615
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,578
I can't watch you

616
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:11,057
let them take you away.

617
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:11,817
But...

618
00:30:11,818 --> 00:30:12,618
Don't worry.

619
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:14,408
We've concluded

620
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,009
that the mastermind

621
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:17,929
is the Empress.

622
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,300
The Empress?

623
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,900
The praying ceremony
on the day after tomorrow

624
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:22,489
will be the day she makes her move.

625
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:23,737
But my current lead

626
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,938
is only Pang Hu.

627
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:26,729
We must catch him as soon as possible.

628
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:28,497
I saw Pang Hu.

629
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:29,457
We can't

630
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,009
let her stay here.

631
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:36,209
Over there!

632
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:37,808
- Hurry!
- After him!

633
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,098
It seems

634
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:43,848
Pang Hu orchestrated this.

635
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,568
If I let him capture me,

636
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,178
we'll have a chance to capture him.

637
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:47,938
I can't let you

638
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:48,858
put yourself in danger.

639
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,098
But Pang Hu

640
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,648
is the most important lead now.

641
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:53,289
I don't want to give up.

642
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:55,049
We can't give up either.

643
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:58,168
They want to catch you

644
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,209
to lure me out.

645
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:01,529
In that case,

646
00:31:01,978 --> 00:31:04,049
I'll lure Pang Hu out.

647
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,689
Trust me.

648
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:13,257
This sachet

649
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:14,618
is made of peony flowers

650
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,138
and rosemary.

651
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:17,338
After you're captured,

652
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:19,128
use it to leave a trail.

653
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:20,848
I'll definitely find you.

654
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,249
Okay.

655
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:28,049
Be careful.

656
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:38,969
You too.

657
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:48,888
Wear this

658
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:50,568
to protect yourself.

659
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,938
Where did he go?

660
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,009
Where is he?

661
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:57,009
Where is he?

662
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:58,737
You can't run away now!

663
00:31:58,738 --> 00:31:59,729
Stop right there!

664
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:04,529
Behave!

665
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:06,858
Official Lu,

666
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,168
we finally meet again.

667
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:10,769
Pang Hu.

668
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:13,408
Take him away.

669
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:13,977
Yes.

670
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,088
Move it!

671
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:53,328
So

672
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:55,777
it was the incense
that drove the crows mad.

673
00:32:55,778 --> 00:32:57,457
This incense has a special scent.

674
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,568
So it's easy to recognize.

675
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:00,449
They intentionally provoked the crows

676
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:02,088
while burning the incense.

677
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:04,217
So when the crows smell this scent,

678
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:05,848
they go mad and attack.

679
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:07,489
Official Zhou,

680
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:08,898
what happened

681
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,249
at Baixiang Pavilion just now?

682
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:12,537
Miss Shen Zhen! Miss Shen Zhen!

683
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:13,608
Official Zhou.

684
00:33:14,298 --> 00:33:15,368
Where's Lu Shiyan?

685
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:16,497
What happened?

686
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,378
We need to gather some men
to find him quickly.

687
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,297
Let's talk while we walk.

688
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,648
Okay, let's go.

689
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:37,648
Oh, Lu Shiyan.

690
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:41,368
You've finally fallen into my hands.

691
00:33:43,498 --> 00:33:45,489
You can still laugh.

692
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:47,888
From Wuzhou to the capital,

693
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:50,808
you've repeatedly ruined my plans.

694
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:53,168
Today, you've fallen into my hands.

695
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:56,608
I will settle the scores with you.

696
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:58,449
It seems

697
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,049
I can't escape death today.

698
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,497
If it weren't for the master's order,

699
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,337
I could kill you now.

700
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,728
Master?

701
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,009
In your master's eyes,

702
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:13,978
you're nothing

703
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:16,009
but an insignificant person.

704
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:17,688
If things succeed,

705
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:19,568
you'll probably end up like me.

706
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:22,889
Dead.

707
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:28,648
Once my master's plan succeeds,

708
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,809
I'll be the meritorious official.

709
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,737
You mean, founded the country.

710
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:35,849
Well,

711
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,618
you'll know soon enough.

712
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,969
Then do you want me to die in peace?

713
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:42,768
Trying to dig information from me, huh?

714
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:44,288
Don't worry.

715
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:46,809
I'll tell you

716
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:48,849
when I start burying you.

717
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:13,049
I bought this fragrance.

718
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:15,728
Smell this and find him.

719
00:35:57,378 --> 00:35:58,698
Watch Lu Shiyan closely.

720
00:35:58,699 --> 00:35:59,897
Don't let anyone come near here.

721
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,297
The antidote must be with him.

722
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:02,329
Official Zhou,

723
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:04,217
we all want to save Ran.

724
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:06,128
But we must not act rashly.

725
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,377
I'm going to meet someone.

726
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:08,458
I'll be back soon.

727
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,288
Yes.

728
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:12,377
I think

729
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,208
he's going to meet the mastermind.

730
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:15,568
I'll follow him.

731
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:38,009
We've caught Lu Shiyan.

732
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:39,409
What should we do to him?

733
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:44,168
Kill him.

734
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,009
Eunuch Lou?

735
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:54,768
Lu Shiyan,

736
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:56,969
how are you?

737
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:58,049
Are you hurt?

738
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:01,849
I'm fine.

739
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:10,168
Don't worry.

740
00:37:16,218 --> 00:37:17,329
Is this Blacky?

741
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,889
Blacky,

742
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,578
we finally meet.

743
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:23,009
Who does Pang Hu serve?

744
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:25,009
I don't know.

745
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:26,768
You don't know?

746
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:29,217
Sir, have mercy.

747
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:30,618
He never let us follow him.

748
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,049
We don't know.

749
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:35,608
Take them away!

750
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,417
I'm back.

751
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:39,208
Move it!

752
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:42,168
The person meeting Pang Hu
is Eunuch Lou.

753
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,849
He also ordered Pang Hu to kill you.

754
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:48,248
Eunuch Lou?

755
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:51,329
It seems our previous deduction

756
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:52,568
was correct.

757
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,128
You tricked me again.

758
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:16,000
(Su Mansion)

759
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:19,168
Where's the antidote?

760
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:21,168
I don't know.

761
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,929
Keep hitting him.

762
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,529
Where's the antidote?

763
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:29,417
I really don't know.

764
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:31,449
It should be with Eunuch Lou.

765
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:37,969
Did you think

766
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:40,929
you're the only one I want to trick?

767
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,178
So what?

768
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:44,529
Everything you know now

769
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:46,458
can't no longer affect

770
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,297
Master's great plan.

771
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:50,098
But because of you,

772
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,449
Eunuch Lou has been implicated.

773
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:54,098
Even if you manage

774
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,688
to get out of here,

775
00:38:55,898 --> 00:38:58,049
you won't live long.

776
00:38:58,099 --> 00:38:59,529
So be it, then.

777
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:01,857
At least, you'll die along with me.

778
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:04,088
If you reveal what you know,

779
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,728
maybe

780
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:07,728
we can let you go

781
00:39:07,818 --> 00:39:10,009
and give you a chance to escape.

782
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:12,049
You can just kill me.

783
00:39:12,338 --> 00:39:14,449
I won't say a word.

784
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:15,608
Fine.

785
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:18,337
Then I'll drain

786
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:20,178
your blood out slowly

787
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:22,768
until you die!

788
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,768
Guards!

789
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:25,529
Bleed him dry.

790
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,168
Since you're so eager for death,

791
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,248
I'll just grant you your wish.

792
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:53,688
Don't worry.

793
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,168
Miss Shen Ran will hang on.

794
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:03,768
Someone!

795
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,809
Lu Shiyan,

796
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:07,809
come and kill me!

797
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:11,849
Someone!

798
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:43,568
Someone...

799
00:40:45,218 --> 00:40:46,568
Someone...

800
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,248
I'll confess...

801
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,529
I'll confess!

802
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,809
Someone!

803
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,208
I'll speak!

804
00:40:58,818 --> 00:40:59,417
Speak!

805
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:00,417
Stop my bleeding.

806
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:01,377
Stop my bleeding.

807
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,217
Where's the antidote?

808
00:41:02,218 --> 00:41:03,217
It's the Empress.

809
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:04,618
It's the Empress.

810
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,409
We're working for the Empress.

811
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:08,369
It's the Empress.

812
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:10,178
What are they planning?

813
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,337
She wants us to take action
during the prayer ceremony.

814
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:13,578
But Eunuch Lou hasn't told me

815
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:15,849
the details of the plan.

816
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,449
All I know is

817
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:19,658
that the Crown Prince won't survive
the prayer ceremony.

818
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:20,688
See? I've told you.

819
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:21,857
Stop my bleeding!

820
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:24,058
Do you still have other accomplices?
Who saved you last time?

821
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:25,009
Mr. Ge.

822
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,297
It was Mr. Ge.

823
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:27,658
Mr. Ge?

824
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:28,449
Yes.

825
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:29,417
What do you know

826
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:30,728
about Mr. Ge?

827
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,498
Mr. Ge has a group of assassins.

828
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:34,857
The assassinations
of Lan, Li Di, Zhao Chong, and others

829
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:36,857
were plotted by Mr. Ge.

830
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,498
The real document
of the iron ore purchase

831
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,138
is also in Mr. Ge's hands.

832
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:41,777
So the Empress found an excuse

833
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,409
to let him stay in the palace.

834
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:44,929
After that?

835
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,658
Previously, she sent someone
to assassinate you

836
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:48,897
and framed Eldest Princess.

837
00:41:48,898 --> 00:41:51,058
She was hoping to disrupt Official Lu

838
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:52,498
to cover up her plot

839
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:54,178
and buy time to take action.

840
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,058
That's all I know.

841
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,138
Stop my bleeding.

842
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,208
Stop my bleeding!

843
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:01,529
Don't go.

844
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:04,009
Don't go!

845
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,409
Stop my bleeding!

846
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:08,698
Stop it for me.

847
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:10,529
Stop it for me quickly.

848
00:42:22,818 --> 00:42:24,449
Lu Shiyan!

849
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:28,009
You tricked me again!

850
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,897
Those people are all skilled
in military combat.

851
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,600
They're definitely
from a military background.

852
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:37,098
Judging from their numbers and formations,

853
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,900
they seem to be following
a military structure.

854
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:39,288
Moreover,

855
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:41,178
the number of refugees is increasing.

856
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:43,058
The day after tomorrow
is the prayer ceremony.

857
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,409
Given the current situation,

858
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:47,058
they should

859
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:48,618
be well prepared.

860
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:51,049
They're just waiting to strike
during the ceremony.

861
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:52,138
But

862
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,498
there are many princes.

863
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:55,849
It might not necessarily
be the Sixth Prince.

864
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:57,498
If nothing unexpected happens,

865
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:58,849
the Sixth Prince

866
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:01,568
will probably also attend the ceremony.

867
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:03,737
When the Crown Prince appears,

868
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:05,529
there will be a sign of chaos.

869
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:07,768
But when the Sixth Prince appears,

870
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:09,809
there will be auspicious signs.

871
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:12,178
The people will surely believe

872
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:13,377
that the Sixth Prince

873
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:15,098
is the one fit to be the heir.

874
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:15,978
Official Zhou.

875
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:17,058
If it's as you said,

876
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:18,297
we could only stay put

877
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,578
in that case.

878
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:20,889
If her plan fails,

879
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,618
the private troops
will besiege the capital

880
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,009
and seize the position by force.

881
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:25,369
The Empress's move

882
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:27,168
is bound to succeed.

883
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:29,009
Does the Sixth Prince know
about this plot?

884
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,529
We're still not certain.

885
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,168
The Empress used Xu Wei to amass wealth,

886
00:43:35,218 --> 00:43:38,208
secretly winning over officials.

887
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:40,529
We don't know
how many people in the court

888
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:43,248
are on her side.

889
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:45,768
There's one important step

890
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:48,018
to stop this action.

891
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:49,498
We must find out which ministers

892
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,369
are on the Empress's side
as soon as possible.

893
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:52,768
That's right.

894
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:54,417
By the way,

895
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:55,777
Pang Hu said

896
00:43:55,778 --> 00:43:56,937
Mr. Ge has evidence

897
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:58,937
of illegal iron ore purchases.

898
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:00,449
If we can find it,

899
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,817
not only can we help the Eldest Princess
clear her name,

900
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:04,049
but

901
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:06,857
we can also incriminate the Empress.

902
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:07,889
I'll go and get it.

903
00:44:08,499 --> 00:44:10,018
Earlier, the Empress said

904
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:11,849
I could enter and leave the palace
at anytime.

905
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:15,018
Miss Xu, be careful in all matters

906
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,128
and stay safe.

907
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:17,417
Mr. Ge lives

908
00:44:17,418 --> 00:44:18,538
in the far west of the palace,

909
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:20,128
at Chenghong Hall in Tianqian Palace.

910
00:44:20,378 --> 00:44:22,929
Both inside and outside the palace
are patrolled by the Imperial Guards.

911
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:24,889
Miss Xu, be extra careful.

912
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:27,088
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

913
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,208
Your Majesty.

914
00:44:48,258 --> 00:44:50,208
You all may leave.

915
00:44:57,218 --> 00:44:58,608
Your Majesty,

916
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,698
everything is going smoothly.

917
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,098
For it to succeed,

918
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:05,248
everything must be flawless.

919
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:07,889
Remember

920
00:45:07,898 --> 00:45:10,049
to get rid of anything

921
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:12,128
that gets in the way.

922
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,088
Your Majesty, rest assured.

923
00:45:14,499 --> 00:45:16,498
Lu Shiyan has been captured by us.

924
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:17,297
Zhou Shu'an

925
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,377
is busy finding medicine
for Miss Shen Ran.

926
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:22,768
They are currently too occupied
to do anything else.

927
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:29,688
Our success or failure
depends on this one move.

928
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:34,409
The Sixth Prince is here!

929
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,297
I heard you were looking
for me urgently.

930
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:45,538
Is there something wrong?

931
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:46,777
You weren't reviewing your studies

932
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:47,857
in the palace today.

933
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:48,897
Where did you go?

934
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:50,018
I noticed Brother

935
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,217
looking depressed lately.

936
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:52,698
So I went to keep him company.

937
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:53,897
The prayer ceremony failed,

938
00:45:53,898 --> 00:45:56,529
so Crown Prince is surely upset.

939
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:58,529
You should avoid provoking him.

940
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,658
Lest the Emperor to punish you

941
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:02,529
for saying or doing anything wrong.

942
00:46:02,979 --> 00:46:04,417
