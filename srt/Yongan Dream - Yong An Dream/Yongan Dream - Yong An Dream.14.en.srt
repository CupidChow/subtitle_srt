18
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,368
Did you know

19
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,919
that Zhao Chong was arrested?

20
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:00,969
I do.

21
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,368
Wuzhou relayed the news to me long ago.

22
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,120
If so, why didn't you tell me about it?

23
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm Zhao Chong's first contact person.

24
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,849
Will they find evidence related to me
after they arrest him?

25
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,200
Will he rat me out?

26
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,849
You guys still want me
to run errands for you?

27
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,328
You want me to die?

28
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,839
Don't worry.

29
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,839
They have no evidence at all.

30
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,728
Zhao Chong wouldn't say a single word

31
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,399
even if it meant he would die.

32
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,679
Really?

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,448
Do you think I still have time

34
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,608
to handle Madam He for you

35
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,399
if you were to be in trouble?

36
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:31,888
Now, I just want to see

37
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:32,809
the 5,000 gold taels

38
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,320
as soon as possible.

39
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,299
The materials meant for
the West Canal's reparation

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,568
have been delivered.

41
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,239
Inspect and verify them quickly.

42
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:41,280
Got it.

43
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:52,320
Lay it straight.

44
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:55,649
Brother, what do you think?

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,608
I must prove myself
during the next fall hunt.

46
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,760
I'll show it to Father.

47
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,679
Here.

48
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,728
I'll give it one more try.

49
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,280
The fall hunt is still very far away.

50
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,200
What about the homework
you received lately?

51
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,440
How's your progress?

52
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,200
Don't bring that up.

53
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,929
I feel frustrated
whenever I think about it.

54
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,568
I feel giddy

55
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:11,768
whenever I step into

56
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,728
the study room.

57
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:13,969
And, I feel drowsy too.

58
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,000
I feel terrible.

59
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:17,089
Brother, I'm in trouble.

60
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,969
I didn't copy a single word of

61
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,440
the essays Grand Tutor told me to copy.

62
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,888
I'll help you out.

63
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:23,969
Really, Brother?

64
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,849
Thank you.

65
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,119
That's great.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,369
I'll practice a little longer.

67
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,200
-You do expect me to help you out, huh?
-Brother!

68
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,519
Just you wish!

69
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:31,839
I'll go back now.

70
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,880
Your Highness.

71
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,079
Cousin.

72
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,040
Cousin,

73
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,000
how's the case with Minister Shen?

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,880
We're still investigating the case.

75
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,119
Minister Shen is my mentor.

76
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,008
He would never do

77
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,160
such a thing.

78
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,760
Why don't I make a plea for him
in front of Father again?

79
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,320
Your Highness, I have a piece of advice.

80
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,919
As the crown prince,

81
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,089
you're a ruler

82
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,799
and a subject of His Majesty as well.

83
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,969
This concerns the imperial court.

84
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,849
One's claims have no place in it.

85
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,679
You need strong evidence
to prove your claims.

86
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,200
If so, Cousin,

87
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,929
I hope you can get
to the bottom of the case

88
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,150
and uphold justice for Minister Shen
as soon as possible.

89
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,039
I'll do my best.

90
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,128
If you're free later,

91
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,159
why don't you stay here
and join me for a meal?

92
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,560
All right.

93
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:30,200
He's taking so long to see His Majesty.

94
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,039
The sun has already set.

95
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:34,409
Maybe he was obstructed

96
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,599
by something.

97
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,688
Let's not wait for him anymore.

98
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:38,808
We can eat first.

99
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:39,680
Miss,

100
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,440
let's wait a little longer.

101
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,240
Qingxi,

102
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:46,320
there's something off about you lately.

103
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:47,728
What do you mean?

104
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,248
You're siding with outsiders now.

105
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,368
Miss, who said so?

106
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,569
Official Lu went to the palace
to see His Majesty

107
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,168
for Master's sake too.

108
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,849
Preparing dinner for him

109
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,009
and waiting for him to come home

110
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,608
serve as our thanks.

111
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,440
I wasn't referring to today.

112
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,608
You and Yang Zong spoke in turns

113
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:04,168
when we were returning to the city.

114
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:05,760
Don't think that I couldn't tell.

115
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:06,769
And,

116
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,128
weren't you worried about me

117
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,969
spending time alone with Official Lu
before this?

118
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,039
Miss,

119
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,808
that was because

120
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:15,889
I didn't know Official Lu back then.

121
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,728
After my thorough observation,

122
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,409
I think Official Lu

123
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,880
is sincere to you.

124
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:24,560
What about Di's sincerity

125
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,248
when he first married Sister?

126
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:28,200
All of us saw it ourselves.

127
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,209
Although Father
objected to their marriage,

128
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,399
he acknowledged it lastly.

129
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,079
Qingxi,

130
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,719
I know you're doing this for my sake.

131
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,168
But if he can't even express

132
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,880
his sincerity in words,

133
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,599
how can I believe

134
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,839
that blurry feeling, then?

135
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,479
Miss.

136
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,240
My lord,

137
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,279
this time...

138
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,649
This time, it's all on you.

139
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,329
If you do fancy Miss Shen,

140
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,240
you have to tell her.

141
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:17,488
Think about it.

142
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,200
What she said just now

143
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:20,849
didn't reflect

144
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,248
her feelings for me.

145
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:22,959
And,

146
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,320
it seemed like she was in a bad mood.

147
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,649
If I act recklessly,

148
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,639
it'll backfire on me

149
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,009
and cause me to lose all hope.

150
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,240
Do you think you're conducting...

151
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,839
Lower your volume.

152
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,248
Do you think this is a trial?

153
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:40,569
You're taking your own sweet time

154
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,120
at handling it, huh?

155
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,209
This concerns one's relationship.

156
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,649
Miss Shen is getting
more and more obvious with her hints now.

157
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,329
How could you still lower your head
and try to look for clues?

158
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,608
Listen.

159
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:52,889
If you keep this up,

160
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,608
you'll lose

161
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,800
that last sliver of hope.

162
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:01,048
Miss, stop drinking.

163
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,360
Let me pour you some tea.

164
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:12,479
What did His Majesty say?

165
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,000
His Majesty said

166
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,320
he would release your father

167
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,399
as long as the culprit shows himself.

168
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,449
If he releases him now,

169
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,360
he'll alert the culprit to our presence.

170
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,808
His Majesty also said

171
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:27,440
that he would
give your father extra care.

172
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,200
Understood.

173
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,039
Thank you, Official Lu.

174
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,168
Official Lu,

175
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,079
we've prepared your cutlery for you.

176
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,719
Qingxi!

177
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,560
Miss,

178
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,849
you haven't eaten either, am I right?

179
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,920
Come, let's eat together.

180
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:58,920
Delicious.

181
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:00,649
Of course.

182
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,248
Miss Shen

183
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,928
made it for you personally.

184
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,800
No wonder it's so delicious.

185
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,839
So, Miss Shen, you can cook too.

186
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:11,360
You should eat up, then.

187
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:13,969
You guys can enjoy your meal.

188
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,880
I'll go and prepare extra dishes.

189
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,888
I wonder

190
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,200
how my sister is doing?

191
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,209
I remember she once said
that she was

192
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,689
the happiest person in the world

193
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,200
on her wedding day.

194
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,640
Who would expect

195
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,440
her relationship,
which she cherished more than her life,

196
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:20,640
would be gone in just a few years?

197
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,119
It vanished

198
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,999
like a candle flame

199
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,160
embraced by the wind.

200
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,680
You're drunk.

201
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,119
Li Di!

202
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,800
That scoundrel.

203
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,920
My sister was nice to him.

204
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:52,479
Yet, he betrayed her.

205
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,728
He let her down

206
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:56,719
and harmed the Shen family.

207
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:00,008
If I were to find a husband
in the future,

208
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,049
I would definitely keep my eyes open.

209
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,008
I won't find a guy

210
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,599
like Li Di.

211
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,239
Shen Zhen,

212
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,879
don't worry.

213
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,959
You won't encounter a person like him

214
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,839
as long as I'm around.

215
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,719
You're the same as him.

216
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,759
Me?

217
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,768
You don't dare to own up
to what you did.

218
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,169
You kissed me,

219
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,408
yet you denied it.

220
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,200
And, you pretended
not to remember anything,

221
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,089
I told you already.

222
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,520
What did you say?

223
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:29,929
Are you trying to
bear the responsibility

224
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,169
just because you kissed me?

225
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,119
Who said I needed you
to bear the responsibility?

226
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,560
If I want to get married,

227
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,969
I must get married

228
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,400
to a guy who truly loves me.

229
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:40,969
So, how do you feel

230
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,800

I'm just bad

at expressing my feelings.

238
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:20,999
Don't be angry.

My lord.

254
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:37,049
Speak.

255
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,920
I found the place you wanted me to find.

256
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,479
Come and take a look for me.

257
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,599
What do you think about this painting?

258
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,479
Does it look like her?

259
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:48,800
It does.

260
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,479
It's literally her.

261
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:52,368
My lord,

262
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:53,608
I'm afraid Miss Shen

263
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:54,648
will pop out of the painting

264
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,400
if it gets any more similar.

265
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,280
But I keep feeling like

266
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:00,400
something's lacking.

267
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,160
I think I can improve upon

268
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:04,209
her eyebrows.

269
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,999
Am I right?

270
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,089
My lord,

271
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,608
it's already midnight.

272
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:08,969
You've drawn so many paintings of her.

273
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,049
You should rest now.

274
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,839
There's no need to rush.

275
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,719
My lord, what's the matter?

276
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,888
This time,

277
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:23,359
I must do my best.

278
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:26,040
I must let her feel

279
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,999
my sincerity.

280
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,889
(Baixiang Pavilion)

281
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,488
Madam, thank you

282
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,528
for all the fragrances you gave to me.

283
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,079
I shall gladly accept them.

284
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,640
You don't need to stand on ceremony.

285
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,329
You may go ahead.

286
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,640
I shall take my leave.

287
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,879
Official Zhou.

288
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,599
She's not Lan.

289
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,920
Aunt, thank you for the trouble.

290
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:05,479
Chuyi,

291
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,089
send Aunt back to the palace.

292
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,920
Yes, sir.

293
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,899
Miss Lan, we're in trouble.

294
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,488
His Majesty already issued
an imperial edict.

295
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:23,929
He told me to finish the reparation

296
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,169
of West Canal in ten days.

297
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,528
If not, he'll remove me

298
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,560
from office.

299
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,329
I only have ten days, you know?

300
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,728
How could I possibly finish it by then?

301
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:32,008
His Majesty is pressuring me

302
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,599
while Zhao Chong is imprisoned.

303
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,528
Miss Lan, can you make a plea for me

304
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,329
in front of Benefactor?

305
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,680
I want to quit.

306
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,999
Let me resign from my post
and return to the countryside.

307
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,320
Actually,

308
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,608
you ran plenty of errands for Benefactor.

309
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,400
You've contributed a lot to his cause.

310
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,768
Benefactor's big event is imminent.

311
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,999
I think I can do you that favor

312
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,128
as long as

313
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,440
you gather the necessary gold.

314
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,569
After all, you know how capable

315
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,320
Benefactor is.

316
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,040
Think about Xu Wei.

317
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,759
If so, Miss Lan,
thank you for the trouble.

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,008
I'll come up with a way
to gather the necessary gold

319
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,280
as soon as possible.

320
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,640
It's so beautiful!

321
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,479
Be careful.

322
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,248
How did you find

323
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:57,839
such a beautiful place?

324
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,560
Does someone draw here?

325
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:01,839
I prepared that.

326
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,089
We shouldn't let such a gorgeous view
go to waste.

327
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,920
Maybe

328
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,320
you would be in the mood to draw today.

329
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,089
Official Lu,

330
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,569
why do I feel like

331
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,800
you're a different person today?

332
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,520
Is that so?

333
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,719
Yeah.

334
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,040
As long as you like it.

335
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,320
Isn't that my mother's jade bangle?

336
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,040
It looks so exquisite.

337
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,008
Did you hire a silversmith to repair it?

338
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,160
I repaired it myself.

339
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,239
I started repairing it

340
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,040
ever since we went to Wuzhou.

341
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,079
Do you like it?

342
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,680
Yeah.

343
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,449
He could've completed the deed
with one phrase.

344
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,649
If she says yes, he can marry her.

345
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,608
If no, just forget about it.

346
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,559
What's with all the extra effort?

347
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,888
He's trying to get a bride, you know?

348
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:11,519
It's different from doing a business.

349
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,249
All men

350
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,928
desire beautiful ladies.

351
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:16,640
Good luck.

352
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,319
Come.

353
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,208
Stand guard at the entrance.

354
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,128
Tell me immediately

355
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,049
if Madam is back.

356
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,799
Yes, sir.

357
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,759
We're husband and wife.

358
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:03,999
I'm doing this for my own good,
which is for your own good.

359
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,729
You should contribute to my cause

360
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,880
and help me gather
the 5,000 gold taels for now.

361
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,680
(Divorce Letter)

362
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:20,920
A divorce letter?

363
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,329
There's even an official seal on it?

364
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,559
Zhou Shu'an,

365
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,600
you did put in a lot of effort
just to see our divorce.

366
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,720
(Title Deed)

367
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,799
Shen Ran,

368
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,729
I didn't expect you

369
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,968
to be so wary of me

370
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:54,999
right now.

371
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,529
Why is there a normal brush like this

372
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,600
hidden within the secret compartment?

373
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:34,719
This is my rubbing.

374
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:37,968
I saw Mrs. Li entering

375
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,729
an empty house.

376
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,408
I was worried about her.

377
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,640
That's why I followed her.

378
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,408
You shameless scum!

379
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:43,849
Master,

380
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,519
someone robbed your house
in Minqin Alley.

381
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,249
Maybe

382
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,569
Xu Wei isn't the only mastermind here.

383
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,809
In Wuzhou,

384
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,769
we arrested a wealthy merchant
named Zhao.

385
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,479
We'll know the result
after interrogating him.

386
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,559
You guys were investigating me?

387
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,240
(Li Residence)

388
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,239
Madam!

389
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:31,880
- Madam!
- Qingli!

390
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,039
You're finally back.

391
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,519
Ran,

392
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,489
I'll give you one last chance.

393
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,880
Give me back the secret letters,
hidden accounts,

394
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,809
and the money I kept

395
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,360
in the money house,

396
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,319
and I can let bygones be bygones.

397
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,239
You'll still be my dearest wife.

398
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,440
All of those were
evidence of your crime.

399
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,160
I've already handed it to Zhou Shu'an.

400
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:20,120
How can I get them back?

401
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,849
Don't tell me you really thought

402
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,600
you could become
the wife of the Censor-in-chief

403
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:25,289
after toppling me

404
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,168
and clinging on

405
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:27,840
to Zhou Shu'an?

406
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,999
Zhou Shu'an has a high position
within the officialdom.

407
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,009
He has plenty of noble ladies

408
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,128
to pick from.

409
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,799
How could he fall for you?

410
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,608
He was just using you

411
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,049
to aid him in investigating the case.

412
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,888
After the deed is done,

413
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,089
he'll rise up the ranks

414
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,440
and cast you away!

415
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,569
Don't forget.

416
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,200
You're no longer
the daughter of the minister.

417
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:48,099
You're still able
to act all high and mighty

418
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,928
all because you're my wife.

419
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:50,928
It's all thanks to me!

420
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:51,489
You're nothing

421
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,880
without me.

422
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,519
You and your lies!

423
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,688
Do you still think

424
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,600
I'm the innocent Shen Ran

425
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:58,648
who's in love with you
and is willing to be coaxed by you?

426
00:21:58,649 --> 00:21:59,769
How dare you hit me?

427
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,479
You traitor!

428
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,399
I'm so nice to you.

429
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,729
How dare you collude with Zhou Shu'an

430
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,999
and harm your own husband?

431
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,809
Do you know your fault?

432
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,208
You don't have the right to say that!

433
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,208
I have.

434
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,408
You put it so nicely.

435
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:11,680
You framed my father
and caused him to be imprisoned.

436
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,600
Not only that, but you also
tried to marry my sister off

437
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,039
as someone else's mistress.

438
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,648
I was totally wrong about you.

439
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:17,289
I thought

440
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,999
that we could be together forever

441
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,368
even if you had nothing in life

442
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,640
as long as we were
in love with each other.

443
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,968
I never expected you

444
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:24,849
to be the vilest

445
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,329
and most despicable person
I've ever met!

446
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,208
I'm despicable?

447
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:28,249
If only I killed you

448
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,489
sooner!

449
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,208
You want to kill me?

450
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:31,239
Fine!

451
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,809
Your father, that old fool!

452
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,809
He was so stubborn

453
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,729
and inflexible!

454
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,928
I only get a meager salary
from him every month!

455
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:39,448
Who'll sustain the family

456
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:40,809
if I don't make extra money?

457
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,319
Just you wait.

458
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,999
You'll be executed for your crime alone.

459
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,080
And, the mastermind behind you
will be punished too.

460
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,968
You have to gather
a large sum this time,

461
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:49,400
am I right?

462
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,329
It's not too late
to head to the Imperial Censorate

463
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,599
and reveal the mastermind to them.

464
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,400
That's right.

465
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,279
If not, the mastermind

466
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,729
will never let you off

467
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,009
when things go south.

468
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,009
Fine. Shen Ran,

469
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,888
if I can't survive,

470
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:01,049
I'll drag you down with me!

471
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,809
Understood?

472
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,688
Where is it?

473
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:04,880
Tell me!

474
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,120
Kill...

475
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,519
Even if you kill me,

476
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,440
you won't get what you want.

477
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,999
Li Di,

478
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:23,600
you're done for.

479
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,640
Do you have a death wish?

480
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,360
Let's perish together, then!

481
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,920
Fish stew with no coriander.

482
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,448
Meatballs without orange peel.

483
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:53,799
Prepare an extra plate of honey
for the marrow cake.

484
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,688
The steamed pork must be
cooked at a suitable temperature

485
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:56,729
so that it's soft and sticky.

486
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,688
My lord, don't worry

487
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:59,208
since you already
assigned the task to me.

488
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:01,030
I was worried that you might
miss out on the details.

489
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:02,729
You already told me thrice.

490
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,450
By the way, my lord,

491
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:04,300
I should test the dishes

492
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,529
just in case they don't taste good.

493
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,759
Hurry and bring her here.

494
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:08,120
Got it.

495
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:11,368
I'm starving.

496
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:12,640
Mister, over here, please.

497
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,759
Please.

498
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,089
Please.

499
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,600
What's with all the dishes?

500
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,279
Qingxi,

501
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,208
didn't you say

502
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:24,039
you have something important
to tell me just now?

503
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,239
Am I right?

504
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:27,128
Let's go.

505
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,519
You can tell me all about it.

506
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,368
All of these are my favorite dishes.

507
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:35,680
As long as you like them.

508
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:38,759
Zhen!

509
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,360
Brother Su Heng?

510
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:42,769
I finally found you!

511
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,120
Little Black.

512
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:45,799
You blockhead!

513
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,049
How is it?

514
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,120
How are you and your family doing?

515
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:54,208
I rushed back after hearing
what happened

516
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:55,519
to Uncle Shen.

517
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:58,400
But I couldn't locate you
no matter where I went.

518
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,559
Where did you go?

519
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:00,849
I'm fine.

520
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,128
Brother Su Heng,

521
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:04,569
many things have happened lately.

522
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,200
I'll tell you all about it later.

523
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,319
I'm glad that you're fine.

524
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,840
Isn't that Official Lu?

525
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,719
Did you only notice me by now?

526
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:15,600
Official Su.

527
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,208
Brother Su Heng,

528
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,559
do you know Official Lu as well?

529
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,009
We met each other

530
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,648
in the imperial palace long ago.

531
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:23,608
His Majesty even told us

532
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,959
to spend more time with each other.

533
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,009
Official Lu,

534
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,120
seems like you're holding
a banquet today.

535
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,719
I wonder if it's convenient

536
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,519
for me to attend it?

537
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,729
Of course.

538
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,279
We're a family.

539
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:38,880
We're a family?

540
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah,

541
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,529
We're a family.

542
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,799
Official Su, make yourself at home.

543
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:48,089
Brother Su Heng,

544
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,840
when did you come back?

545
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,479
Will you be leaving again?

546
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,168
Not for some time.

547
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:54,489
I'm here to see

548
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:54,968
if I can help

549
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:56,239
Uncle Shen out.

550
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:58,440
Don't worry.

551
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,680
Now that I'm back,

552
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:01,809
you don't need to be scared.

553
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,440
Official Su, were you
close friends with Miss Shen?

554
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,608
Uncle Su was my father's best friend.

555
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,729
Official Lu,

556
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,688
Miss Shen

557
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:11,519
was the childhood friend

558
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:12,928
I told you about.

559
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:14,600
We were engaged before we were born.

560
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:21,600
Brother Su Heng,

561
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:22,648
that...

562
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,769
That was a joke we cracked
when we were young.

563
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,968
We shouldn't take it seriously.

564
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:27,049
Our parents wanted it,

565
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,800
and the matchmaker
already did the deed for us.

566
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,009
And, no matter what,

567
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,208
we're considered childhood friends.

568
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,880
Why shouldn't we take it seriously?

569
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:34,408
I...

570
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:35,688
Since Official Lu is here,

571
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:36,880
he can be our witness.

572
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,440
I, Su Heng,

573
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,880
will only marry you as my wife.

574
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,849
When it comes to a relationship,

575
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,688
it depends on both sides.

576
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,049
Official Su, you have to respect

577
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,239
Miss Shen's will too.

578
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,200
Zhen.

579
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:55,408
I know.

580
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:56,809
It's been so many years since we met.

581
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,200
We might not be as close now.

582
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,449
But I'll be staying in the capital
for some time.

583
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,208
Let's take it slowly

584
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,208
and try to get along,

585
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:02,888
okay?

586
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:03,809
That's right.

587
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,319
The ability to get along is
the most important thing among people.

588
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:07,888
However, the current Miss Shen

589
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:09,208
might be different from

590
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,128
the person you remember.

591
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,160
Do you understand?

592
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,049
I like Zhen no matter

593
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,319
how much she has changed.

594
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:20,080
Brother Su Heng,

595
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:23,080
my father has been caught in a plight.

596
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:26,479
I'm in no mood to talk about that.

597
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:29,799
Please don't bring it up again.

598
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,039
You're right.

599
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,089
If so, we can talk about it

600
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,279
after Uncle Shen has been
released from prison.

601
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,208
Zhen, don't worry.

602
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,289
We'll come up with a way

603
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,799
to save Uncle Shen.

604
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,479
Thank you, Brother Su Heng.

605
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:44,160
The dishes are getting cold.

606
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,039
You're right.

607
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,039
Let's eat.

608
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,120
Zhen,

609
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,959
your jade bangle looks nice.

610
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:50,928
You mean this?

611
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:52,959
It's an item left behind
by my late mother.

612
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:54,729
However, someone broke it

613
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,600
before this.

614
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:58,959
Luckily, Official Lu repaired it for me.

615
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,928
Which immoral guy broke the jade bangle?

616
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:04,849
How dare he break such
an important object?

617
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,489
Zhen,

618
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,479
tell me who he is.

619
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,840
I'll get back at him for you.

620
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,559
It's already fixed.

621
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,009
Let's eat.

622
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,759
Let's eat.

623
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,239
- This is your favorite.
- This is your favorite.

624
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,239
Zhen,

625
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,569
have mine.

626
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,999
There's no fishbone in this.

627
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,688
Although Miss Shen loves fish,

628
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,959
she doesn't like fish belly.

629
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:33,809
I...

630
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,569
Zhen,

631
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,729
didn't we always fight for the fish belly

632
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,049
when we were young?

633
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,968
Times have changed.

634
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,039
People do change too.

635
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,400
These are just small habits.

636
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,600
Zhen,

637
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,959
it's fine as long as you like it.

638
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,049
If so, you should also respect

639
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,160
the thoughts of other people,

640
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,719
am I right?

641
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,479
It's fine.

642
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,719
I'll have both.

643
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,688
(Huafeng Restaurant)

644
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:12,699
I didn't get to taste the dish.
What do you worry about?

645
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,489
Have you had your fill?

646
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,809
I'll take you to a great restaurant

647
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,529
for an extra meal.

648
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,519
What will we be having?

649
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,648
Do you want mutton

650
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:18,208
or beef?

651
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:19,360
Qingxi?

652
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,089
Mr. Su!

653
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,489
I finally found you two!

654
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,640
You guys...

655
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,769
I'm Official Yang Zong
of the Magistrate Office.

656
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,959
Greetings.

657
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,279
Greetings, Official Yang.

658
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,368
- Mr. Su!
- Qingxi.

659
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,800
Let's go and bring the carriage here.

660
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,529
The carriage?

661
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,479
Zhen,

662
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,959
where are you guys living now?

663
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:43,239
She's living at
the Imperial Censorate now.

664
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,239
Why are you living
at the Imperial Censorate?

665
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,289
Miss Shen participated
in the investigation of Minister Shen's case.

666
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,899
Now, she's an important witness.

667
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,529
She's living
at the Imperial Censorate for now

668
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,479
so that we can ensure her safety.

669
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,400
Zhen is a girl, you know?

670
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,168
You're making her
live at the Imperial Censorate?

671
00:29:58,169 --> 00:29:59,559
It's inconvenient for her.

672
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,688
Zhen, follow me back
to the General's Residence.

673
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:03,368
Let's return to
Cavalry General Residence.

674
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,769
I'll see who dares to bully you.

675
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,408
Let's go.

676
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:06,600
Brother Su Heng,

677
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,249
calm down.

678
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,899
They're doing this for my sake.

679
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,648
And, since I'm participating
in an investigation,

680
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:13,759
I should obey the rules.

681
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,840
Let me send you there, then.

682
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,840
Let's go.

683
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,319
We're already here.

684
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,400
Miss Shen, you should rest early.

685
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,049
Zhen,

686
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,559
I'll look for you tomorrow.

687
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:37,448
It's fine.

688
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:38,448
Brother Su Heng,

689
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:40,680
I'll look for you some other day.

690
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:43,039
All right. I'll wait for you.

691
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,519
You guys should head back first.

692
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,400
I'll make a move first.

693
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,600
Let's make a move too.

694
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,759
I'll wait for you.

695
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,640
Shen Zhen.

696
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,600
Let's go.

697
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,239

I do.

Was I smiling?

00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,279
Are you guys hiding something from me?

720
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:39,239
Let's go.

721
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:47,680
Let's hurry!

722
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:48,999
Wait for me!

723
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,680
Oh, heavens.

724
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,640
I'm just one step away, you know?

725
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,439
You didn't have to rain on my parade.

726
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,080
This darned passing rain.

727
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,919
These aren't raindrops at all.

728
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:58,568
These are daggers!

729
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:00,640
They pierce through our hearts!

730
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,480
What did you draw?

731
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:07,968
Our lord pulled several all-nighters

732
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:09,399
just to prepare these paintings for you.

733
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:12,120
Initially, he wanted
to give you a surprise.

734
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:15,000
After that, the passing rain came.

735
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,520
Shen Zhen,

736
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,399
let's go back.

737
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,040
You'll catch a cold if you stay here.

738
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,480
Since it's meant for me,

739
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,799
I'll accept it, then.

740
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,520
Forget it.

741
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,769
They're ruined anyway.

742
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,129
The painting is ruined,

743
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,000
but the intention of the artist isn't.

744
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,160
Am I right?

745
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:20,680
If so, I'll draw them again

746
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,960
next time.

747
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,120
Okay.

748
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,160
I'll wait for you.

749
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,160
(Lanyue Pavilion)

750
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,919
Miss,

751
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:57,849
you've been in the bathtub for an hour.

752
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,649
And, you've been smiling
the entire time.

753
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,520
Does the bath make you that happy?

754
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,209
I'm happy.

755
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,160
- I'm happy.
- You're happy, huh?

756
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,568
If so, does Official Su

757
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:07,809
make you happier?

758
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,928
Or does Official Lu

759
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,249
make you happier?

760
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,799
Of course it's...

761
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm not telling you.

762
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:14,928
You're not telling me?

763
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:16,129
I'll take a guess, then.

764
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,689
I think

765
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,729
it's Official Su.

766
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,408
You're wrong.

767
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:21,849
It's Official Lu.

768
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,759
So, it's Official Lu?

769
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:25,048
You said that yourself.

770
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:26,799
- I didn't say that.
- Qingxi!

771
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,480
You still don't want to admit it?

772
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,960
It's Official Lu!

773
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,080
Follow me back.

774
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:51,719
I'll provide you with everything

775
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:54,080
I can provide to you.

776
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,279
The sky in the northern desert is blue.

777
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,759
The clouds are so low

778
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,839
that I can touch them with my hands.

779
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:04,600
I wish to see them for myself.

780
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:07,080
Seems like you're blaming me.

781
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:10,080
Can you truly provide me

782
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,239
with what I want?

783
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,120
The only thing you can provide me

784
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,649
is that piece of sky

785
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,239
that is unfit to be seen.

786
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,480
Do you wish

787
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,239
to take me as your wife?

788
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:33,279
By the way,

789
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,080
you will have your wife soon.

790
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,040
Do you have feelings for him
in your heart??

791
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,239
I do.

792
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,279
I know you're lying to me.

793
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:50,080
If so, what about
our relationship last year?

794
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,879
Was it just a temporary relationship?

795
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:54,759
I can never forget

796
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:57,879
your kindness.

797
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,169
If the afterlife does exist...

798
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,600
You know that I don't believe in that.

799
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,600
I've made up my mind.

800
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:13,600
Do not pester me again.

801
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:15,640
We shall

802
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:18,799
never see each other again.

My lord!

819
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:34,399
My lord?

820
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,239
My lord, what's wrong with you?

821
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,759
Do you feel sick?

822
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,680
I dreamt that she left me.

823
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,439
My lord, you must be
referring to Miss Shen.

824
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,729
My lord, this means that you have to
cherish your opportunity.

825
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,448
You have to stop

826
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:03,799
hesitating.

827
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,680
Was that what it meant?

828
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,769
Isn't it obvious?

829
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,169
If you keep hesitating,

830
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,719
she'll leave you for real.

831
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,560
(Tie in one's dream,
calamity in one's life.)

832
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,408
(I think I believe it now.)

833
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:18,000
(The heart-piercing pain
is too real to be false.)

834
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,520
Ran,

835
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,439
you're finally awake.

836
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,040
Where's Qingli?

837
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:35,680
Even now,
you're still thinking about her?

838
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:38,719
You do have a great relationship
with your servant.

839
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,160
Ran.

840
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,239
Ran, we're husband and wife.

841
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,649
We're birds of a feather after all.

842
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,368
I know I did Father-in-law

843
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:55,799
wrongly.

844
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:56,968
But if they wish

845
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:58,609
to use Father-in-law,

846
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,480
I can't do anything about it.

847
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:02,239
Who are they?

848
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:04,839
You wouldn't end up like this

849
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,480
had you reported them
to the authorities last time.

850
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:10,600
Reporting them to the authorities
is the least of their concerns.

851
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,088
Ran, trust me.

852
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:14,809
Do not trust the Imperial Censorate.

853
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,120
Now,

854
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,968
write to Zhou Shu'an.

855
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:18,809
Tell him

856
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,560
to return all those things to me, okay?

857
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:23,640
Why are you worried
that your crime evidence

858
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
is at the Imperial Censorate
when they're not afraid...

859
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:27,888
It's because they're more terrifying
than the authorities!

860
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,048
Ran, they would kill me

861
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:37,809
if they knew that I was hiding

862
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,000
so many pieces of evidence.

863
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,399
They won't let you stay alive either.

864
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:44,560
Come with me.

865
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,769
Write to Zhou Shu'an,

866
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,319
okay?

867
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,160
Come.

868
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:51,520
I'm not going.

869
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:53,319
Come with me.

870
00:42:57,529 --> 00:42:59,560
Let go of me!

871
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:05,960
You!

872
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,759
Ran, listen to me.

873
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,640
Write to Zhou Shu'an.

874
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,160
Ran,

875
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:36,439
give me your thumbprint.

876
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,560
I won't let you take over my shops!

877
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,560
You!

878
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,200
You're a parasite!

879
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:50,560
Before this, you sucked
my father's blood!

880
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:52,960
Now, you're trying to suck mine!

881
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:54,928
You're a loser

882
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:56,680
who will never achieve anything in life!

883
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,888
You deserve to be a lower-class citizen!

884
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,480
You said I sucked blood, huh?

885
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,640
Fine.

886
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,640
I'll show you.

(Shen Ran)

888
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:12,439
Come.

889
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:16,239
This is how I suck your blood.
