- Let go of her!

You better play nice.

If not...

22
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:55,763
Put down your sword.

23
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:04,804
Tell me, then.

24
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:06,403
What do you want?

25
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:08,483
I don't want anything.

26
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,164
However,

27
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:11,973
Official Lu, right now,

28
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,803
you have two choices.

29
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:15,412
First,

30
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,572
you can go and rescue your mother.

31
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:19,373
You can go to your mother's room

32
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:20,973
and destroy all of the evidence.

33
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,923
However, once you leave the room,

34
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,203
I'll kill Shen Zhen.

35
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,164
You can't bear for her to die?

36
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:31,683
If so, you can stay here and rescue her.

37
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:32,732
We can fight

38
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,693
and perish together.

39
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,253
After that, you can stand there and look

40
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,732
as Zhou Shu'an arrests your mother.

41
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,483
But I need to tell you something.

42
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:39,653
Those pieces of evidence

43
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,452
are enough to ruin her reputation.

44
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,363
And, her reputation
will be ruined forever!

45
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,083
What nonsense are you talking about?

46
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,604
What evidence?

47
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,284
You don't believe me?

48
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,292
Official Zhou,

49
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:51,813
this is Duke Zhenguo Residence.

50
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:52,533
Please allow me

51
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:53,852
to notify Eldest Princess first.

52
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:56,012
An important witness
has barged into Duke Zhenguo Residence.

53
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:57,300
To ensure Eldest Princess's safety,

54
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,892
the Imperial Censorate is here
to arrest him.

55
00:02:58,893 --> 00:02:59,844
Search the area.

56
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:01,213
Official Zhou,

57
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,900
you can't just barge in like this.

58
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:04,373
I haven't notified Eldest Princess yet!

59
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:07,083
How dare you guys do such
a thing to the imperial family?

60
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:10,004
Eldest Princess.

61
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:11,963
Official Zhou.

62
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:15,243
What exactly are you up to

63
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:17,324
by barging into Duke Zhenguo Residence?

64
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:18,604
Eldest Princess,

65
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,253
an important witness

66
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:21,923
has barged into Duke Zhenguo Residence.

67
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:24,884
I have no choice
but to search your residence.

68
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:27,892
Search the area thoroughly.

69
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:29,493
Leave no stones unturned.

70
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:30,404
Yes, sir.

71
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:33,923
I'm sure you believe me by now.

72
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:37,604
You don't have much time.

73
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:41,284
Xu Wei,

74
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:42,813
what have you done

75
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:44,203
in Duke Zhenguo Residence?

76
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:46,004
Why did you do so?

77
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:50,884
Lu Shiyan,

78
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:52,852
you ruined my reputation.

79
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:54,213
Everyone detested me.

80
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,612
I was barely surviving.

81
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:56,813
Since I suffered so much,

82
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:58,612
you should suffer the same!

83
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,172
Miss, tell him

84
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,604
why I did so.

85
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:03,724
Lu Shiyan,

86
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:05,093
what will you choose?

87
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:06,213
No matter who you choose,

88
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:09,324
you won't be able to live in peace
after this.

89
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:13,164
If you keep hesitating,

90
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:17,683
both of them will die.

91
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,243
Stop!

92
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:25,483
Official Zhou,

93
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:28,053
we found over ten boxes like these

94
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,724
in Duke Zhenguo Residence's cellar.

95
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:30,923
These weapons

96
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,123
were the same ones
as the ones I discovered.

97
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:37,883
Eldest Princess,
how do you explain yourself?

98
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,483
Speak.

99
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,443
Who's the mastermind behind all of this?

100
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,332
The mastermind is your mother,

101
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,443
the eldest princess.

102
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:08,772
Are you all right?

103
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:09,613
You're injured.

104
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:10,813
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

105
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:11,693
Stay here.

106
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:12,964
I'll go and look for my mother.

107
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,724
This is evidence of her
purchasing iron ore illegally.

108
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,440
(Receipt)

109
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:23,923
Eldest Princess,

110
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,204
how do you explain this?

111
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,363
Why did you purchase iron ore illegally?

112
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,923
I had no idea what was going on.

113
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:35,443
This is your personal seal, right?

114
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,443
Personal seals are created for
the imperial family.

115
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,733
Do you think I'll be so silly

116
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:41,972
as to purchase iron ore

117
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:43,572
with my personal seal?

118
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:45,399
Concealing one's motive
by revealing one's actions

119
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,532
is a type of strategy too.

120
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,964
Zhou Shu'an, how dare you!

121
00:05:58,374 --> 00:05:59,123
Run!

122
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,173
Brother Su Heng?

123
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:08,563
What is he doing here as well?

124
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,204
Xu Wei?

125
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:11,293
I thought you were...

126
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:12,883
Eldest Princess!

127
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,323
I was inept!

128
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:17,644
I've failed to complete your request.

129
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,132
What are you saying?

130
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,204
Don't worry.

131
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,173
I definitely won't

132
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:22,363
cause you any trouble.

133
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:27,323
Now, I shall atone for my sin
by taking my life.

134
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:37,284
Official Zhou,

135
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,084
now, we have both evidence
and witness of her crimes.

136
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,644
Eldest Princess is a suspect
in the West Canal Case.

137
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:48,652
From now on,

138
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,443
Duke Zhenguo Residence
is to be sealed off.

139
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,964
No one is to enter or exit the premise.

140
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:57,084
Stop right there.

141
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:59,764
You wish to interrogate me, huh?

142
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:03,044
You guys are not worthy.

143
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:06,652
The Duke Zhenguo Residence

144
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:08,683
fear nothing as we're innocent.

145
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,084
I want to see

146
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:13,923
who's the one

147
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,563
trying to frame me here.

148
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:24,693
You guys,

149
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,044
return to your rooms.

150
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,844
This is Zhen's jade bangle.

151
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,363
What's going on?

152
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:43,452
Zhen was wearing it

153
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:44,933
all the time.

154
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:45,972
But her jade bangle

155
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,053
vanished without a trace

156
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:48,803
when she was framed for
killing Zhao Chong.

157
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,452
Eldest Princess must've
killed Zhao Chong

158
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:54,003
and framed Zhen for it.

159
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,493
Keep some of our men here

160
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,404
to continue investigating
Duke Zhenguo Residence.

161
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:58,683
The rest of you

162
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:00,452
shall pursue and arrest Lu Shiyan.

163
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:01,284
Yes, sir.

164
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,044
Lu Shiyan?

165
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:16,960
(Duke Zhenguo Residence)

166
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,844
All personnel in Duke Zhenguo Residence
are not allowed to leave or enter.

167
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,204
Miss Shen?

168
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,243
What are you doing here?

169
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:32,364
Eldest Princess invited me here today.

170
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:38,612
Official Zhou,

171
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:39,933
what's going on?

172
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,252
Is Eldest Princess the mastermind

173
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,972
behind the West Canal Case?

174
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,252
The case hasn't been concluded yet.

175
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:45,764
I cannot reveal the details to you.

176
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:46,933
However, judging from

177
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,683
the evidence and witnesses
we've gathered,

178
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:49,852
that is the case.

179
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,284
Witness?

180
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:52,963
Are you referring to Xu Wei?

181
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,133
What if he took his own life
to frame Eldest Princess?

182
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,884
If so, what was his motive for doing so?

183
00:08:58,253 --> 00:08:59,173
What evidence is there

184
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:00,443
to prove your inference?

185
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,813
No matter if it's true or not,

186
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:03,404
evidence is required to prove both.

187
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:05,843
Baseless accusations

188
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,723
are meaningless.

189
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:10,563
What about Official Lu?

190
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:13,683
Regarding Official Lu's
degree of participation,

191
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:15,484
it's unknown.

192
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,092
Since it has come to this,

193
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:18,053
Official Lu should

194
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:19,884
go to the Imperial Censorate
to explain the case.

195
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,723
But now, he's not here.

196
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,524
He's a suspect too.

197
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,803
According to the law,

198
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,323
he should be arrested.

199
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:29,484
Impossible.

200
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,612
I'm sure he's not related to this case.

201
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,572
For some things,

202
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,013
it'll still happen

203
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:35,723
even if we don't believe them.

204
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:39,923
Miss Shen, since you appeared at

205
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,723
Duke Zhenguo Residence today,

206
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:44,372
if the Imperial Censorate

207
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:45,252
wishes

208
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,203
to investigate the case,

209
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:49,044
please cooperate with us
when your help is required.

210
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:51,284
Naturally.

211
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:55,284
Zhen?

212
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:57,524
Zhen.

213
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:04,044
Zhen!

214
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,563
Don't follow me.

215
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:06,653
I know.

216
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:08,524
It's hard for you to accept this.

217
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,372
But I gave you a reminder long ago.

218
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:12,644
I told you to be wary of Lu Shiyan.

219
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,723
You suspected him long ago?

220
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,004
What did you find out?

221
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,372
That's no longer

222
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,813
the issue here.

223
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:20,813
Most importantly,

224
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:23,013
we have both evidence and witness
of their crime.

225
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:25,332
They purchased iron ore illegally
to forge their own weapons.

226
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,203
This is treason.

227
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:28,843
Their crime is unpardonable.

228
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,603
I believe in Lu Shiyan.

229
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:32,923
Zhen!

230
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,413
Stop following me.

231
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:35,413
If you keep following me,

232
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:37,484
I shall never see you again.

233
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:38,764
Zhen!

234
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,933
The Imperial Censorate is here
to investigate under imperial order.

235
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,923
What's going on?

236
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
(Search Warrant)

237
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:49,803
From today onward,

238
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,572
all personnel in the Magistrate Office

239
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,372
are not to leave without permission.

240
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:55,803
All of you will be investigated
by the Imperial Censorate!

241
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,533
Say, did you think Eldest Princess
and Official Lu

242
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,972
were truly up to this all along?

243
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:01,572
Who knows?

244
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,284
Remember this.

245
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,124
- Sir.
- Sir.

246
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:07,013
Do not jump to conclusions
when the case hasn't been concluded.

247
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,083
Yes, sir.

248
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,004
Be more careful about it.

249
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:23,452
Do not destroy their items.

250
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:24,764
Yes, sir.

251
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,120
(Imperial Censorate)

252
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,323
This is the jade bangle

253
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,413
that Miss Shen had lost

254
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:52,124
when she was framed
for killing Zhao Chong.

255
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:54,923
It was discovered in
Duke Zhenguo Residence.

256
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:56,164
Eldest Princess,

257
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,044
how do you explain yourself?

258
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,563
I've never seen this jade bangle before.

259
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:07,364
This is the evidence

260
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,612
left behind by the culprit

261
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:11,323
when Zhao Chong was killed.

262
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,323
And, this is your personal seal.

263
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:16,813
All of these are evidence of

264
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:18,764
you purchasing iron ore illegally.

265
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:20,563
Eldest Princess,

266
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:23,284
how do you explain yourself?

267
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:27,164
I've never heard of the name Zhao Chong.

268
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:29,683
As for my personal seal,

269
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:33,443
plenty of people have seen it before.

270
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,813
Although it's an imperial seal,

271
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,284
I suppose it can be forged too.

272
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,963
If so, Eldest Princess,
according to you,

273
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:42,933
you have no idea

274
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:43,813
that these weapons

275
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:45,492
were transported from the pier

276
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:47,723
to Duke Zhenguo Residence.

277
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,773
I truly have no idea

278
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:52,563
about that.

279
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:57,524
Fine.

280
00:12:57,774 --> 00:12:59,644
Let me ask you one more question.

281
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,284
Xu Yiqing, the daughter of
Jibei Chariot General,

282
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,484
stayed in the residence
under your arrangement, right?

283
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,404
Official Zhou,

284
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,773
what do you mean by that?

285
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:10,284
I just wish to know

286
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,400
if you desire to take her
as your daughter-in-law

287
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:14,492
or establish a marriage alliance
between the two families

288
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,004
so that you can obtain military power?

289
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,612
What nonsense are you talking about?

290
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:21,173
Is it illegal for a mother

291
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,092
to

292
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,803
make the best arrangement

293
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:26,013
for her son's marriage?

294
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,203
Eldest Princess,

295
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:29,803
you may choose to deny
all of the allegations.

296
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:32,404
However, these pieces of evidence
are enough

297
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:36,044
to prove that Duke Zhenguo Residence
is guilty of treason.

298
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:40,533
Did you forget how Shen Wenqi
was framed?

299
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,284
And now,

300
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,293
it's Duke Zhenguo Residence's turn

301
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,484
to face the same.

302
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,443
If Duke Zhenguo Residence is convicted,

303
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,173
it proves

304
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,563
how incompetent
the Imperial Censorate is.

305
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,492
Eldest Princess, you're right.

306
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,603
I'll definitely investigate
the case thoroughly.

307
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:01,443
I have one more question for you, then.

308
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:03,404
Where is your son?

309
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,693
This has nothing to do with him at all.

310
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:07,963
If so, we have no choice
but to search for him.

311
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:09,683
According to the law,

312
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:12,252
all personnel in Duke Zhenguo Residence

313
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:14,164
shall be investigated.

314
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:15,972
The Imperial Censorate's duty

315
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:18,284
is to reveal the truth.

316
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:19,683
Eldest Princess,

317
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,443
if you truly want the best
for you and your men,

318
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,044
please calm down

319
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:26,404
and try to recall

320
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:28,053
every person who appeared

321
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:29,133
and every incident

322
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,203
that happened in Duke Zhenguo Residence.

323
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:42,203
How could this happen?

324
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:44,013
Who exactly

325
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:45,803
is behind this?

326
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:47,884
When you're one of
the wealthy and powerful,

327
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:49,293
unexpected things

328
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,843
always happen.

329
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,044
Father, do not overthink it.

330
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,524
It's just that Zhen is...

331
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:01,404
Uncle Shen, Miss Shen Ran.

332
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:02,972
Everyone is

333
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:04,200
talking about this.

334
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,173
They said Official Zhou stormed
Duke Zhenguo Residence

335
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:07,843
with plenty of yamen runners.

336
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:09,732
Eldest Princess was arrested,

337
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,923
and Official Lu was nowhere to be found.

338
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,563
Miss Shen, please wait.

339
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,212
(They lured me into
the residence on purpose.)

340
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,732
(Xu Wei attracted Lu Shiyan's attention
on purpose,)

341
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,533
(escaped to Duke Zhenguo Residence,)

342
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,484
(and lured the Imperial Censorate there.)

343
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,533
If so, why was Brother Su Heng there

344
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,173
at that exact timing?

345
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:33,843
And, he even arrested Xu Wei.

346
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:35,884
Could it be

347
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,923
that they had their eyes on
Xu Wei all along?

348
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:41,044
You suspected him long ago?

349
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:43,404
What did you find out?

350
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:44,732
That's no longer

351
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,284
the issue here.

352
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,212
Most importantly,

353
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,803
we have both evidence and witness
of their crime.

354
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:51,563
What exactly did he find out?

355
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:53,203
This plot was set in motion

356
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:55,364
long ago.

357
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:57,653
The mastermind is your mother,

358
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,683
the eldest princess.

359
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,164
I was incompetent!

360
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,443
Eldest Princess, I've failed
to complete your request.

361
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:08,404
(Lu Shiyan, where are you?)

362
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:30,923
(Who exactly)

363
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,173
(could do such a thing)

364
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,164
(in Duke Zhenguo Residence?)

365
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,044
It must be Housekeeper Zhao.

366
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:49,683
I've said everything that's necessary.

367
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:50,893
Official Zhou,

368
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,923
do you have any other questions?

369
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,332
Where's Lu Shiyan?

370
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,173
Official Lu, according to what you said,

371
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:57,332
Xu Wei's last words

372
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,372
aren't enough

373
00:16:58,373 --> 00:16:59,773
to prove

374
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,413
that he's related to
Eldest Princess's crime

375
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:03,092
and the type of crimes
that he committed.

376
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:04,764
And, according to the law,

377
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:07,843
the statements of the culprit
can only be accepted

378
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,333
when they match

379
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,524
the evidence.

380
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,924
Xu Wei is a fugitive.

381
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,333
How could his statements

382
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,573
be enough to prove that
Eldest Princess was guilty?

383
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:17,972
If Eldest Princess wasn't guilty,

384
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:20,724
why would Official Lu Shiyan

385
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:22,853
be guilty?

386
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:25,323
Crossbows, spears, and lances

387
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,613
are not allowed to be kept at home.

388
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,603
Their possession constitutes a crime.

389
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:33,363
Those who keep more than
100 armor set in private

390
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:34,724
shall be executed.

391
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:37,004
Those who keep more than 100 swords,
spears, or lances

392
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:40,524
shall be executed.

393
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,052
Those who keep more than 80 bows

394
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,204
shall be executed.

395
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,333
If Xu Wei's statements

396
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:47,684
were doubtful,

397
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:50,204
what was Eldest Princess's motive

398
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,163
for committing the crime?

399
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,613
Unless you can prove

400
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:56,613
that the receipt of
Eldest Princess's purchase of

401
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,163
the iron ore is fake

402
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:01,883
and that someone else framed her
for possessing the weapons.

403
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:04,883
If you cannot do so,

404
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,173
Eldest Princess

405
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:09,363
will be convicted of treason,
which is punishable by death.

406
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,133
Now, we have both evidence

407
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:12,964
and witness of her crime.

408
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:13,933
According to the law,

409
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,764
I should've reported this
to His Majesty.

410
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:16,964
Official Yang,

411
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:19,052
you're Lu Shiyan's trusted aide.

412
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,163
According to the law,

413
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,812
you should be considered

414
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,444
a suspect for the crime of treason.

415
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:25,972
Now, I will suspend you

416
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,323
and your duties.

417
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:28,964
We shall wait for
the investigation result.

418
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:32,883
Official Zhou, you may go ahead.

419
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,492
My conscience is clear.

420
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:36,363
Farewell.

421
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:39,484
If you feel maligned,

422
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,883
if you have the time to argue with me,

423
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:42,853
you should go back

424
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:45,004
and search for evidence

425
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,524
to prove that Official Lu is framed.

426
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,812
(Imperial Study)

427
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:55,724
Your Majesty,

428
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:58,052
according to the evidence we have,

429
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,333
Zhao Chong's death

430
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,413
is directly related

431
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:02,204
to Eldest Princess.

432
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,613
It appears that she procured large sums
of embezzlement

433
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:06,724
through Xu Wei and Li Di.

434
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,173
Official Su suspects

435
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:09,173
that Eldest Princess

436
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,772
used the embezzlement
to purchase iron ores

437
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,684
and forged weapons in private.

438
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,083
Your Majesty.

439
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,484
Just now, you said

440
00:19:21,614 --> 00:19:24,492
Xu Wei took his own life
in Duke Zhenguo Residence

441
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:25,933
to escape from his punishment.

442
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,853
But didn't Official Lu already
sentence him to death before this?

443
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:30,323
Official Su thinks

444
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:31,990
that it was just a trick
to deceive the masses.

445
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,284
It's hard to investigate the dead.

446
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,484
Now that the tide has turned,

447
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:39,044
he could only atone for his crime
with death.

448
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:41,492
You talked about

449
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,244
what Official Su thought about the case.

450
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:44,333
Official Zhou, seems like

451
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:45,924
you don't necessarily feel the same.

452
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,133
Tell me

453
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:48,764
what you think.

454
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:50,603
In my opinion,

455
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,964
we have concrete evidence.

456
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,004
However, the evidence-gathering process
was too smooth.

457
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,252
It was so smooth

458
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:00,724
that it made me develop doubts.

459
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:02,452
Even so, you don't have evidence.

460
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,900
The Imperial Censorate is
trying to gather evidence as we speak.

461
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,933
What if you can't find any
questionable points?

462
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:09,284
According to the evidence we have,

463
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,444
the case can be closed.

464
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:18,012
Where's Lu Shiyan?

465
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,693
We're trying our best to arrest him.

466
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:21,964
Arrest him as soon as possible.

467
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,693
Find out whether

468
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:26,004
he was kept in the dark or not.

469
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:29,843
Did you see these?

470
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,413
All of them want me

471
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,244
to give them an account.

472
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,123
You have ten days.

473
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:38,484
If there's no progress after ten days,

474
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:40,964
Eldest Princess

475
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:45,044
will be executed as per the law.

476
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,204
Understood.

477
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:50,563
Leave.

478
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,284
I shall take my leave.

479
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:07,093
Your Majesty!

480
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,244
Why did you get a cough all of a sudden?

481
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,964
Come, let me do it.

482
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:13,163
Be careful.

483
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:15,563
It's an old ailment of mine.

484
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,684
Your Majesty, take care.

485
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,532
I heard that
Eldest Princess was in trouble.

486
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,212
Where did you hear it from?

487
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,643
Yiqing.

488
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:28,052
She's the daughter of General Xu.

489
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,924
I told her to follow Eldest Princess
so that she could learn from her.

490
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,333
When she returned
to the residence today,

491
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,284
she found out that the residence
was sealed off.

492
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:36,684
What exactly happened?

493
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:37,492
Your Majesty,

494
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,684
please get to the bottom of the case.

495
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:45,373
Your Majesty, a woman like me

496
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:47,093
knows nothing about court affairs.

497
00:21:47,094 --> 00:21:48,812
I'm just saying this because

498
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:50,083
I'm close to Eldest Princess.

499
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:53,643
Your Majesty, please pardon me.

500
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:57,452
Don't do it again.

501
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:58,444
You may rise.

502
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,684
Thank you, Your Majesty.

503
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:09,123
The crown prince has arrived.

504
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:16,693
Greetings, Father.

505
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:17,684
You may rise.

506
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,853
Father, please practice wise judgment.

507
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:21,492
Aunt never
intervened with court affairs.

508
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,252
Official Lu is fair and just.

509
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:24,803
How could they attempt treason?

510
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,093
Your father knows what to do.

511
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:27,772
But Father...

512
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:28,883
Shut up!

513
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,772
You're jumping to conclusions
without knowing the truth.

514
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:33,373
How can I entrust the throne

515
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:34,573
to someone like you?

516
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:35,653
Father, I know what you mean.

517
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,803
But Aunt is...

518
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:39,893
Take a close look.

519
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:42,444
Think about how to deal with this.

520
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:47,333
Do you think you can tell the officials

521
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,052
that she won't commit any mistakes

522
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:50,573
just because she's your aunt?

523
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:51,532
Do you think

524
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:54,004
you can convince the masses with that?

525
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:56,693
Nonsense!

526
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:57,173
Father!

527
00:22:57,174 --> 00:22:57,650
Your Majesty!

528
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,049
-Father!
-Summon the imperial physician!

529
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,924
Yes, Your Majesty.

530
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:00,732
Imperial physician!

531
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:01,252
Your Majesty!

532
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:02,173
Imperial physician!

533
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,484
Your Majesty, please calm down.

534
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:07,972
Eldest Princess is suspected of

535
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:08,933
practicing embezzlement

536
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,573
in the West Canal Case

537
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,212
to forge weapons in private.

538
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:13,812
This is an attempt at treason.

539
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:15,573
She shall be executed within ten days.

540
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:16,532
What?

541
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,212
As the Imperial Inspector,
Lu Shiyan should've

542
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:19,549
enforced the law.

543
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,693
But he covered up for a criminal

544
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:21,690
and was suspected of murder.

545
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,532
He escaped after he failed.

546
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:24,600
Now, he's a wanted criminal.

547
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:26,292
If anyone discovers clues
of his whereabouts,

548
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:29,300
you shall receive 1,000 strings of cash
upon reporting it to the authorities.

549
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:31,413
1,000 strings of cash? That's a lot.

550
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:32,403
That's right.

551
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:36,684
Qingxi,

552
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,684
there's a person clad in black
behind you.

553
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,093
I saw him

554
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,363
when we were in Chengxi.

555
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:43,163
Why did he follow us

556
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,764
all the way to Chengdong?

557
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:52,333
1,000 strings of cash.

558
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,173
That's a huge bounty.

559
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:55,333
Let's go and search for him
and report to the authorities.

560
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,843
I think he tailed us.

561
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,244
He should be looking for Lu Shiyan.

562
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:03,163
Miss, here you go.

563
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:28,403
Let's go.

564
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:09,484
Sister.

565
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,004
Where did you go just now?

566
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:18,843
I didn't go anywhere.

567
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:21,524
Did you look for Lu Shiyan just now?

568
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,083
He was injured when he was in

569
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,093
Duke Zhenguo Residence.

570
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:31,403
He's injured, huh?

571
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:36,484
Have you considered Father's injury?

572
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,390
Have you considered the pain
the Shen family had endured?

573
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,643
Do you wish for that to happen again?

574
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:46,204
This is a plot too.

575
00:25:46,374 --> 00:25:47,693
They were framed.

576
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:49,693
Have you ever considered
the kind of person capable enough

577
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:50,924
to frame Duke Zhenguo Residence?

578
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,924
Lu Shiyan never feared them

579
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:54,373
when Father was framed.

580
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:55,413
If I can

581
00:25:55,414 --> 00:25:56,492
swap my life for Lu Shiyan's,

582
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:57,933
I'll do it without any hesitation.

583
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:59,399
But now, this house, Father, and you

584
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,812
are the only things we have left.

585
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:01,732
This is the only place

586
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,363
we can protect.

587
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:05,083
If so, you can treat it

588
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:06,643
as if I'm not a part of the Shen family.

It's okay.

Don't worry.

607
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:33,083
I'm fine.

608
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:55,643
Official Zhou, what are you doing?

609
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:57,853
We're to arrest Lu Shiyan
under imperial order.

610
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,532
We have to investigate everything

611
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:00,964
that's related to Lu Shiyan.

612
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:02,123
So...

613
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:03,613
Since it's an official matter,

614
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:05,524
Official Zhou, please go ahead.

615
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:07,484
Sorry for the trouble.

616
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,333
Official Zhou,

617
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:17,252
how's the case progress?

618
00:28:17,253 --> 00:28:18,732
Uncle Shen, as you can see,

619
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,363
we're trying to arrest Lu Shiyan.

620
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:23,933
What about Eldest Princess, then?

621
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:27,044
The case hasn't been concluded yet.
Therefore, I cannot reveal the details.

622
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:29,732
Official Zhou.

623
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:30,563
She's not here.

624
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:33,244
Yes, sir.

625
00:28:38,253 --> 00:28:40,212
Miss Shen Ran, may I know

626
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,724
where Miss Shen Zhen is right now?

627
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,292
She's unwell.

628
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:45,413
I have some questions

629
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:46,573
for her.

630
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,123
Is now a convenient time?

631
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:49,093
Haven't you already

632
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,052
questioned her yesterday?

633
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:52,603
Miss Shen Ran, please consider
our circumstances.

634
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:54,284
Since Lu Shiyan hasn't been arrested,

635
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:57,284
the Imperial Censorate won't miss out on
a single clue or lead.

636
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:58,684
Official Zhou.

637
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,764
Official Zhou, you may go ahead.

638
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:06,133
Miss Shen Zhen,

639
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:08,004
where did you go after leaving

640
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:09,403
Duke Zhenguo Residence?

641
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:13,684
Official Zhou,
you already sent your men to tail me.

642
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,163
I'm sure you know

643
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:16,800
where I went.

644
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:17,924
He sent his men to tail you?

645
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:21,244
Miss Shen Zhen, I never
sent my men to tail you.

646
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,284
So, he wasn't one of your men?

647
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,452
I returned to Baixiang Pavilion

648
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:27,883
after leaving Duke Zhenguo Residence.

649
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:29,452
I brought Qingxi out with me

650
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:30,924
as I wanted to take a walk outside.

651
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:32,933
However, someone followed me

652
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:35,204
from Chengxi to Chengdong.

653
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,123
I was scared.

654
00:29:37,134 --> 00:29:38,363
That's why I came back.

655
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:40,803
Who would it be

656
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,964
if he wasn't one of your men?

657
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:44,933
Official Zhou, I think
he has the same goal as you,

658
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:47,004
which is to capture Lu Shiyan.

659
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:50,893
Who else wants to capture Lu Shiyan
besides the Imperial Censorate?

660
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:52,452
Miss Shen Zhen, you don't need to worry.

661
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:54,764
I'll leave some of my men here
to ensure your safety.

662
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:57,204
However, Miss Shen Zhen,

663
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:58,173
if you have any news

664
00:29:58,174 --> 00:29:59,292
of Lu Shiyan,

665
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:01,599
please notify me immediately.

666
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,613
Official Zhou, thinking about
the days we exchanged letters

667
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:05,653
when I was in Wuzhou,

668
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:06,373
I thought

669
00:30:06,374 --> 00:30:07,924
we were friends.

670
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:09,484
I didn't expect you

671
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,724
to be the one

672
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:14,044
arresting Lu Shiyan today.

673
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:16,964
The Imperial Censorate
only operates on evidence.

674
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,173
There was perfect evidence of

675
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,284
my crime when I was framed

676
00:30:20,374 --> 00:30:22,853
as the killer of Zhao Chong.

677
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,390
I was able to clear my name
because Lu Shiyan wasn't willing to give up

678
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,363
even until the very last moment.

679
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,484
He risked his life to seek the truth.

680
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:32,452
I'm impressed

681
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:33,803
by his enthusiasm too.

682
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:34,812
However,

683
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:36,133
the Imperial Censorate

684
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,004
is also handling the case impartially.

685
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:40,123
If so, Official Zhou, please go ahead.

686
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:43,323
It is my duty.

687
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,044
Father, Sister,

688
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,843
don't worry.

689
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:00,204
I won't make you guys worried.

690
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,853
Xu Wei was able
to escape from death before this.

691
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:52,403
He'd surely die

692
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,284
if they found him again.

693
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:58,244
Therefore, they sacrificed his life
to frame my mother.

694
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,653
And, the evidence

695
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,643
that they discovered
in Duke Zhenguo Residence

696
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,123
proved

697
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:06,204
that the plot was
set into motion long ago

698
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:07,964
and that it had no weakness.

699
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,452
What is false cannot become true.

700
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:12,123
I'm sure there's a flaw somewhere.

701
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:14,163
By the way,

702
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:16,133
when Official Zhou was interrogating me,

703
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,292
he once told me

704
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:18,843
that unless we could prove

705
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,452
that the receipt of Eldest Princess's

706
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:21,532
purchase of the iron ore is fake

707
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,933
and that someone else framed her

708
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:24,212
for possessing the weapons,

709
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:25,123
if not...

710
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:28,083
If not, Eldest Princess
will be executed.

711
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:30,333
But now that I think about it,

712
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:32,403
could it be that he was giving us hints

713
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,883
to prove that the receipt was fake?

714
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:40,004
Since the weapons are real,

715
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,643
the receipt might not be fake.

716
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,284
The receipt for the iron ore

717
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:46,292
has the seal of the eldest princess.

718
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:47,452
That's how they were able

719
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:49,732
to pin the crime on my mother.

720
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,012
Therefore, the seal

721
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,684
should be our clue.

722
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:55,693
During the incident,

723
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:57,173
everyone in Duke Zhenguo Residence

724
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:59,083
was terrified and fearful.

725
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,883
But Housekeeper Zhao

726
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:05,323
didn't seem surprised at all.

727
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:07,532
And, he manages the entire

728
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,724
Duke Zhenguo Residence.

729
00:33:10,174 --> 00:33:12,724
He has plenty of chances
to come into contact with

730
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:14,684
my mother's seal.

731
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,363
Since a large number of weapons
were found in the cellar,

732
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:20,292
I'm sure he was working together

733
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:21,924
with a spy.

734
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:26,163
Do you have any news of
Housekeeper Zhao?

735
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:28,933
Duke Zhenguo Residence
has been sealed off.

736
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,764
Everyone is stuck inside.

737
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,684
How's my mother doing?

738
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,323
Eldest Princess

739
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:40,444
was detained by the Imperial Censorate.

740
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:50,724
Let's split up and investigate the case.

741
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,000
(Baixiang Pavilion)

742
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,723
What? Do you have a guilty conscience?

743
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:11,932
Where did you pop out from?

744
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,332
You scared me for a second there.

745
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,932
What do you mean by that?

746
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,763
I'm here to look for Miss Shen Zhen.

747
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,613
But you?

748
00:34:18,614 --> 00:34:20,173
You always rushed inside

749
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:21,964
whenever you were here.

750
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:23,364
What's wrong with you today?

751
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,243
Why are you hesitating?

752
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,643
Don't tell me

753
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,444
you're here to ask for her hands?

754
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:39,243
Do you think this is the right moment?

755
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:41,332
Yeah, this isn't the right moment.

756
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,732
Enough. Just go inside.

757
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:43,533
Stop bothering me.

758
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:44,643
Go and look for Zhen.

759
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:47,884
You!

760
00:34:48,694 --> 00:34:51,093
Don't spout nonsense
and make Zhen angry.

761
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:52,683
I'm not as detestable as you.

762
00:34:56,974 --> 00:34:58,093
Hurry and tell me.

763
00:34:58,094 --> 00:34:58,892
What's the latest news

764
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:00,603
you've heard in the palace?

765
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:04,212
Duke Zhenguo Residence

766
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:06,404
won't be able to escape unscathed
this time.

767
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:09,653
Although their treason
hasn't been proven,

768
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:10,892
purchasing iron ore in secret

769
00:35:10,893 --> 00:35:12,283
and forging weapons in private

770
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,524
are acts of treason.

771
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:19,812
Miss Shen Zhen,

772
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:21,643
I know this sounds terrible.

773
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:23,083
However,

774
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:24,093
I hope

775
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:25,493
that you can be mentally prepared.

776
00:35:25,494 --> 00:35:26,653
Even if no one

777
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,364
trusts him,

778
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:30,004
I'll trust him.

779
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,603
I trust Official Lu too.

780
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:33,484
But what about

781
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,243
Eldest Princess?

782
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:36,852
If Eldest Princess

783
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,163
is the mastermind,

784
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:40,004
even if Official Lu
manages to escape this time,

785
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,524
how will you face him

786
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,563
in the future?

787
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,613
If so, that means she's the culprit
who caused your father to be imprisoned

788
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:48,763
and lose his career.

789
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:50,524
And your sister.

790
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:52,643
She suffered so much

791
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,643
because of the same incident.

792
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:56,484
She almost lost her life too.

793
00:35:57,213 --> 00:35:59,083
How could she face the son of her enemy

794
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:01,324
with a smile?

795
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:05,203
In my opinion,

796
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:08,924
a marriage isn't between
two individuals.

797
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:10,763
It's between two families.

798
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:14,924
I know you're saying that
for my own good.

799
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,964
I also was troubled by the thought of

800
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:18,884
facing Lu Shiyan

801
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:20,653
if Eldest Princess

802
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:21,932
was truly the mastermind

803
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:24,283
behind the West Canal Case.

804
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,300
But I choose to believe him.

805
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:29,693
Lu Shiyan was in Duke Zhenguo Residence

806
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:31,804
when they went there
to arrest Eldest Princess.

807
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:34,212
Back then, Xu Wei held me hostage.

808
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:35,653
Lu Shiyan couldn't do anything about it.

809
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:38,093
Xu Wei even said that the residence
contained enough evidence

810
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:39,524
to convict Eldest Princess of her crime.

811
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,973
After that, Xu Wei ran away.

812
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:42,493
Lu Shiyan went after him.

813
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,412
Xu Wei escaped to the front yard.

814
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,004
He was captured by Su Heng.

815
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,563
Back then,

816
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:49,573
I'm sure Lu Shiyan
was at the front yard too.

817
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:50,693
I know him well.

818
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:51,800
If there was concrete evidence,

819
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:52,852
he would definitely come out

820
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:54,732
and bear the crime together
with Eldest Princess.

821
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:55,812
So,

822
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:56,812
he ran away

823
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,292
because he chose to gather evidence

824
00:36:58,293 --> 00:36:59,603
as he believed in his mother?

825
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:03,163
That's right. I believe in him.

826
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:05,364
That's why I believe in his choice too.

827
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:08,093
Have you met him?
How can he investigate this case alone?

828
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:09,603
Do you need me to help him out?

829
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:14,044
I think he's worried that
he might implicate me.

830
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,493
Miss Xu,

831
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,453
you mustn't act recklessly too.

832
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:19,203
We can't face you

833
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,364
if you were implicated because of this.

834
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,453
There's no need to fear
when you have a clear conscience.

835
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:26,404
I'm not afraid. You guys
shouldn't be afraid too.

836
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,812
You two are a devoted

837
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,563
yet ill-fated couple.

838
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,133
However,

839
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:35,453
I'm envious of you

840
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,412
for having someone

841
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:38,044
whom you can devote yourself to.

842
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:39,573
By the way,

843
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:41,404
there's another devoted guy
at the entrance.

844
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:42,693
Who is it?

845
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,283
It's Su Heng.

846
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:45,573
For some reason,

847
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:47,324
he doesn't dare to come inside.

848
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:49,732
If so, please bring him inside.

849
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:50,484
Okay.

850
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,844
Zhen, I know.

851
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:06,364
I know that you're very upset.

852
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:08,292
Even if you hate me,

853
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:09,732
some things should be revealed sooner

854
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,444
than later.

855
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:14,004
Brother Su Heng,

856
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,884
I don't hate you at all.

857
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,524
However,

858
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,332
Official Lu and I

859
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,203
are one.

860
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:23,283
If he does die,

861
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:25,404
I won't live alone.

862
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:27,053
Zhen!

863
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,404
How can you persist in your folly?

864
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,453
We have evidence and witnesses

865
00:38:31,454 --> 00:38:32,653
of Eldest Princess's treason.

866
00:38:32,654 --> 00:38:34,053
Her crime is unpardonable.

867
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:37,053
You just happen to find those pieces of evidence
in Duke Zhenguo Residence.

868
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:38,292
They could be forged

869
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:39,772
to frame them.

870
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:41,453
Did you witness Eldest Princess
purchasing

871
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:42,732
the iron ore personally?

872
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,252
Or did you witness her

873
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:45,412
forging the weapons personally?

874
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,613
I ripped the bloodied shirt

875
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:47,932
with the word "Zhang"

876
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,100
from Zhao Chong's body myself.

877
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:50,693
I witnessed the process
when they transported

878
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:53,844
a large number of weapons from the pier
to Duke Zhenguo Residence.

879
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:55,372
Your jade bangle

880
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:57,404
was discovered in
Duke Zhenguo Residence too.

881
00:38:57,413 --> 00:38:59,243
How can they be forged?

882
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:01,173
You still don't understand, huh?

883
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:02,252
You were blinded

884
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:03,292
by Lu Shiyan back then.

885
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:05,013
You would rather
deceive yourself than admit

886
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:06,524
that I'm speaking the truth!

887
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:07,613
Zhen,

888
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:09,533
I'm doing so for your own good.

889
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:10,763
What did you say?

890
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,453
A bloodied shirt with the word "Zhang?"

891
00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:15,332
You only returned for a brief period
when Zhao Chong was found dead.

892
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,332
You found the bloodied shirt,
but you didn't take it out

893
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,812
because you had preconceived notions
with Lu Shiyan.

894
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:20,300
Therefore,

895
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:22,852
you spied on Duke Zhenguo Residence
to gather evidence of his crime, huh?

896
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:25,173
Why didn't you show us the bloodied shirt
when you found it, then?

897
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:26,252
How could you be sure

898
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,133
that what you saw

899
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:28,683
was the truth?

900
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:30,493
How could you be sure

901
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:31,212
that Eldest Princess

902
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:32,013
killed Zhao Chong

903
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,900
just because my jade bangle
was found in her residence?

904
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:35,364
You should reflect upon your actions.

905
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:40,563
That was a huge deal.

906
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:47,884
(I never expected myself)

907
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,763
(to be the cause.)

908
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:51,852
(If I didn't make)

909
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,013
(Brother Su Heng hostile)

910
00:39:53,014 --> 00:39:54,964
(toward Lu Shiyan in the first place,)

911
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:56,653
(he would've shown us)

912
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:58,563
(the bloodied shirt when he found it.)

913
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,083
(If so,)

914
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:04,083
(I'm sure Lu Shiyan could
predict what was going to happen.)

915
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:09,964
What should I do now?

916
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:14,603
Just do whatever you think is right.

917
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:18,524
Father.

918
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,123
I'm old now.

919
00:40:23,174 --> 00:40:24,804
You guys can't lean on

920
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:26,013
my shoulders

921
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:27,524
in the future.

922
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:29,603
Father, you're not old.

923
00:40:30,213 --> 00:40:32,693
I feel at ease when you're here.

924
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:34,484
I'm going to depend on you forever.

925
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:37,763
Are you ignoring Lu Shiyan, then?

926
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,484
Zhen,

927
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:47,212
I suppose

928
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:48,653
you feel terrible lately, huh?

929
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,964
Father.

930
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:55,203
You must understand
your sister's feelings.

931
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:02,453
Your sister was
the acting mother of the family.

932
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:03,332
And,

933
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,412
I was involved in
a scandal not long ago.

934
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:07,723
She took on so much by herself.

935
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:11,444
She's been through
a life-and-death experience.

936
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:13,493
Therefore,

937
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:15,212
she cherishes

938
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:16,693
the current peace

939
00:41:16,694 --> 00:41:18,763
we enjoy.

940
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:21,693
Did you think she felt nothing

941
00:41:21,694 --> 00:41:23,804
when she slapped you?

942
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:25,133
She cried in her room

943
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,732
the entire night.

944
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,804
I saw it myself.

945
00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:34,603
Father, I understand.

946
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:36,884
I don't blame Sister at all.

947
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:39,884
It's just

948
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:44,013
that I'm unable to let go of Lu Shiyan.

949
00:41:44,014 --> 00:41:46,804
If so, you don't need to let go of him.

950
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:47,924
You see,

951
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,212
Lu Shiyan

952
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:52,364
is the Shen family's benefactor.

953
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:53,732
And,

954
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:55,643
he's your lover too.

955
00:41:55,773 --> 00:41:58,693
If you believe that he's innocent,

956
00:41:58,694 --> 00:42:01,013
you should do your best to help him out.

957
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:02,453
If he's truly a criminal,

958
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:04,372
you can end your ties with him

959
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:06,133
by having a drink with him
before his execution.

960
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:08,123
He'll never do something like this.

961
00:42:08,174 --> 00:42:09,212
That's why

962
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:12,123
you should dispel the fog

963
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,683
and move on.

964
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:22,404
Father, thank you.

965
00:43:25,094 --> 00:43:26,563
He's here.

966
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:34,763
Where are you going?

967
00:43:36,094 --> 00:43:36,533
I...

968
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:37,932
I just wanted to take a walk.

969
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:39,332
No one is allowed to leave.

970
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,163
Close the door.

971
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,603
Yes, sir.

972
00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:51,723
Why isn't he here to pick me up yet?

973
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:57,812
Housekeeper Zhao.

974
00:43:57,813 --> 00:43:58,683
What is it?

975
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,772
Last time, you told us

976
00:44:00,773 --> 00:44:03,013
to transport your private stash
to the residence.

977
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:03,812
You promised

978
00:44:03,813 --> 00:44:05,013
each of us

979
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:06,252
five silver taels.

980
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:07,093
You see,

981
00:44:07,094 --> 00:44:08,653
I'm stuck here.

982
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:10,400
Where can I get the money?

983
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:12,292
Once Duke Zhenguo Residence
is no longer sealed off,

984
00:44:12,293 --> 00:44:13,173
I'll give you guys

985
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:14,844
the full sum.

986
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:17,573
Although we weren't
at the front yard last time,

987
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:20,203
everyone has heard about what happened.

988
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:23,493
We transported weapons to the residence

989
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,364
last time.

990
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:26,332
Housekeeper Zhao,

991
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,133
that's a crime
punishable by death, you know?

992
00:44:28,134 --> 00:44:29,004
Wait.

993
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,964
Let's talk this over.

994
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:32,372
I'll definitely pay you guys

995
00:44:32,373 --> 00:44:34,133
after I get out of this residence.

996
00:44:34,134 --> 00:44:36,412
We want the money

997
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:38,683
