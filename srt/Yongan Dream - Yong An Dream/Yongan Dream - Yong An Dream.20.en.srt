=Episode 20=

18
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,257
I tested him with a stone.

19
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:43,856
He immediately became alert

20
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,248
and went out the door to look around.

21
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,687
But when the court official asked him,

22
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:49,617
he evaded the question.

23
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,207
He reacted that way

24
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:52,817
because he probably thought

25
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:54,657
his superior was trying to contact him.

26
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:55,657
Lastly,

27
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:56,416
a servant

28
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,327
also avoided the court officials
to go and meet him.

29
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,207
He asked him for money,

30
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,567
money for transporting weapons.

31
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:05,936
This treacherous of a man!

32
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:07,528
I can't believe he's behind this.

33
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,048
Don't worry, Master.

34
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:10,336
I'll take him back here.

35
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:11,167
No rush.

36
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:12,936
The seal is crucial.

37
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,177
But first, we need to confirm

38
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:17,007
if the seal is still in his possession.

39
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,048
You're right.

40
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,447
What's your plan, Master?

41
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,208
The servant needs money.

42
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:27,687
Mr. Zhao needs money too.

43
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,968
Then let's use money to trap them.

44
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,127
I can't believe

45
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,447
she was willing to die for him.

46
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:46,488
What is love in this world?

47
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,536
The love between
Miss Shen and Official Lu

48
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,447
is truly admirable.

49
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,617
Lu Shiyan, this scoundrel.

50
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:56,737
He's involved in embezzlement,

51
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,697
is suspected of treason,
and harms the Shen family.

52
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:00,488
He even enticed Zhen.

53
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:03,216
If you ask me,

54
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,577
you become obsessed because
your feelings aren't reciprocated.

55
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:07,328
Do you support her decision?

56
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,447
Do you care about what she needs?

57
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:11,177
You've always believed

58
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,617
that Miss Shen Zhen was misled

59
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:13,847
by Official Lu.

60
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:14,776
Have you ever

61
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,977
look closely

62
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,776
at the sacrifices they made
for each other

63
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:19,447
and what they had been through?

64
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:22,088
You're distorting the truth

65
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:24,328
and have also been misled by Lu Shiyan.

66
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,167
No, that's not it.

67
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:29,687
You don't understand love or feelings.

68
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,928
You're just someone

69
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,936
who has to marry

70
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,687
whoever your family chooses.

71
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,208
You're like

72
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,137
the two wild geese being carried away

73
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:42,256
during a marriage proposal.

74
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:44,127
Su Heng, you're asking for it!

75
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,127
You...

76
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:04,808
Do you admit defeat?

77
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:06,177
I admit!

78
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:07,328
Who's the wild goose now?

79
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,607
I am.

80
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,096
What are you again?

81
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,208
A wild goose, happy?

82
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:21,927
Look at you...

83
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,737
You're a lady.

84
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:26,456
Can you stop

85
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:28,128
resorting to violence at every turn?

86
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,816
It's all because you said

87
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,367
something out of turn.

88
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:39,287
It's because I drank too much just now.

89
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:41,328
That's more like it.

90
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:44,768
Actually,

91
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,688
I think what you just said

92
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:48,927
makes sense.

93
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:51,297
In the past,

94
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:53,407
I thought I was living
with great understanding.

95
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:55,657
I was born into this kind of family

96
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:57,247
and accepted this kind of fate.

97
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,648
But now I think

98
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,088
I should change my way of thinking.

99
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:11,208
Su Heng,

100
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,047
the same goes for you too.

101
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:15,008
Don't let the past control you.

102
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:16,968
Clear your mind,

103
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:18,727
open your eyes,

104
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,768
and take another look at this world.

105
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:22,737
See what is truly worth cherishing

106
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,128
for yourself.

107
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:30,927
Here.

108
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,657
Miss,

109
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:47,737
why do we have to wait here

110
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:48,927
for Official Yang?

111
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,768
I'm being watched.

112
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:52,696
If I meet with Yang Zong,

113
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:54,056
people will definitely notice.

114
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,199
According to the rules,

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,016
he has to come
to the Imperial Censorate every day.

116
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,016
He will definitely come.

117
00:05:58,017 --> 00:05:59,737
Are you sure that Lu Shiyan

118
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,448
will keep in touch with Yang Zong?

119
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,648
He needs help.

120
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:08,088
He's here.

121
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:15,487
Let's go.

122
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,097
From yesterday until now,

123
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:20,097
my schedule has been as such.

124
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:21,367
There are witnesses for everything.

125
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,496
If you have any doubts,

126
00:06:23,497 --> 00:06:24,688
you're welcome to verify.

127
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:28,367
Thank you for your report,
Official Yang.

128
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:29,950
You're just following the procedure.

129
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:30,888
So it's understandable.

130
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:35,847
Sir, Miss Shen Zhen is here.

131
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:40,088
Let her in.

132
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:45,167
Official Zhou.

133
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:46,857
Official Yang.

134
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:47,927
Miss Shen Zhen.

135
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,768
What brings you here today,
Miss Shen Zhen?

136
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:54,816
I came here today to inquire

137
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,688
if there is any news about Lu Shiyan.

138
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:58,607
Not yet.

139
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,727
Then may I ask,

140
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,537
what will you do

141
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:03,807
if you find Lu Shiyan?

142
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,968
It depends on what truly happened.

143
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,977
Then I will act accordingly.

144
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:10,576
I heard from Commandant Su that you
began to suspect the Eldest Princess

145
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:12,737
because of the word "Eldest"
on the blood-stained cloth

146
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:14,688
left by Zhao Chong.

147
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,376
All the investigations
by the Imperial Censorate

148
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:18,576
are based on evidence.

149
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:20,576
But I'm sorry, Miss Shen Zhen.

150
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:21,696
It's not convenient for me

151
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:23,136
to reveal the details of the case yet.

152
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:24,200
Later, Commandant Su started

153
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,016
to monitor the Duke Zhenguo Residence

154
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,056
and discovered the weapons

155
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:30,167
were transported from the dock
to the Duke Zhenguo Residence.

156
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:31,097
In the end,

157
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:32,056
Xu Wei led Lu Shiyan

158
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:33,337
and you into the mansion

159
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:34,097
and discovered

160
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:35,376
this series of evidence.

161
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:36,696
I want to ask you this.

162
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:37,576
Don't you think

163
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,607
someone is setting up behind the scenes?

164
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:41,417
Whether it's someone set it up

165
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,056
or their own setup,

166
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:44,496
it's hard to say now.

167
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,047
I only look at the evidence.

168
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:47,016
If Lu Shiyan

169
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:49,056
is really innocent,

170
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:50,890
he should come forward now

171
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:52,256
and accept the investigation calmly.

172
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,576
The West Canal case is really unusual.

173
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:56,896
I hope you can solve it soon

174
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:59,417
and clear the name of the person
who was framed,

175
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,217
so I can also get rid

176
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:01,927
of some disturbances.

177
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,727
Are there still people following you,
Miss Shen Zhen?

178
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:05,768
Yes.

179
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,617
Miss Shen Zhen,

180
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:08,896
don't worry.

181
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,247
I'll send several court officials
to protect you.

182
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,016
Thank you, Official Zhou.

183
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,816
I have troubled you today.

184
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,807
- Please excuse me.
- Goodbye.

185
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:25,287
Sir,

186
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:26,888
I'll take my leave too.

187
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,968
Shen Zhen was at the Imperial Censorate?

188
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,817
I think Miss Shen Zhen wants

189
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,256
to convey these messages to you

190
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:42,288
through me.

191
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:50,247
The character "Eldest?"

192
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,487
Blood-stained clothes.

193
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:55,176
Weapons were transported from the dock

194
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:57,247
to the Duke Zhenguo Residence.

195
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,057
Miss Shen Zhen also said

196
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:00,850
someone has been following her recently.

197
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:02,256
From her conversation
with Official Zhou,

198
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:03,057
it can be determined

199
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:04,977
that those people are not
from the Imperial Censorate.

200
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,457
She's probably trying to remind you

201
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,808
to be more careful.

202
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:21,487
I understand.

203
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,968
The depth of this case

204
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,928
has exceeded my imagination.

205
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:28,247
So far,

206
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,857
we still do not have

207
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,808
any substantial breakthroughs or clues.

208
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,896
I don't want her to be involved

209
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:35,247
or

210
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:37,088
with me implicating the Shen family
in the end.

211
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,288
By the way,

212
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,296
have you arranged

213
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,296
what I told you?

214
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:44,217
Don't worry, Master.

215
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,367
Everything is taken care of.

216
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:55,016
What do you want again?

217
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,937
I'm also trying to find a way.

218
00:09:56,938 --> 00:09:58,337
I can no longer persuade them

219
00:09:58,338 --> 00:09:59,656
with these excuses anymore.

220
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,256
The fellows want to see

221
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:02,896
something real and practical.

222
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,496
But now I'm locked up here.

223
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:05,607
What can I even do?

224
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:08,127
Mr. Zhao. Come on, Mr. Zhao.

225
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:09,977
I have a plan.

226
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:10,697
You know

227
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:12,617
I'm from the field estate.

228
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:15,048
I'm familiar with the keeper there.

229
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:17,097
Today, he came to the mansion
to deliver food

230
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,808
and we talked for a bit.

231
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,817
He can forge a document

232
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:23,887
to sell the field estate.

233
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,127
And as long as

234
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:27,577
we can steal

235
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:29,367
the Eldest Princess's seal

236
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:32,647
and quietly stamp it on the document,

237
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,337
then this estate

238
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:36,416
will be ours in the future.

239
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:37,968
Are you out of your mind?

240
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:42,737
Do you think it's that simple?

241
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,928
You might not live to enjoy it.

242
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:46,617
Then

243
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:48,367
are you doing

244
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,568
a simple matter?

245
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:57,697
Don't worry. Mr. Zhao.

246
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,577
The keeper is well acquainted

247
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:00,896
with the local officials.

248
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:03,136
Everything is arranged.

249
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,767
Nothing will go wrong with the document.

250
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:08,256
Besides, the Eldest Princess
has so many field estates.

251
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:10,968
She wouldn't even notice one missing.

252
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,176
She might even think

253
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,088
she sold it herself.

254
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,656
As long as we have the seal...

255
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:22,607
Yes, as long as we have the seal.

256
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,296
Well, you don't say.

257
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:35,656
I thought

258
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,288
we were at your residence.

259
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:43,688
Drink it to sober up.

260
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,328
You're being nice.

261
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:50,088
I want to ask you something.

262
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:52,048
What is it?

263
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:52,697
Are you sure

264
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:54,208
about the Duke Zhenguo Residence's crime?

265
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,896
There is ample evidence and witnesses.

266
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:00,727
What else is there to say?

267
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:03,457
If the Duke Zhenguo Residence

268
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,847
is really up to something,

269
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,217
would those few trunks of weapons

270
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:07,487
even be enough?

271
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:09,857
Could there be more

272
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,448
hidden elsewhere?

273
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,296
If this matter isn't investigated
thoroughly,

274
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,896
even if the Eldest Princess is detained,

275
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,647
it might be difficult to convict her.

276
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,057
Your romantic pursuit ended in failure.

277
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:28,896
Why not win in the investigation?

278
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:30,527
Let's go and investigate.

279
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,568
You have a point.

280
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:41,256
Didn't you say

281
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:42,097
you see

282
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,217
people transporting the trunks

283
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:44,408
to the Duke Zhenguo Residence?

284
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:45,697
Do you remember

285
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,048
what that person looked like?

286
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:48,288
Of course, I remember.

287
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,656
Let's find Miss Shen Zhen
and have her draw this person.

288
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:52,127
I can help you find that person.

289
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:53,607
Let's go.

290
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,767
I... I'm not going.

291
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,457
As a man,

292
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,088
how can you be so affected?

293
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:04,448
You said you're okay if she's okay.

294
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,817
Why are you afraid to see her
after a fight?

295
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:08,376
I'm not. I just feel...

296
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:09,168
If not, then let's go.

297
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,328
Come on.

298
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,647
Zhen, are you okay?

299
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,887
Miss Xu, are you looking for me?

300
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,136
We're here today

301
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:30,337
to ask you

302
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:31,928
to help us draw a portrait.

303
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:33,296
We want to find the person

304
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:34,977
who was transporting weapons
from the dock

305
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:36,208
to the Duke Zhenguo Residence.

306
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:42,817
Since you believe

307
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:44,057
the Eldest Princess is innocent,

308
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,208
then we have to investigate.

309
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,656
Any force in any direction

310
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:48,328
that can pinpoint the truth
is necessary.

311
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:54,448
Don't you agree?

312
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,408
Okay then.

313
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:17,007
Say it again.

314
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:18,647
What are his eyes like?

315
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,887
His eyes are unusually fierce,

316
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,367
narrow,

317
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,048
and a bit

318
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,727
contemptuous-looking.

319
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:50,448
Are you sure this is him?

320
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,487
Yes, I'm sure.

321
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:56,776
Do you know him?

322
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:57,808
It's Pang Hu.

323
00:14:58,137 --> 00:14:59,607
Do you still remember Zhao Chong?

324
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:01,737
This person
was Zhao Chong's subordinate.

325
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,617
When Lu Shiyan captured Zhao Chong,

326
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:05,057
he faced assassination many times

327
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:06,688
and narrowly escaped death
multiple times.

328
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,767
Pang Hu even attacked me.

329
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:09,776
Lu Shiyan

330
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:11,408
would never conspire with him.

331
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:14,136
If it's not Lu Shiyan,

332
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:15,767
what if it's the Eldest Princess?

333
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:17,256
The Eldest Princess

334
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,127
would never joke around
with her son's life.

335
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:20,617
Actually,

336
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:23,247
I also think the Eldest Princess
won't do such a thing.

337
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:25,256
After I returned to the capital,

338
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,088
I stayed at the Duke Zhenguo Residence
for a long time.

339
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:31,048
I got along well
with the Eldest Princess.

340
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:32,337
She grew up in favor

341
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:34,448
of the late Emperor

342
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:36,097
and now has a close relationship

343
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,527
with the current Emperor.

344
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,647
Although she is a bit proud
and stubborn,

345
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,448
she is simple-minded.

346
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:45,288
How could she have
the intention of rebellion?

347
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:47,527
Moreover, not long ago,

348
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:50,057
when Mr. Zhao needed
the Eldest Princess's seal

349
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:51,928
to purchase fabric,

350
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:52,857
she casually

351
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,208
let Mr. Zhao take it.

352
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,457
So,

353
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,500
how can the seal on the document

354
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,288
for the private purchase
of iron ore prove anything?

355
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,657
(Baixiang Pavilion)

356
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:12,727
Commandant Su.

357
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:14,767
Su Heng!

358
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:17,448
What are you thinking about?

359
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,016
Do you also think

360
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:21,048
Miss Shen Zhen is right?

361
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,288
Listen,

362
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,217
Zhen has always been very simple-minded.

363
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,536
She might not be able to see through

364
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,688
those cunning people.

365
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,607
And you,

366
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:34,750
you said you think

367
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,337
the Eldest Princess
wouldn't do such a thing.

368
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:37,817
Do you all make judgments

369
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,457
based on intuition?

370
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,408
Fine.

371
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:42,487
Then we won't rely on intuition.

372
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,937
Pang Hu is currently in the capital.

373
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,199
If we capture him,

374
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,857
we'll know the answer
after we interrogate him.

375
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:48,767
What do you think?

376
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:50,296
We?

377
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:51,288
Why?

378
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:52,737
I'm willing to help you.

379
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:54,288
Shouldn't you be grateful?

380
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:58,568
A defeated underling dares
to be pretentious.

381
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:00,808
Let's go and discuss the strategy.

382
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,247
I'm not your defeated underling.

383
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,247
I...

384
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:24,968
Mother.

385
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:27,648
Yan.

386
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,287
Mother.

387
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:32,567
Yan, what are you doing here?

388
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,368
It's too dangerous here.

389
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:36,736
What if you get caught?

390
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:37,688
Mother,

391
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:39,848
how are you holding up?

392
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:41,848
I'm fine.

393
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:43,727
Don't worry.

394
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:45,936
You need to leave quickly.

395
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:46,888
Mother,

396
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:49,327
I want to talk to you.

397
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,247
Yan,

398
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,487
I have never done

399
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:56,888
anything presumptuous as this.

400
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,487
I have implicated you.

401
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,487
Mother, don't say that.

402
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,688
I have never doubted you.

403
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:12,767
I have found out

404
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:15,087
that Mr. Zhao is involved in this.

405
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,136
It's very likely

406
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,537
that he forged your seal

407
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:18,736
to purchase the iron ore.

408
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:21,656
Then he worked with the other party
to smuggle the weapons into the residence.

409
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:23,247
Mr. Zhao?

410
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,848
He has been serving us
for over twenty years.

411
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,848
I trusted him so much.

412
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:29,257
How could he

413
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,617
do such a thing?

414
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,247
People's hearts are unpredictable.

415
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:34,617
Mother, rest assured.

416
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:36,057
I have set a trap.

417
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:37,537
He will fall into it.

418
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,136
Once we have obtained the fake seal,

419
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:41,807
we will have a chance
to have the case reexamined.

420
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:44,537
Mother,

421
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:46,527
it was my negligence this time.

422
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:48,888
I was completely unaware of this matter

423
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:51,408
and caused you to suffer.

424
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,888
What nonsense are you talking about?

425
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:56,696
As long as I can see

426
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:58,408
you are safe and sound,

427
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:01,928
that's enough.

428
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:04,567
As long as you are safe,

429
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,448
I don't care what happens to me.

430
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,128
Mother, rest assured.

431
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:13,047
I will definitely investigate
this case thoroughly.

432
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:15,688
I won't let you suffer unjustly.

433
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:18,688
All right.

434
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,656
I believe in you.

435
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:23,247
But remember,

436
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,608
you must never put yourself
in danger again.

437
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:33,327
Okay, you have to leave now.

438
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:35,368
Don't let anyone find out.

439
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:43,888
Mother, remember to eat well

440
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:46,376
and take care of yourself.

441
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:47,567
Don't worry.

442
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,608
Go now.

443
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:55,047
Be careful. You must be careful.

444
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:57,648
Yan.

445
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:01,608
Yan, be careful.

446
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,920
(Smuggling)

447
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,840
(Eldest Princess Case)

448
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,280
(Eldest)

449
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,896
It was just a cat.

450
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:47,577
Let's go.

451
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:48,408
Okay.

452
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,617
(Duke Zhenguo Residence)

453
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:57,696
Mr. Zhao,

454
00:22:57,697 --> 00:23:01,416
these are the transfer documents
for the field estate deed.

455
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,736
They're all here.

456
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:03,727
Take a look.

457
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:06,656
Once we stamp
the Eldest Princess's seal on them,

458
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:09,087
these will all be ours.

459
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,817
All right. I know.

460
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:16,968
You can leave first.

461
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,297
Don't draw any attention.

462
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:19,696
I'll handle

463
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:20,857
the seal.

464
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,807
All right.

465
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:50,777
(So it was)

466
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:52,487
(all Pang Hu's doing.)

467
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:54,057
(He was the one smuggling weapons)

468
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,487
(to the Duke Zhenguo Residence.)

469
00:23:56,058 --> 00:23:57,807
(If we can find him,)

470
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:58,736
(we should be able)

471
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,497
(to help the Eldest Princess
clear her name.)

472
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:02,368
(I need to inform Lu Shiyan quickly.)

473
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:06,537
Lu Shiyan, sorry about this.

474
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:08,327
I hope you'll understand.

475
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,416
What's wrong, Master?

476
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:27,648
Is your heart aching again?

477
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:30,608
You can go ahead first.

478
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:33,448
I can feel something's wrong with her.

479
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:34,968
But Master...

480
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,527
Shen Zhen.

481
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,727
I'm sorry.

482
00:24:58,098 --> 00:25:00,208
I've caused you pain again.

483
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:02,976
I had no other way.

484
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,848
I wanted to see you too.

485
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:07,287
But I can't.

486
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:09,087
I understand.

487
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:11,368
It's okay.

488
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:13,608
Yang Zong already told me.

489
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:17,487
How's your injury?

490
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:19,057
Does it still hurt?

491
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:21,527
Come and sit down.

492
00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:24,136
Don't worry.

493
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:25,176
It doesn't hurt anymore.

494
00:25:25,177 --> 00:25:26,208
I'm fine.

495
00:25:29,018 --> 00:25:29,848
By the way,

496
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:33,497
Su Heng told me

497
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,696
the leader who smuggled weapons

498
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:37,327
to the Duke Zhenguo Residence
was Pang Hu.

499
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:40,168
Pang Hu?

500
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,368
The person controlling Pang Hu

501
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:45,047
must be very close to the mastermind.

502
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:48,727
Capturing Pang Hu is crucial.

503
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,896
Miss Xu and Su Heng

504
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,727
have already followed Pang Hu's trail.

505
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:54,368
Zhen,

506
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:56,727
thank you.

507
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:05,848
Take a look at this.

508
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:07,608
Is there anything unusual?

509
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:09,727
Isn't this...

510
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:12,007
Shouldn't this be
at the Imperial Censorate?

511
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:13,767
How did...

512
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,007
This doesn't smell right.

513
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:23,608
Not just blood.

514
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:30,688
How did you manage to smell that?

515
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:34,617
Did you learn this from Blacky?

516
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:36,448
How can you joke

517
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:37,888
at a time like this?

518
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:41,487
Because

519
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:44,087
I wish to see a smile

520
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:46,448
on your face forever.

521
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:01,456
Official Lu?

522
00:27:01,457 --> 00:27:02,487
Ran.

523
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:06,727
Miss Shen Ran.

524
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:08,727
If you really care about Zhen,

525
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:10,896
you know you shouldn't be here.

526
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:13,007
Miss Shen Ran,
I understand your concerns.

527
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,087
But I do have a reason

528
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:17,527
for coming here today.

529
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:22,817
Ran,

530
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:24,448
I made him come here.

531
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:25,696
We have made a discovery.

532
00:27:25,697 --> 00:27:27,087
- This matter isn't...
- Zhen,

533
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:28,888
have you forgotten

534
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:31,168
what I told you?

535
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:34,087
Official Lu,

536
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:36,216
the whole city is searching for you.

537
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:38,087
If anyone finds out you're here,

538
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:39,136
have you ever thought

539
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:40,408
about Zhen's safety?

540
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,168
I apologize, Miss Shen Ran.

541
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:45,848
I acted rashly.

542
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:47,688
Please understand, Official Lu.

543
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:49,208
Ran!

544

00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:12,216
Madam Zhuang?

566
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,057
Official Lu,

567
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:15,128
you should stay here tonight.

568
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,696
Madam Zhuang,
you lent a hand to save me.

569
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:18,287
I'm truly grateful.

570
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:20,497
But I'm sure you know
what the situation is like now.

571
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:22,487
There are two groups
of people looking for me.

572
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:23,777
If they find out I'm here,

573
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:24,936
you'll be implicated.

574
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:25,696
I should leave.

575
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:26,408
No.

576
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,857
It's too dangerous out there.

577
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:29,208
That's right.

578
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,656
Take a seat first.

579
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:31,337
Let's talk inside.

580
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:32,087
Sit.

581
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:40,736
I believe you're

582
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:42,297
not an evil person.

583
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:43,087
That's right.

584
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:45,057
You're seriously injured.

585
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:46,807
I'll go and get some medicine
to treat you.

586
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,399
Official Lu, stop hesitating.

587
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,097
If you hadn't risked your life
to save my husband,

588
00:31:54,098 --> 00:31:56,487
he wouldn't have returned safely.

589
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,176
At that time,
I only wanted to save my husband.

590
00:31:58,177 --> 00:32:00,537
I was afraid he might already
have been killed by Zhao Chong.

591
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:01,297
You are

592
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:03,047
our lifesaver.

593
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:04,176
Tonight,

594
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:06,247
stay here without any worries.

595
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:10,057
Earlier,

596
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:11,896
I met Miss Shen Zhen.

597
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,888
I've heard about your situation.

598
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,136
The temporary difficulties you're facing

599
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,136
are a kind of trial

600
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,456
for both of you.

601
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:21,337
I believe you and Miss Shen Zhen

602
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:23,247
will be able to overcome the obstacles.

603
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:30,087
Thank you.

604
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:36,448
You two have survived a great ordeal.

605
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,247
It's not easy

606
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:40,848
to start a new life.

607
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:42,727
Live well.

608
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:44,608
We will be fine.

609
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:27,648
Father,

610
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:32,368
was I wrong?

611
00:33:35,298 --> 00:33:37,848
There's nothing wrong.

612
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:41,767
I know my daughter

613
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,767
the best.

614
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:45,648
You and Zhen

615
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,327
are both straightforward.

616
00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:50,176
You do

617
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:51,497
what you think and feel.

618
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:52,257
And

619
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:53,456
you both strive

620
00:33:53,457 --> 00:33:56,767
to uphold your beliefs and loves.

621
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:00,448
But Ran,

622
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:02,208
you also need to see

623
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,767
that Zhen has grown up.

624
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:08,856
Besides caring

625
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:10,256
and protecting her,

626
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,017
shouldn't you also choose

627
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,808
to trust her?

628
00:34:17,337 --> 00:34:18,728
And for you,

629
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,937
there's no need to be overly persistent
about certain things.

630
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:24,928
Life is short. How can we waste it?

631
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,296
Let the past

632
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,928
pass quickly

633
00:34:28,257 --> 00:34:30,408
and live a fulfilling life.

634
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,328
Then your life won't be in vain.

635
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:42,968
Sir!

636
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:46,647
Sir!

637
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:48,216
Why are you so flustered?

638
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:49,768
Miss Shen Ran is here.

639
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:51,888
What is she here for?

640
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:53,968
Let me go and ask.

641
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,087
Wait.

642
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:56,417
No need to ask.

643
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:57,417
Let her come in.

644
00:34:57,418 --> 00:34:58,207
Yes, sir.

645
00:34:58,817 --> 00:34:59,728
Chuyi,

646
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:06,047
look at me.

647
00:35:06,098 --> 00:35:07,127
How do I look today?

648
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:08,288
Handsome.

649
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:10,537
Go and get her.

650
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:11,288
Yes, sir.

651
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,127
Official Zhou.

652
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:29,687
Miss Shen Ran,
what brings you here today?

653
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:32,057
Is it for an official matter or...?

654
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:33,856
When my father hurt his back,

655
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:35,848
it was thanks to your ointment
that he was better.

656
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,577
My father is feeling a bit unwell today,

657
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:39,176
so he sent me to ask

658
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:40,968
where you bought the ointment.

659
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:42,808
The ointment

660
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,487
is from the Imperial Censorate's
private collection.

661
00:35:48,137 --> 00:35:49,696
Then I won't trouble you.

662
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:51,888
Matters regarding Uncle Shen
are no trouble at all.

663
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:56,167
I'll have someone fetch it.

664
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,047
Chuyi,

665
00:35:58,578 --> 00:35:59,497
go and get it.

666
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:00,248
Yes, sir.

667
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:03,127
Thank you, Official Zhou.

668
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:04,647
Miss Shen Ran,

669
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,977
how about a cup of tea

670
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:07,150
while waiting for the ointment?

671
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:08,207
Sure.

672
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:09,288
This way, please.

673
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:15,368
Will it affect your work if I'm here?

674
00:36:15,578 --> 00:36:16,937
If so, I can come back later.

675
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:17,888
It won't.

676
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:19,808
Please, sit.

677
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:29,977
Miss Shen Zhen, how is she today?

678
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:31,127
She's fine.

679
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:33,336
Other than coming here
these past two days,

680
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:34,808
She hasn't left home.

681
00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:38,527
You don't have to worry too much.

682
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,448
Things will come to light eventually.

683
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:43,617
What Miss Shen Zhen needs to learn now

684
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,368
is how to protect herself.

685
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:50,047
How should she protect herself?

686
00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:53,607
Zhen has deep feelings

687
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:56,207
for Official Lu.

688
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,167
It's all right if nothing happens
to the Duke Zhenguo Residence.

689
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,647
But if something does,

690
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,696
Zhen may never be at peace in this life.

691
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:06,007
The matter at the Duke Zhenguo Residence
is not trivial.

692
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:07,216
If Official Lu

693
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,007
is really involved in treason,

694
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:10,696
the best thing to do now

695
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,848
is to come forward, confess everything,

696
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:14,567
and accept the punishment.

697
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:16,816
If the Eldest Princess

698
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,848
is indeed being framed,

699
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:21,007
if the two of them
truly love each other,

700
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:22,617
there's no need to rush

701
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,288
at this moment.

702
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:26,928
They understand each other's feelings.

703
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:28,296
If they can't even overcome

704
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:29,768
this obstacle,

705
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:32,808
how can they entrust their lives
to each other?

706
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:36,937
Actually, I have always hoped

707
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:39,127
that Zhen could live a peaceful
and happy life,

708
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,928
carefree

709
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,968
and loved.

710
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:44,736
But I overlooked

711
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:45,856
what she truly wants

712
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,448
from life.

713
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,368
A seemingly peaceful life

714
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:51,968
does not mean inner peace.

715
00:37:52,578 --> 00:37:54,167
A seemingly harmonious relationship

716
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:56,647
does not mean true happiness.

717
00:37:57,498 --> 00:37:59,808
If there is a longing in the heart,

718
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:02,888
the pursuit process can also be joyful.

719
00:38:03,257 --> 00:38:04,687
Looking back,

720
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:06,768
even if it's bitter,

721
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,607
it can also be sweet.

722
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,017
Official Zhou,
you're busy with official duties.

723
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,417
I won't disturb you anymore.

724
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:34,047
I'll come and get the ointment tomorrow.

725
00:38:34,257 --> 00:38:35,087
It's all right.

726
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:36,888
Whenever you're free.

727
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:38,856
I can also deliver it

728
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:40,207
to Baixiang Pavilion tomorrow.

729
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:45,248
I'll leave it to you, Official Zhou.

730
00:38:56,618 --> 00:38:57,736
Hurry up.

731
00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:58,448
Okay.

732
00:38:58,697 --> 00:38:59,888
There are two more trunks here.

733
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,216
These goods are all very important.

734
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:01,736
Hurry up.

735
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:02,537
Count them carefully.

736
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:03,248
Okay.

737
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:06,207
Are all those weapons?

738
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:07,167
Yes.

739
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:11,768
Master Pang.

740
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:12,928
Pang Hu is here.

741
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:14,736
Are the goods all sorted?

742
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:17,728
They are handled according to usual procedures.
There won't be any mistakes.

743
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,136
Have you found Lu Shiyan?

744
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:22,057
We were useless.

745
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:23,607
Lu Shiyan managed to escape.

746
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:31,577
Then find Lu Shiyan as soon as possible.

747
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,736
Report to the authorities

748
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,047
or kill him, do whatever it takes.

749
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,776
The benefactor wants the Eldest Princess

750
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:37,417
to be convicted as soon as possible

751
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:38,937
to avoid further complications.

752
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:39,687
Yes.

753
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:40,977
Hurry up.

754
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:41,687
Come on.

755
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:42,448
Yes.

756
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:48,047
Do you get it now?

757
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,560
(Pillar of the State)

758
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,808
I thought I knew the truth.

759
00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:02,808
I even hid it from Zhen

760
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:05,647
and caused the person she liked
to suffer injustice.

761
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:09,047
I even thought I was doing it
for her own good.

762
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:11,527
But in the end, I was ignorant
of my own stupidity.

763
00:40:13,657 --> 00:40:15,497
Am I a failure?

764
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,127
Don't blame yourself too much.

765
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:18,550
You came to the capital

766
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:20,377
to investigate the case
of the amassing of troops.

767
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,497
Having doubts and finding evidence

768
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,288
is part of your responsibility.

769
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,728
Besides,

770
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:28,728
aren't you quite capable?

771
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:35,888
But I used it

772
00:40:36,777 --> 00:40:38,567
in the wrong place.

773
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,647
I even hurt other people's feelings.

774
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:44,897
Everything is still uncertain.

775
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:45,656
Look,

776
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:46,457
you've found

777
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,848
Pang Hu's whereabouts.

778
00:40:47,898 --> 00:40:48,696
And

779
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,897
you even admitted your mistake.

780
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:50,888
Xu Yiqing,

781
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:52,288
I know.

782
00:40:52,978 --> 00:40:54,207
Actually,

783
00:40:54,857 --> 00:40:56,768
you deliberately led me to the dock,

784
00:40:57,337 --> 00:40:59,248
claiming it was to investigate

785
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:00,607
and verify evidence.

786
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,377
But in reality, you wanted me

787
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,167
to discover the truth myself.

788
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:07,017
You're a stubborn person.

789
00:41:07,018 --> 00:41:07,937
If I didn't let you see

790
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:09,687
and hear it for yourself,

791
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:11,928
would you easily believe it?

792
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,007
Thanks.

793
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:20,408
Miss Man, this way.

794
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:22,696
Official Yang,

795
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,487
why did you bring me here?

796
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:26,567
Miss Man.

797
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:28,368
Official Lu?

798
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,007
Sorry to trouble you.

799
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:31,968
It's urgent

800
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:33,497
and I need your help.

801
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:34,856
If I can help,

802
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:36,256
I would help without hesitation.

803
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:37,127
Thank you.

804
00:41:42,177 --> 00:41:44,097
This is what Zhao Chong left
before he died.

805
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:45,256
Miss Shen Zhen said

806
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:47,248
besides the smell of blood,

807
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,097
she also smelled

808
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:49,567
something else on it.

809
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,336
Miss Man, you're knowledgeable
about medicine.

810
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:53,328
Could you check it out?

811
00:42:50,418 --> 00:42:51,567
"Chen?"

812
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:54,577
Zhao Chong's first reaction
before he died

813
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:57,207
should indicate the person
who killed him.

814
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:58,808
So

815
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:03,527
this character is directed
toward a person.

816
00:43:06,337 --> 00:43:07,808
The character "Chen"

817
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:12,487
is the rank of an imperial prince.

818
00:43:12,898 --> 00:43:14,728
Prince?

819
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,776
The secretly forged weapons

820
00:43:15,777 --> 00:43:17,127
and the amassing of troops

821
00:43:17,217 --> 00:43:19,127
Commandant Su mentioned earlier...

822
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:21,007
