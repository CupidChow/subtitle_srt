=Episode 11=

18
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:40,823
Wei,

19
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:43,615
what do you think about the liquor?

20
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,544
I think you brewed it
using the immersion method.

21
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:49,424
First, you immerse
the wine yeast in water.

22
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:52,215
You acquire its juice
after filtering it.

23
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,544
I told you to tell me how it tastes,

24
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,814
not how I make it.

25
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:00,734
Ever since I stepped into
the liquor industry,

26
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,016
I can never
drink liquor in the same way again.

27
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:04,456
Whenever I drink,

28
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,607
I think about the profit I can make.

29
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,968
Wei, seems like you're
raring to join the industry.

30
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:14,136
Naturally.

31
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,777
All ten boxes of gold are ready.

32
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:17,337
I can deliver them to you anytime.

33
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,937
Wei, it's satisfying
to do business with you.

34
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,528
Come.

35
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:24,167
Let's have another toast.

36
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:30,647
Zhao!

37
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:42,767
Wei, save me!

38
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:44,968
Zhao, I'll save you!

39
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:47,267
Who are you?

40
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,799
How dare you try to assassinate Zhao?

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,948
Your identity has been exposed.

42
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,867
I'm here to save you under
the governor's order.

43
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,228
What do you mean?

44
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,149
We're just doing business here.

45
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,508
Zhao Chong already captured Miss Qin.

46
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,307
Miss Qin

47
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:58,747
has already exposed your identity.

48
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:01,350
You and I have to capture Zhao Chong
as quickly as possible and report back.

49
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:03,098
I didn't!

50
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:09,139
(Shen Zhen is only crying now
after she was captured?)

51
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:11,739
Someone!

52
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,938
Run!

53
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,419
Zhao, let's go!

54
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,547
Buddy, that's enough!

55
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:33,707
I'll go back to Jingzhou!

56
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,587
I'll return to Jingzhou!

57
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:36,459
You can take him back if you like.

58
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,859
Zhao, I don't want to die!

59
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,811
Zhao,

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,660
so, you were testing me?

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,091
Wei, don't blame me.

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,740
We're doing risky business here.

63
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,571
Naturally, we have to be careful.

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,780
Where's Miss Qin?

65
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,890
Don't worry. She's fine.

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,290
Let's continue our chat.

67
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:20,731
I'll ask you this again.

68
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,290
Where's Miss Qin?

69
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,410
Will you tell me or not?

70
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:27,970
Hurry!

71
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:30,850
I have no idea.

72
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,739
Wei!

73
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,380
Don't move!

74
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,410
Wei!

75
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,090
Wei, I was terrified.

76
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,530
Everything's fine now.

77
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,571
I'm here.

78
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,611
Don't cry.

79
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:50,691
Everything's fine now.

80
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,131
Were you hurt?

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,970
Seems like Miss Qin was shocked.

82
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:58,650
He said you were an impostor?

83
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,611
Wei.

84
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,260
How could you

85
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,090
be an impostor?

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,660
I went to Jingzhou from the capital

87
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:08,090
five years ago.

88
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,419
You fell for me back then.

89
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,660
You tried to win my heart every day.

90
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,539
When I wanted the moon,

91
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,040
you didn't dare to
pluck the stars for me.

92
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,700
When I wanted peony
that only grew during winter,

93
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:17,260
you built

94
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,371
a greenhouse for me.

95
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,611
Wei,

96
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,890
how could you be an impostor?

97
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,020
You guys better listen up.

98
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:29,330
Wei will never lie to me.

99
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,450
That's right.

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,179
When you wanted the moon,

101
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,731
I didn't dare to pluck
the stars for you.

102
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,770
Stop crying.

103
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,290
If you keep crying,

104
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,970
my heart will ache.

105
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,739
Not only did you test me,

106
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,539
but you also

107
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,731
did this to my mistress.

108
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,780
Zhao,

109
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,251
the deal is off.

110
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,650
Wei.

111
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,299
I was inconsiderate indeed.

112
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,970
I was rude.

113
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:10,011
What about this?

114
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,210
You can take an extra 10% of our profit.

115
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,691
20%.

116
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:27,611
20%?

117
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,220
I wish to buy the white jade hairpin

118
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,131
sold by Chunli Pavilion.

119
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,820
Besides Chunli Pavilion,

120
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,859
you can also buy the silk
in Jinxiu Fabric House,

121
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,419
Huayue Bordello's rouge,

122
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,460
and the paintings of
Wenmo Painting House.

123
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:39,939
Wuzhou is a great place for you to stay

124
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,731
as long as you have money.

125
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,970
Does it still hurt?

126
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,251
It won't hurt as long as

127
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,450
I have the white jade hairpin.

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,650
Making money is more important.

129
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,171
Miss Qin is understanding indeed.

130
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,380
Do not do this again.

131
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:16,251
I won't.

132
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:43,731
Sorry.

133
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,090
I was negligent.

134
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,890
You had to put yourself in danger.

135
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:54,499
We're trying to save my father here.

136
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,691
It's my duty to take such risks.

137
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,131
And, you're the Imperial Inspector.

138
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,251
Although this is your duty,

139
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:05,811
you're still risking your life

140
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,890
for my sake.

141
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,650
However,

142
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,179
I did great today, right?

143
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,051
Yes, you did great.

144
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,660
You used your silver tongue,
which you used

145
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,419
to discuss the law with me,

146
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,660
to stall Pang Mu

147
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,890
and made him unable to act.

148
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,290
Were you afraid just now?

149
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,650
I was.

150
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,810
But I have to hang in there.

151
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:36,611
I'm Miss Qin.

152
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,810
Wei, am I right?

153
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:43,091
That's right.

154
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:45,331
You're Wei's Miss Qin.

155
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,570
I'm fine.

156
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,219
It's just a minor wound.

157
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,690
It no longer hurts.

158
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,050
Don't move.

159
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,611
You have a wound.

160
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:14,890
Does it hurt?

161
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,131
No.

162
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,530
By the way,

163
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,699
Fuman

164
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,731
already told Zhao Chong

165
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,410
about your identity.

166
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:45,690
But the act he put up today,

167
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,020
I wonder what's going on.

168
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,491
I think someone from the capital

169
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,611
leaked the news to him.

170
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,611
The collapse of the West Canal
is a huge case.

171
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,939
Zhao Chong and Li Di alone

172
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,890
cannot achieve that by themselves.

173
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,810
I never expected Di

174
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,170
to be someone like that.

175
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,170
I wonder how my sister is doing.

176
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,451
Don't worry.

177
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:10,410
If anything does happen,

178
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,371
Official Zhou will help her out.

179
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:14,980
By the way, we just formed

180
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,131
a collaboration with Zhao Chong.

181
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,971
You must never leave my side
in the future.

182
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,810
Okay.

183
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:29,131
Madam, Official Zhou sent this here.

184
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,371
A ledger.

185
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,706
(Divorce Letter)

186
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,211
A divorce letter?

187
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,419
(If you're willing,)

188
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,900
(sign your name here.)

189
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,570
(Leave the rest to me.)

190
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,371
Are you going to divorce Master?

191
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,740
Shouldn't I?

192
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:07,539
I was worried

193
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,740
that you would be implicated

194
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:10,539
if Master was convicted of his crime.

195
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,260
Madam,

196
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:13,299
if you can divorce him
before he gets convicted,

197
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,290
you won't be implicated.

198
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:17,170
Madam,

199
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,459
Official Zhou

200
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,971
cares a lot about you indeed.

201
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:23,331
Madam!

202
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,251
I will consider it.

203
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:45,971
The Wei family is wealthy indeed.

204
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,059
They delivered ten boxes of gold

205
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,451
from Jingzhou immediately
right after we requested it.

206
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:52,140
But Mr. Zhao, you had to accept

207
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:53,851
a deficit of 20%.

208
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,459
It's necessary for us to be wary.

209
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,219
We were involved in a huge deal.

210
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,179
If something goes wrong,

211
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,620
even the execution of our entire families
can't make up for it.

212
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,410
Understood.

213
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,140
Moreover, the Wei family

214
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,810
has their own transport routes
and caravans.

215
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:12,380
It's very beneficial

216
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,810
to our business.

217
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,690
Moreover, Wei Xian was already drugged.

218
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,860
The deficit we receive today,

219
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:21,050
we'll get them back

220
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,770
in the future.

221
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,410
Understood.

222
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,650
I was short-sighted.

223
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,539
Have you prepared the food supply

224
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,539
that Wei Xian requested?

225
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,620
Yes, sir.

226
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,530
We just need to wait for them
to deliver the rest of the gold to us.

227
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:49,419
I was very close to Autumn Moon

228
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,579
today,

229
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,570
yet I couldn't get my hands on it.

230
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,380
Now, Zhao Chong

231
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,930
already trusts us.

232
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,539
If we have a fake painting

233
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,331
that looks like the real deal,

234
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,620
we might have a chance to swap it

235
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:01,971
for the real deal.

246
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,140
My lord, we just received news
that the waterway was congested.

247
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,780
The gold we're transporting
from Jingzhou

248
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:14,200
won't be able to reach here by tomorrow.

249
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,740
But now, we only have

250
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,650
one box of gold remaining.

251
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,100
Zhao Chong is a paranoid person.

252
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:22,290
Now, we only have one box of gold.

253
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,731
I'm afraid we won't be able to
dupe him tomorrow.

254
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,860
Don't tell me you're going

255
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,500
to retrieve Autumn Moon tonight?

256
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,339
Tonight is our best chance.

257
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,819
But now, you haven't devised a plan yet.

258
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,260
Wouldn't it be more dangerous

259
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,579
if you went there suddenly

260
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,410
and failed?

261
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,451
Do you trust me?

262
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,666
(Zhao Residence)

263
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,733
The capital was upset with us

264
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:25,373
about the fire at the sawmill.

265
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:26,694
Luckily, the deputy minister

266
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:28,245
mediated for us.

267
00:15:28,535 --> 00:15:30,045
You know what to do

268
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:31,814
after this.

269
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:32,724
Understood.

270
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,604
Deputy minister?

271
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,574
Now, we have bigger issues to deal with.

272
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:51,885
No mistakes are allowed.

273
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:52,885
Yes, sir.

274
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:13,804
Mr. Zhao,

275
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:15,285
this is the ledger for this month.

276
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,574
All ten boxes of gold

277
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:23,014
will be delivered here tomorrow.

278
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,694
Divide the loot accordingly
as per usual.

279
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:26,324
60% will be delivered to the capital.

280
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,014
As for the 40%...

281
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:29,324
I know what to do.

282
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:34,253
Someone is investigating

283
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,333
the West Canal case now.

284
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,604
I still feel uneasy about it.

285
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,525
To ensure that everything is safe,

286
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:44,493
destroy all of the ledgers.

287
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:45,964
Keep none of them.

288
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:50,285
After this, I'll depend on you
to do my accounts.

289
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,604
Mr. Zhao, don't worry.

290
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,654
I won't make any mistakes.

291
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:55,484
Go now.

292
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,373
Protect him

293
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,494
24/7.

294
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:05,325
Yes, sir.

295
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,054
How long has your missus

296
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,444
been standing there?

297
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:32,653
She's been standing there

298
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:34,325
ever since the sun set.

299
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,004
What's wrong?

300
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:39,605
Let me ask you something.

301
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:42,133
Don't you think my master

302
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:43,093
is acting weird lately?

303
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:43,805
I!

304
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:47,524
I wanted to ask you the same.

305
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,093
Don't you think

306
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:51,214
my missus is also acting weird lately?

307
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:52,565
What do you mean?

308
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:53,413
Sometimes,

309
00:17:53,414 --> 00:17:54,373
she'll smile to herself

310
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,325
when she's alone.

311
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:57,964
It's quite concerning.

312
00:17:58,295 --> 00:17:59,933
She has the same symptoms

313
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,845
as my master.

314
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,244
Could it be...

315
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,444
Could it be...

316
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:15,964
I'm back.

317
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:18,885
You're back?

318
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:21,933
Are you okay?

319
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,173
Were you discovered?

320
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:24,405
Were you hurt?

321
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:26,244
Do you feel unwell?

322
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:33,044
I retrieved the construction plan.

323
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:36,605
I retrieved Fuman's antidote too.

324
00:18:57,894 --> 00:18:59,325
It's hidden within indeed.

325
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:01,284
It's the construction plan.

326
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:05,204
Here.

327
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:06,484
Hold this.

328
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,284
It's my father's handwriting.

329
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,125
Official Lu, thank you so much.

330
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,413
I'm glad that you got it back.

331
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,333
This is great.

332
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,365
I can finally rescue my father.

333
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:41,085
But don't cry.

334
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:44,574
Does that mean

335
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,284
we can return to the capital now?

336
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:50,684
What's the matter?

337
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:51,853
Sit down.

338
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,085
Let me explain the situation.

339
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,054
Initially, we could withdraw from here

340
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,845
after retrieving the construction plan.

341
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,325
But now,

342
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,524
we have one more task to accomplish.

343
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:06,173
Zhao Chong is accumulating wealth
illegally at a rapid rate.

344
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:08,444
60% of his profit

345
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:10,085
will be delivered to the capital.

346
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,605
The capital?

347
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:14,774
Zhao Chong does what he wants in Wuzhou

348
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,444
without any fear.

349
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,805
Could it be that someone
from the capital is backing him?

350
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:23,254
The West Canal case
involves many individuals.

351
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,173
When I was in the painting room,

352
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:25,933
Zhao Chong

353
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,853
mentioned the fire at the sawmill.

354
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,405
He said the deputy minister

355
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:31,524
diffused the tension for them.

356
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:33,413
I need to find out who

357
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:36,244
the deputy minister is

358
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:37,974
and who the person above him is.

359
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,484
Let me join you.

360
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,814
You and Yang Zong can return
to the capital

361
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,734
and hand the construction plan
to Official Zhou.

362
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,734
The earlier he gets the
construction plan,

363
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:48,885
the earlier your father
can rest at ease.

364
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:50,133
What about you, then?

365
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:51,565
I'll go back and find you

366
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,044
after I capture Zhao Chong.

367
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:02,684
If you stay by my side,

368
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:05,325
I'll get distracted.

369
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:07,774
I can leave first.

370
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,605
However, I'll wait for you
outside the city gate.

371
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,724
I want to return
to the capital with you.

372
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:18,964
All right.

373
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:22,764
My lord.

374
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:23,805
Have you found it?

375
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:25,365
Yes, sir.

376
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,613
His name is Li Ji.

377
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:27,534
He's a famous accountant

378
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:28,933
in Wuzhou.

379
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:31,444
After that, he was recruited by Zhao Chong
and served him ever since.

380
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:32,534
Rumor has it

381
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,333
that he can remember
all accounts at first glance

382
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,613
no matter how complicated they are.

383
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:38,974
There's actually
a genius like him around?

384
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,254
Li Ji

385
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:41,774
is hiding in Zhao Chong's painting room.

386
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:44,165
Once we capture Li Ji,

387
00:21:44,174 --> 00:21:45,534
we'll gain access to all

388
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,333
of Zhao Chong's accounts.

389
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,044
My lord, to be honest with you,

390
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,413
I was fed up

391
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:52,524
with my role

392
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:54,365
as Yang Zong, the housekeeper.

393
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,645
Now, I can finally do some stretches.

394
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:58,764
Here.

395
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,524
You will escort Miss Shen

396
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:06,294
out of the city through the road.

397
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:08,004
Once I capture Li Ji,

398
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,885
I'll take the waterway.

399
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:12,684
I'll rendezvous with you guys

400
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:15,365
at this point.

401
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:16,885
No.

402
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:18,684
My lord, you mustn't do so.

403
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:19,653
Right now,

404
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:20,893
we only have one box of gold left.

405
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:22,133
We don't even know

406
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,734
if we can gain
Zhao Chong's trust tomorrow.

407
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,853
And, you're entering the tiger's den.

408
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:27,524
You're attempting
to capture a person alive.

409
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:29,454
Moreover, that Zhao fellow

410
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:30,613
already found out

411
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:31,853
that the capital was investigating

412
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:32,853
the West Canal case.

413
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:34,893
I'm sure he has increased
the security around his residence.

414
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:35,333
My lord,

415
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,613
if your identity is revealed,

416
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:37,724
the consequences will be...

417
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:41,933
Please let me join you.

418
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,244
At least it'll be safer.

419
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:46,284
What you need to do now

420
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:48,893
is to protect Miss Shen

421
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:50,244
and the construction plan.

422
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,004
But my lord...

423
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:54,684
I've already made up my mind.

424
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:02,204
Send someone to Yongzhou Military Camp

425
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,605
and tell them to send reinforcements.

426
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:07,484
Understood.

427
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,533
(Wuzhou City Defense Plan)

428
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:33,244
Where's Madam Liu?

429
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:34,613
I fed her some sleeping drug

430
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,405
and locked her inside the woodshed.

431
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:40,165
This is the antidote to Xulingzi.

432
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:41,925
Official Lu retrieved it for you.

433
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,964
I need to thank Official Lu for this.

434
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,494
Thank you too...

435
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:46,964
My name is Shen Zhen.

436
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:49,925
Thank you.

437
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:53,653
You aren't

438
00:23:53,654 --> 00:23:55,524
an ordinary lady, right?

439
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,814
I felt that way

440
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,605
ever since our first encounter.

441
00:23:59,614 --> 00:24:02,365
After entering Lu Garden, I realized

442
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:03,893
that although you were arrogant,

443
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,565
you didn't go overboard.

444
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,254
Although you were haughty and arrogant,

445
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:09,405
you never intended to harm me.

446
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:10,925
Thank you,

447
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:11,974
Miss Shen.

448
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,933
No matter what surname we have,

449
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:16,085
our family is the most important to us.

450
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:19,653
I can understand why you're doing this.

451
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,373
However, no matter what it is,

452
00:24:21,374 --> 00:24:23,004
we should do things with propriety.

453
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:25,964
Miss Man,

454
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,004
I hope you can

455
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,964
live optimistically in the future.

456
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:33,254
I wish you and Official Lu

457
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:35,365
have a fruitful relationship too.

458
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:40,284
We're just partners
in the case investigation.

459
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,284
The road to the north of the desert

460
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,645
is far and dangerous.

461
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:14,925
Take care.

462
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,405
So,

463
00:25:17,614 --> 00:25:18,333
is there no cure

464
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,684
for my lord?

465
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:22,974
I'm indebted to our lord.

466
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:24,365
If there's a way to save him,

467
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:27,133
I'll definitely give it my all.

468
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,085
Thank you.

469
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,413
My lord, why didn't you tell her

470
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:33,964
that you were poisoned?

471
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,004
Since it's already too late,

472
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:40,684
there's no need to break her heart.

473
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,524
If so, what about her letter?

474
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:45,845
You can deal with it accordingly.

475
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:49,524
However,

476
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,925
you're not allowed to burn it.

477
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,684
Since you're already on your way
to the underworld,

478
00:25:56,094 --> 00:25:58,444
why did you

479
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:01,925
have to torture yourself like this?

480
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:18,484
Love is born out of a wretched tie.

481
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:22,484
However, why were they separated?

482
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:28,444
Why did I dream about
the same ending again?

483
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,966
(Divorce Letter)

484
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:02,653
Madam, the imperial palace
sent their men here.

485
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,085
Please go and take a look.

486
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,284
The imperial palace?

487
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,294
Are you the woman

488
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:12,853
the imperial palace granted to Di?

489
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:13,684
Yes, Old Madam.

490
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:16,204
I've reached the appropriate age.
I should leave the palace.

491
00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:17,693
Under the grace of Her Majesty,

492
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:20,244
I'm to become
the mistress of Official Li.

493
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,574
The imperial palace

494
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:24,645
does appreciate Di, huh?

495
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:27,099
That means my son has
a bright future ahead of him.

496
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,933
Official Li is one of the main pillars
of the court.

497
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:31,165
Old Madam, you're beyond blessed.

498
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,734
Good.

499
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,204
Lass, you're so eloquent.

500
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:38,805
You look pretty too.

501
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,444
You are to be his mistress, huh?

502
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:43,294
I'm pregnant now.

503
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,173
In the future,

504
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:46,044
you can serve me in my room.

505
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:48,605
I'm here to serve Official Li.

506
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,214
It's my honor

507
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:51,764
to be able to serve Old Madam.

508
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:53,964
I'm afraid I cannot serve anyone else.

509
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:55,893
Now, I'm pregnant with

510
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,294
the eldest son of the Li family.

511
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:01,125
In the future, I'll be the female head
of the Li family.

512
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,574
According to what I know,

513
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:04,724
Official Li already had a wife.

514
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:06,933
Mrs. Zhao, you're a mistress as well.

515
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:07,974
You mustn't overstep

516
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:09,925
your boundaries at all times.

517
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,133
That Shen is just...

518
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:13,645
Greetings, Master.

519
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:16,014
Li!

520
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:17,294
Do not be rude.

521
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,093
She was the rude one.

522
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:19,693
That's why I...

523
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:20,333
Was she wrong?

524
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,605
Enough already.

525
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:24,494
Ru is pregnant, you know?

526
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,133
-Mother-in-law!
-Why are you blaming her for it?

527
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:26,613
Li.

528
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:27,484
That's right.

529
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:29,925
Greetings, Madam.

530
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,764
You don't need to be this courteous.

531
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:35,173
Since you're already here,

532
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,014
you can stay in the eastern quarters.

533
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,964
Yes, Madam.

534
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:40,524
Move your belongings there.

535
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:41,764
Enough.

536
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:44,373
Lan, I'll bring you around.

537
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:45,405
- Let's go.
- Okay.

538
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:50,613
- Ru.
- But she...

539
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:51,814
Enough already.

540
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:52,534
But Mother-in-law...

541
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:53,333
Enough.

542
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,645
All right now.

543
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:03,964
Ran.

544
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:10,004
Ran.

545
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:10,964
Li.

546
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:14,645
You handled the situation well just now.

547
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:16,814
Lan did come
from the imperial palace after all.

548
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,534
On one hand, this is
His Majesty's grace.

549
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:19,613
On the other hand,

550
00:29:19,614 --> 00:29:21,499
she might know all sorts of people
in the palace

551
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,853
after living there for so many years.

552
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:24,885
I can't afford to offend her
no matter what.

553
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,399
Dear, you do live up to the name
as my wife.

554
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,085
You're so considerate toward me.

555
00:29:29,295 --> 00:29:31,254
Now, the imperial palace
appreciates you greatly.

556
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:33,133
They're even granting you
concubines and servants.

557
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:34,413
I'm sure you'll be successful

558
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:36,004
very soon.

559
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,004
I will wait for you to be successful.

560
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:39,774
Ran.

561
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:40,645
By the way,

562
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:49,605
this is the new product
of Baixiang Pavilion.

563
00:29:49,614 --> 00:29:51,004
It's hard to get.

564
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:52,805
Deliver it to Lan.

565
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:55,365
Okay.

566
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:03,964
Master, what are you doing here?

567
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:06,333
You just entered the Li Residence,
I came here to see

568
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:07,574
if you could get used to it.

569
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:09,774
And, I'm here to see
if you need anything else.

570
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,014
Master, thanks for the concern.

571
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:12,574
I'm doing great here.

572
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:13,734
My wife gave you

573
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:15,173
the new product of Baixiang Pavilion.

574
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:16,125
Keep it.

575
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:18,373
Thank you, Master.

576
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:19,734
Thank you, Madam.

577
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,004
Let's sit over there.

578
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:21,893
You may leave first.

579
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:22,645
Yes, Master.

580
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,266
(Gather 5,000 gold taels
as soon as possible)

581
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:43,044
If so, we'll leave first.

582
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:02,405
Are you ready?

583
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,405
However,

584
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:09,004
this is also my first time

585
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:10,565
dressing myself like this.

586
00:32:11,414 --> 00:32:12,405
You look great.

587
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,494
Zhao Chong has been in Wuzhou
for many years.

588
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:19,413
The streets are littered with
his informants.

589
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:20,484
Before this,

590
00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:22,764
many people already found out
who you were.

591
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:24,165
If you don't pay attention,

592
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:26,244
they might discover you.

593
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:27,645
I understand.

594
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:30,214
However, no matter
how they try to investigate the case,

595
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,684
they won't ask a bride
to step down from her carriage easily.

596
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:34,133
And, the guards can pretend to be

597
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:35,933
part of the wedding escort team

598
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:37,574
so that they can leave Wuzhou easily.

599
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:39,054
But you have to suffer grievances.

600
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:40,365
Although you aren't married yet,

601
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,365
you have to wear a wedding dress.

602
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:44,613
There's no husband there to receive me.

603
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:45,734
So, it doesn't count.

604
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:47,444
That's hard to say.

605
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:49,373
I'll go and receive you if I reach

606
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:50,605
the rendezvous point first.

607
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:00,565
Sorry about that.

608
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,645
I blurted that out without thinking.

609
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,734
It's fine even if you arrive

610
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,204
at a later time.

611
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,524
Official Lu, I'll wait for you.

612
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:15,684
Okay.

613
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:17,964
By the way,

614
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,845
I broke

615
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,893
the jade bangle
your mother left behind for you

616
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,165
last time.

617
00:33:23,174 --> 00:33:24,684
I haven't fixed it yet.

618
00:33:26,015 --> 00:33:27,845
Now, you can take

619
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:30,085
my jade pendant first.

620
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:32,173
You promised me

621
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:33,964
that you would fix it.

622
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,325
I'll wait for you.

623
00:33:46,495 --> 00:33:48,484
My lord, time's up.

624
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:51,244
All right. You can go and get ready.

625
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,885
It's getting late.

626
00:33:57,575 --> 00:33:58,933
People might start to suspect us

627
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:00,524
if we miss out on the auspicious hour.

628
00:34:05,094 --> 00:34:06,405
Lu Shiyan,

629
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:08,765
promise me

630
00:34:09,055 --> 00:34:11,124
that you'll return to the capital
with me.

631
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:16,805
All right.

632
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,365
I promise you

633
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:22,685
that I'll return to the capital
together with you.

634
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:25,484
I trust you.

635
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:31,213
You must be careful.

636
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:32,093
Stay alert.

637
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:32,773
Go and get ready.

638
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:33,644
Yes, sir.

639
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,245
Miss, are you reluctant
to part with the place?

640
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,974
You guys have been
staying here for some time.

641
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:00,733
Even I'm reluctant
to part with this place now.

642
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,534
Moreover, Miss,

643
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,685
you managed the courtyard yourself.

644
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:06,613
Miss, I'm afraid the courtyard

645
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:08,133
isn't the only thing you miss.

646
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:10,285
I suppose you miss the people
in the courtyard too.

647
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:14,414
Has Lu Shiyan departed?

648
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:16,173
He's getting ready to depart.

649
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:17,374
That Zhao fellow

650
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,124
sent his housekeeper here
to pick him up.

651
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:21,365
I'm afraid he won't be able
to see you off this time.

652
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:27,164
It's time for us to go.

653
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,333
(Joy)

654
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:40,173
I pray that everything
goes smoothly for you.

655
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:42,205
I'll stop here.

656
00:35:43,294 --> 00:35:44,414
Mrs. Zhuang,

657
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:46,524
thank you for all your help.

658
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:48,133
May we see each other again.

659
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:49,164
Take care.

660
00:36:03,055 --> 00:36:04,004
Let's depart!

661
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:24,966
(The Zhao Residence)

662
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,685
You're something else.

663
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:57,285
Mr. Wei, you're finally here.

664
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:01,285
What are you doing here again?

665
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,524
I'm furious whenever I see you.

666
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:08,205
All eight boxes of gold are here.

667
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:11,854
Come, let me show you something.

668
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:12,894
I'm sure you haven't seen

669
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,845
such a huge amount of gold in your life.

670
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:19,813
Mr. Zhao has been waiting for you.

671
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:21,454
Mr. Wei, please enter
the residence first.

672
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:23,604
I can transport them for you.

673
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,213
These are eight boxes of gold
we're talking about.

674
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:29,150
It's not something
that you can afford to compensate.

675
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:32,293
I think I'll stay here
and watch over them.

676
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:33,564
I can feel at ease this way.

677
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:35,084
All right, then.

678
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,124
Move them!

679
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:53,693
Be careful!

680
00:37:53,694 --> 00:37:55,199
It's gold! Come and take a look!

681
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,934
Look at all the gold!

682
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:57,534
My gold!

683
00:37:57,535 --> 00:37:58,974
I told you so many times

684
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:00,885
to be extra careful!

685
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,334
Zhao told you guys

686
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:05,454
to be extra careful with them!

687
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:07,014
Is this how you're doing things?

688
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:08,885
Mr. Wei, please pardon us.
They don't dare to touch it.

689
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:10,925
Stop it!

690
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:12,093
All of you, back off!

691
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:12,693
Be quiet!

692
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:13,685
Look at all the gold!

693
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,200
Do you guys have a death wish?

694
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,374
I'll see which of you dare to
touch the Zhao Residence's belongings!

695
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,653
The Zhao Residence?
That's the place we want to steal from!

696
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:21,613
Haven't you guys extorted enough
from the people

697
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:22,613
in the past few years?

698
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:24,133
- That's right!
- That's right!

699
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,494
We're barely making a living here.

700
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:26,494
But look at you guys.

701
00:38:26,495 --> 00:38:28,253
Look at all these boxes of gold.

702
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:29,733
I'm sure these are

703
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:30,894
dirty money!

704
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:31,845
Shut up!

705
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,644
Say another word,
and I'll beat you guys to death!

706
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:35,894
Rob them!

707
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:37,934
-Rob them!
-Mr. Wei, this is dangerous!

708
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:39,564
Hurry! Let's go!

709
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:42,084
My gold!

710
00:38:42,094 --> 00:38:43,964
My gold!

711
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:49,854
Look at all the gold!

712
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:51,054
My gold!

713
00:38:51,055 --> 00:38:52,133
Don't steal them!

714
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:53,484
My gold!

715
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:55,653
Why are you still standing there?

716
00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:57,173
Find someone to transport them inside!

717
00:38:57,174 --> 00:38:57,894
Find help!

718
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,285
- Don't just stand there!
- Hurry!

719
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:01,325
Hurry!

720
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:03,765
Hurry up!

721
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,245
Stop this immediately!

722
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:18,974
Keep guard outside.

723
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:19,854
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

724
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:22,253
Zhao, you should teach

725
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:22,854
your bodyguards

726
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:24,133
a lesson.

727
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:25,454
This actually happened

728
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:27,405
when they were transporting my gold.

729
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,604
Indeed.

730
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:30,093
I never expected

731
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:31,653
those vulgar townsfolk

732
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:33,894
to do such a thing in broad daylight.

733
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:35,524
But Wei, don't worry.

734
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:37,733
There's no place safer in Wuzhou

735
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:39,604
than the Zhao Residence.

736
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:41,805
Wait.

737
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:43,685
Zhao,

738
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,813
both my gold and I

739
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:48,405
are already here.

740
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:50,054
Where's the food supply I requested?

741
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,685
I'll give it to you
after I verify the gold.

742
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:55,574
The Wei family has been doing
business for generations.

743
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:56,894
I never forget about the family rules.

744
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,653
Zhao, I'm being very sincere

745
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,164
in our collaboration.

746
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:10,334
Wei, you're right.

747
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:12,285
Let's head to the granary.

748
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:14,173
What about my gold?

749
00:40:14,174 --> 00:40:15,213
You saw that just now.

750
00:40:15,214 --> 00:40:17,050
All those townsfolk out there
have their eyes on them.

751
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,084
Don't worry.

752
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:19,653
Someone.

753
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:21,534
Move the boxes to the painting room.

754
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:22,534
Yes, sir.

755
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:23,414
Don't worry.

756
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:25,604
The painting room is the safest place
there is.

757
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:36,285
Wei, please.

758
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:11,325
Who are you guys?

759
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,974
Wei, you can rest at ease now.

760
00:41:22,975 --> 00:41:24,773
I only make promises

761
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,213
when I can deliver them.

762
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:27,534
Zhao, you're amazing indeed.

763
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:28,494
I found the right person

764
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:30,325
for the job.

765
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:31,653
I heard that the Wei family

766
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:33,454
has their own water and land
trading routes.

767
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:34,894
You're making other people jealous of

768
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,693
your special trade.

769
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,133
Both of us have our own strengths.

770
00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:40,974
If we work together,

771
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:42,374
we can look forward

772
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,604
to making a windfall.

773
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:47,124
Let's have some tea.

774
00:41:47,335 --> 00:41:47,813
Please.

775
00:41:47,814 --> 00:41:48,725
Mr. Zhao!

776
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:51,093
The residence is on fire!

777
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,293
The residence is on fire?

778
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:52,964
That's right.

779
00:41:53,015 --> 00:41:54,205
I'll go and take a look.

780
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:56,765
Zhao,

781
00:41:57,134 --> 00:41:58,964
my gold is in the painting room.

782
00:41:59,094 --> 00:42:00,765
The fire won't reach there, right?

783
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:03,894
Why are you still standing there?

784
00:42:03,895 --> 00:42:04,934
Go and take a look!

785
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:06,374
Let's hurry!

786
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,405
Come on...

787
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:11,813
Zhao...

788
00:42:11,814 --> 00:42:13,004
Wei, calm down.

789
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:14,293
I'll go and check it out.

790
00:42:14,294 --> 00:42:15,293
But my gold...

791
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:16,124
Don't worry.

792
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:19,093
Since the gold is in my residence now,
that means I've received them.

793
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:20,374
You can rest here.

794
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,685
I'll be back in a second.

795
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:30,374
How's Li Ji?

796
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,574
I haven't gone there yet.

797
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:33,164
The fire hasn't reached
the painting room yet.

798
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:35,604
How dare they set my residence on fire?

799
00:42:35,895 --> 00:42:37,733
Tell the governor
to close the city gate.

800
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:38,444
Yes, sir.

801
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:07,084
Zhao,

802
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:09,004
sorry for the offense.

803
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,124
You're something else.

804
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:14,885
Take him away!

805
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,733
(Wuzhou)

806
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,765
It's so lively today.

807
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,765
Stop.

808
00:43:30,214 --> 00:43:31,484
This is a routine inspection.

809
00:43:35,855 --> 00:43:37,454
Where are you guys heading?

810
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:38,293
Our bride will be

811
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:39,725
marrying into the Yang family.

812
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:41,285
Do you mean the Yang family of Luo City?

813
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:42,524
That's right.

814
00:43:43,895 --> 00:43:45,494
It's a festive occasion.

815
00:43:45,495 --> 00:43:48,484
I don't think it's appropriate
to draw your weapon.

816
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:53,964
Yang Xing is a lucky old man.

817
00:43:57,015 --> 00:43:57,773
You may go.

818
00:43:57,774 --> 00:43:58,765
Thank you.

819
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:01,245
Let them pass.

820
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,733
This is an order from the governor!

821
00:44:18,734 --> 00:44:20,014
There's a criminal in the city!

822
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,733
The gate is to be closed immediately!

823
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:24,054
No one is allowed to exit the city!

824
00:44:24,055 --> 00:44:26,004
Stop right there!

825
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:26,845
Stop!

826
00:44:27,094 --> 00:44:28,004
Go back.

827
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:30,205
Did you hear that? Go back.

828
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:31,805
Everyone, follow me.

829
00:44:31,814 --> 00:44:33,133
Zhao Chong is beating us up!

830
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:34,484
We want to leave the city!

831
00:44:35,614 --> 00:44:38,644
Let us out!

832
00:44:38,814 --> 00:44:40,399
Miss Shen, if it doesn't work out,

833
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,050
we have no choice
but to force our way through.

834
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,133
Could it be that his identity
was exposed?

835
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,653
That person didn't state

836
00:44:45,654 --> 00:44:47,574
the fugitive's name and identity.

837
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:48,685
I don't think so.

838
00:44:48,694 --> 00:44:49,934
Think of a way to leave the city

839
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:51,014
without implicating him.

840
00:44:51,015 --> 00:44:52,054
All right. I understand.

841
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:54,004
Let us out!

842
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:59,054
Let us out!

843
00:44:59,055 --> 00:44:59,974
Go back!

844
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:00,693
What are you doing?

845
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:02,245
We want to leave the city!

846
00:45:02,694 --> 00:45:04,524
Let us out!

847
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:07,293
Sir, what are you doing?

848
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:08,054
I can't afford

849
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:09,374
to bear the consequences

850
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,854
if we miss out on the auspicious hour.

851
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:13,334
If Mr. Yang wants to blame someone,
you can go to the Governor Office.

852
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,444
Go back!

853
00:45:14,654 --> 00:45:15,414
Go back!

854
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:16,454
My marriage with Mr. Wang

855
00:45:16,455 --> 00:45:17,733
was arranged by the governor.

856
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:19,334
He was the one who set the date too.

857
00:45:19,335 --> 00:45:21,574
The Yang Residence is setting up
their banquet.

858
00:45:21,575 --> 00:45:22,374
If you insist on

859
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,084
embarrassing Mr. Yang,

860
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:25,093
do you think you can

861
00:45:25,094 --> 00:45:26,693
bear the consequences given

862
00:45:26,694 --> 00:45:28,813
their ties?

863
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:30,733
Zhao Chong is beating us up!

864
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:32,613
Zhao Chong is oppressing us!

865
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:33,813
We want to leave the city!

866
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,293
We will complain to His Majesty!

867
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:36,765
Let us out!

868
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,253
In my opinion,

869
00:45:38,254 --> 00:45:39,773
their sudden appearance

870
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:41,054
is something abnormal.

871
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:43,693
The criminal might be hiding among them.

872
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:46,613
Do you think
you can bear the consequences

873
00:45:46,614 --> 00:45:48,484
if you fail to arrest the criminal

874
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:50,245
and ruin the ties between

875
00:45:50,335 --> 00:45:51,964
Mr. Wang and the governor
at the same time?

876
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:53,374
This...

877
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,044
You see,

878
00:45:54,174 --> 00:45:56,054
our carriage is stuck in the middle.

879
00:45:56,055 --> 00:45:58,093
We can't leave or enter the city.

880
00:45:58,094 --> 00:45:59,213
Stop shouting.

881
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,805
And, you can't close

882
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:03,644
the city gate with us here.

883
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:06,124
Let them pass.

884
00:46:06,694 --> 00:46:07,253
Go now.

885
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:07,813
Thank you.

886
00:46:07,814 --> 00:46:08,813
Hurry.

887
00:46:08,814 --> 00:46:09,974
We need to close the gate.

888
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,653
We'll complain to His Majesty!

889
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:14,574
Zhao Chong is beating us up!

890
00:46:14,575 --> 00:46:15,133
Hurry!

891
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:16,653
We'll complain to His Majesty!

892
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:17,293
Close the gate!

893
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:20,334
Let us out!

894
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:22,644
We'll complain to His Majesty!
