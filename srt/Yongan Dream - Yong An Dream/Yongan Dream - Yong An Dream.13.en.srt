=Episode 13=

18
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:44,907
Miss Qingxi,

19
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:47,627
I have something to ask you.

20
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:49,556
Your Miss...

21
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:51,636
Miss said she would pretend

22
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,156
as if nothing had happened.

23
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:54,907
So you can feel relieved now.

24
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,707
What exactly happened?

25
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,987
Official Lu,

26
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:05,595
as an Imperial Inspector,

27
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:07,035
you dare not admit what you did.

28
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:08,676
Before, you seemed sincere

29
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:10,355
and helped Miss.

30
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:10,836
I thought

31
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:12,195
you were a righteous man.

32
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:14,507
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

33
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,956
It's really disgusting.

34
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:17,266
Disgusting!

35
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:18,666
Wait a minute.

36
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:20,426
What did you say?

37
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,946
I disgust you?

38
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,067
I dare you to say that again.

39
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,556
You kissed Miss.

40
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:26,676
But you refused to admit it.

41
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:27,475
Do you know

42
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,396
how serious this is

43
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:29,199
to a young lady?

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,595
You were injured
and fell into the water.

45
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:31,399
It was Miss

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,195
who risked everything to search
for you everywhere.

47
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,475
She even brewed medicine for you

48
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:36,075
where her hands
were covered in blisters.

49
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:36,876
Miss

50
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:38,475
has always lived a pampered life.

51
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,355
She never had to suffer this much.

52
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:42,635
Also, she was worried
about you getting a fever.

53
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:44,396
She wipes your body day and night.

54
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,116
If these things were
to be known by others,

55
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:47,475
how could she ever marry?

56
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,396
Since you don't want
to take responsibility,

57
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:51,236
why did you flirt with her?

58
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,035
Do you know

59
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:54,236
how sad and upset she is?

60
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:57,067
She doesn't even dare to cry

61
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,747
because she's afraid your heart aches.

62
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:00,996
She painted for you

63
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,156
but doesn't dare to show you.

64
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:03,836
She has endured all this.

65
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:05,795
And now you come to me

66
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:07,426
and ask what's going on.

67
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,355
You should know

68
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,386
what had happened.

69
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:21,826
What?

70
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:23,556
You kissed Miss Shen.

71
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,946
I didn't tell you
so you can criticize me.

72
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,106
Master,

73
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:31,907
do you like Mistress Shen?

74
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,035
It does seem like

75
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:39,187
there is a bit.

76
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,507
I care deeply and pay close attention

77
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:44,475
to every move she makes.

78
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,467
Sometimes,

79
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,355
I would even think about her.

80
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,507
Master,

81
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:54,227
does this seem like
a bit of a feelings to you?

82
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,475
It means both of you

83
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,436
like each other.

84
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,676
I suggest you

85
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,075
be kinder and gentler

86
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,236
to Miss Shen.

87
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:03,915
In any case, it has to be better.

88
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,195
In the future,

89
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,067
don't hurt her heart again.

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,035
(Since you don't want
to take responsibility,)

91
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:10,996
(why did you flirt with her?)

92
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:11,716
(Do you know)

93
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,195
(how sad and upset she is?)

94
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:15,307
I understand.

95
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,467
I must take responsibility.

96
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:19,426
Stop the carriage.

97
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:23,249
Everyone, stay here and rest.

98
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,476
Be on guard around the perimeter.

99
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,506
What's the matter?

100
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,347
Get down first.

101
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,506
No.

102
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,436
Qingxi,

103
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,599
why are you so dense?

104
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,996
Master has something important to do.

105
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,195
What is it?

106
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:36,827
Just stay out of it.

107
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:39,596
Let's go.

108
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,707
Come on.

109
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:42,066
Official Lu,

110
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:43,707
did anything happen?

111
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,066
Miss Shen.

112
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,116
After we reach the capital,

113
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,506
I will marry you.

114
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,106
You don't have a fever.

115
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:58,186
I'm serious.

116
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,106
Why are you suddenly acting this way?

117
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:04,387
Because I kissed you.

118
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,635
You...

119
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:09,546
I thought you forgot about it.

120
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:10,746
In any case,

121
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,306
I'll take the responsibility.

122
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:13,907
So

123
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:15,827
are you only marrying me

124
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:17,999
because you kissed me

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,476
and want to take responsibility for it?

126
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:20,996
This matter concerns your reputation.

127
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:23,907
As a man, it's only right
to take the responsibility.

128
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:25,106
No need.

129
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:26,116
I'll pretend

130
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:26,796
I was kissed

131
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:27,986
by Blacky.

132
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:29,506
Blacky?

133
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,195
That dog?

134
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:31,907
Yes.

135
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,227
Then

136
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:44,546
would you draw

137
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:47,147
a portrait of Blacky?

138
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:48,866
I'll do it when I get back.

139
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,306
It's mine.

140
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:05,787
- Master!
- Miss!

141
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:06,476
Don't go.

142
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:07,506
Wait here.

143
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,556
Master, slowly.

144
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,506
Are you hurt?

145
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:17,436
Hurry.

146
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:18,515
Protect Zhao Chong and Li Ji.

147
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:19,426
Yes, Master.

148
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:12,506
Official Yang, now what?

149
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:13,916
See if anyone survives.

150
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,787
Yes, sir.

151
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,106
Are you hurt?

152
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,236
Miss!

153
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,066
Are you all right? Come.

154
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:19,755
I'm fine.

155
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:20,676
For heaven's sake,

156
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:22,275
do you know
how dangerous it was just now?

157
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,426
-You almost got yourself...
-I didn't think much about it.

158
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,876
Miss, are you all right?

159
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,147
Qingxi.

160
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:37,787
Qingxi,

161
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,755
help Miss Shen to my carriage to rest.

162
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:40,347
All right.

163
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:42,666
You...

164
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,666
Don't worry.

165
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:46,506
It's all right now.

166
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:49,986
Let's go.

167
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:02,876
Come over here now.

168
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:03,476
Mr. Zhao,

169
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:05,267
they're here to kill us.

170
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:08,947
Watch Li Ji.

171
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:09,746
Yes, sir.

172
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:11,866
You'll come with me.

173
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,426
Mr. Zhao.

174
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,155
You had to make me work

175
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:22,746
so hard.

176
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,986
So many died

177
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,476
only to come to take your life.

178
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:28,955
But they failed.

179
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:30,715
From the moment

180
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:31,907
I got myself into this,

181
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:33,675
I had expected

182
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,476
this day to come.

183
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:36,547
Well,

184
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,307
you sure have a well-thought-out plan.

185
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:40,555
Do you still want to protect

186
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:41,996
the person behind you?

187
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:43,386
Do you think

188
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,827
they can still save you?

189
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:48,555
If the person behind me

190
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:50,956
is someone you can afford to offend,

191
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:52,947
I might as well tell you.

192
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,587
If you dare to touch me,

193
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:58,275
even your mother, the Eldest Princess,

194
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,667
may not be able to protect you.

195
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:02,707
How dare you!

196
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,106
Had it never occurred to you

197
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,755
why it was me,

198
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,836
Duke Zhenguo's heir
who is investigating this case?

199
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:14,956
Why did I change my identity

200
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,236
and spare no effort
to get to the bottom of it?

201
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:17,795
And why can I

202
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:18,956
even mobilize General Meng

203
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,026
for support?

204
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:26,067
Your backers may be powerful.

205
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:28,635
But they can never surpass mine

206
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:31,187
with just a casual remark.

207
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,986
If I tell you,

208
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,675
death will be the end for me.

209
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,476
Do you think you can live
if you keep quiet?

210
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,836
Don't forget.

211
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,866
Li Ji is in my hands.

212
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,386
Li Ji?

213
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,716
Do you think he knows anything?

214
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:48,635
He's nothing but a burden.

215
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:50,035
You can kill him if you want.

216
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:52,035
Do you think I'll kill him?

217
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,915
All of your dealing transactions

218
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,755
are in his head.

219
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,626
We can let anyone lose their life,

220
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,067
but not his.

221
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,786
So you can rest assured.

222
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:06,467
If you have the ability,
go investigate it yourself.

223
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:08,356
Don't expect to get

224
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,386
any information from me.

225
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:19,947
Then I'll wait.

226
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,596
Master,

227
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,035
were you rejected?

228
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,626
No, I wasn't.

229
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:34,755
Didn't you get into the carriage

230
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,067
and talk to Miss Shen?

231
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:38,755
The assassins attacked

232
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,667
before I managed to finish my words.

233
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:42,827
Why aren't you doing it now?

234
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:46,275
Do you think

235
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:47,786
this is the right time?

236
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:50,316
She didn't say a word since we got here.

237
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,675
She didn't even warm herself up

238
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,587
and kept making herself busy.

239
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:54,435
Master,

240
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,106
I didn't want to judge you.

241
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:57,596
But Miss Shen

242
00:10:57,597 --> 00:10:58,675
risked her life

243
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:00,146
blocking that attack for you.

244
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:00,996
Look at you.

245
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,316
You're great in solving cases.

246
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,196
Why are you so clueless

247
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:04,626
when it comes to your matters?

248
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:09,587
She compared me to Blacky.

249
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,106
What Blacky?

250
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:16,467
Her pet dog.

251
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:20,187
A pet dog

252
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,106
is considered family too.

253
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,467
Miss,

254
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:33,515
what's wrong?

255
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:34,675
What did Official Lu

256
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,067
tell you?

257
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:42,435
He wants to marry me?

258
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:43,427
Really?

259
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:45,467
Sit down.

260
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,196
But he wanted to marry me

261
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:49,587
because he kissed me.

262
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,316
How is that wrong?

263
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:52,755
Of course, it's wrong.

264
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:54,906
Is he marrying me only because of that?

265
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:02,386
Miss,

266
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,035
I'll go get you some water.

267
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:05,227
Water?

268
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,356
Go and help Miss Shen make fire.

269
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:10,227
All right.

270
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,555
Do you know

271
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,347
how your Master expresses his feelings?

272
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:21,915
He said

273
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,675
he wanted to marry Miss.

274
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,035
But it was only

275
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,307
because he kissed her.

276
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:30,876
What about love?

277
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:32,986
Do you even have a clue?

278
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,739
Many people want to
marry Miss until the threshold

279
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,836
of Shen Residence is worn out.

280
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:38,467
Your Master isn't the only one around.

281
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:40,755
I understand what you're saying,
Miss Qingxi.

282
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,035
Sometimes,

283
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:45,587
our Master is a little dull in response.

284
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:46,716
But it doesn't change the fact

285
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:47,476
that his feelings

286
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,236
for Miss Shen are genuine.

287
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,116
That's undeniable.

288
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:52,316
Are you saying

289
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:53,956
her feelings aren't genuine?

290
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,755
She even tried to save him
from being stabbed.

291
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:56,795
I get that.

292
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:57,596
Look.

293
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:58,555
They rely on each other

294
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:00,467
for everything.

295
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:02,356
It would be a pity

296
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:04,227
if they missed this opportunity.

297
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:08,956
So shouldn't both of us

298
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:11,187
do something about it?

299
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:20,986
Be gentle.

300
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,116
What is this, Master?

301
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,395
Your wound

302
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:25,915
is stuck to the gauze.

303
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,587
If I don't use some force,

304
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:29,626
I won't be able to do it.

305
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:32,836
Master, it's strange.

306
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:34,386
Why are your wounds

307
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,467
not recovering?

308
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:40,956
If you keep doing it like that,

309
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:42,635
even a healed wound will reopen.

310
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:44,236
Then you do it.

311
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:46,035
Of course, I can't do it.

312
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:47,227
Qingxi.

313
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:54,275
You're right about that.

314
00:13:54,276 --> 00:13:55,035
Master suffers

315
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:56,395
such a serious injury this time.

316
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:57,356
Thanks to Miss Shen's

317
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,746
timely rescue in a critical moment.

318
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,866
Master, change your clothes.

319
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,146
Go.

320
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:33,746
Thank you, Miss Shen.

321
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,155
No need to thank me.

322
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,106
I'd do the same if it was someone else.

323
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:38,635
That's not necessarily true.

324
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:39,996
Take me for instance,

325
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:41,836
unless it's my beloved,

326
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,076
I wouldn't sacrifice myself

327
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,675
to save him.

328
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,395
So according to Miss Qingxi,

329
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,555
Miss Shen's sweetheart

330
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,275
is our Master?

331
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:50,067
I...

332
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,866
I didn't mean that at all.

333
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:57,866
I'm going to fetch some firewood.

334
00:14:58,117 --> 00:14:58,795
Miss,

335
00:14:58,796 --> 00:14:59,716
let Yang Zong

336
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:01,116
and me do this kind of chores.

337
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:01,876
We'll go first.

338
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:02,755
You should rest.

339
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:03,435
Yes, that's right.

340
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,307
Both of us will go.

341
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,386
Actually,

342
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:32,386
I've made myself clear enough.

343
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:34,266
Firstly,

344
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,866
I'm not a promiscuous person.

345
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,746
It's just that when I was unconscious,

346
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:41,146
it was like something confused my mind.

347
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,347
So, I sincerely apologize to you

348
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,866
for this matter.

349
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:47,347
Secondly,

350
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:49,316
you don't need to avoid me

351
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,906
because of this.

352
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:53,316
It was just an unintentional mistake.

353
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,106
Unintentional mistake?

354
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:02,035
Wait, how could he...

355
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:02,555
Yes,

356
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:04,116
it might be unintentional.

357
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:04,555
But...

358
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:05,395
Stop talking.

359
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,876
Never mention this matter again.

360
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:08,316
You're unintentional, I'm indifferent.

361
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,950
You don't need to worry
about it in the future.

362
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:10,476
I also

363
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:11,196
don't really care.

364
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:11,986
Move aside.

365
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:13,026
I want to sleep.

366
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:16,555
Miss Shen.

367
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:18,626
Official Lu, please watch your conduct.

368
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,386
Just go.

369
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,316
(The Li Residence)

370
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:40,986
Since that temple is so efficacious,

371
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,635
you should come along

372
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:44,635
with me.

373
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,956
I wanted to go too.

374
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:47,596
But the ministry needs me.

375
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:48,635
You can go first.

376
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:50,106
Don't get delayed.

377
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:58,275
Take care of Madam.

378
00:16:58,276 --> 00:16:59,146
Yes, Master.

379
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:04,867
I'll get going, then.

380
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,306
Why is it so shaky?

381
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:35,026
I'm talking to you.

382
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,235
Stop the carriage now.

383
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:42,627
I can't endure this anymore.

384
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:43,556
I dare not disobey

385
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:44,596
Master's order.

386
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,955
What did Master order you to do?

387
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:47,707
He ordered me to kill you!

388
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:49,076
Stop the carriage now!

389
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:50,346
Help!

390
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:52,907
Stop it now!

391
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,427
Help! Please help!

392
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:15,026
She should be dead after that fall.

393
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:26,066
Don't be scared.

394
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:53,266
Madam.

395
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:54,506
It's all right.

396
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:57,026
This is the Imperial Censorate.

397
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:58,356
You and your child

398
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,786
will be safe.

399
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:05,506
Was it... Was it really Li Di?

400
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:07,346
Was it really him?

401
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,627
Didn't the driver admit

402
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,546
that Li Di ordered him to do it?

403
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,066
Impossible.

404
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:15,947
I don't believe it.

405
00:19:16,077 --> 00:19:16,955
How can it be him?

406
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,667
You witnessed

407
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:20,627
and heard it yourself just now.

408
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,826
The affection you value

409
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:24,675
and the child you cherish,

410
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,707
compared to wealth and fame,

411
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:29,586
I think you have seen it very clearly

412
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,147
which is more important in Li Di's heart.

413
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:33,467
Impossible.

414
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:35,907
How could he end up like this?

415
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,516
This is his flesh and blood.

416
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,427
How could he possibly
be so ruthless to us mother and son?

417
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:43,187
Impossible.

418
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:44,786
I want to go see him.

419
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,995
I want to ask him myself!

420
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:47,600
Because the Imperial Censorate
has evidence

421
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,900
accusing him of committing bigamy.

422
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:51,586
The Imperial Censorate...

423
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:53,316
That's why he and Lan intended

424
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,667
to kill you to silence you.

425
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:59,427
Lan is also involved in this?

426
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,506
It's not too late for you
to know his true colors.

427
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:05,346
The Imperial Censorate has found out

428
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,667
that the money
you've been helping Li Di save

429
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,947
was obtained through corrupt means.

430
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,266
These things are all in your name.

431
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,346
Once things are exposed,

432
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,227
you will be the scapegoat.

433
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:22,187
Madam,

434
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:23,826
please save me.

435
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,147
Save my child.

436
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,786
I had wronged you before this.

437
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,675
I'm truly sorry.

438
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:34,026
Get up quickly.

439
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:37,187
Slowly.

440
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:40,907
Don't be afraid.

441
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,516
With the Imperial Censorate here,

442
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,026
they dare not do anything.

443
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:47,907
Tell me

444
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:50,306
everything you know.

445
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,395
I don't know anything.

446
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,116
He just handed things to me

447
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,635
and asked me to deposit them
at the money house.

448
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,826
He didn't tell me anything else.

449
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:02,107
Think carefully

450
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,066
about everything he said

451
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:06,266
that has nothing to do with your life.

452
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:10,116
Once he drank too much

453
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:11,026
and said,

454
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,387
these scums

455
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,715
made him do everything

456
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:15,266
and carry all the blame

457
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,235
and even sent a lady

458
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:17,876
from Mingyue Bordello to him.

459
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,546
When was this?

460
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:20,915
It was

461
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,907
when Lan had just arrived.

462
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:27,586
But isn't Lan a palace maid?

463
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,746
So the lady he mentioned is her?

464
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,026
Lan?

465
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:34,707
Madam,

466
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,707
I've lost everything now.

467
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,506
Can you help me

468
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,907
and my child?

469
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,506
The Imperial Censorate will protect you.

470
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:48,627
You should go and get some rest first.

471
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:53,066
Go on.

472
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,076
Mingyue Bordello belongs to Xu Wei.

473
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:04,195
But isn't Xu Wei dead?

474
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:05,276
Could there be someone else

475
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:06,546
controlling Lan?

476
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:08,276
But Lan clearly came

477
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,746
from the palace.

478
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:11,796
Whether she's really from the palace,

479
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,346
it's not difficult to find out.

480
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:20,826
We're finally back.

481
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:22,995
Since the incident at Jin Money House,

482
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:24,076
I don't know

483
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:25,195
how long it's been

484
00:22:25,196 --> 00:22:27,346
since I walked so freely on the streets.

485
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,276
Then

486
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:32,306
let's walk freely and casually today.

487
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:34,356
Qingxi.

488
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:35,546
Yes, Miss?

489
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:37,195
Miss,

490
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:39,036
my head is still spinning.

491
00:22:39,037 --> 00:22:40,356
I can't go with you.

492
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:41,986
Why don't both of you go ahead?

493
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:44,746
It's all right. I'll keep you company.

494
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,715
What about Yang Zong?

495
00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:49,227
Yang Zong has already taken the criminals
back to the Magistrate Office.

496
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:56,915
Mister, drive slower.

497
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,995
I feel dizzy.

498
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:58,907
All right.

499
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:01,107
Miss, take a look at the scented sachets.

500
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:03,235
Come and take a look.

501
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:04,195
These are handmade.

502
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:05,467
Miss, take a look.

503
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:07,549
Buy one if you like it.

504
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,356
It's fun to play with.

505
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:09,076
How much is it?

506
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:10,187
Two wen.

507
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:12,506
We'll take it.

508
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:14,836
Do you like it, Miss?

509
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:16,266
It really suits you.

510
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:18,435
Come and take a look
at our high-quality flower vase.

511
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:20,107
These are all high-quality.

512
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:22,356
Candied hawthorns for sale!

513
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:23,707
Do you need anything?

514
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:24,756
I'll take them all.

515
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:26,100
All right. I'll wrap them up for you.

516
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:26,826
How about one?

517
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:32,796
It's good.

518
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:34,116
It tastes of childhood.

519
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:35,346
Please come again if you like it.

520
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:36,995
Why did you buy

521
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:38,116
so many things?

522
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,675
You seem reluctant to let go of them.

523
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:41,066
So I bought them all.

524
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:44,066
How about

525
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:45,707
you try one too?

526
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:51,915
Sweet.

527
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,427
It tastes of childhood.

528
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,516
Official Lu,

529
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,746
thank you for taking care of me
during this time.

530
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,435
Now that we're back in the capital,

531
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:02,955
I'll return to Baixiang Pavilion first.

532
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:03,947
Shen Zhen,

533
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,876
your sister is still waiting
for you at Cheng Garden.

534
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,147
My sister?

535
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:20,546
They've already entered the city.

536
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:22,586
They should be here soon.

537
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:24,667
Don't worry too much.

538
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,836
You said the same thing

539
00:24:25,837 --> 00:24:27,076
an hour ago.

540
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:29,107
But they're still not here.

541
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:34,947
I'm sorry.

542
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:37,266
I was too impatient.

543
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:39,427
No matter.

544
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:46,867
It's Ran.

545
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,586
Ran!

546
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:50,707
Zhen!

547
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,475
Hold these.

548
00:24:52,476 --> 00:24:53,746
Ran!

549
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:54,635
Zhen.

550
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:55,506
Ran.

551
00:24:56,837 --> 00:24:58,867
Ran, how have you been well lately?

552
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,227
Of course, I'm not well.

553
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:02,915
You've started lying to me.

554
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,116
You didn't tell me that you went

555
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:05,387
to do something so dangerous.

556
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:06,836
Ran,

557
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:09,187
I lied because I didn't want
to worry you.

558
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:10,876
Look at me now.

559
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,306
I'm perfectly fine.

560
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,116
Official Lu,

561
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,955
I'm sure my sister has caused you
a lot of trouble during this time.

562
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,435
If she has offended you in any way,

563
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,036
as her elder sister,

564
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:26,796
I apologize on her behalf.

565
00:25:26,797 --> 00:25:28,195
Ran,

566
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:28,995
why do you assume

567
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,026
that I've caused trouble for him?

568
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,427
Mrs. Li, rest assured.

569
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:33,915
Miss Shen not only helped a lot

570
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,986
during this trip to Wuzhou.

571
00:25:36,196 --> 00:25:37,627
She also saved my life.

572
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,026
You saved him?

573
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,715
When we were taking
Zhao Chong back here,

574
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:41,986
I was seriously injured.

575
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,266
Thanks to Miss Shen, she found me

576
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:46,155
and took care of me day and night.

577
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:47,427
Otherwise,

578
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,707
I wouldn't be able
to return to the capital.

579
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:51,915
It's also risky for Official Lu

580
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,867
to save Father.

581
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:55,627
It was my duty.

582
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,116
It seems that Official Lu and Miss Shen

583
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:03,395
have indeed experienced a lot
along the way.

584
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,596
From obtaining the construction plans
to capturing Zhao Chong,

585
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,155
the two of you seem to

586
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:09,147
have a natural understanding
and work well together.

587
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:10,467
- Not at all.
- No, we don't.

588
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:17,467
We were just solving the case.

589
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:23,187
Well, it is indeed because of the case.

590
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:24,995
Enough said. It's getting late.

591
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:25,756
Let's go inside

592
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:26,276
and discuss

593
00:26:26,277 --> 00:26:27,516
our findings in Wuzhou

594
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:28,986
and the information from Official Zhou.

595
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:30,147
All right.

596
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:32,306
So this is the secret ledge

597
00:26:32,877 --> 00:26:35,187
Li Di recorded himself?

598
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:39,556
I had someone verify

599
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:40,955
Minister Shen's construction plans.

600
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:42,066
The design is reasonable

601
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,667
and won't cause the collapse
of the West Canal.

602
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:47,266
With this secret ledger,

603
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:49,836
I'm confident I can make Li Ji confess.

604
00:26:49,837 --> 00:26:51,586
Did Zhao Chong not say anything?

605
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:53,995
Despite various threats,

606
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:55,986
we couldn't get any clues from him.

607
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:57,867
With his level of stubbornness,

608
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,516
if we present the evidence now,

609
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:03,066
all our previous efforts
will be in vain if he says

610
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:05,467
Minister Shen instructed him to do it.

611
00:27:05,636 --> 00:27:07,387
If we can't get Zhao Chong to talk,

612
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:09,746
then we only have...

613
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:11,867
Li Di.

614
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:21,346
Li Di is greedy.

615
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:23,546
But cowardly.

616
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:25,076
As long we pressure him,

617
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,947
he'll surely panic.

618
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:30,076
Since Li Di was ordered
to repair the canal,

619
00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:32,195
Zhao Chong has continued
to cut down willow trees.

620
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:34,596
Although the situation
is very challenging,

621
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:36,155
the other party has not given up

622
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,986
on this opportunity to make money.

623
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,306
If the Emperor pressures him,

624
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:42,276
Li Di can't handle it on both sides,

625
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,187
he will definitely
be driven to a corner.

626
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:47,195
That's where

627
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:49,586
you will play your role in this.

628
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,915
Thank you

629
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,276
for paving this path

630
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:55,826
for Li Di early on.

631
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,187
Ran, how about you?

632
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:02,276
Don't worry,

633
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:04,026
I know what to do.

634
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,556
It's you I'm worried about.

635
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:06,756
I'll clean up the courtyard

636
00:28:06,757 --> 00:28:07,796
at Baixiang Pavilion.

637
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:08,955
You can stay there.

638
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:09,907
No, she can't.

639
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:20,546
The mastermind is still unknown.

640
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:23,995
But if Li Di becomes desperate,

641
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,306
which will happen soon.

642
00:28:25,597 --> 00:28:26,796
If Miss Shen stays alone

643
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:27,995
at Baixiang Pavilion,

644
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,947
she might be in danger,

645
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:31,986
and our hands will be tied.

646
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,346
What Official Zhou said makes sense.

647
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:35,756
Let Miss Shen stay

648
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,227
at Cheng Garden for now.

649
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:38,715
After all,

650
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,876
no one dares to break into

651
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:41,667
the Duke Zhenguo Residence's courtyard.

652
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,467
Then I'll leave her to you, Official Lu.

653
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,026
Zhen,

654
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,306
you can continue to stay here.

655
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:55,796
If you need anything,

656
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:58,346
let Qingxi go to Baixiang Pavilion
to send me a message.

657
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,187
So is this the room you stay?

658
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:16,427
Yes.

659
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:23,266
Zhen,

660
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:26,076
did something happen
between you and Official Lu

661
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:26,995
during the journey?

662
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:27,995
Nothing happened.

663
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:30,147
We just worked on a case together.

664
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:32,147
What case were you helping him with?

665
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:33,227
I...

666
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:36,346
I pretended to be his concubine.

667
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,467
Just pretend?

668
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:46,667
Of course.

669
00:29:48,797 --> 00:29:50,155
But why do I feel like

670
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,276
he looks at you

671
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:52,986
with affection in his eyes?

672
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:55,786
Maybe it's because we faced
many dangers together

673
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:58,596
while working on the case.

674
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,915
Such affection can be considered

675
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:03,346
as a bond between colleagues.

676
00:30:04,716 --> 00:30:05,667
Zhen.

677
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:08,627
Although our family
has currently fallen from grace,

678
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,076
no matter how difficult it gets,

679
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:11,826
we must not lose our integrity.

680
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:14,586
There are things we can and cannot do.

681
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:16,506
You must be clear about this.

682
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,467
I know.

683
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:20,627
Zhen.

684
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:23,627
Sit down.

685
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:29,147
Although we lost Mother at a young age,

686
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:30,395
Father has never neglected

687
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,826
in his teachings

688
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:32,876
and has never used

689
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:35,227
the traditional norms for women
to restrain us.

690
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:37,387
He hopes that we understand

691
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:39,387
that no matter
how deep our feelings are,

692
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:40,867
we can rely on them

693
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:42,546
but never depend on them completely.

694
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,276
Ran,

695
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,475
there's really nothing going on

696
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,876
between Official Lu and me.

697
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:49,116
I really can't wait to move out of
Cheng Garden now.

698
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:51,346
I don't want to see his...

699
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:56,227
Grumpy face.

700
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:09,026
Shouldn't you invite me for a drink?

701
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:10,635
As a dignified Imperial Inspector,

702
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:13,026
yet, you can't express
your thoughts clearly.

703
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:17,147
Well, you're the dignified
Vice Censor-in-chief with desires

704
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:19,026
but dares not act.

705
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:20,707
In the future,

706
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,746
there will be a time I'll help you.

707
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,506
- Let's help each other.
- Let's help each other.

708
00:31:29,877 --> 00:31:30,826
Zhen,

709
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:33,907
keep these words in mind.

710
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:35,707
Like your brother-in-law,

711
00:31:36,357 --> 00:31:37,836
I believe he once had feelings for me,

712
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:38,826
which were genuine.

713
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:41,546
But he couldn't withstand the test.

714
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,667
At any time,

715
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,427
only you, yourself
are the most reliable.

716
00:31:46,597 --> 00:31:48,107
I understand.

717
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,467
But

718
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:52,667
I'm really worried about you staying

719
00:31:52,837 --> 00:31:55,107
in the Li Residence.

720
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:57,826
Don't worry.

721
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,707
It will be over soon.

722
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:03,995
Miss Shen, don't worry too much.

723
00:32:03,996 --> 00:32:05,986
I will keep an eye on the Li Residence.

724
00:32:06,877 --> 00:32:08,395
Then I'll be counting on you

725
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:10,026
to watch over my sister.

726
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:15,667
Then we'll take our leave.

727
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,667
I'll get going then.

728
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,107
See you, Ran.

729
00:32:40,037 --> 00:32:41,627
What did you say about me?

730
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:43,306
Grumpy face.

731
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:44,147
Me?

732
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:46,907
Do I have a grumpy face?

733
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:50,506
Don't worry.

734
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:53,306
Official Lu has always been upright

735
00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:55,107
and will not overstep his bounds.

736
00:32:57,396 --> 00:32:59,266
He may not overstep in his actions.

737
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:01,346
But what about his feelings?

738
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,066
Feelings?

739
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:07,546
Feelings come from the heart.

740
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,147
If it is truly what his heart desires,

741
00:33:10,716 --> 00:33:12,627
then there is nothing to worry about.

742
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,627
Official Lu's mother
is the Eldest Princess.

743
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,746
The marriages of these people

744
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:22,187
are not based on feelings

745
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:23,155
but

746
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:24,826
on various interests.

747
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:26,786
There are always exceptions.

748
00:33:27,517 --> 00:33:28,995
Once Official Lu

749
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:30,467
decides on something,

750
00:33:31,037 --> 00:33:33,387
he will protect it at all costs.

751
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,147
I only want Zhen to be able
to live peacefully

752
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:37,475
without the need

753
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:39,066
to do anything at any cost.

754
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,050
(Magistrate Office)

755
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:12,756
Help!

756
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:14,035
Help! Someone is trying to kill me!

757
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:14,555
Help!

758
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:16,716
Guards! Guards!
Someone is trying to kill me!

759
00:34:16,717 --> 00:34:17,906
Who's there? Capture him!

760
00:34:20,197 --> 00:34:21,876
Help!

761
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:22,836
Help!

762
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:24,796
Guards! Someone is trying to kill me!

763
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:26,075
Someone is trying to kill us!

764
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:27,995
Help! Help me. I don't want to die.

765
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:28,435
Someone,

766
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:30,547
take Zhao Chong's body away.

767
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:34,756
Official Yang! Official Yang, please.

768
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:36,156
An assassin tried to kill us just now.

769
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,475
You need to increase more guards.

770
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,115
They will come again.

771
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,227
Who should we protect?

772
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:41,356
Zhao Chong is already dead.

773
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:42,600
Who are we supposed to protect now?

774
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:43,196
You?

775
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:43,595
Let's go.

776
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:45,955
I... I'll confess. I'll talk.
I'll tell you everything.

777
00:34:45,956 --> 00:34:47,150
Take me to the Imperial Inspector.

778
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,716
I know all of Zhao Chong's accounts.

779
00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:50,306
I know a lot.

780
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:51,466
Take him away.

781
00:34:51,476 --> 00:34:52,227
Yes, sir.

782
00:34:53,197 --> 00:34:54,115
I'll tell you everything.

783
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:55,147
Guards.

784
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:56,475
Bring Li Ji in for questioning.

785
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:58,746
I'll confess everything.

786
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:00,866
Official Yang.

787
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:02,027
Well done.

788
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:10,716
Guards,

789
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:12,826
take Zhao Chong's body away.

790
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:14,836
Take him away.

791
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:15,866
Keep him under strict guard.

792
00:35:15,877 --> 00:35:16,746
Yes, sir.

793
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:18,107
Take him away.

794
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,595
Li Ji

795
00:35:24,596 --> 00:35:26,075
sure lives up to his reputation.

796
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:27,395
He recited

797
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:28,395
all the transactions

798
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:29,426
of the ledger effortlessly.

799
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,027
Shipments on the first day
of the third month,

800
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:36,356
purchases on the tenth
of the same month.

801
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:37,356
Zhao Chong's secret ledger

802
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:38,906
and Li Di's secret ledger

803
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:40,395
match perfectly

804
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:42,500
in terms of the quantity and timing

805
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,796
of the wood.

806
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:44,955
But the most crucial thing

807
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:46,035
is the embezzled money.

808
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:47,595
Zhao Chong hardly kept any for himself.

809
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:48,987
He transferred it all out.

810
00:35:49,476 --> 00:35:50,636
So it's possible

811
00:35:50,637 --> 00:35:52,676
that they were not conspiring for money.

812
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:55,786
But they had other plans
with this money.

813
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:03,946
The embezzled money direction was toward

814
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:10,306
Jizhou, Wuzhou, and the capital,

815
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:13,547
with the biggest transaction
toward the capital.

816
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:24,346
Who is

817
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,627
behind Xu Wei and Li Di?

818
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:31,866
And what are they plotting?

819
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,115
During the trip to Wuzhou,

820
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:40,027
I obtained the West Canal's
construction plans from Lu Si.

821
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:40,800
It's verified that

822
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:42,515
the previously found construction plans

823
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:44,107
had been tampered with.

824
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:46,035
I also arrested
the wealthy merchant Zhao Chong

825
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,475
and his accountant, Li Ji in Wuzhou.

826
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:48,236
It's enough to prove

827
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:49,515
that Zhao Chong and Li Di conspired

828
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:51,435
to embezzle public funds.

829
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:52,876
After the collapse of the West Canal,

830
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,435
they used the excuse of
flawed construction plans to frame Shen Wenqi

831
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,555
to cover up their misconduct.

832
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:58,515
Just

833
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,236
Zhao Chong and Li Di

834
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:01,156
might not be able

835
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:02,515
to execute such a big thing.

836
00:37:02,516 --> 00:37:03,987
Your Majesty is wise.

837
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:06,346
But I found no clue

838
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:08,426
about the person behind this for now.

839
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:09,955
So,

840
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:11,507
what do you need me to do?

841
00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:12,836
Put pressure on Li Di.

842
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:15,187
Order him to repair the canal
within a deadline.

843
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:16,746
Approved.

844
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:18,906
Thank you, Your Majesty.

845
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:21,547
Your Majesty,

846
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:25,866
how should we deal with Shen Wenqi?

847
00:37:25,956 --> 00:37:28,636
You should understand
the current situation.

848
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:29,636
I understand.

849
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:31,587
If we release Shen Wenqi at this time

850
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:33,627
would alert the enemy.

851
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:35,707
Yan,

852
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:36,836
this shouldn't be something

853
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,067
you can't think of.

854
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:40,075
I just thought

855
00:37:40,076 --> 00:37:41,395
that Shen Wenqi was old

856
00:37:41,396 --> 00:37:43,027
and had been in prison for a long time.

857
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:44,866
I'm afraid his health won't hold up.

858
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,627
It would be better
to put more care to him.

859
00:37:48,237 --> 00:37:49,027
Yes, Your Majesty.

860
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:52,555
Your Majesty,

861
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:54,667
Commandant Su Heng has arrived.

862
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:55,746
Send for him.

863
00:37:57,797 --> 00:38:01,227
Summon Commandant Su Heng!

864
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:06,786
I, Su Heng, greet Your Majesty.

865
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:08,395
Please rise, Commandant Su Heng.

866
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:09,547
Thank you, Your Majesty.

867
00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:12,999
We gained this victory

868
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,915
because General Su led the army
to defeat the enemy.

869
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:17,075
Commandant Su,
you're also valiant and invincible.

870
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:18,115
Your Su family

871
00:38:18,116 --> 00:38:19,995
is indeed a family of generals.

872
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:21,667
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

873
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:24,276
This is Official Lu,

874
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:26,306
the heir of Duke Zhenguo.

875
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,266
Greetings, Your Grace.

876
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,915
Commandant Su, what brings you back
to the capital this time?

877
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,955
Can I be of any help?

878
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:34,187
To be honest,

879
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:36,316
I returned to the capital
this time mainly

880
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:37,987
for my marriage.

881
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:39,716
Which lady

882
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,555
have you set your sights on?

883
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:42,515
Come on, tell me.

884
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:44,786
I'll personally arrange it for you.

885
00:38:45,516 --> 00:38:46,987
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Majesty.

886
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:49,515
My parents arranged a marriage
for me when I was young.

887
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:52,027
I will go to propose marriage myself.

888
00:38:52,556 --> 00:38:54,386
Congratulations, Commandant Su.

889
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,115
Thank you, Your Grace.

890
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:58,356
Don't just congratulate others.

891
00:38:58,357 --> 00:39:00,796
You should think
about your own marriage.

892
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,276
Your mother often nag to me

893
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:04,187
about this in the palace.

894
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,595
I already have someone in mind.

895
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:11,995
But I need to wait a while longer.

896
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:12,906
Your Majesty,

897
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:14,946
please don't tell my mother yet.

898
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,676
You young people

899
00:39:17,677 --> 00:39:19,475
sure have such big ideas.

900
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:20,316
Fine.

901
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,107
I'm not going
to concern myself with this.

902
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:30,946
Ran. Ran, wait.

903
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:32,075
I'm sorry.

904
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:33,676
I'm truly sorry.

905
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:35,547
Please don't divorce me, okay?

906
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,435
You don't have to consider the rest.

907
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:39,115
You can consider

908
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:40,555
the relationship we have all this year,

909
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:41,075
am I right?

910
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:42,676
I can't live without you.

911
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:44,115
If we divorce,

912
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:46,115
what would these court officials
think of me,

913
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:46,716
am I right?

914
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,595
I know you're bothered

915
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:48,299
by Madam He.

916
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,395
I'll make an arrangement
to send her out of the city, okay?

917
00:39:50,396 --> 00:39:51,876
She'll never bother you after this, okay?

918
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:53,346
Please, I beg you.

919
00:39:53,717 --> 00:39:54,627
Ran.

920
00:39:58,237 --> 00:39:59,075
Official Zhou,

921
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:00,075
Official Li, and Mrs. Li

922
00:40:00,076 --> 00:40:00,906
have been brought in.

923
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,276
Let them in.

924
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,107
Yes, sir.

925
00:40:11,516 --> 00:40:12,987
Greetings, Official Zhou.

926
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:17,987
Official Zhou,

927
00:40:18,197 --> 00:40:19,115
why

928
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,475
did you

929
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:22,067
bring us here today?

930
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:23,707
Madam He is dead.

931
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,507
Madam He is dead?

932
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:29,515
How could she be dead?

933
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:31,547
How could she be dead?

934
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:33,515
I... I just feel sorry for the child.

935
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,356
The child is innocent.

936
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:37,236
What exactly had happened?

937
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:38,276
How did she die?

938
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:39,107
Yes, tell us.

939
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,836
When her body was found,

940
00:40:40,837 --> 00:40:42,627
it was on a desolate road
out of the capital.

941
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:44,299
The horse was startled
and fell off a cliff.

942
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,915
But she was on the way
to the temple to pray.

943
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:46,756
Pray?

944
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:47,627
Yes.

945
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:49,555
But that road is not the way

946
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:50,987
to the temple.

947
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,466
Who wanted to harm her?

948
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:53,746
Then...

949
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:55,386
Where's the driver?

950
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:56,756
Not yet found.

951
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,276
Then go and find the driver.

952
00:40:58,277 --> 00:40:59,876
Why are you not doing anything here?

953
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,796
We'll know after we find the driver.

954
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:02,499
This case

955
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,196
has been handed over
to the Magistrate Office.

956
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:05,306
Official Li,

957
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:07,627
we'll give you an explanation.

958
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,587
Okay.

959
00:41:16,076 --> 00:41:16,946
Ran,

960
00:41:20,717 --> 00:41:21,719
let's go back.

961
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,067
Let's discuss this when we get back.

962
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:24,266
Wait.

963
00:41:25,197 --> 00:41:26,306
Official Li,

964
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:30,547
someone just reported you
for committing bigamy

965
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:32,667
and now Madam He died suddenly.

966
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:34,915
Don't you think all this

967
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,946
is too coincidental?

968
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:42,306
Official Zhou,

969
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:44,306
today Madam He died,

970
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:46,316
you claimed it was
for the investigation.

971
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:47,236
But here you are,

972
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,515
accusing me without reason

973
00:41:48,516 --> 00:41:50,107
because of these rumors.

974
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:53,067
Are you doing it for official duty

975
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:55,227
or do you have ulterior motives?

976
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:57,906
Ulterior motives?

977
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:03,306
What ulterior motives could I have?

978
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,707
Oh?

979
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:10,386
If you have evidence,

980
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:12,386
arrest me.

981
00:42:12,436 --> 00:42:13,466
If you don't,

982
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,547
put away your random speculations.

983
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:18,876
Shen Ran is my wife.

984
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:20,075
This is my family matter.

985
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:21,786
You don't need to worry about it.

986
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,466
Official Li,

987
00:42:28,956 --> 00:42:32,346
you sure are good at arguing.

988
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:36,035
Today I called you two here

989
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:37,746
for another matter.

990
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:39,147
Bring her in.

991
00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:44,035
Ran.

992
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:44,826
Zhen?

993
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:46,676
Ran.

994
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:47,426
Zhen.

995
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:55,466
It's really you.

996
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:57,067
I thought you were...

997
00:42:57,237 --> 00:42:58,466
I'm all right.

998
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:03,266
Fortunately, I didn't fail Mrs. Li

999
00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:04,716
and found your younger sister.

1000
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:05,915
Thank you, Official Zhou.

1001
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,627
I'm extremely grateful.

1002
00:43:08,996 --> 00:43:09,716
Zhen,

1003
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:11,466
what happened exactly?

1004
00:43:11,637 --> 00:43:14,075
That day, after meeting Brother-in-law,

1005
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:15,426
I was worried about Father.

1006
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:18,276
I wanted to buy some of
his favorite pastries in Chengxi

1007
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:19,316
and visit him.

1008
00:43:19,317 --> 00:43:20,356
But on my way there,

1009
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:22,667
I was abducted by Xu Wei.

1010
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:24,796
Later, a few other ladies and I

1011
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:26,426
were locked in a dilapidated house.

1012
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:29,316
I vaguely heard
the bad guys outside saying

1013
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:31,187
they were acting on Xu Wei's orders

1014
00:43:31,357 --> 00:43:33,236
and that they were going to send us

1015
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:34,987
to some province.

1016
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:36,987
It's all right.

1017
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:38,906
It's all over now.

1018
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:41,756
Yes.

1019
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:43,187
As long as you're safe.

1020
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:45,395
Official Zhou,

1021
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:46,515
how did you

1022
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:47,676
find Zhen?

1023
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:49,716
There are still
several missing ladies in the capital

1024
00:43:49,717 --> 00:43:50,796
that have not been found.

1025
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,466
The Magistrate Office and I
traced to Wuzhou.

1026
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:54,756
On the way to Wuzhou,

1027
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,306
we rescued several ladies.

1028
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:58,866
Coincidentally, we ran into Miss Shen.

1029
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:02,156
But I heard

1030
00:44:02,157 --> 00:44:03,435
the mastermind behind this,

1031
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:05,426
Xu Wei, is already dead.

1032
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:08,236
Perhaps Xu Wei

1033
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:09,987
is not the only mastermind.

1034
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:16,915
You're right. I agree with that.

1035
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:18,156
On our trip to Wuzhou this time,

1036
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:19,276
we also captured

1037
00:44:19,277 --> 00:44:21,196
another wealthy merchant named Zhao.

1038
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:22,995
After I interrogate him severely,

1039
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:23,987
we will know the truth.

1040
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:27,866
Official Zhou,

1041
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:29,196
you must not

1042
00:44:29,197 --> 00:44:30,515
let these villains go.

1043
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:32,027
Mrs. Li, rest assured.

1044
00:44:32,277 --> 00:44:35,386
I will make him confess.

1045
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:38,636
Ran,

1046
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:40,435
let's send Zhen back
to the residence first.

1047
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:41,716
She must be tired.

1048
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:42,196
Don't...

1049
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:42,826
No, she can't.

1050
00:44:43,396 --> 00:44:44,515
Miss Shen

1051
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,555
is an important witness.

1052
00:44:45,556 --> 00:44:46,395
We have an obligation

1053
00:44:46,396 --> 00:44:47,796
to protect her safety.

1054
00:44:47,797 --> 00:44:49,035
So it's safer for her

1055
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:50,187
to stay here for now.

1056
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:51,587
Also,

1057
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,435
to avoid alerting the enemy,

1058
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:54,555
you must keep

1059
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:55,595
Miss Shen's return

1060
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:57,707
strictly confidential.

1061
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:00,826
All right.

1062
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,276
(Xue Money House)

1063
00:45:07,277 --> 00:45:09,587
Mr. Li, this way.

1064
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:11,107
Please come this way.

1065
00:45:12,396 --> 00:45:13,587
All right.

1066
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,260
(Eighteen)

1067
00:45:41,516 --> 00:45:42,587
Where's my money?

1068
00:45:45,596 --> 00:45:46,946
Where is it?

1069
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:49,987
My money...

1070
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,027
Safe number eighteen.
It's indeed the right safe.

1071
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:55,147
My money...

1072
00:45:56,157 --> 00:45:57,466
Ru?

1073
00:45:58,357 --> 00:46:00,426
But Ru is dead.

1074
00:46:01,797 --> 00:46:03,107
Where's my money?

1075
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:04,866
Where did my money go?

1076
00:46:39,717 --> 00:46:41,836
Ru would at most take the money.

1077
00:46:41,837 --> 00:46:42,395
She didn't know

1078
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:44,027
about the ledger.

1079
00:46:44,956 --> 00:46:46,946
She's dead now.

1080
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:49,547
Who else knows about this?

1081
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:53,707
