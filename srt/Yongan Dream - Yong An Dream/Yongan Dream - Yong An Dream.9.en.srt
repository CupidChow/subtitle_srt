18
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:49,747
Official Zhou.

19
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:50,697
Sorry for the wait.

20
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,697
I went to see Mr. Shen just now.

21
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:53,906
How's my father?

22
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:55,507
Minister Shen already
regained consciousness.

23
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:56,387
The doctor said

24
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:58,147
he could recover completely

25
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:59,938
after resting and recuperating
for a few days.

26
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:01,778
Thank you, Official Zhou.

27
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,298
By the way,

28
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:06,387
this is the rubbing I found

29
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:07,867
in Li Di's study room.

30
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,147
The hollow-out design

31
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:09,950
is uncommon.

32
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,727
I think it's quite similar
to the rail cipher

33
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:13,537
you mentioned last time.

34
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:15,458
We'll know when we give it a try.

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
(Copybook)

36
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,938
Something's wrong with the wood.
Make sure they avoid inspection.

37
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,058
It was him indeed.

38
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,120
(The construction plan
is at Jin Money House.)

39
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,778
(The construction plan
is at Jin Money House.)

40
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,737
They swapped the original materials for
inferior ones behind my father's back.

41
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:32,547
And they framed my father for it,

42
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:33,977
causing the people to despise him.

43
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:35,707
Seems like he was the one

44
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,697
who set Jin Money House on fire as well.

45
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:39,186
To think that I even believed

46
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:40,938
that he'd help me find Zhen.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,120
(XXX)

48
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,218
Our result matches Official Lu's
investigation result in Wuzhou.

49
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,857
They're using materials from Wuzhou
to repair the West Canal.

50
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,147
Does that mean Zhen and Official Lu

51
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,257
went to Wuzhou
to investigate this case as well?

52
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,098
This Zhen.

53
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:08,200
She never even told me

54
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,857
that she was involved in
such a dangerous act.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,386
I can forgive Zhen for not telling me.

56
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:13,147
But why didn't you

57
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:14,547
and Official Lu tell me as well?

58
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:15,587
This is a huge deal.

59
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,626
I only knew that Official Lu

60
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,146
went to Wuzhou alone.

61
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:18,787
I didn't know

62
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,617
that Miss Shen followed him as well.

63
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,186
But please don't worry.

64
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:23,186
I'm sure Official Lu

65
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,218
will take good care of your sister.

66
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:29,467
Now that we have evidence,

67
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,066
can we arrest Li Di now?

68
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,737
It's obvious that Li Di was manipulated.

69
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:34,867
What should we do

70
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:36,497
if Li Di was manipulated again

71
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:37,706
after he was captured

72
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:39,617
and said that your father

73
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,497
was the mastermind?

74
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:43,778
Therefore, our priority

75
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,377
is to locate the mastermind.

76
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,537
Currently, we have two leads.

77
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,898
One leads to Wuzhou.

78
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,537
Another leads to the capital.

79
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:56,386
We have to wait for Official Lu's return

80
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,578
before we receive any updates.

81
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,698
However, there's one thing

82
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,258
I don't really understand.

83
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,778
Usually,

84
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:09,458
people will destroy these
encrypted letters

85
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:11,266
after reading them.

86
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,467
Why did Li Di

87
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:13,146
keep them

88
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,307
around?

89
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:15,698
An evil person like Li Di

90
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,386
thinks that he can escape unscathed

91
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,218
after committing his evil deeds.

92
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:21,338
Once things get out of hand,

93
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:22,926
he can at least use
these encrypted letters

94
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,857
to prove that he isn't the mastermind.

95
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,177
And,

96
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,747
I think he's hiding
other pieces of evidence

97
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:30,937
besides these encrypted letters.

98
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,987
Therefore, he might record
the amount of gold

99
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:34,626
he received

100
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,338
one by one.

101
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,898
You do know Li Di well.

102
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:43,057
Didn't you use me, who was his wife,

103
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,497
because of the same reason?

104
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,467
If so, where would he hide

105
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,018
those records of his?

106
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,417
It's not possible for him
to hide them at home.

107
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:00,258
If things do get out of hand one day,

108
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,338
Li Di will surely abandon the cart
to save the horse.

109
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,706
He's a member of the Li Residence.

110
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,900
There's no way he can do it
without implicating his family.

111
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,578
The place that Madam He is staying in,

112
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,417
it's a good place for him
to hide his things.

113
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:13,698
It's possible that he might
have a hidden stash there.

114
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,338
He doesn't understand a single word.

115
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,307
She has no idea what she's doing

116
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:19,146
when she runs errands

117
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:20,658
for Li Di.

118
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,177
Naturally, Li Di understands that fact
very well.

119
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:26,537
We've finally seen

120
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:28,537
Li Di's true colors.

121
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,297
Don't you think it's time
to make plans for yourself?

122
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:35,537
You should get a divorce.

123
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:38,937
I'll lend you a hand.

124
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:43,107
Now, I just want

125
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:44,578
this case to end as soon as possible.

126
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,537
I don't want to see Li Di
alive in this world.

127
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,578
Official Zhou,

128
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,458
my existence doesn't matter.

129
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:59,177
I can do anything as long as

130
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,497
Li Di can be brought to justice
as soon as possible.

131
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:16,537
Isn't that Ran's carriage?

132
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,720
(Yayuan Teahouse)

133
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,578
Official Zhou, Mrs. Li is here.

134
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:47,258
She's here again?

135
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,857
Does she come often?

136
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:52,747
Keep a close eye on Madam.

137
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:53,999
Report to me if you find anything.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,218
Yes, Master.

139
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,586
Zhao is a refined person indeed.

140
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:04,907
Look at the pond view.

141
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:05,626
It's so scenic.

142
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:06,338
Please.

143
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,138
Sir, please wait outside.

144
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:34,098
Wei.

145
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:36,617
You're here.

146
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,178
Zhao, how have you been?

147
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,747
Where's that beloved mistress of yours?

148
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:44,467
Could it be that
she was still blaming me

149
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:45,506
for what happened last time?

150
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:46,827
How could that be?

151
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:48,067
She got drunk again last night.

152
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,418
That's why she couldn't make it.

153
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:51,617
I see.

154
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:52,617
Have a seat.

155
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,777
Wei, let me offer you a toast.

156
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,818
Wei, you said before that you wanted
to venture into the liquor industry.

157
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:13,977
That's right.

158
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,707
The Wei family has been selling

159
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,227
silk and fabric for generations.

160
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:20,467
And, you have the license to sell salt
in Jingzhou too.

161
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,007
Why do you want

162
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,178
to venture into the liquor industry
in Wuzhou out of the blue?

163
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,547
According to the family rules of the Wei,

164
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:25,827
the industry itself isn't important.

165
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:27,850
What important is to know
how to adapt to local conditions.

166
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:31,747
Shops selling high-quality silk
and fabric litter the streets of Wuzhou.

167
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:34,426
If I try to do the same business here,

168
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:37,017
I'm afraid it'll end up as a failure.

169
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:42,377
If so, are you sure that you can succeed
in the liquor industry?

170
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,178
Zhao, whether I can succeed or not

171
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,617
all depends on you.

172
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,938
If I do make a profit,

173
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:53,418
you can have 60% of it.

174
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,707
Wei, you're direct indeed.

175
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,458
I guess fate did lead us to each other.

176
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:08,737
Fuman, come and offer Wei a toast.

177
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:21,178
Mr. Wen, we meet again.

178
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,418
Miss Man, your playing
is as elegant as ever.

179
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,418
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

180
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:29,058
Mr. Wei, let me offer you a toast.

181
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:31,938
But I'm afraid

182
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,947
that I cannot play for you again

183
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,137
after today.

184
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:37,698
Why is that the case?

185
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:44,467
I'm going to be married

186
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,777
to a 70-year-old man called Yang Xing

187
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:48,698
as his mistress.

188
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,777
How could that happen?

189
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,698
There's nothing I can do about it.

190
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,698
Mr. Wei,

191
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,698
it was because
I didn't serve you well enough.

192
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,218
Mr. Wei, since you don't like me,

193
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,178
I have no choice but to...

194
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,107
Mr. Wei,

195
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:10,257
why don't you take Fuman
as your mistress?

196
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:14,938
What? Don't you like Miss Man?

197
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,187
That's not the case.

198
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:19,107
It's just that my wife

199
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,626
is a jealous person.

200
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,426
If I do take her as my mistress,

201
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:23,467
I'm afraid I won't be able

202
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,587
to live in peace.

203
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:27,707
If that's the case, just divorce her.

204
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,218
Zhao, it's easy for you to say.

205
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,506
But I can't bear to do so.

206
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,067
Wei, you're a rare talent.

207
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,497
It's reasonable for you to have
several wives to serve you.

208
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,666
If Miss Qin does cause a ruckus,

209
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,306
you just need to coax her.

210
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:42,298
Zhao, you're right.

211
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,867
But my wife

212
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,707
is truly difficult to coax.

213
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,338
She's a young woman.

214
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:50,107
She'll be happy as long as

215
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,977
you buy her the things she likes.

216
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:54,400
But I already gave her

217
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,187
all the jewelry and accessories
I could think of.

218
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:58,467
I have no idea what else to buy for her.

219
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,298
This is vexing indeed.

220
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:01,987
I heard from my wife

221
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,987
that Miss Qin loves to draw as well.

222
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:04,987
What about this?

223
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,777
You can give her one of my paintings.

224
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:10,257
Zhao, if I do get one of your paintings,

225
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,458
I'm sure I don't need to coax her.

226
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,137
It's decided, then.

227
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:16,906
Miss Man,

228
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:17,467
you must

229
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,578
serve Mr. Wei well in the future.

230
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:25,857
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

231
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:28,657
Let's go.

232
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,897
Let's go and pick a painting.

233
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,266
Wei, over here, please.

234
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,306
Zhao, the view in your garden
is impeccable.

235
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,626
My garden seems primitive
compared to yours.

236
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:44,867
Wei, you're such a jokester.

237
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:47,218
I decorate the garden just for fun.

238
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:00,418
Zhao, before this, I only heard that
you were an avid painting collector.

239
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:02,257
Seems like

240
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:04,666
you do live up to your reputation.

241
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,818
This is the only hobby I have.

242
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:07,906
I collected these

243
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:10,377
in the past few years.

244
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:11,626
I spent a long time

245
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:13,467
to procure some of them.

246
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,146
I wonder what kind of painting
does Miss Qin like?

247
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:17,227
Zhao,

248
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:18,306
she's not an expert

249
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:19,617
like you.

250
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:21,777
She'll like it

251
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:23,938
as long as it's pretty.

252
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:30,067
There's a breeze here
even though there's no window.

253
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,338
That's unusual.

254
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:32,737
By the way,

255
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:37,098
she loves paintings of mountains,
plum blossom, bamboo,

256
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,338
moon, and so on.

257
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:40,418
Wei.

258
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:41,818
Over here.

259
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,298
If so, Wei, why don't you
check these paintings out?

260
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,298
Zhao, all of your paintings

261
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:53,657
are of superb quality.

262
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:56,306
If so, you can pick whatever you like.

263
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,497
If so,

264
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:00,218
I shall not stand on ceremony.

265
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:22,178
(There's indeed a hidden layer
beneath Autumn Moon.)

266
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:30,818
Zhao,

267
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,026
I think my mistress will like

268
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:35,418
this painting of bamboo and autumn moon.

269
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,306
Since this painting

270
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,298
has both bamboo and the autumn moon...

271
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,306
I'm so forgetful.

272
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:43,546
There's no need to pick.

273
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,137
I know the painting you need.

274
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,218
Come.

275
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,107
I heard that you and Miss Qin

276
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:51,146
are trying to have a child.

277
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,467
I'm sure Miss Qin

278
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:54,977
wants this painting.

279
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:01,947
Mr. Zhao, to be honest with you,

280
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,578
I already have this painting at home.

281
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:06,266
This is different from the one
you have at home.

282
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:07,818
It works like a charm.

283
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:10,906
I already have eight of them.

284
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:13,298
My wife pesters me to no end
because of them.

285
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,546
Therefore, I don't dare

286
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,497
to keep this painting.

287
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:19,467
Zhao...

288
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,017
Don't stand on ceremony.

289
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:21,467
But Zhao...

290
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:22,146
Someone!

291
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:24,497
Wrap the Painting of Fertility for him.

292
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,418
Wei, you're back.

293
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:52,377
Did Mr. Zhao give you this?

294
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:57,818
It's his gift for you.

295
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:03,137
Mr. Zhao is so thoughtful.

296
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:06,266
Seems like

297
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,698
you have a new mistress.

298
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,578
A new mistress?

299
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:20,578
Why are you here?

300
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,218
Greetings, Miss Qin.

301
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,617
Wei!

302
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:25,906
What exactly is going on?

303
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,218
Explain yourself!

304
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,067
Zhao made this arrangement for me.

305
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:30,786
I couldn't refuse him.

306
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:32,418
You couldn't refuse him?

307
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,377
If so, did he tell you

308
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:36,178
to divorce me?

309
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:38,987
He actually did.

310
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:39,506
You!

311
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,137
Wei Xian! You're something else!

312
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:42,947
It's no wonder
you didn't bring me there today.

313
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,750
You said you had a business deal
to discuss with him.

314
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:47,506
So, you just wanted to bring her back
because you fell for her, huh?

315
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,666
This is...

316
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:49,467
Qing,

317
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,058
it isn't what you think...

318
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,538
Did you forget that you promised me

319
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,707
not to get any mistresses

320
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,146
after you married me?

321
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:58,707
You lying scoundrel!

322
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,698
Fine! I'll leave, then!

323
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:04,457
Qing!

324
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:05,786
Qing!

325
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:07,217
Don't!

326
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:10,058
Qing!

327
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:11,786
That's your favorite vase.

328
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:13,306
It was difficult
to procure it, you know?

329
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,147
It's such a waste to smash it like that.

330
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:16,707
Such a waste?

331
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,747
It was difficult for you

332
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:19,066
to ask for my hand as well.

333
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,707
But you still didn't cherish me!

334
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,200
I couldn't do anything about it today.

335
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:24,427
You couldn't do anything about it?

336
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,627
Explain why

337
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,177
you couldn't do anything about it!

338
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,866
Just let me die, won't you?

339
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,349
You liar!

340
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,026
- Wait.
- You're abandoning me for someone new!

341
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,058
I'll kill you!

342
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,098
Why didn't you take Autumn Moon?

343
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:39,546
It was inside Zhao Chong's
painting room.

344
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:41,306
I didn't dare to ask for it insistently.

345
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:42,978
I was afraid that he might suspect us.

346
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,066
Didn't I already explain myself just now?

347
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,786
Zhao was too enthusiastic.

348
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:47,949
You said so yourself yesterday

349
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,026
that we lacked servants, right?

350
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,187
I don't believe you!

351
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:51,467
Am I the one lacking servants?

352
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:52,266
Or are you the one?

353
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:53,227
That's my baby!

354
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:54,306
Stop it! Let go!

355
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,546
Qing, mind your hands!

356
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:56,586
Mind your hands!

357
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:58,106
Is Miss Man here to keep an eye on us?

358
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:59,546
His servants couldn't get close to us.

359
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,578
Therefore, he sent Fuman here
to keep an eye on me.

360
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,106
Qing! Stop hitting me!

361
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:07,586
You're the only one I love!

362
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,857
My goodness.

363
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,000
This is my first time

364
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:10,999
witnessing a wife

365
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,747
who's daring enough
to do this to her husband.

366
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:13,467
Come here!

367
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,227
Don't!

368
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:15,298
Don't hit my face!

369
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:17,026
I'll kill you!

370
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,106
Qing, don't do it!

371
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:19,147
What are you worried about?

372
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:20,266
Do you think my missus

373
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,697
will hurt your master for real?

374
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:23,538
That's not what I'm worried about.

375
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,546
It's just that I have to spend
a lot of money tomorrow.

376
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:26,697
Help!

377
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:29,147
Help!

378
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:31,417
Wei Xian, why don't you just let me die?

379
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:33,707
Stop interfering with my life
in the future! Don't ever come back!

380
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,457
Qing!

381
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:37,346
Qing! You!

382
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:38,707
I've never seen

383
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,506
such an arrogant lady.

384
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:41,617
Qing.

385
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:44,177
She's pretty lucky.

386
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,187
Wei.

387
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:50,306
Miss Man,

388
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:51,937
you should return to your room first.

389
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:53,306
Don't walk around outside.

390
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:54,217
It's dangerous.

391
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,258
- That was dangerous.
- But Wei...

392
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:00,187
- Miss Man.
- Madam!

393
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:01,586
Let me take you to Dongli Bordello.

394
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:02,857
Madam, don't be angry!

395
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:04,778
Madam!

396
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:06,026
Thank you.

397
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:08,177
Madam, open the door!

398
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,820
(Lu Garden)

399
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:25,417
Greetings, Miss Qin.

400
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,187
Someone is here to spoil my mood

401
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:28,937
this early in the morning.

402
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,738
I was rude.

403
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:37,338
Miss Qin, I'm here to apologize to you.

404
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:40,586
I was born a slave.

405
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,818
I've been wandering since young.

406
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,467
I had no choice too

407
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,098
when I was sent to the Wei Residence.

408
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,387
Miss Qin, I'm willing to serve you
with all my heart

409
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,387
in hopes of

410
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,137
getting your protection.

411
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:54,818
I'll be content

412
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:58,018
to have a shelter.

413
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:07,467
Are you willing to serve me
of your own accord?

414
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:08,417
Yes, Miss.

415
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,457
You may order me whenever you like.

416
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,098
All right.

417
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,058
Did I tell you to get up?

418
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,738
I dare not.

419
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,147
Go to the backyard
and do our laundry later.

420
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,137
Yes, Miss Qin.

421
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:24,546
You may get up.

422
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,098
Thank you, Miss Qin.

423
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,937
Miss Qin,

424
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,306
I made these desserts for you.

425
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:35,697
Please try them.

426
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,826
If you like them,

427
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:39,177
I can make them for you in the future.

428
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:42,738
Give them to me.

429
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,338
Miss Qin, Mr. Wei is here.

430
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,187
- Qing.
- Over here.

431
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:49,747
Wei.

432
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,346
Qing, it must've been
tough on you yesterday

433
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,250
that expended a lot of energy
smashing all those pots.

434
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,137
I've replenished all of them
for you today.

435
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,947
Are you saying that
I can smash them again

436
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:00,227
if you make me angry next time?

437
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:01,546
I dare not do so.

438
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:03,907
Qing, why would I make you angry?

439
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,098
Wei.

440
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,018
Have you eaten?

441
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,187
Why are you still here?

442
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,377
You're bothering me and Wei here.

443
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:16,377
Leave.

444
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:19,857
I shall take my leave.

445
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:29,657
Miss Man,

446
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:32,546
don't forget about
Master's instructions.

447
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:33,627
When can we achieve our goal

448
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:34,826
if you keep bowing to them?

449
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:37,417
Do you think we can achieve our goal
by doing things recklessly?

450
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,427
They left!

451
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:47,667
That was exhausting.

452
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,498
It's tough to be a mistress.

453
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:50,987
If only

454
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:51,987
Fuman wasn't sent here

455
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:53,217
by Zhao Chong.

456
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:54,346
Do you wish

457
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,907
to keep her here, then?

458
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:57,498
No matter what,

459
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,018
she did endure
a lot of hardships out there.

460
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:02,506
People like them
are great at acting and pretending.

461
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:04,266
You mustn't feel sorry for them.

462
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:05,147
That's right.

463
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,866
It's in the nature of women like them

464
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,657
to act pitifully.

465
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:10,506
Don't worry.

466
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,106
I'll be careful

467
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:13,697
until our goal is achieved.

468
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:15,907
But what's Fuman's goal

469
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:17,857
for coming here?

470
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:19,897
Is she just here to test us?

471
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:21,747
If so, what should we do?

472
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:22,747
What does it have to do

473
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,098
with your collaboration?

474
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,417
Or, do they have other motives
for sending her here?

475
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:29,657
Could it be that there was something

476
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,137
we didn't know about Wei Xian?

477
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:35,137
Mr. Wei!

478
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:36,217
Mr. Wei!

479
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,617
My lord,

480
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:40,427
thanks to

481
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:41,306
Mrs. Zhuang's intel,

482
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:42,387
we were able

483
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:43,417
to locate the sawmill.

484
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,667
Are my husband and the rest still alive?

485
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,106
There are plenty of lumberjacks.

486
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:49,707
We don't have any info

487
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,857
on your husband yet.

488
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:54,217
Official Lu,

489
00:22:54,347 --> 00:22:56,058
I wish to save my husband.

490
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:59,058
The condition of the sawmill
is unknown for now.

491
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:00,897
I need to head there myself.

492
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:02,227
I might also be able

493
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:03,306
to discover other clues

494
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:04,498
or evidence there.

495
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:05,707
Zhao Chong will surely

496
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,427
be suspicious of us if Fuman finds out

497
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,498
that I'm not in the residence.

498
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:12,137
Shen Zhen,

499
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,467
can you stall Fuman

500
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,377
and not let her find out that I'm gone

501
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,657
if I need to be away for two days?

502
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:19,098
I can do it.

503
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:21,499
Yang Zong,
gather the men we planted in Wuzhou.

504
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,147
Tell them to infiltrate the sawmill
in batches.

505
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,106
After that, send someone to Jingzhou

506
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:27,907
to find out if there are
any undiscovered secrets of Wei Xian.

507
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,137
Got it, my lord.

508
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:31,778
Thank you.

509
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:41,657
The place that Madam He is staying in,

510
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:44,058
it's a good place for him
to hide his things.

511
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:48,778
(The secret accounts
are hidden within Madam He's residence.)

512
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:17,137
(Where would he keep them?)

513
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:20,657
Fresh vegetables for sale.

514
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:21,897
Master!

515
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:23,506
Master.

516
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:25,578
Madam went to the residence
in Minqin Alley.

517
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:29,018
Where did she go there?

518
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,457
Let's go and take a look.

519
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:32,417
Official Zhou,

520
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,506
Li Di suddenly turned back
on his way to the county yamen.

521
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,627
He's heading toward the He Residence
in Minqin Alley.

522
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:39,617
Mrs. Li went to the residence
early in the morning.

523
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:40,667
I'm worried

524
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:41,826
that Li Di might bump into her

525
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:43,137
while she's making new discoveries.

526
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,300
(Ledger)

527
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,467
Official Zhou?

528
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:57,346
Li Di is here.

529
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,298
Have you found it?

530
00:24:58,388 --> 00:24:59,738
I'm not sure if this is the one.

531
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:03,338
Who's there?

532
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:10,058
What are you doing?

533
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,467
What are you guys doing?

534
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,258
Reprimand me.

535
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:13,857
You shameless scum!

536
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:16,657
Li, he tried to violate me.

537
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,217
Official Zhou,

538
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:20,217
this is my private residence.

539
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:21,400
As the Censor-in-chief,

540
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,106
you intruded upon a private residence
and violated a maiden.

541
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,697
Do you have no regard for the law?

542
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:27,778
We like each other.

543
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,697
How am I violating her?

544
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:33,417
Mrs. Li,

545
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,417
if you're willing,

546
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:37,147
and if you do like me,

547
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:38,467
I'll marry you immediately

548
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:40,457
if you divorce him.

549
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:42,058
Impossible.

550
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:43,627
Did you hear that?

551
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:44,387
Did you hear

552
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:45,578
what my wife said?

553
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,599
Zhou Shu'an, just you wait.

554
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,187
I'll report you
to the local authorities now.

555
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:48,987
Li Di, don't forget

556
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:50,657
how you got your position.

557
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,747
There's no progress on the reparation

558
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:55,387
of the West Canal at all.

559
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,866
The Imperial Censorate supervises
all officials.

560
00:25:57,867 --> 00:26:00,667
At this moment,
I can impeach you officially

561
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:01,947
for your negligence.

562
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:03,627
Do you wish to join me

563
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,667
in explaining oneself

564
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:06,617
to His Majesty?

565
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:11,617
Official Zhou,

566
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,137
you shouldn't mix up
private matters with official matters.

567
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:17,707
I saw Mrs. Li entering

568
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,177
an empty house like this by herself.

569
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:21,786
I was worried about her.

570
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:23,258
That's why I followed her here.

571
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:27,617
All men desire beautiful ladies.

572
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:30,258
I was rude today.

573
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:32,457
I shall never

574
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,498
repeat my mistake.

575
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,066
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing!

576
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,306
Shameless scum!

577
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:47,657
You're disgusting!

578
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,066
I'll see how long you can

579
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,498
remain as the Censor-in-chief!

580
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:52,147
I...

581
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:54,306
Li, I can never face anyone in public

582
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:55,857
if news of this gets out.

583
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:57,467
Why didn't you speak up for me?

584
00:26:57,468 --> 00:26:59,417
This concerns an official. I...

585
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,907
If so, why did you go to the teahouse

586
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:06,937
to see him yesterday?

587
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:09,177
Who said I was seeing him?

588
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,546
I went to the teahouse
to find Shopkeeper Liu.

589
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,018
I have nothing to hide.

590
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:15,778
Did you tail me?

591
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,106
If you suspect me,

592
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,707
we can confront
Shopkeeper Liu right now.

593
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,187
I just saw it by accident yesterday.

594
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:21,266
And, this happened just now.

595
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,937
That's why I'm overthinking things.
Don't be angry at me.

596
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,427
But why did you come here

597
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,018
all of a sudden?

598
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:31,387
I went to find Shopkeeper Liu
to expand my business.

599
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,947
This place was vacant anyway.

600
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:33,667
I came here to see

601
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:35,377
if I could use this as my warehouse.

602
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:37,217
You cannot use this place.

603
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:38,786
Why not?

604
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:41,427
How can we support the entire residence
with your meager salary?

605
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:41,826
I...

606
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,106
I devoted myself to the Li Residence.

607
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,627
I was humiliated just now.

608
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:47,018
Not only did you not help me,
but you also doubted me.

609
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:50,457
I know now.

610
00:27:50,988 --> 00:27:53,538
You wish to reserve this house
for your mistress, huh?

611
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,066
Now, you only have her interests
at heart.

612
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:56,947
What about me?

613
00:27:56,948 --> 00:27:58,387
Ran, of course I have yours at heart too.

614
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:00,066
He is pregnant right now.

615
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:01,227
It's more convenient for us

616
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:02,249
if I keep her here.

617
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,467
I didn't say I would let her stay.

618
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:04,586
That's just an excuse!

619
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:05,467
How is that an excuse?

620
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:07,338
I'm doing this for our sake!

621
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,199
I was humiliated.

622
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,697
Do you dare to report to the authorities?

623
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:10,707
What else do you know

624
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,137
besides trying to pacify me?

625
00:28:12,468 --> 00:28:14,338
I was wrong about you indeed.

626
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:21,697
Here.

627
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:23,586
Miss Man.

628
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:24,387
Wei.

629
00:28:24,388 --> 00:28:25,457
What are you doing here?

630
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:26,467
Qing, have a seat.

631
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:27,697
Spare the formalities.

632
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,147
She insists on

633
00:28:30,148 --> 00:28:31,627
serving me.

634
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,498
It's hard for me to decline her.

635
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,697
I did so of my own accord.

636
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,978
Wei, please try my cooking too.

637
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:55,177
Delicious. It's pretty good.

638
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:57,266
Wei, I'm glad that you like it.

639
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:58,026
I've learned

640
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,907
several Jingzhou tunes lately.

641
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:01,857
Why don't I play it for you?

642
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:05,937
Miss Qin can enjoy the show too.

643
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:07,018
No need for that.

644
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:10,538
Sure. Thanks, Miss Man.

645
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:18,498
Leave.

646
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:20,457
You don't have the right
to enjoy the show.

647
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:26,066
Qing, drink with me.

648
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,866
Why are we drinking in the afternoon?

649
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:29,826
Look.

650
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:31,266
We have delicacies

651
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,657
and beauties here.

652
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:37,987
I mean you, my beauty.

653
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:40,137
Of course we have to drink to this.

654
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:41,937
Wei, here's a toast to you.

655
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:51,266
I finally understand now.

656
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,266
I wondered why you were
trying to serve me wholeheartedly.

657
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,707
So, this was your intention all along.

658
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:55,306
That's not it.

659
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,106
Miss Qin,

660
00:29:56,107 --> 00:29:57,346
I don't know what you mean.

661
00:29:57,347 --> 00:29:57,747
Qing.

662
00:29:57,748 --> 00:29:58,578
Shut up!

663
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:01,258
You didn't?

664
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,617
You didn't know what I meant, huh?

665
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,026
What do you mean by you didn't

666
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:05,427
and you didn't know what I meant?

667
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,266
Qing, she was just playing a song.

668
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:08,427
There's no need to do this.

669
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:10,177
Playing a song, huh?

670
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:12,387
Were you listening to the song?
Or were you staring at her?

671
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:13,947
Did you think I was blind?

672
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:14,707
How dare you

673
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,338
exchange glances with her
in front of me?

674
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:17,506
You.

675
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:18,786
Pack your belongings and scram!

676
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:21,298
Miss Qin, please be kind to me.

677
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,826
If I leave this place,

678
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:25,506
Zhao will kill me.

679
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,106
He has my slave certificate.

680
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:28,907
Where else can I go?

681
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:30,546
Miss Qin, please be kind to me.

682
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:31,266
If you don't leave,

683
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,826
I'll kill you!

684
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:33,538
Qing!

685
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:34,147
Qing!

686
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:35,346
-Calm down!
-You better scram!

687
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:36,506
Qing, calm down!

688
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:37,586
- Calm down!
- Don't stop me!

689
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,187
Wei!

690
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:38,866
Scram!

691
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,266
Don't let me see you again!

692
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:40,826
Just go!

693
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:41,227
Qingxi!

694
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:42,346
- Madam, I'm coming!
- Qingxi!

695
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:43,707
I won't be able to hold her off
if you don't leave now!

696
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,586
Madam, should I hit her?

697
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:45,227
Beat her up!

698
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:46,187
Don't! Qingxi!

699
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:46,947
Leave immediately!

700
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:47,707
Qingxi!

701
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,338
-Don't let me see you again!
-Qing!

702
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:50,707
Don't let me catch you!

703
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:51,627
Don't come back!

704
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:52,306
Stop hitting me!

705
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:53,578
I'll kill you!

706
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:54,897
You better leave!

707
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:56,338
I think she left.

708
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:11,417
That was exhausting.

709
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:12,778
Say,

710
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:15,227
you were pretty convincing
for a feisty lady.

711
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:17,066
Did you think it was easy for me?

712
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,747
It's very tiring.

713
00:31:18,748 --> 00:31:19,947
It's no wonder my buddies

714
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:23,098
always complained about the
things they face at home to me.

715
00:31:24,988 --> 00:31:25,826
I wonder

716
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:27,707
if this'll make her quit.

717
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,699
Hard to say.

718
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,578
Maybe Zhao Chong gave her an order that
would result in her death if she failed.

719
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:37,098
I have to leave by tonight.

720
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:38,937
I'll bring Zhuang Yuan with me.

721
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:41,937
I'll leave Lu Garden

722
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,299
to you.

723
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,227
You can proceed with your mission
without any worries.

724
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:46,457
I can do this.

725
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,137
Just cry

726
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:49,937
when you're in trouble.

727
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,377
I'll know by then.

728
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:53,467
What if

729
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:55,187
you're in danger, then?

730
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:56,457
What should we do by then?

731
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:00,538
Just trust me.

732
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:17,778
Is there something wrong?

733
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:19,457
No.

734
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:21,258
Everything's fine.

735
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:22,498
My lord,

736
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:24,667
everything is ready.

737
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:25,578
We may depart now.

738
00:32:26,468 --> 00:32:27,578
Let's go.

739
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:28,937
You...

740
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,338
Be careful out there.

741
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,627
Even so,

742
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,227
you have to think of a way

743
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:47,058
to get close to Mr. Wei.

744
00:32:47,107 --> 00:32:49,217
I'm already racking my brain here.

745
00:32:50,587 --> 00:32:52,346
Miss Qin is truly overbearing.

746
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,667
She almost killed me

747
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:55,578
when Wei looked at me
for a second longer than usual.

748
00:32:55,628 --> 00:32:57,066
How can I enter Chunxi Hall

749
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:59,177
after what happened today?

750
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:00,747
Husbands

751
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:02,387
always loved

752
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:05,657
sensible and thoughtful wives.

753
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:07,147
A wife like Miss Qin

754
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:08,707
who throws tantrums all the time

755
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,627
will definitely be frowned upon.

756
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:11,866
Endure it for a little longer

757
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:14,617
and try to get close to Wei.

758
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:17,978
I'm sure you can definitely
make him fall for you.

759
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:28,617
I'm afraid Mr. Zhao won't let you off

760
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:32,538
until you confirm his identity.

761
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:55,546
Miss, what are you...

762
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:56,866
Miss Qin said

763
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,147
Miss Man should rest well

764
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,346
in her room.

765
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:00,747
She doesn't wish to see you guys.

766
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,546
Are you guys trying
to put us under house arrest?

767
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:03,657
House arrest?

768
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:04,897
What does that mean?

769
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:06,266
Anyway, Miss Qin

770
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:07,338
makes the call here.

771
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,067
Although we're servants,

772
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,187
Mr. Zhao was the one

773
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:17,107
who sent us here.

774
00:34:17,108 --> 00:34:18,707
Don't you guys think

775
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,147
that you're crossing the line here?

776
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,587
Who's Mr. Zhao?

777
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:22,587
You're a servant.

778
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:23,627
I'm a servant too.

779
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,386
Therefore, Miss Qin

780
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:26,777
makes the call here.

781
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:29,498
It's as if she doesn't have a brain.

782
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,107
Do you know what time it is?

783
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:33,866
How are you still in the mood
to light incense?

784
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,147
When can we achieve our goals
if this continues?

785
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:39,378
Haven't we already planted
some men into Lu Garden before this?

786
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:45,217
Tie this onto the window frame.

787
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:53,458
Yesterday...

788
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:57,786
Did he make things difficult
for you yesterday?

789
00:34:57,787 --> 00:34:58,777
It doesn't matter.

790
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,737
He just reprimanded me
and complained about me.

791
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:05,297
But Li Di is a narrow-minded person.

792
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:08,378
I'm worried that he might do something
to ruin your reputation.

793
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:09,657
He doesn't dare to do so.

794
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,378
I'm not afraid of him either.

795
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,058
By the way,

796
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:15,386
the ledger we obtained yesterday,

797
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:16,898
was that his hidden ledger?

798
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:22,297
I already checked it thoroughly.

799
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:23,426
It only contained

800
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:26,018
the daily expenditures of Madam He.

801
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:27,817
Madam He is illiterate.

802
00:35:28,028 --> 00:35:28,786
Therefore,

803
00:35:28,787 --> 00:35:30,498
only numbers were written on it.

804
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:33,587
Yesterday, I said

805
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:35,418
I wanted to use the house
as my warehouse.

806
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,187
Not only did Li Di panic,

807
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:38,107
but he also brushed me off

808
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:40,350
by saying that he needed to use
the residence for other purposes.

809
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:42,547
Therefore, I think
he definitely hid the ledger

810
00:35:42,548 --> 00:35:44,067
in that residence.

811
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:46,107
I will send my men disguised as crooks

812
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:47,578
to raid the residence.

813
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:48,466
On one hand,

814
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:49,737
we can investigate the place again.

815
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,058
On the other hand,

816
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:53,578
we can see if we can lure
the culprit out.

817
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:55,866
When will you act, then?

818
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:56,986
Tell me before you act.

819
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,737
I'll keep a close eye on Li Di.

820
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:02,378
Have you ever considered this?

821
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:05,538
If Li Di is convicted,

822
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:08,418
the entire Li family will be implicated.

823
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:10,498
And that includes you.

824
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:11,587
The Shen family

825
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,337
wouldn't end up like this

826
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,306
had I not insisted on

827
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:16,858
getting married to Li Di back then.

828
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:19,498
Shouldn't I be implicated?

829
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:21,018
It's my fault.

830
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:22,458
It's not your fault.

831
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,027
It's Li Di's fault.

832
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:25,587
He was dominated by his greed.

833
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:27,297
Official Zhou, thank you
for your kind gesture.

834
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:29,378
I'll consider it.

835
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:43,137
Are we leaving the city?

836
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:45,538
I'm bringing you somewhere.

837
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:01,657
What are we doing here?

838
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:05,177
Whenever I suffer from
setbacks, failures,

839
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:07,257
or feel depressed,

840
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:10,177
I'll come to this place.

841
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:26,137
It looks bottomless, right?

842
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:30,098
Those who have lost all hopes

843
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:34,257
only see the bottom of the cliff.

844
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:37,177
They think that they'll be free

845
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:39,737
after they jump off the cliff

846
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:42,098
and die.

847
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:46,297
However, there's no point in being free

848
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:50,418
if one is already dead.

849
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:53,378
We should raise our head instead

850
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:55,657
and look at the vast sky and wide sea.

851
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,737
There are infinite possibilities
in the world.

852
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:01,946
There's no need to stick

853
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,938
to one path until the end.

854
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,257
Thank you, Official Zhou.

855
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,538
I understand what you mean.

856
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:17,337
But now, I have to stick to my path

857
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:20,657
until the end.

858
00:38:25,148 --> 00:38:26,858
If I'm lucky enough

859
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,737
to see the rising sun again,

860
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:30,866
I'll consider

861
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,697
all of the possibilities by then.

862
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:37,938
I believe

863
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:41,018
that it'll definitely happen.

864
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:50,266
You're something else.

865
00:38:50,267 --> 00:38:51,507
You managed to lure her away

866
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:52,938
with Mr. Zhao's servants.

867
00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:55,777
She's still here.

868
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:58,458
She's here.

869
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:07,657
Greetings, Miss Qin.

870
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:11,227
Miss Man,
it's already eight in the morning.

871
00:39:11,228 --> 00:39:12,697
Miss Qin,

872
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,018
I woke up long ago.

873
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,306
However,

874
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:18,507
a servant stood there

875
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:21,098
and forbade me from leaving my quarters.

876
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:23,866
How could that be?

877
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,777
Which servant are you referring to?

878
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,786
I don't think that's true.

879
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:27,426
It's the one

880
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:29,538
who's huge and tall.

881
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,578
The weather is great today.

882
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:35,737
I wish to get some sun in.

883
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,147
You can serve me here.

884
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,306
But I need

885
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:41,547
to greet Mr. Wei first.

886
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,547
Did you forget

887
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,137
what I told you yesterday?

888
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:47,587
I dare not do so.

889
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:50,027
Don't blame me for
not showing you any mercy.

890
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:51,547
I was furious yesterday.

891
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:54,018
Wei spent the entire night
before he could pacify me.

892
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:54,747
That's why

893
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:56,187
I'm being nice to you.

894
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:57,817
You better be content.

895
00:39:58,387 --> 00:39:59,777
Yes, Miss Qin.

896
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:02,386
In the future, refer to yourself
as Miss Man.

897
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:03,906
Do not call yourself Wei's mistress.

898
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:05,737
I didn't give you my permission yet.

899
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:07,817
Yes, Miss Qin.

900
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:10,098
You better hurry and
serve Miss Qin some tea.

901
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:13,058
Yes, Miss Qin.

902
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:18,297
Where are you going?

903
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,177
Miss Man made some chicken soup.

904
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:22,826
I'll deliver it to Mr. Wei

905
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:24,107
in Chunxi Hall.

906
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:25,906
It won't taste as good if it gets cold.

907
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,346
I'm still here.

908
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:29,018
Are you blind?

909
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:37,177
My shoulders are sore.

910
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:38,617
Miss Qin,

911
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:40,538
let me give you a massage.

912
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,410
(Chunxi Hall)

913
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:46,587
Miss Man, your fragrance

914
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:47,826
smells nice.

915
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:49,866
I made it myself.

916
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,346
If you like it,

917
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:52,426
I'll get some for you

918
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:54,337
later.

919
00:40:54,427 --> 00:40:55,986
Get it for me now.

920
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,507
Get your instrument as well.

921
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,297
I wish to listen to some songs.

922
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:01,858
Yes, Miss Qin.

923
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:12,578
Miss Man, how long have you been
staying in Wuzhou?

924
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:14,578
Miss Qin,

925
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:16,058
I've been here for five to six years.

926
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:18,578
Where are you from?

927
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,498
I come from the Yongping Commandery.

928
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:24,817
My family encountered some misfortunes.

929
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:28,058
Therefore, I was sold to Wuzhou.

930
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:30,898
Your family encountered
some misfortunes?

931
00:41:33,628 --> 00:41:35,137
That's all for today.

932
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:36,177
Go back now.

933
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:41,538
Madam, what's wrong?

934
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,067
I think I sprained my foot.

935
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,137
Have a seat.

936
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:45,707
It hurts.

937
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,297
I shall bring Mr. Wei here.

938
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:48,898
Stop right there!

939
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:50,707
Mr. Wei pulled an
all-nighter last night.

940
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,667
He's resting now.

941
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:52,306
But...

942
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:53,386
No buts.

943
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:55,306
You'll be bothering him
if you go to him right now.

944
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:57,826
Can you bear the consequences
if you make him angry?

945
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:58,737
Go back!

946
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:03,137
I don't think I can move.

947
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:04,418
Let me see.

948
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,898
-What are you doing?
-What are you up to?

949
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:20,498
Miss Qin, try moving again.

950
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:24,938
I think

951
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,578
it doesn't hurt as much now.

952
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:34,898
Miss Man, are you
a medical practitioner?

953
00:42:37,028 --> 00:42:39,777
I was adopted by
a physician before this.

954
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,737
Therefore, I picked up
some medical skills.

955
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,697
Miss Qin,

956
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:46,098
let me help you to your room.

957
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:47,617
No need for that.

958
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:49,707
You may leave first.

959
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:50,786
You guys may leave first.

960
00:42:50,787 --> 00:42:52,498
Miss Qin needs to rest.

961
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:54,257
All right.

962
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,040
(Taman Lu)

963
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:20,466
Madam,

964
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:22,578
is there something wrong
with the incense?

965
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:25,938
There's nothing wrong with it.

966
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,418
But there's something wrong with her.

967
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,306
Fuman was sent here by Zhao Chong

968
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:30,699
to keep an eye on you.

969
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,187
Of course
there's something wrong with her.

970
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:34,507
This is no ordinary incense.

971
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:35,906
It contains herbs.

972
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:37,386
It can help soothe the nerves.

973
00:43:37,387 --> 00:43:37,946
Ordinary people

974
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:39,386
cannot make this.

975
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:41,027
And, the herbs she used

976
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:42,578
are not cheap.

977
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:44,786
And, your ankle recovered

978
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:46,386
after she did something to it

979
00:43:46,387 --> 00:43:47,627
when you sprained it.

980
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:48,418
That's right.

981
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:49,866
She achieved that with one move.

982
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:52,058
You can't pick that skill up
in a short time.

983
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:54,458
If Fuman is this capable,

984
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:56,458
she should be able
to survive by herself.

985
00:43:56,628 --> 00:43:59,018
Why did she depend on Zhao Chong?

986
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:01,617
We have to let Wei investigate this.

987
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,147
Why hasn't he come back

988
00:44:06,148 --> 00:44:07,697
after so long?

989
00:44:09,987 --> 00:44:11,426
Are you worried about him?

990
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:13,418
Of course.

991
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:22,266
I'm his mistress, you know?

992
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:23,498
His beloved mistress.

993
00:44:26,148 --> 00:44:27,507
Go out and stand guard at the door.

994
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:28,858
All right. I'll go now.

995
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:44,098
Sun!

996
00:44:55,668 --> 00:44:57,018
Sun.

997
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,667
Mr. Pang, we're in trouble!

998
00:44:58,668 --> 00:44:59,147
Mr. Pang!

999
00:44:59,148 --> 00:44:59,950
Why are you panicking?

1000
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:02,098
The warehouse is on fire!
And, our workers caught the plague!

1001
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,466
The warehouse is on fire?
Our workers caught the plague?

1002
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,906
That's right! What should we do?

1003
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,227
Protect the wood. Put out the fire!

1004
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:08,297
Yes, sir!

1005
00:45:08,297 --> 00:45:09,297
(Inspector, Li Di)

1006
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,800
(Verification of the Ministry of
Water Resources)

1007
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:31,378
Li Di, huh?

1008
00:45:39,188 --> 00:45:43,306
Thank you, benefactor.

1009
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,498
Hurry. Be careful.

1010
00:45:44,628 --> 00:45:45,378
Let's go.

1011
00:45:46,387 --> 00:45:47,538
Dear?

1012
00:45:52,387 --> 00:45:55,067
The reparation of the West Canal
is nearing.

1013
00:45:55,068 --> 00:45:58,177
And, we have to deliver
that batch of logs soon.

1014
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:02,337
Now, you're telling me
that they were all burned down?

1015
00:46:03,987 --> 00:46:06,657
I don't know what happened,
but there was a fire.

1016
00:46:06,658 --> 00:46:09,217
The weather was dry, and the warehouse
was filled with logs. They...

1017
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,657
All of them were burned down
in the blink of an eye.

1018
00:46:16,668 --> 00:46:17,898
Five days.

1019
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,898
You have five days
to replenish the missing logs.

1020
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:25,297
The workers died.

1021
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:27,938
They caught

1022
00:46:28,028 --> 00:46:29,300
the plague.

1023
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:31,906
I don't think we can use them.
It'll be troublesome to keep them around too.

1024
00:46:31,907 --> 00:46:33,627
Coincidentally, there was a fire there.

1025
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:34,858
I just let them leave.

1026
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:38,986
A fire?

1027
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:40,266
And a plague?

1028
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:41,018
That's right.

1029
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:44,578
That's too much of a coincidence.

1030
00:46:48,787 --> 00:46:50,378
Useless fool.

1031
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:59,697
Where is Wei Xian right now?

1032
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,507
I think he's inside the residence.

1033
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:02,667
Did I ask you?

1034
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:04,306
Go and ask Fuman!

1035
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:05,177
Yes, sir.

1036
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:06,378
I'll depart immediately.
