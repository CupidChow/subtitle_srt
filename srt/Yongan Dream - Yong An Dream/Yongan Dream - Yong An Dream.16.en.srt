=Episode 16=

18
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:07,801
(This lock was first opened with a key.)

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,480
(Then deliberate marks were made
to suggest it had been forced open.)

20
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,721
I was too eager to solve this.

21
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:16,129
I only thought about catching

22
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,360
the real culprit before dawn

23
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,080
and overlooked this scene.

24
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,490
There are food scraps and debris

25
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:32,770
everywhere,

26
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,849
except the areas

27
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,170
where Zhao Chong's body

28
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,640
and Shen Zhen laid down.

29
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,480
This indicates

30
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,890
that the bowl

31
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:40,610
was smashed

32
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,880
after the two were on the ground.

33
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,689
There are cut marks on this table

34
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,200
with blood around them.

35
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:51,281
But no blood inside the marks.

36
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:52,289
This suggests

37
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,289
that the marks were made

38
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,640
after the blood was splattered.

39
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,920
The killer deliberately created
a sign of struggle at the scene.

40
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,969
(There are no signs of struggle)

41
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,681
(on Zhao Chong's body or limbs.)

42
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,170
(The splattered blood)

43
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:08,561
(is relatively concentrated,)

44
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,521
(indicating that Zhao Chong
was ambushed.)

45
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,161
(He was not cautious)

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,200
(against the killer.)

47
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:18,320
He was familiar with the killer.

48
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,449
The killer deliberately created

49
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,001
a sign of struggles to cover this up.

50
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:24,409
But Zhao Chong was secretly detained.

51
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,401
No one visited today.

52
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,961
The familiar person can only be

53
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:31,441
a court official.

54
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:35,961
Pretend you are the killer.

55
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,161
Official Lu?

56
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,841
Oh, no!

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,930
I can't hold it in anymore.

58
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:29,680
Wait for me.

59
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:00,970
Shen Zhen was knocked unconscious.

60
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,440
Su Heng and the court officials
quickly arrived at the cell.

61
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:05,370
If the killer left the cell,

62
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,600
they would surely run into each other.

63
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,920
So...

64
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,440
The killer did not leave the cell.

65
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,521
Zhen.

66
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,800
Zhen.

67
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,000
The killer is still
in the Magistrate Office.

68
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,649
(At the Hour of Yin,)

69
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,401
(the evil will retreat.)

70
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,920
Sir, everyone has assembled.

71
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,081
I've found out

72
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,009
about the killer.

73
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,810
Found out?

74
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:51,730
That's great.

75
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,930
Official Lu is indeed mighty.

76
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:55,089
Miss Shen was indeed framed.

77
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,810
So, where is the killer?

78
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,161
Who is the killer?

79
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,240
The killer

80
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,370
is among us.

81
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,081
What? Among us?

82
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,530
Yang Zong.

83
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:08,841
Who exactly is the killer?

84
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,089
The killer didn't hesitate

85
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,480
to drug his colleagues with laxatives,

86
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,881
kill Zhao Chong,

87
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,081
and frame Madam Shen.

88
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,800
To cover up,

89
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,680
he even deliberately created
the illusion of a fight at the scene.

90
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,000
However,

91
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,170
whoever has come into contact
with the laxative

92
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,730
and put his hand in a copper basin,

93
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,240
the water will turn yellow.

94
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,129
All of you

95
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,689
were carefully selected by me.

96
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,089
Your skills in martial arts, knowledge,

97
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,410
character, and aspirations

98
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,120
are all exceptional.

99
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,360
You have a clean family background too.

100
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,249
It's not easy to be recruited

101
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,841
by the Magistrate Office.

102
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:43,649
Why would you help the tyrant

103
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,480
and take such drastic steps today?

104
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,721
Is there

105
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,521
an unspeakable difficulty behind this?

106
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:53,961
I'm giving you a chance now.

107
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,040
If you step up and confess your crime,

108
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,530
I will consider our years
of working together

109
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,360
and deal with you leniently.

110
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,360
Otherwise,

111
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,321
don't blame me for being ruthless!

112
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,521
Yang Zong.

113
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:48,410
Are you the killer?

114
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:48,970
What?

115
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:49,390
No, I'm not.

116
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:50,129
From the moment I said

117
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,290
those who touched the laxative

118
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,050
will turn the water
in the copper basin yellow,

119
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,500
you've been constantly
rubbing your hands,

120
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,089
trying to rub off

121
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,800
the laxative residue.

122
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,009
Come on, say something.

123
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,961
- Yes, say it.
- What's going on?

124
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,040
How can it be him?

125
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,321
Are you trying to deny it?

126
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:07,569
Yang Zong,

127
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,920
bring it here and let him try.

128
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,281
Here you go.

129
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,360
Did you kill

130
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,521
Zhao Chong?

131
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:21,641
Yes.

132
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,201
I killed him.

133
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:25,730
Who ordered you to kill him?

134
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,040
I can't tell you.

135
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,401
Please, sir.

136
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,449
For the sake

137
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,800
of our years of working together,

138
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:34,641
save my family.

139
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:35,920
Take care of them

140
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,361
for me.

141
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,449
Spit it out! Spit it out!

142
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,521
Spit it out!

143
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,361
Contact his family

144
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,329
immediately.

145
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,040
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,161
Be gentle.

147
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,641
Just bear with it.

148
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,040
I can't help it
when you're seriously injured.

149
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,481
Bear with it. It'll be over soon.

150
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:30,960
You're up.

151
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,930
Sorry to worry you.

152
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,720
Why didn't you rest a bit more

153
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,040
and wait for me to see you?

154
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,130
Madam knows your hand is injured.

155
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:48,680
She insisted on coming to see you
after she woke up.

156
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,369
I'm fine.

157
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,369
I saw you applying medicine

158
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,641
to your injuries just now.

159
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,361
Let me check your injuries.

160
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:57,601
It's really nothing.

161
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,680
I even brought the medicine.

162
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,720
Does it hurt a lot?

163
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:00,161
Official Zhou,

164
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:03,481
it's my fault

165
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,920
that you suffered.

166
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,800
I am grateful to you

167
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:11,481
for what you've done for me

168
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,481
and the Shen family.

169
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:15,920
But I...

170
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,449
I truly don't know

171
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,121
how to repay you.

172
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,281
When it comes to repaying and gratitude,

173
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,080
I should be repaying you.

174
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,601
Do you remember you once helped

175
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,290
a scholar in a rush
to take the examination

176
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,080
in the capital years ago?

177
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:44,481
My father was a gambler.

178
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,530
He lost all our family's property

179
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,040
and owed some debts outside.

180
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,650
At that time, the creditors

181
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,840
snatched away the money
I used to buy books.

182
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,361
It was you who helped me.

183
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,601
You told me back then

184
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,200
that if one day I passed
the imperial examination

185
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:04,121
and became a good official,

186
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,161
that would be considered repaying you.

187
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:11,200
So that was you.

188
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:15,481
It was just a small favor back then.

189
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,689
You don't have to think about it.

190
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,001
But I just can't help
but keep thinking about it.

191
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,521
Back then, I was just a poor scholar.

192
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,881
And

193
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,800
you were the daughter of a minister.

194
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,720
Until one day,

195
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,761
I've finally entered officialdom.

196
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,960
I thought I could...

197
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,881
But I never expected

198
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,010
that my waiting to end up

199
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,800
seeing you marry Li Di.

200
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:48,969
If I

201
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,761
had accomplished all this earlier,

202
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:53,960
would today have turned out like this?

203
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:56,729
Please don't mention

204
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,121
repaying me in the future

205
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,800
because I'm the one owing you.

206
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,361
It's just
that I still have selfish thoughts.

207
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,960
I still want to see you

208
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,241
as pure

209
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,481
and cherished

210
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,001
as before.

211
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:17,121
You are about to divorce soon.

212
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,521
Can...

213
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:22,969
Can I stay

214
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,969
by your side

215
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,401
and continue to take care of you?

216
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,881
Now,

217
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,560
in the current situation,
probably not the same as in the past.

218
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,130
After the experience

219
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,680
of having my husband scheming on me,

220
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:45,680
I no longer have such intentions.

221
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:52,840
I will continue to wait for you.

222
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:01,881
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

223
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:06,121
I'll get going, then.

224
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:11,761
Wait.

225
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,161
I took this back for you.

226
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,560
(Shen Ran)

227
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:47,920
Thank you.

228
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:17,209
Sir,

229
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,481
we've brought in the criminal.

230
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,001
Zhou Shu'an,

231
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,320
don't bother asking.

232
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:39,560
I won't say anything.

233
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,680
Li Di,

234
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:44,040
do you still think

235
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:46,161
your benefactor will come to save you?

236
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,881
You should know your own weight

237
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,720
before talking to me like this.

238
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,161
Did you kill her?

239
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,569
Compared to you,

240
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,369
Lan

241
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,569
is a more important clue for us.

242
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,690
Do you think

243
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:18,641
we would kill her?

244
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,000
Who is

245
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,369
so eager

246
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,520
to cut off this lead?

247
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,361
That can't be.

248
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,369
Pawns like you

249
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,770
have already been exposed.

250
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,010
For your benefactor,

251
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,041
it's more harm than good.

252
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,210
Let me tell you another piece of news.

253
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,250
Besides Lan,

254
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,690
Zhao Chong has also been killed.

255
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,329
For your benefactor,

256
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,490
all of you are nothing but pawns.

257
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:45,081
Once used, you will be disposed of.

258
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,000
As long as abandoned pawns like you

259
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,889
are forever silenced,

260
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,601
no one will ever find out about him

261
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:56,960
regarding the West Canal case.

262
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,280
Isn't it all thanks to you?

263
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:02,530
If you hadn't been pursuing me
so relentlessly,

264
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,920
how could my benefactor
have given up on me?

265
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,369
You're just coveting

266
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,369
my wife, Shen Ran.

267
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,250
Otherwise, of all people in this world,

268
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:09,770
why would you

269
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:11,680
keep targeting me all the time?

270
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,920
You still think
it's other people's fault.

271
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,440
How foolish and pathetic.

272
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,760
Zhou Shu'an,

273
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,409
don't lecture me.

274
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,649
You have no right

275
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,089
to mock me.

276
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,401
Even if I cannot escape death,

277
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,450
I will not let you and Shen Ran

278
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:30,561
get what you want.

279
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,200
Aren't you trying to save Shen Wenqi?

280
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,041
I'll tell you this now.

281
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,609
Without my confession,

282
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,680
Shen Wenqi will die.

283
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,401
He will die!

284
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,561
Shen Wenqi has already been beheaded.

285
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,849
Beheaded?

286
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,369
It's easy to imagine

287
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,290
how ruthless

288
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,240
your benefactor is.

289
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,129
Now, I don't know

290
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,161
how much longer

291
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,210
you can live.

292
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:55,889
No, wait.

293
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,369
But...

294
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,280
It's...

295
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:03,450
This old stubborn fool

296
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,649
just ended up being the scapegoat

297
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,081
for no reason at all.

298
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,970
He lost everything,

299
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:08,970
including his life.

300
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,810
Now, he died with
his reputation as a criminal.

301
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,081
Utterly foolish.

302
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:15,450
This old man...

303
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,649
I really can't...

304
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,970
This old man.

305
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,881
Oh, this old man.

306
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,920
You heartless person.

307
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,641
How dare you shamelessly
mention my father?

308
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:29,649
You're just

309
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,690
a useless pawn being cast away.

310
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,881
Who do you think you are?

311
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,480
You... You're still alive?

312
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:45,520
Before I see you confess
and receive punishment,

313
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:48,321
how could I die so easily?

314
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,041
Back then,
you only have ordinary talent.

315
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,770
It was my father who taught

316
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:57,361
and helped you step by step.

317
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,920
There's an old saying
that a favor should be repaid.

318
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,810
But you

319
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:03,081
ungratefully framed my father.

320
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,161
You have completely lost
your conscience.

321
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:07,760
Shen Wenqi helped me?

322
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,680
It's been more than ten years.

323
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,730
For over ten years, I studied hard.

324
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,841
Finally, I entered
the Ministry of Water Resources.

325
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,601
Do you know

326
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,649
you could make a lot of money

327
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,730
at the Ministry of Water Resources

328
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,121
if you close your eyes just a little?

329
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,321
But your father,

330
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,169
that righteous father of yours,

331
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,450
kept restraining me!

332
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:30,490
What power does he have

333
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,760
to make me rich?

334
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:34,609
If he didn't restrain me,

335
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,089
do I need to endure humiliation

336
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,121
and obey their orders?

337
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,490
What did I do it for?

338
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:42,000
For whom am I doing it, Shen Ran?

339
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,970
It was your own greed

340
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:46,841
that blinded you and led you astray.

341
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:48,409
Yet, you're blaming your benefactor

342
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,161
for not offering you a luxurious life?

343
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,490
Luxurious life?

344
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:54,561
Li Di,

345
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,129
you are beyond help.

346
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,520
Utterly foolish.

347
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:00,321
Anyway, your father is already dead.

348
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,520
Although he was framed by bad people,

349
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,601
heaven is just

350
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,401
and has kept him alive.

351
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:26,440
The one whose life is about to end

352
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,200
is you.

353
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,601
You tricked me!

354
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,730
Guards! Get his thumbprint!

355
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,000
Shen Ran! Shen Ran!

356
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:46,450
You...

357
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,649
Shen Ran, we are husband and wife.

358
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,490
Why are you siding with him?

359
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:52,081
Zhou Shu'an!

360
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,609
Li Di's testimony is enough to prove
that Shen Wenqi was framed.

361
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,530
Report it immediately.

362
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:02,490
Yes, sir.

363
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:04,321
Zhou Shu'an!

364
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,321
Zhou Shu'an!

365
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,210
Someone, get the physician.

366
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:15,041
Yes, sir.

367
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:17,881
Zhou Shu'an,

368
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,841
you poisoned me.

369
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,401
That court official
may have taken his own life.

370
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,920
But it's enough to prove

371
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,401
that you were set up.

372
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,881
I knew

373
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:21,920
you would keep your promise.

374
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,240
But you still had to suffer.

375
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,440
Well, I didn't suffer

376
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:28,321
in vain.

377
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,240
At least,

378
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:32,960
I know how you feel.

379
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,920
Also,

380
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,561
Li Di had confessed.

381
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,089
This is enough to prove

382
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,490
that your father was framed

383
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:51,250
in the West Canal case.

384
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,960
Official Zhou
has already entered the palace.

385
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:56,240
Your father will be released soon.

386
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:58,121
Really?

387
00:23:58,531 --> 00:23:59,609
That's great.

388
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,081
My father is going to be released.

389
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,121
I'm so happy, Lu Shiyan.

390
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,169
My father no longer

391
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,801
has to suffer from injustice.

392
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,121
Su Heng.

393
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:20,760
Zhen.

394
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:22,641
Uncle Shen asked me
to pass a message to you.

395
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:24,720
My father?

396
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,500
I went to visit him just now.

397
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:28,530
He said he hopes you'll move
into the Su Residence first

398
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:29,680
to put his mind at ease.

399
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,129
My father also replied to my letter.

400
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,900
He asked me to take good care
of the Shen family.

401
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:35,480
So, just now,
I brought Ran back to the Su Residence.

402
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,649
I'm grateful to Uncle Su

403
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,760
and you too, Su Heng.

404
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,409
Then I'll head

405
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,520
to Cheng Garden to pick up Qingxi first.

406
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,520
I've already sent someone
to pick her up.

407
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,810
Then please take good care

408
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:53,561
of Zhen for these few days.

409
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:56,490
It's a matter between the Su family

410
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:58,081
and the Shen family.

411
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,601
I don't need you to ask.

412
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,041
Let's go.

413
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,401
I'll come and visit you soon.

414
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,609
By the way, to prevent any bad people
from causing trouble,

415
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,530
our general's mansion

416
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:11,050
has strengthened security recently.

417
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,161
If you want to enter,

418
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:14,920
be very careful.

419
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,050
Let's go.

420
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,299
Ran has been injured by Li Di.

421
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,250
Let's go and check on her.

422
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:23,280
Ran?

423
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:24,329
How did that happen?

424
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,081
Let's go.

425
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,849
What's wrong with you?

426
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,649
You're always slow to act

427
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,361
and let others take advantage.

428
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:39,520
You're such a disappointment.

429
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:52,801
It's going to be a tough road ahead.

430
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,400
(Su Residence)

431
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,200
Ran.

432
00:25:58,731 --> 00:25:59,601
Zhen?

433
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,121
Zhen.

434
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:09,200
Ran, Zhen.

435
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,250
Treat this place

436
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:11,720
as your own, and talk freely.

437
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:13,081
I'll check outside first.

438
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:16,041
Ran,

439
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,000
your injuries...

440
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,081
These are just flesh injuries

441
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,321
by Li Di's desperate actions.

442
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,641
It's nothing serious.

443
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,480
How could he do such a thing?

444
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,641
It's all in the past now.

445
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:37,081
Well, our father's innocence
had finally been restored.

446
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,770
As for you,

447
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,361
what exactly had happened?

448
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,641
I...

449
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:43,920
Tell me quickly.

450
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,121
Zhao Chong was killed

451
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,210
and I was falsely accused

452
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:48,849
of being Zhao Chong's killer.

453
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,041
Killer?

454
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:52,530
But thanks to Official Lu,

455
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,690
he found some clues

456
00:26:53,691 --> 00:26:54,970
and the killer

457
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,161
to clear my name.

458
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:57,881
I'm all right now.

459
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,720
Zhen.

460
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,530
Ran,

461
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:03,369
let's not dwell

462
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,010
on the past.

463
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,730
Father is about to be released.

464
00:27:06,731 --> 00:27:07,530
We can reunite

465
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:09,161
as a family soon.

466
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,609
Father would not want

467
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,760
to see you like this.

468
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,210
Get more rest.

469
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:15,329
Both of us shouldn't

470
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,290
make Father worry.

471
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,280
Okay?

472
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,641
Okay.

473
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,000
Then promise me

474
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,129
that no matter what you do
in the future,

475
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,720
you mustn't act recklessly.

476
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,200
I promise.

477
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:29,450
In a few days,

478
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:30,450
let's go and pick up Father

479
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:31,600
and return to Baixiang Pavilion

480
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:32,450
to accompany him

481
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,401
and make him happy.

482
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
(Zhang)

483
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:50,801
Zhen!

484
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,970
(Zhang)

485
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:58,329
(Someone has broken into the prison!)

486
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,841
(Notify Official Lu immediately!)

487
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,280
(Official Lu?)

488
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,200
(Eldest Princess?)
[*Zhang means Eldest in Chinese]

489
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:11,121
Was it Eldest Princess
who killed Zhao Chong?

490
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,010
(Eldest Princess. Zhang)

491
00:28:18,011 --> 00:28:19,329
If Eldest Princess is the mastermind

492
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,361
behind all this,

493
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:25,321
then what is her motive?

494
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,280
Lu Shiyan?

495
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,889
(Imperial Censorate)

496
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,210
He has not regained consciousness.

497
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:40,960
We've called the physician
to check on him.

498
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:43,401
Li Di was poisoned
with extremely strong poison.

499
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,240
He may be out of danger.

500
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,841
But the medical official
cannot determine

501
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,760
when he will wake up.

502
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:55,200
Sir, Commandant Su requests a meeting.

503
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:57,561
Let him in.

504
00:28:57,811 --> 00:28:58,601
Yes, sir.

505
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,321
Official Zhou,

506
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,329
I came

507
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,369
to inquire

508
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,609
about the West Canal case.

509
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,290
This case is under investigation.

510
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:15,361
So I'm unable to reveal details.

511
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,601
His Majesty's decree.

512
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:39,121
Assist you?

513
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,329
We found

514
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,050
that someone had been secretly
amassing troops

515
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,440
and privately forging weapons in Jizhou.

516
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:46,490
These weapons

517
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,129
were sent to Wuzhou

518
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,280
and the capital.

519
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:50,210
Among these three places,

520
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,089
we found

521
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,569
a huge amount of money transactions.

522
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,929
There's a key figure in these incidents,

523
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,280
which is Zhao Chong.

524
00:29:57,051 --> 00:29:58,899
It appears that the West Canal case

525
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,409
and the private army
and forging of weapons

526
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,569
are the same mastermind.

527
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,810
It is possibly

528
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:04,770
indicating

529
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:06,841
a conspiracy of treason.

530
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,641
Treason?

531
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:12,569
No wonder I always felt

532
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,770
these people were up to more

533
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,280
than just lining their pockets.

534
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,690
Now, can you share

535
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,641
the case details with me?

536
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:27,680
This case was originally
under the Magistrate Office.

537
00:30:30,771 --> 00:30:32,280
Where's Lu Shiyan?

538
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,889
Master has been busy
with official duties lately.

539
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,609
He said

540
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,649
once he has finished his work

541
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,881
he will come to visit you.

542
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,041
What are these?

543
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,799
Master said he's afraid

544
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,530
you're not used to the things
in the Su Residence.

545
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:46,200
So he instructed me

546
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:48,480
to prepare the things you're used to
and send them to you.

547
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,250
Both of you, please come with me.

548
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,161
Move these things.

549
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,730
Why do you need to prepare these?

550
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,490
You can just take them
from Cheng Garden.

551
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,401
Master also said

552
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,210
everything from Cheng Garden
must be kept as it is.

553
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:08,401
Miss Shen will come back.

554
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,290
Why would I go back?

555
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,889
My father is coming home.

556
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,849
Naturally,

557
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,641
I want to be with him.

558
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,960
Besides,

559
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,129
I didn't say

560
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,799
Miss Shen is going

561
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,649
to marry into
the Duke Zhenguo Residence immediately.

562
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,210
-Yang Zong, you...
-All right, I'll stop.

563
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:30,561
Let's talk about the main issue.

564
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,450
Previously, you asked me

565
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:32,490
about the bangle.

566
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,899
We searched
the entire Magistrate Office.

567
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,770
But we didn't find it.

568
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:35,450
Are you sure

569
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:36,210
you were wearing it

570
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,200
when you entered the Office?

571
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:38,601
Yes, I'm sure I was wearing it.

572
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:42,089
Now, that's really odd.

573
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,081
Master couldn't figure out
what happened either.

574
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,770
It's all right.

575
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,321
I'll ask Master again when I return.

576
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,641
Now that I've delivered your things,

577
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,960
I shall take my leave, then.

578
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,569
It's only nearby.

579
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,200
Can't he stop by

580
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,210
just to visit me for a little while?

581
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:00,920
Unbelievable.

582
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:03,920
Miss.

583
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:06,250
It has only been a day.

584
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:07,210
Are you that eager

585
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,369
for him to come?

586
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,041
Qingxi, are you teasing me too?

587
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:16,121
This is...

588
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,129
Official Lu hid in the chest.

589
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,121
Really?

590
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,121
He finally has come to his senses.

591
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:26,810
It was Lu Shiyan
who captured Zhao Chong?

592
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,641
Yes.

593
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:29,099
It was also Lu Shiyan

594
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,369
who took the initiative to travel
to Wuzhou to capture Zhao Chong.

595
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,409
He traveled to Wuzhou

596
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,290
to search for Shen Wenqi's
construction plans.

597
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,920
Coincidentally, the painting
where the plans were hidden within

598
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:38,841
was snatched away by Zhao Chong.

599
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,161
Along the way, it was discovered

600
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:44,369
that Zhao Chong was also
the mastermind behind the logging case.

601
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,690
So he got close to him

602
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:48,280
and arrested him.

603
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,169
Why are you showing me this?

604
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,450
Zhao Chong was killed
in the Magistrate Office.

605
00:33:00,451 --> 00:33:02,680
I found this on him.

606
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,889
The person it refers to

607
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,490
should be his killer,

608
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:06,369
who is also

609
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,000
the mastermind behind our two cases.

610
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:18,161
"Eldest?"

611
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,810
Why did you hide

612
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:25,129
such important evidence?

613
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,280
Let me explain.

614
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,450
In the capital,

615
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:28,810
who holds a high position

616
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:31,161
and carries the title "Eldest?"

617
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:33,081
Lu Shiyan's mother,

618
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,450
the Eldest Princess.

619
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:35,240
Exactly.

620
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,490
On the day of the murder,

621
00:33:36,491 --> 00:33:37,770
I went to Cheng Garden to find Zhen.

622
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:39,299
It was Lu Shiyan who insisted

623
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,050
that Zhen go to the Magistrate Office
at that time.

624
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:42,849
There was indeed a sudden situation
at that time.

625
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,089
Perhaps Official Lu was trying

626
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,250
to protect Miss Shen.

627
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:46,409
How can you be sure

628
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,929
he wasn't trying to cover up for his mother

629
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,801
and deliberately frame someone?

630
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:51,290
That's why

631
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,041
I hid the evidence at that time.

632
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:55,240
With just one piece of evidence,

633
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:57,450
it's not enough to imprison him.

634
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,089
That's why we need
to investigate further.

635
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,450
This is what I'll do.

636
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:02,500
I'll investigate the private army
and weapon forging case.

637
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:04,010
Official Zhou,
you oversee the officials.

638
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:06,520
So I'll leave Lu Shiyan to you.

639
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,960
All right.

640
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,800
This case is of great importance.

641
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:12,840
Only the two of us know about it.

642
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,320
Official Zhou, you must remember this.

643
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,001
Don't worry, Commandant Su.

644
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,041
I shall take my leave.

645
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,049
How did Shen Zhen's bangle

646
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,800
go missing?

647
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,009
After the court official
killed Zhao Chong,

648
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,880
he didn't leave the Magistrate Office.

649
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:41,800
Why is the corner

650
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,041
of Zhao Chong's clothing missing
for no reason?

651
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,961
Did Zhao Chong intentionally
leave behind some information,

652
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:51,200
but it was taken by someone?

653
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,760
Yang Zong.

654
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,680
Yes, sir.

655
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,800
Thoroughly investigate everyone
in the office.

656
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,921
I suspect there is a second mule.

657
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:05,880
I always feel

658
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,441
that the other party not only wants
to silence these people.

659
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,441
Understood.

660
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,840
Master.

661
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,300
(Shen Zhen's Brief Introduction)

662
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,600
(Shen Zhen, born in the capital,
20 years old)

663
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:23,521
Don't worry.

664
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,840
I won't let anything happen to you.

665
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,290
(Who holds a high position)

666
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,601
(and carries the title "Eldest"?)

667
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,049
(How can you be sure)

668
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,570
(he wasn't trying to cover up
for his mother)

669
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:45,441
(and deliberately frame someone?)

670
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,441
Sir.

671
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:57,001
In the West Canal case,

672
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,161
Official Lu has been working tirelessly.

673
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,810
This doesn't seem like he's...

674
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:01,601
Chu Yi,

675
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:06,081
we must not be misled by appearances
in our investigations.

676
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,921
We only believe in evidence.

677
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,161
Now that the evidence points
in a certain direction,

678
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:13,720
we must investigate.

679
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,720
But remember,

680
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,730
what's truly real cannot be faked,

681
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:21,641
and what's fake cannot be true.

682
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,760
Understood.

683
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,969
Official Lu, please wait for a moment.

684
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,610
Young Master will be back shortly.

685
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,041
Please excuse me.

686
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,320
Lu Shiyan.

687
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:43,601
Zhen.

688
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:45,210
Qingxi told me you're here.

689
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,529
So I came to see you.

690
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,081
I wanted to come and see you too.

691
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,290
Do you have any urgent matters

692
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,489
with Su Heng?

693
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,081
Don't call him so intimately.

694
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,521
Are you jealous?

695
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,001
By the way,

696
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,250
I have important news.

697
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:07,290
I just received confirmation
from the palace.

698
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,849
The Emperor said
your father will be released tomorrow.

699
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,001
Really?

700
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:12,049
Then I must go with Ran

701
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,481
to pick Father up.

702
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:16,290
If you're not busy,

703
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,329
do you want to come along?

704
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,561
Sure.

705
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,921
For you.

706
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,521
I thought there were no flowers today.

707
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,840
As long as you like it.

708
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,929
Official Lu, your visiting manner

709
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,561
is indeed special.

710
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:47,090
I came as an Imperial Inspector

711
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:49,240
to ask you some questions.

712
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,641
Does this look like
you're doing official duty?

713
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:57,049
Don't always use work

714
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,200
as an excuse.

715
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,360
You can always talk things out nicely.

716
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,489
Su Heng,

717
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,889
Official Lu has important matters

718
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,880
to discuss with you.

719
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:14,369
Let's sit down and talk.

720
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,441
Let's sit down and talk.

721
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,641
Then I'll get some pastries for you.

722
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:26,601
Have a seat.

723
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,680
Regardless of what you think,

724
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,770
it's the responsibility
of the Magistrate Office.

725
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:39,849
Please cooperate with me

726
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,441
and answer a few questions.

727
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,570
Just ask

728
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:43,641
whatever you want.

729
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:46,041
When you arrived at the scene,

730
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:48,090
did you find anything

731
00:38:48,091 --> 00:38:49,360
on Zhao Chong?

732
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:50,921
No.

733
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:54,170
I only confirmed
whether he was still alive.

734
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:57,161
Then the court officials arrived.

735
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,049
Did you notice Zhen's

736
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,441
bangle anywhere at that time?

737
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,041
I didn't notice.

738
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,481
Official Lu, do you have
any more questions?

739
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:09,610
If you do,

740
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:10,969
you can ask me anytime.

741
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,320
But please do not enter the mansion
without permission.

742
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:14,969
After all, Zhen

743
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,840
is my fiancée.

744
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,680
We will marry

745
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,290
once Uncle Shen is released from prison.

746
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,400
Official Lu,

747
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,601
please don't overstep your boundaries.

748
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:25,409
This marriage

749
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,929
was a joke during childhood.

750
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,290
Why take it seriously?

751
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,489
It has been customary for parents
to arrange marriages

752
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,730
since ancient times.

753
00:39:31,731 --> 00:39:33,500
Matters of the heart are like water,

754
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,049
one knows best
whether it's warm or cold.

755
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,529
While parents' thoughts are important,

756
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,570
but ultimately,

757
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:39,570
it's about respecting the wishes

758
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:41,121
of the individuals involved.

759
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:43,650
Treat others as you would like
to be treated.

760
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:45,090
If General Su arranged your marriage

761
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:45,770
with a woman

762
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:47,521
who's not suitable for you,

763
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,730
you wouldn't be happy either.

764
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:52,200
Do you think this is the truth?

765
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:53,730
But Zhen

766
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:55,290
whom my father chose for me

767
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:56,210
is very suitable.

768
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:57,760
Why wouldn't I be happy?

769
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,280
Enough said.

770
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,210
I

771
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:02,921
don't need to talk to you
about these matters.

772
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,090
This is between the Su

773
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:05,170
and the Shen families.

774
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:06,320
Official Lu,

775
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,280
if you have no more questions,

776
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:10,760
please leave.

777
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:17,601
You're done talking?

778
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:20,641
I'll meet you
at the Imperial Censorate's entrance.

779
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:23,840
I'll get going now.

780
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,760
Zhen,

781
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:32,250
you're still young and inexperienced.

782
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:33,489
Many things

783
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,610
cannot be judged

784
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:35,800
by appearances.

785
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,481
Official Lu.

786
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,250
What's the matter, Mrs. Li?

787
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,130
Thank you

788
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:04,760
for saving Zhen from danger.

789
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:05,840
I know

790
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,449
things are not as simple

791
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,449
as Zhen said.

792
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,161
I'm very grateful.

793
00:41:10,162 --> 00:41:11,390
There's no need for much ceremony.

794
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:13,240
This is my duty.

795
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:14,849
You have done a great favor

796
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,880
to the Shen family.

797
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,400
We are grateful.

798
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,641
But regarding Father's matter,

799
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,409
Zhen has already experienced

800
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,760
too much suffering.

801
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:26,001
The Shen family

802
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:27,170
doesn't want

803
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:28,610
to be involved in any power struggles

804
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,001
or deceitful schemes.

805
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,200
I ask you

806
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,529
to let Zhen live a peaceful life.

807
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,489
I can definitely

808
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,001
protect Zhen.

809
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,489
Zhen is just a commoner

810
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,200
and it's hard to befriend
those of high status.

811
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,240
It's better to end things

812
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,360
before your relationship deepens,

813
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,449
to avoid difficulties for both of you

814
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,001
in the end.

815
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,320
As long as Zhen loves me

816
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:55,601
and I love Zhen,

817
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,161
I will continue on this path

818
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:00,240
even if I have to kneel

819
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:02,921
all the way.

820
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,800
I understand your feelings.

821
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,961
But this is the answer
from the Shen family.

822
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:12,880
I have said enough.

823
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:15,320
I hope you'll think
about this thoroughly.

824
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:34,969
Why isn't he coming out yet?

825
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,770
He should be out soon.

826
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:37,690
-Let's wait a bit longer.
-They are already waiting.

827
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:39,441
Thank you, Official Zhou.

828
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,369
Zhen. Ran.

829
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,720
- Father!
- Father!

830
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:49,009
Father.

831
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,081
Zhen. Ran.

832
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:53,121
Father.

833
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:57,449
Father.

834
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,690
Zhen, Ran.

835
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:03,240
I can finally see you all.

836
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,481
Father.

837
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:12,880
Father,

838
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,641
are you okay?

839
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:17,170
Ah, yes.

840
00:43:17,171 --> 00:43:18,921
Have you recovered?

841
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,161
Thanks to Official Zhou's care,

842
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,880
I'm fully recovered.

843
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:29,400
Official Lu,

844
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,650
Official Zhou told me

845
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,449
that it was thanks
to your full protection

846
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,329
that

847
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,840
my beloved daughter Zhen's
life was saved.

848
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,200
I...

849
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:41,770
- Father!
- Father!

850
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:42,650
Please get up.

851
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:43,130
Father.

852
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:44,720
You're overwhelming us.

853
00:43:45,811 --> 00:43:48,280
I was imprisoned.

854
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,690
It was both of you

855
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:51,641
who protected my family's safety.

856
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:54,130
Now, I can see the light of day again.

857
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,529
It's also thanks to both of you
for solving this case.

858
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,360
I'll remember

859
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,730
this great kindness in my heart.

860
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:03,489
Minister Shen, you're too kind.

861
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,290
Official Zhou and I
were just doing our duty.

862
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:06,500
You were not guilty, to begin with.

863
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:07,969
It was our limited ability

864
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,329
that caused you to suffer.

865
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,760
We are truly ashamed.

866
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:11,961
Oh, no.

867
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,369
Please don't address me
as Minister Shen anymore.

868
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,889
I am now just a commoner.

869
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,210
If both of you

870
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:20,449
don't mind,

871
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,130
you can call me

872
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:23,449
Uncle Shen.

873
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,921
- Uncle Shen.
- Uncle Shen.

874
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:38,210
Official Zhou. Official Lu.

875
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:40,929
Father has just been released from prison
and has not eaten a full meal yet.

876
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,449
If you don't mind,

877
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,400
we'll come to thank you another day.

878
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,130
There's no time like the present.

879
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:48,290
I'm sure both of you are hungry too.

880
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:49,210
If you don't mind,

881
00:44:49,211 --> 00:44:51,690
you can come to my house for a meal.

882
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:52,449
Yes,

883
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,561
let's have a meal together.

884
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:55,250
I'm afraid we're not able
to host you well

885
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:56,369
and disrespect both of you.

886
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,449
I eat very little.

887
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,921
I don't eat much either.

888
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,449
I can cook.

889
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,240
Father, let's go home.

890
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,760
All right.

891
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,840
You can go back first.

892
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:08,360
Official Zhou.

893
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,070
I was planning to go to your place
to get some ointment for my wounds.

894
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:14,140
Coincidentally,
I was invited for a home-cooked meal.

895
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,670
How can I not go?

896
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,550
Don't you agree?

897
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:18,660
Uncle Shen, let me help you walk.
