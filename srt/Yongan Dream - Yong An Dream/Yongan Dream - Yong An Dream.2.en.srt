(Imperial Censorate)

19
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,682
Luckily, the prison guards
reached him on time

20
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:51,873
when they heard the commotion.

21
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:53,403
He's out of danger for now.

22
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:55,793
How long until he's awake?

23
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:57,883
Official Zhou,

24
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,844
I can't tell.

25
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:03,644
Only fate can determine
Official Shen's fate now.

26
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:04,882
Where's the perpetrator?

27
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:05,644
He took his life.

28
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,564
We found a letter.

29
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:08,924
It's said that his family died

30
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,444
in the collapse of the West Canal.

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,084
So he came to seek revenge
on Shen Wenqi.

32
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,044
How he managed to sneak

33
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:15,364
into the prison

34
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,884
is still uncertain.

35
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:21,604
Official Zhou,

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,764
Shen Wenqi's eldest daughter,
Shen Ran, is here.

37
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:26,644
Sir,

38
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:28,044
we're here to visit Shen Wenqi.

39
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,603
Shen Wenqi is not allowed any visitors.

40
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:29,963
Leave.

41
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,044
Why?

42
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:33,963
Don't you know how many people died

43
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,243
in the West Canal's collapse?

44
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:37,674
I can't believe you want
to visit the criminal.

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,750
- Why you...
- Just leave.

46
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:39,723
How dare you.

47
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:40,834
What did you say?

48
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,644
As a court officer,

49
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:45,204
you dare to abuse your power.

50
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:46,924
What law gives you the right

51
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:48,843
to obstruct visitation?

52
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:50,084
Also, my father

53
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,283
is a high-ranking official

54
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,884
and has not been dismissed
from his title.

55
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:54,599
You dare to criticize a senior official
without justification.

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,520
Do you know your crime?

57
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,523
So based on your reasons,

58
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:01,403
how should this court officer
be punished?

59
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,484
Sir...

60
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,164
You are...

61
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,963
Zhou Shu'an, the Vice Censor-in-chief.

62
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,243
Greetings, Official Zhou.

63
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:21,764
Miss Li,

64
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:23,164
do tell me

65
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:26,123
how should the court officer
be punished?

66
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,003
Fifteen strokes

67
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:30,884
or six months' salary

68
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:32,283
as a warning to others.

69
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:33,563
Chuyi.

70
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:34,764
Yes, sir.

71
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:36,120
Did you hear that?

72
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:36,884
Yes.

73
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:38,123
Take him away.

74
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:39,963
Sir!

75
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:41,164
Sir!

76
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:42,924
Have mercy, sir!

77
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:43,764
Sir!

78
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:49,243
Official Zhou,

79
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:52,003
I came here today

80
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:53,243
to inquire

81
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:54,604
about my father's case.

82
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:56,324
No comment.

83
00:03:58,243 --> 00:03:59,604
May I visit my father

84
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:00,884
and bring him some medicine?

85
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,003
The West Canal collapse case is complex.

86
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,084
No one can visit,

87
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,084
especially close family.

88
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:11,484
My father is ill.

89
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,764
Can you make an exception?

90
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,603
I only want to send this medicine.

91
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:18,603
No exceptions.

92
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,124
Just this time.

93
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,163
If it was only a birthday gift,

94
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,084
why did Father give it to me secretly?

95
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,483
Why not tell me?

96
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:04,923
What did I miss?

97
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:13,483
(Why won't it open?)

98
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:14,530
(Safe Number Five, Six, Seven, Eight.)

99
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:16,244
(There's no safe number 39 here.)

100
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:18,163
But Official Shen's things

101
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:19,644
are clearly stored here.

102
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:23,084
Could Father have something else
hidden there?

103
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,644
I'm such a fool. Why was I so careless?

104
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:26,884
Qingxi!

105
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,403
Qingxi!

106
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:29,804
Yes, Miss.

107
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,483
Father still has something there.

108
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,363
At Jin Money House.

109
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:33,084
Let's go.

110
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,363
Official Lu?

111
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:43,114
What's the meaning of this?

112
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:43,804
Search!

113
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:44,764
Stop!

114
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,154
What gives you the right to search?

115
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:49,482
The Magistrate Office is conducting
a search according to law.

116
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,563
We need to investigate
all physical evidence related

117
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:52,403
to Shen Wenqi's case.

118
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:53,403
Search!

119
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:55,760
No, wait...

120
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:00,884
Fine.

121
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,203
You can search all you want.

122
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:02,963
I'm in a rush.

123
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:09,124
Give it to me.

124
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:13,244
The scented sachet.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,482
I don't think it's appropriate
since it's a personal belonging.

126
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,923
We must examine everything thoroughly,

127
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,124
nothing excluded.

128
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:43,444
Official Lu, are you done?

129
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:44,684
Search her.

130
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,180
Official Lu, you're being disrespectful.

131
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,483
What are you looking for?

132
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,084
Don't you think you're going too far?

133
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:50,683
That's right.

134
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:51,723
In front of everyone,

135
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:52,923
a group of men trying

136
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:53,603
to shame

137
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:54,603
the Young Miss.

138
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:55,843
Come in.

139
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,483
Search her.

140
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:01,324
Yes, sir,

141
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:02,764
Miss, come this way.

142
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:06,124
Miss Shen, don't be too angry.

143
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:07,722
During an investigation,

144
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,363
personal feelings must be put aside.

145
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:10,564
But look,

146
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:12,723
Official Lu is still being considerate.

147
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,162
He fears you might be inconvenienced.

148
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:15,644
So he specially called me here.

149
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:16,603
Does that mean

150
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:18,084
I have to thank him?

151
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:23,723
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:25,603
I'm not angry at you.

153
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,444
It doesn't matter.

154
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:29,884
This is the first time

155
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:32,523
I've heard of a female officer working
for the Magistrate Office.

156
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:33,283
Well,

157
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:34,523
I'm afraid only our office

158
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,320
has female officers.

159
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:36,644
Official Lu said

160
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:38,563
that both men and women
have their strengths.

161
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:39,764
As long as they're willing

162
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:41,363
and pass the assessment,

163
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,004
they can work here

164
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:45,043
to earn a living.

165
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,523
I never expected him

166
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:50,444
to have such a thought.

167
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,963
The people always say

168
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:55,444
that our office is tough and harsh.

169
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:56,764
But they don't know much.

170
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:58,403
If we weren't like this,

171
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,603
how could we control those criminals

172
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:02,244
and protect the people's safety?

173
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,283
Do your job seriously.

174
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:06,684
Yes, sir.

175
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,043
That doesn't stop me from disliking him.

176
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:20,204
Miss!

177
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,564
Sir, I found nothing.

178
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,363
Sir, we found nothing.

179
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:25,923
Official Lu,

180
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,324
are you satisfied?

181
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:28,324
Leave.

182
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:29,043
Official Lu,

183
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:30,884
you've forgotten

184
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:32,204
one thing.

185
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:34,843
It's not proper to take things

186
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,164
from the people.

187
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,363
Or

188
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:42,363
is this thing important evidence

189
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:44,390
that needs to be submitted
to the Imperial Censorate?

190
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:07,684
Miss,

191
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:09,123
aren't we leaving now?

192
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:09,963
Wait.

193
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,482
I fear his actions just now showed

194
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,163
that he found out

195
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:13,603
I was hiding Father's things.

196
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:16,034
We'll wait until they're further.

197
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:19,804
So,

198
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,524
is everything here?

199
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,204
Yes, madam.

200
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:23,444
All right, move them.

201
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:24,963
Stop.

202
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:30,524
Mother,

203
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,564
what are you doing with my dowry?

204
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:34,243
I'm doing this

205
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:36,164
in case your sister comes
to see you again.

206
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,443
When it comes to relationships,

207
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,164
you'll have to chip in some, right?

208
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,963
So let me keep them for you.

209
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,763
You can tell her
that I'm managing it now.

210
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:43,284
That way,

211
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:44,580
not only you won't offend her,

212
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:46,123
but you can also still keep your dowry.

213
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:47,483
Zhen is my sister.

214
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:48,763
If she needs it,

215
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:50,003
I'll definitely help her.

216
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,363
If you help her,

217
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:54,084
it'll cost a shop.

218
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:55,044
Our Li Residence

219
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:56,603
can't afford such extravagance.

220
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:57,883
That's my shop.

221
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:59,443
I didn't touch the Li family's money.

222
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:00,883
Why would you say that?

223
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:02,564
You and Li Di are husband and wife.

224
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,564
There's no need to divide
what's yours and his.

225
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:06,603
Mother,

226
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:08,804
put my dowry back,

227
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:10,643
and I'll pretend nothing happened.

228
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,123
Back then,

229
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:15,643
I was an illiterate woman

230
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:16,763
from a humble family.

231
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,684
I worked hard in the cold winter

232
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:19,843
to wash clothes for others

233
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,284
to support Li Di's education.

234
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:22,763
Now,

235
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:23,643
I've finally earned

236
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:25,284
some peace and happiness.

237
00:10:25,404 --> 00:10:26,603
But your family runs

238
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,404
into such a huge trouble.

239
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:29,643
I have to consider

240
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,204
the Li Residence's interest, right?

241
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,034
I understand your situation.

242
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:34,524
So I ask you to understand mine too.

243
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:36,003
Helping each other

244
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:37,404
is what family is about.

245
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,044
You've married into our family.

246
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:41,044
So we're a family.

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,284
We'll discuss this further
when my husband returns later.

248
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,723
Why do you want him to come back?

249
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,482
Isn't it enough
that your father was arrested?

250
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,980
Do you want my son to be arrested too?

251
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:52,363
Listen here.

252
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,044
My son has studied hard for many years.

253
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:54,723
I cannot allow

254
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,444
your Shen family to ruin him.

255
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:58,404
Move! Move! Move everything!

256
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,204
Do not move them.

257
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:02,243
Old Madam.

258
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:03,404
You...

259
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:05,284
How dare you push me?

260
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:09,684
Is there no justice left?

261
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,723
You...

262
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:11,444
Mother.

263
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:12,123
You...

264
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:13,804
I respect you as an elder.

265
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:16,204
Back then, the Li family had nothing.

266
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:17,524
It is my dowry

267
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,203
that the Li family enjoys such grandeur.

268
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:20,750
Now that the Shen family is in trouble,

269
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,524
you want to distance yourself.

270
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:24,284
Is that reasonable?

271
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:25,324
You're...

272
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:26,404
I...

273
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,843
Move all my dowry back where it belongs,

274
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,204
every single one of them.

275
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:36,084
Move them.

276
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:37,164
Move them now!

277
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:39,963
You're...

278
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:42,284
You...

279
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:44,003
Old Madam.

280
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,220
(Li Residence)

281
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:49,444
Son!

282
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,843
Oh, Son.

283
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:53,564
My son.

284
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,723
You're finally home.

285
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:57,204
Mother, what happened to you?

286
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,324
Are you all right?

287
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:00,643
It's your wife's fault.

288
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,723
She pushed me.

289
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:03,723
Pushed you?

290
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:05,243
How's that possible?

291
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:07,564
You don't believe me?

292
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:08,044
I...

293
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,204
When the Shen family was in trouble,

294
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,163
she went to take a look.

295
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,324
So that's understandable.

296
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:13,324
But she started

297
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:14,723
giving out things

298
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:16,123
from the house.

299
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:18,524
It's the whole shop, you see.

300
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:21,243
She refused to listen to my advice.

301
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:22,044
She even...

302
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,444
I can't believe she actually pushed me.

303
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:25,524
Look at my foot.

304
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:26,243
That's right.

305
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,123
I'm still limping

306
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,524
until now.

307
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:29,363
She pushed you?

308
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:31,243
This...

309
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:31,804
It hurts.

310
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,722
This part hurts?

311
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:34,324
The physician came to check on her.

312
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:35,324
It's quite serious.

313
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,722
It won't heal in a couple of months.

314
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,842
Did you say a couple of months?

315
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:38,564
It's that serious?

316
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,284
Son...

317
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,044
Mother, please calm down.

318
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:44,444
Take these snacks.

319
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:45,284
Take them.

320
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,804
Why did you spend money on these?

321
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,164
It's because you like them.

322
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,363
You must have suffered a lot.

323
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:52,394
How about this?

324
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:53,804
I'll go back and talk to her.

325
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:56,444
Yes, you should.

326
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:58,524
You must scold her severely.

327
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:00,324
The Shen family has fallen anyway.

328
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:01,963
We have nothing to fear anymore.

329
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:04,003
Mother, don't say that.

330
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,723
Help Old Madam back to rest.

331
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:06,164
Yes.

332
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:07,924
Let's go back to my room.

333
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:09,963
You must show

334
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,603
your authority as the husband.

335
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:12,763
Criticize her harshly.

336
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,900
Yes, I'll do it right away.

337
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:15,044
Let's go.

338
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:17,060
Old Madam, you...

339
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:18,564
You have to be careful.

340
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:20,763
Walk slowly.

341
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:23,483
That hurts.

342
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
- It really hurts.
- It's hurting again?

343
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:26,804
Yes.

344
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:27,524
Come.

345
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:29,324
Not too fast.

346
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:30,643
- It hurts.
- Be careful.

347
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:45,164
Ran.

348
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:47,243
Dear.

349
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:48,363
Ran.

350
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:49,284
Dear,

351
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:50,643
any news?

352
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,523
How's Father doing at the Censorate?

353
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:53,444
I wanted to visit him.

354
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:54,643
But they won't let me in.

355
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:56,002
The collapse of the West Canal

356
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:56,923
was a serious disaster.

357
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:58,564
The Emperor takes it very seriously.

358
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,122
He has ordered the Imperial Censorate

359
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,399
and the Magistrate's Office
to investigate it together.

360
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:03,963
You must believe in Father.

361
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,723
The construction plans
can never be wrong.

362
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,962
After everything is investigated,
he will definitely return home.

363
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:08,564
Yes, I agree.

364
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,684
Father's construction plans
cannot be wrong.

365
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,924
But the problem now is

366
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,164
that the construction plans are missing.

367
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:18,044
How could such an important thing
go missing?

368
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,123
There's something suspicious about this.

369
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:21,404
Sit down.

370
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:24,883
Ran.

371
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,003
Do you know
if Father has any other drafts

372
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:28,843
besides these construction plans?

373
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,444
Father never mentioned
anything about it.

374
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,603
That's going to be troublesome.

375
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:35,723
The officers have searched
everywhere for them.

376
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:37,044
What do we do now?

377
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,044
But don't worry,

378
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,603
the case is not settled yet.

379
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:44,643
Justice will prevail.

380
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,643
Father will be fine.

381
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,770
Only, he'll have
to suffer a little for now.

382
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,883
How about I'll write a letter

383
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:51,923
to Uncle Su in Jizhou.

384
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,180
Let's see if he can help Father.

385
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:53,683
All right.

386
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,953
I'll send it out urgently.

387
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:56,643
How's Zhen?

388
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:57,883
She must be scared.

389
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,204
I've settled her down.

390
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:01,284
So don't worry.

391
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:05,883
About what happened just now,

392
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,003
I know about it.

393
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,434
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

394
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:10,524
But

395
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:11,564
I'll always

396
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,924
be on your side.

397
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,324
With your words,

398
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:21,483
I no longer feel any grievances.

399
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:22,963
All right.

400
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,084
We're still family.

401
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:27,193
So living in harmony matters the most.

402
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,564
Mr. Jin!

403
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:39,324
Why are you back here again?

404
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:40,404
Didn't you say

405
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:41,883
Official Shen's things

406
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:43,404
are stored here that day?

407
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:44,603
That means

408
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:46,554
Father still has other things
being stored here.

409
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:47,564
I remember

410
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:48,723
it was safe number eight.

411
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,763
Did I say that?

412
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:52,963
Yes, you did.

413
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:55,324
You, brat.

414
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:56,963
You have no manners.

415
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:58,084
Give it back to me, brat!

416
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,843
Found it! Locker number eight.

417
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,843
(Storage Number Eight)
Take me to retrieve it.

418
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:03,483
Follow me.

419
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,044
No manners.

422
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:28,754
What's the matter?

423
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:29,963
Come on.

424
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:05,044
Mr. Jin. Mr. Jin?

425
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:08,643
Mr. Jin.

426
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:11,004
Mr. Jin?

427
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,524
Help me unlock it, Mr. Jin.

428
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:29,203
Ran's sandalwood blend?

429
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:42,324
How did the fire break out?

430
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:50,443
Master,

431
00:17:50,764 --> 00:17:52,923
could it be your imagination?

432
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:54,764
Do you think I imagine it

433
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:55,683
when I'm in pain?

434
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:57,123
Well, no.

435
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,163
That was indeed

436
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,564
a real pain.

437
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,163
The woman in my dream carries
the same perfume sachet as her.

438
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,922
Before I met her,
I had never seen it before.

439
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:05,083
How could I dream of it then?

440
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,004
She stabbed me in the first nightmare.

441
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:09,324
After that, it was constant nightmares.

442
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:11,244
Also, feeling pain in my heart

443
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:13,324
is like...

444
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:16,484
The moment she cries,

445
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,244
I'll feel pain in my heart.

446
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,843
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

447
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:25,683
Look!

448
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:26,843

449
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:27,764

452
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:32,724
It's Jin Money House again.

453
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:33,882
I'll go and check it out.
Call for reinforcement.

454
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:34,284
Yes, sir.

455
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,724
You wretched woman.
How dare you stab me.

456
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:02,804
Go ahead and run!

457
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,004
Miss!

458
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,284
- Let me go!
- It's dangerous!

459
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,603
Miss is inside!

460
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:15,483
- It's dangerous inside!
- Let me go!

00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:16,083
You can't go inside!

My father's things are inside.

479
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,203
Step aside.

480
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:37,764
It's empty. There's nothing here.

481
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:40,284
Let's go!

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,443
Is there anything you want to tell me?

484
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,284
Thank you for saving my life.

485
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:53,603
You never learn.

486
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:56,244
Tell me.

487
00:20:57,084 --> 00:20:59,244
Why did you go to Jin Money House again?

488
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:03,044
What's inside safe number eight?

489
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:04,484
I...

490
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,203
Do you not trust the Magistrate Office

491
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,363
or do you think you're more capable?

492
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:16,284
Get out!

493
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:18,724
Do you want me

494
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:19,642
to take your Miss

495
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:21,713
back and interrogate her
at the Magistrate Office?

496
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:23,084
Don't worry.

497
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:24,643
Master won't hurt her.

498
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:25,443
Please leave.

499
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,524
Do you think you can save your father

500
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:32,964
with your ability?

501
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:37,203
Do you also think
that my father was framed?

502
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,363
I only believe the truth.

503
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,484
Before getting to the truth,

504
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:43,443
I never make any rash judgment.

505
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:45,044
Then tell me

506
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:46,724
how much you know about the truth.

507
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:50,163
If you don't tell me,

508
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,564
I won't tell you anything.

509
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,314
Are you trying to strike a deal here?

510
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,443
In your father's study,

511
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:01,363
there are all the details he surveyed
for the West Canal,

512
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:02,724
as well as some sketches.

513
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:04,643
I have had someone verify the details.

514
00:22:04,764 --> 00:22:07,203
The details are very detailed
and accurate.

515
00:22:07,443 --> 00:22:08,564
It shows that your father

516
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,363
is a meticulous person.

517
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,922
According to his construction plans,

518
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:13,363
the West Canal

519
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:15,643
should not be so fragile.

520
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:16,724
However,

521
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:20,643
we never found
the finalized construction plans.

522
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:21,724
Construction plans?

523
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,094
Did your father leave you clues
about the construction plans

524
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:25,484
being stored at Jin Money House?

525
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:27,524
He only gave me the key to the safe.

526
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:29,324
But I don't know

527
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:30,324
if what's inside

528
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:31,843
is related to the case.

529
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:32,964
That's it.

530
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,123
Why was the safe empty?

531
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:38,564
Who took the things beforehand?

532
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:42,324
I suspect it was the Earl of Suning.

533
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:45,084
Did you see him?

534
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:47,284
But I smell a scent.

535
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:48,843
Before the fire broke out,

536
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:50,284
he left with a box in his arms.

537
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:53,683
His body had the scent of the fragrance
my sister personally blended.

538
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,163
You recognized him by this scent?

539
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:57,524
My sister carefully blended
the sandalwood scent.

540
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,643
It's only one of its kind.

541
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,723
I've been sensitive to smells
since I was a child.

542
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:01,883
It's no mistake.

543
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,523
So, is that the reason

544
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:06,600
you threw away the scented sachet
touched by others?

545
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:12,964
At that time,

546
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:15,004
I found you hateful.

547
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:16,324
Shen Zhen,

548
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:18,883
you're truly frank.

549
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:19,764
Sir,

550
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:21,123
according to what you said,

551
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:23,883
the things my father left
in the money house

552
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:26,004
are most likely
those construction plans.

553
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:27,203
And I am sure

554
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:29,324
it was the Earl of Suning who took them.

555
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:32,203
If you hurry to raid and search,

556
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:33,284
you'll surely find them.

557
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,843
The Earl Suning Residence
is a third-rank Earl's residence.

558
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,284
If I go and search

559
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:38,724
without real evidence,

560
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:41,244
I'm afraid I'll lose
my official position.

561
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:42,764
Then I have another way.

562
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:45,724
My aunt wanted

563
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:47,883
to send me away before.

564
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,084
I suspect the people who tried to kidnap
me today had the same goal.

565
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:52,643
If I go

566
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,683
to his residence

567
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:54,804
to find him,

568
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:56,643
they'll surely keep me there.

569
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:58,883
By then, I can search
for the construction plans.

570
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:00,804
The Earl of Suning Residence is huge.

571
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:02,003
How can you search

572
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:03,443
for things in the box

573
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:06,044
and get them to me?

574
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,244
I am afraid you might be doomed

575
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,804
before you manage to find the plans.

576
00:24:10,923 --> 00:24:12,044
But that is my father.

577
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,723
Even if there is only one small chance,

578
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:15,044
I will not give up.

579
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,244
Even if you don't help me,

580
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:21,403
I will still go

581
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,524
and pretend to agree
to my aunt's conditions

582
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:26,122
while waiting for the opportunity
to search for the things in the box.

583
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:27,123
If I'm discovered,

584
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:28,834
it'll be difficult for me to escape.

585
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:29,923
I ask that you pretend

586
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:31,564
nothing has happened.

587
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:32,843
But if I'm lucky enough

588
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:34,603
to find the things in the box,

589
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:37,843
please handle it fairly.

590
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:38,764
All right.

591
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:41,084
I agree.

592
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:44,764
But under one condition.

593
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:46,443
What is it?

594
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:54,244
I want you to cry.

595
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:56,484
Cry?

596
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:57,724
Don't ask why.

597
00:24:58,324 --> 00:24:58,923
Cry.

598
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,324
I can't.

599
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:10,603
Just imagine

600
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:12,044
if I didn't arrive

601
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:14,843
in time just now,

602
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,403
you would be caught by those men

603
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:23,484
and handed over to him.

604
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:25,443
At the same time,

605
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,203
you lost the clue
to the construction plans.

606
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:30,004
Then your father...

607
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:40,324
Stop! Stop crying now!

608
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,004
I'll save your father.

609
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,203
You must keep your word.

610
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,363
I'll wait outside
the Earl Suning Residence.

611
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,484
If you've found what's in the box,

612
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:14,044
use this to send a signal to me.

613
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:15,953
Then I'll enter and search
the residence.

614
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:29,564
You're back.

615
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:30,883
What's in your hand?

616
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:33,524
Did you know the money house

617
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,244
still stores Shen Wenqi's things?

618
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,362
Sister-in-law's belongings?

619
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:37,643
I've known for a while now.

620
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,643
What's wrong?

621
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:40,190
He even kept the construction plans!

622
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:42,923
Why are you venting it on me?

623
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,890
Many people store their things
at the money house.

624
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:46,914
How am I supposed
to know everything he stored?

625
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,883
Yes, blame it all on your ignorance.

626
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:54,123
Look what happened now.

627
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:55,603
The money house is gone.

628
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:57,324
What happened?

629
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,083
I was ordered to retrieve

630
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,890
the construction plans
Shen Wenqi left behind.

631
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,163
Then I started a fire

632
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,764
and burned down my own shop.

633
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:05,964
You could've just taken it out.

634
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,643
Why did you burn the shop down?

635
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:09,683
I cannot leave any trace behind.

636
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,683
Even your niece noticed something.

637
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,883
She went to the money house.

638
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:15,923
Zhen?

639
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:17,284
What happened after that?

640
00:27:21,284 --> 00:27:23,403
I can say it's a blessing in disguise.

641
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:27,163
At this moment,

642
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:28,643
she's probably arriving

643
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,363
at Deputy Minister Xu's place now.

644
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:32,964
Master, Madam.

645
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,244
Miss Shen is here.

646
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,564
Aunt.

647
00:27:39,484 --> 00:27:40,163
Let me see.

648
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,203
How did this happen?

649
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:41,923
Aunt,

650
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:43,843
it was my fault for disobeying you.

651
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:46,244
When I heard you told Uncle

652
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,883
to send me to a man,

653
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:49,084
so I...

654
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:50,603
I panicked.

655
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,284
That's why I ran away.

656
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:53,484
Today,

657
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,643
some bad people almost kidnapped me

658
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:58,084
and died in a fire.

659
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,484
Only then do I realize

660
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:01,883
you're doing it for my sake.

661
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:03,804
Father is in prison.

662
00:28:04,203 --> 00:28:04,843
I'm just a girl

663
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,843
without anyone to depend on.

664
00:28:07,324 --> 00:28:08,964
If Father is convicted,

665
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:11,363
no one will want me anymore.

666
00:28:12,403 --> 00:28:14,163
Others will be trampling all over me.

667
00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:14,764
Zhen,

668
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,923
where did you meet those bad people?

669
00:28:17,324 --> 00:28:18,484
At Jin Money House.

670
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:19,683
I was wondering

671
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:21,564
why a fire broke out at the money house.

672
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,324
Uncle, don't be mad.

673
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:25,843
It was my fault.

674
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:28,123
Stop talking about it already.

675
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,000
Zhen is still shaken by this incident.

676
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,729
If the money house has burned down,
then so be it.

677
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,244
Besides, Zhen may not be the reason

678
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:34,643
those bad people came.

679
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:36,244
That's not what I meant.

680
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:37,603
I just wonder

681
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:39,923
how could the money house catch fire?

682
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:41,244
That's enough.

683
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:44,004
Zhen,

684
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,044
I'm doing this for your sake.

685
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,643
As women,

686
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:49,484
we're destined to have a tougher life.

687
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:51,284
Without a reliable husband

688
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:52,564
to depend on,

689
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:54,724
the tough days ahead

690
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:56,484
are unimaginable.

691
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,084
I understand

692
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,724
your kind intentions.

693
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:02,843
These past few days
have been quite terrifying.

694
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,203
I'll leave everything to you then.

695
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:06,524
Don't worry.

696
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:08,643
You're a decent girl.

697
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:10,843
I'll take care
of the arrangement for you.

698
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,363
Just stay without worries.

699
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:15,804
Poor child.

700
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:16,803
You're in such a mess.

701
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,123
You must have been scared.

702
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,964
Go back to your room and wash up.

703
00:29:21,084 --> 00:29:22,044
Get some rest.

704
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:23,964
Thank you, Aunt.

705
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,123
Someone.

706
00:29:26,524 --> 00:29:27,804
Take good care of Miss Shen.

707
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:28,643
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

708
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,163
Miss Shen, please come this way.

709
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:39,044
I'll notify Deputy Minister Xu now.

710
00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:42,923
Miss Shen, how's the water temperature?

711
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:56,564
Zhen, you should wear

712
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:58,524
the clothes I sent over later.

713
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,163
Thank you, Aunt.

714
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:03,244
It was such a close call.

715
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,643
I almost died in the fire.

716
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:07,123
But luckily,

717
00:30:07,363 --> 00:30:08,764
someone rescued me.

718
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:10,244
Who was that?

719
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,284
Official Lu from the Magistrate Office.

720
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:13,443
Official Lu?

721
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:16,804
What was he doing there?

722
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:18,203
He was doing an investigation.

723
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:19,964
He also told me

724
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,100
that there are many suspicious points

725
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:23,804
in Father's case.

726
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:28,314
He said the construction plans
of the West Canal have gone missing.

727
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,403
But my father is a careful person.

728
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:32,883
He would never lose
the construction plans.

729
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:34,923
Aunt,

730
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,163
do you think

731
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:38,363
someone is trying

732
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:40,123
to frame my father?

733
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:43,284
How is that possible?

734
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:46,163
The West Canal is a serious matter.

735
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:47,643
Besides,

736
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,004
your father is such a good person.

737
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:52,123
Who could frame him?

738
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,403
You're right.

739
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:55,084
My father is a good person.

740
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:57,764
But Official Lu told me

741
00:30:57,964 --> 00:31:01,163
that he'll definitely get to the bottom of this case.

742
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:10,363
Aunt,

743
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,764
there's another important thing

744
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,123
I need to tell you.

745
00:31:14,964 --> 00:31:16,764
What is it?

746
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,603
When I went to the money house today,

747
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:19,403
I found out

748
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:21,473
that Father still
has something stored there.

749
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:22,524
I suspect

750
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:24,163
it might be those construction plans.

751
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:28,203
I don't know how bad the fire had damaged
the money house.

752
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,883
Could you ask Uncle

753
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:31,443
to help me find them?

754
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:33,084
Don't worry.

755
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,750
I'll go and talk to your uncle
about it now.

756
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:42,683
(Aunt,)

757
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:45,363
(that's your own brother.)

758
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,160
(Earl Suning Residence)

759
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:52,603
Master.

760
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:54,363
This is the Earl Suning Residence.

761
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:56,603
If Miss Shen was mistaken about this,

762
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:57,882
wouldn't the Magistrate Office

763
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,284
be in huge trouble?

764
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:02,084
We had no clues to this case earlier.

765
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:04,724
Perhaps this is a chance.

766
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:10,564
By the way,

767
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:11,564
have you thought

768
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:13,004
about that carefully?

769
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:14,843
I mean those dreams

770
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,084
and your feelings.

771
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,084
At this moment, I can be certain

772
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:20,484
that when she cries,

773
00:32:21,004 --> 00:32:22,123
I feel pain in my heart.

774
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,804
Also, I even dreamed

775
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:25,284
of her asking for help in a fire.

776
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,044
It came true today.

777
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:27,724
Then...

778
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,203
Then does that mean

779
00:32:30,524 --> 00:32:31,804
she will assassinate you too?

780
00:32:32,004 --> 00:32:33,123
Assassinate me?

781
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,044
Her?

782
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,443
Crying to death is more likely.

783
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:40,443
Master, please.

784
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:41,484
Don't worry.

785
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:45,084
It may be just a coincidence.

786
00:32:45,484 --> 00:32:47,324
Stop thinking
about those baseless things.

787
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:48,484
Is everything arranged?

788
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:49,490
Don't worry, Master.

789
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,524
Everyone is in position.

790
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:57,163
(Aunt,)

791
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,923
(I hope you'll consider
our familial ties.)

792
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:06,284
Who are you?

793
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:14,923
Calm down, miss.

794
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:17,163
I should be the one

795
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:18,923
you're thinking about.

796
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,084
Don't come near me.

797
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:21,564
As expected

798
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:23,394
of the woman
I've been yearning for years.

799
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,964
You look so beautiful
even when you're angry,

800
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:28,484
Don't touch me.

801
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:40,163
Don't you want
to save Official Shen anymore?

802
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:43,964
Have you heard of

803
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:46,004
the current Empress's nephew,

804
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,154
Xu Wei, the Assistant Minister
of the Revenue Section?

805
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:55,244
That's me.

806
00:33:55,643 --> 00:33:56,883
As long as I say the word,

807
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:57,883
countless people

808
00:33:58,044 --> 00:33:59,403
will come forward to help me.

809
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:01,324
A mere West Canal case

810
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:03,524
is nothing.

811
00:34:03,603 --> 00:34:05,004
But with the condition

812
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:07,403
you let me

813
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:09,884
have a good time.

814
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,484
I believe

815
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,763
that you'll make the right choice.

816
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:22,163
Official Xu, your words are convincing.

817
00:34:22,683 --> 00:34:23,763
They say

818
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:26,723
the construction plans
can save my father.

819
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:28,603
Official Xu,

820
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,564
can you obtain the construction plans?

821
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,643
The construction plans
are in your uncle's hands.

822
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:37,084
As long as I say the words,

823
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:38,524
I can make him hand over

824
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,190
the construction plans
to you obediently.

825
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,084
But you must be good.

826
00:34:47,763 --> 00:34:49,364
As long as I can save my father,

827
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:52,763
I'm willing to do anything.

828
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:53,364
That's great.

829
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:53,884
Wait.

830
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:56,924
What is it?

831
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,123
Well,

832
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:01,044
I'm an innocent lady,

833
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:01,844
don't you agree?

834
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:03,643
Even without going through

835
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:05,643
any formalities,

836
00:35:07,364 --> 00:35:08,524
we should at least perform

837
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,123
some ritual ceremony, shouldn't we?

838
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:14,004
Official Xu,

839
00:35:14,723 --> 00:35:16,884
if you're willing to drink
this nuptial wine with me,

840
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:20,203
then I'll entrust

841
00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:22,444
my lifetime to you.

842
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:30,803
Dear...

843
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,323
It's just nuptial wine.

844
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:37,004
I'll accompany you

845
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:39,723
as much as you want to drink.

846
00:35:47,683 --> 00:35:48,884
Dear...

847
00:35:57,564 --> 00:35:58,323
Let's drink.

848
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:04,283
Close your eyes.

849
00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:22,443
Official Xu has had too much to drink.

850
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:23,803
Go and get some sobering soup.

851
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,602
One of you shall go,
the other one shall stay here.

852
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,524
I'm only a weak woman.

853
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,234
Are you afraid that I might escape?

854
00:36:29,484 --> 00:36:30,524
- So...
- Go.

855
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:33,924
Official Xu drank too much.

856
00:36:33,964 --> 00:36:35,274
Help me carry him into the bed.

857
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:44,603
You wretched woman!
How dare you strike me!

858
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:49,643
Go after her!

859
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:50,484
Stop right there!

860
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,643
After her!

861
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:54,844
Stop running!

862
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:58,964
Stop right there!

863
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:00,564
Stop her!

864
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:03,683
Trying to run?

865
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:05,844
Get her!

866
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:11,084
Stop right there!

867
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:12,763
You can't run!

868
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,163
- Stop right there!
- Stop!

869
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:20,283
Stop!

870
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:20,964
Aunt!

871
00:37:22,564 --> 00:37:23,163
Aunt,

872
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:25,123
help me.

873
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:26,844
Aunt!

874
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:27,803
Aunt.

875
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:31,643
Madam.

876
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:33,844
Step aside!

877
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:34,643
Madam.

878
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:37,323
Don't come near me.

879
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,274
Do you know how to kill a man?

880
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:41,844
Over here. Strike here.

881
00:37:41,964 --> 00:37:42,844
Come on, strike here.

882
00:37:42,924 --> 00:37:44,404
Come on.

883
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:45,844
Come on!

884
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:49,484
If you come any closer, I'll kill myself!

885
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:52,964
I thought you wanted
to save your father.

886
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:54,844
Would you die willingly?

887
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:56,283
Trying to scare me?

888
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,044
Uncle.

889
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:12,123
Don't you know it's a blessing for you
to have caught Official Xu's eyes?

890
00:38:12,243 --> 00:38:12,964
What?

891
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:15,603
Stop pretending to be virtuous.

892
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:16,884
Go.

893
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:20,884
You wretched woman!

894
00:38:57,924 --> 00:38:58,803
You're all right now.

895
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:01,524
I'm here.

896
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:10,203
Who kicked me?

897
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,404
Lu Shiyan,

898
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:14,803
you ruined my plan!

899
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,643
Someone reported the Earl's residence

900
00:39:17,803 --> 00:39:20,524
for concealing crucial evidence
of the West Canal case.

901
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:21,844
Report me?

902
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:24,404
Official Lu, do you have evidence?

903
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:25,763
Without evidence,

904
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,564
you still want to search my residence?

905
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:31,043
Lu Shiyan, breaking into the Earl's residence
without an imperial decree

906
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:32,243
is punishable by death.

907
00:39:35,564 --> 00:39:36,803
Trust me.

908
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:42,603
Search!

909
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:43,524
Search!

910
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:47,323
Lu Shiyan!

911
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:51,643
Dear...

912
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,300
Assistant Minister of Revenue Section,
Xu Wei abducted a civilian woman.

913
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:02,084
Arrest and detain him
until he's convicted.

914
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:04,364
Lu Shiyan,

915
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:06,283
what right do you have to arrest me?

916
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:09,323
Who saw me

917
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:10,683
abducting the woman?

918
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:11,322
Come forward

919
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:13,323
and testify for Official Lu!

920
00:40:14,643 --> 00:40:15,484
Anyone?

921
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:22,603
Xu Wei, just now...

922
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:24,323
I saw it with my own eyes.

923
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:27,524
I am a witness.

924
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:28,603
Take him away.

925
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:29,243
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

926
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:29,803
All of you!

927
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:33,084
Lu Shiyan,

928
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:34,844
you will regret this!

929
00:40:35,444 --> 00:40:36,844
You'll regret this!

930
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:38,404
Say something!

931
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:38,964
Move it!

932
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:40,364
Release me!

933
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:41,243
Release me!

934
00:40:42,283 --> 00:40:43,044
Let me go!

935
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:44,803
Let me go!

936
00:40:48,884 --> 00:40:50,123
It's all right now.

937
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,484
Everything is all right now.

938
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,404
Stop crying.

939
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:17,084
Master?

940
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:18,763
Master!

941
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,162
- Someone!
- Official Lu!

942
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:21,163
Master has passed out!

943
00:41:21,884 --> 00:41:23,884
Master? Master!
