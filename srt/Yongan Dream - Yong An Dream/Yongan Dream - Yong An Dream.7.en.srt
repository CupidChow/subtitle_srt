Mother-in-law?

Li.

20
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,523
Li Di.

21
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:01,404
Look at what you've done.

22
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:02,053
Ran.

23
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:03,333
Listen to me.

24
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,083
She...

25
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:05,973
Li,

26
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:07,300
I didn't do it on purpose.

27
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,199
I encountered Mother-in-law
at the makeup powder shop.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,373
I told her

29
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:13,284
that I was pregnant as I was flustered.

30
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:17,653
Di,

31
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,172
why didn't you tell us about it

32
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,012
since you found out?

33
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,004
This is a good thing.

34
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:24,012
Ru,

35
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,764
how long have you been pregnant?

36
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,324
Over two months.

37
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:30,813
This is the time

38
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:33,093
for you to take care of your body.

39
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:34,413
But now,

40
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:36,884
Ru is living outside alone.

41
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:38,172
My grandchild

42
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:41,724
has to suffer out there.

43
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,403
Li Di,

44
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,213
what other good news

45
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:50,253
are you keeping from me?

46
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,123
Ran.

47
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:53,213
It's like this. I...

48
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,523
Madam,

49
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:55,973
please let me stay

50
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:57,612
in the residence

51
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,484
since I'm pregnant.

52
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:04,772
Ru is pregnant with the child

53
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:06,373
of the Li family too.

54
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:09,363
In the end, we're a family.

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,373
I don't know how long
Li Di will hide this from me

56
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:12,452
had I not bumped into him

57
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:13,564
today.

58
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:14,813
Actually, I...

59
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:17,000
Ran, don't be too much.

60
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,813
You've been married into the family
for a long time.

61
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:20,284
And you were never pregnant.

62
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,572
Even so, Di never mistreated you.

63
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:24,853
Now, the Li family has a new descendant.

64
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,093
As the female head of the house,

65
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:27,800
you just need to do your part.

66
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:28,813
Mother, don't say that. I...

67
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:29,604
Enough.

68
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:30,853
I'll make the call today.

69
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:32,332
Ru will stay in the Li Residence

70
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,803
and take care of her baby.

71
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:34,732
She...

72
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,373
Moreover,

73
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:36,533
Ru was

74
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,164
Di's former wife.

75
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:39,892
Former wife?

76
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:41,612
Mother, don't say that.

77
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,403
I...

78
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,604
Was this the great day
you were referring to?

79
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:06,813
Ran!

80
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,892
Di,

81
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:08,973
just let her go.

82
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,100
Mother, I'm a public servant.

83
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,612
It's a crime for me to get another wife

84
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:12,933
while I'm married.

85
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:13,892
People will criticize me

86
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,373
if they hear about this.

87
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:16,492
Li.

88
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:18,052
Try and understand my feelings too.

89
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,893
Now, the Shen family is in deep trouble.

90
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,013
And, it's the key period in rebuilding
the West Canal.

91
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,893
I need the support inside and outside
of the court

92
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:24,812
to establish a foothold.

93
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,364
Look at the mess you caused. I...

94
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:29,252
Let's just not tell anyone

95
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:30,773
about Ru marrying into our family.

96
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:31,400
Not tell anyone?

97
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:32,252
Did you forget about her?

98
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:33,873
If Shen Ran dares to
tell other people about it,

99
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,523
I won't let her off.

100
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:36,612
Let's go.

101
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,004
Let's return to our room.

102
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:39,413
Let's go.

103
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,643
Mother-in-law, be careful.

104
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:08,364
Greetings, Dear.

105
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:16,843
Let's go.

106
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,980
How could a husband
treat his wife like this?

107
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:21,292
No one will believe that you're Wei

108
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:22,692
if you keep showing her

109
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:25,083
the cold shoulders.

110
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:29,292
As Wei, you should wrap your arms

111
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:31,444
around Miss Qin's shoulder.

112
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:36,043
Wrap your arms around her shoulder.

113
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,893
Come on.

114
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:39,732
Miss Qin.

115
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,603
Lean on his shoulder slowly.

116
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:45,804
Lean on his shoulder?

117
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:46,773
How?

118
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,403
You don't even know how to do it?

119
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,083
Come here.

120
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:55,692
Follow what I do.

121
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:58,564
Lean on his shoulder slowly.

122
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:00,843
Put your arms on my shoulder.

123
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:04,364
Just like a subservient girl.

124
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:05,612
Wei,

125
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:07,643
hug her tighter.

126
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,244
It's still wrong.

127
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,612
Your hand is in the wrong place.

128
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:17,732
You need to hug her tighter.

129
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,603
Hug Miss Qin tightly.

130
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:33,893
Madam,

131
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,372
Madam He looks like

132
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:36,853
a devious person.

133
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,004
Why did you take her into the residence?

134
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:42,283
Li Di divorced her long ago.

135
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:44,444
However, he brought her
around the capital.

136
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,603
And, they visit the money house
frequently.

137
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,723
I'm sure there's something
more to it than meets the eye.

138
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:51,483
What is Li Di doing with Madam He?

139
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:53,244
And, where did he get all that money

140
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,043
in the money house?

141
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:57,163
Could it be that
Master has done something...

142
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,083
Ran!

143
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:12,523
Ran.

144
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,764
I still need to explain things to you.

145
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:27,804
He got pregnant by accident.

146
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:28,692
Before this,

147
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,444
I drowned myself in sorrow

148
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:31,692
because of what happened

149
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:32,812
to Father-in-law.

150
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:34,444
That's why I did that with her.

151
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:37,884
Now, she's pregnant.

152
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,292
And Mother wants her to stay
in the Li Residence.

153
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,252
But don't worry.

154
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,573
I'll definitely think of a way
to kick her out of the Li Residence.

155
00:07:43,574 --> 00:07:44,093
Okay?

156
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,612
Mother said
that Madam He was your ex-wife.

157
00:07:45,613 --> 00:07:46,804
How do you explain that?

158
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:48,413
About that, I...

159
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:49,124
Li Di,

160
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,573
since when did you become

161
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:52,204
such a devious liar?

162
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,684
I have nothing to say to you.

163
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:55,200
Ran,

164
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,453
please believe me one last time,

165
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:56,853
okay?

166
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:58,723
- I didn't expect it to end up like this.
- Master!

167
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:00,453
You should give Madam

168
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:01,533
some time for now.

169
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:03,283
I'll definitely kick her out.

170
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,292
Wei, you do look like

171
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,523
a dashing playboy now.

172
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:23,132
Of course.

173
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,364
If not, how can I
be good enough for you?

174
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,692
Only Wei's favorite mistress

175
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:30,013
can go out with him.

176
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:31,973
According to the book of law,

177
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:34,333
we should do things in a logical way.

178
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,333
Although we're staging an act,

179
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:38,372
we have to make things logical

180
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,123
to deceive people.

181
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,404
Seems like you did read
that book thoroughly.

182
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,612
However, can't a playboy like me

183
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,813
bring around

184
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:49,813
another mistress
just to wash my legs?

185
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:51,324
Say that again?

186
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:53,372
Say,

187
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:55,843
it sounds natural for you

188
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:58,012
to call me Wei now.

189
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:59,372
Of course.

190
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,173
I didn't practice

191
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,612
for nothing, you know?

192
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,293
That's right.

193
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,324
By the way,

194
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:05,652
I had a dream last night.

195
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,763
I dreamt that you held my hands.

196
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,652
What else did you dream about?

197
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,603
Initially, I wanted to slap you.

198
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:18,772
But after that, I noticed

199
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,363
my identity.

200
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,164
I held it in.

201
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,083
Luckily, you held it in.

202
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:31,573
Mister,

203
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,363
Wuzhou City is right ahead.

204
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,044
What are you doing?

205
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,684
I'm doing what a mistress
is supposed to do.

206
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,003
You can do that
when we're in Lu Si's residence.

207
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,320
(Wuzhou)

208
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:58,652
How did Uncle Lu Si's residence

209
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:00,483
end up like this?

210
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:09,100
It looks decrepit.

211
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,693
Seems like it's been
abandoned for a long time.

212
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,404
I'm sure no one has lived here
for a long time.

213
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,164
It's safe.

214
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:54,963
Wait.

215
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:04,093
Someone wiped away

216
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,603
their traces on purpose.

217
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:30,524
It's herbs.

218
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:35,044
Someone's here.

219
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,243
It's Uncle Lu.

220
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:06,763
Uncle Lu,

221
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,003
I'm Shen Zhen,
the daughter of Shen Wenqi.

222
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,524
Do you still remember me?

223
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,204
Miss Shen?

224
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:16,532
I'm Lu Shiyan
from the Magistrate Office.

225
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:19,164
This is an emergency.
Sorry for the offense.

226
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,324
Miss Shen,

227
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,213
what are you doing here?

228
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:27,093
Uncle Lu,

229
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,453
I wonder if you still remember

230
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:29,612
that my father once gave you

231
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,053
the construction plan of the West Canal?

232
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,483
Did you keep it with you?

233
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,123
Miss Shen,

234
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,524
I've heard about what happened
to Mr. Shen.

235
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:38,412
But you guys are too late.

236
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,763
Someone already stole
that construction plan.

237
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,293
Who stole it?

238
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,684
Zhao Chong.

239
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,684
Zhao Chong?

240
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:49,652
This Zhao Chong is notorious
for being a bully

241
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:52,083
in Wuzhou.

242
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:53,492
He knew I collected

243
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:55,612
the paintings of many famous artists.

244
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,924
He sent his men to steal them from me.

245
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:03,444
I had no choice but to hide.

246
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,204
After I found out
what happened to Minister Shen,

247
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,324
I hid the construction plan

248
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:11,252
within the gap
of the Autumn Moon Painting.

249
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:12,772
But at this time,

250
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:14,772
Zhao Chong's men stormed my residence

251
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,243
and stole all of my paintings away.

252
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,524
That construction plan

253
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:22,363
was gone.

254
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,284
Everything was gone.

255
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:28,723
Uncle Lu, here.
Take your medicine first.

256
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,524
Miss Shen,

257
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:37,003
I failed to protect
Mr. Shen's construction plan.

258
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,204
Uncle Lu, it's not your fault.

259
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,132
If Zhao Chong hasn't discovered the secret

260
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,644
within the Autumn Moon Painting,

261
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,524
we might still have a chance
to take it back.

262
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:47,644
You mustn't.

263
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:50,083
You mustn't.

264
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,284
It's too risky.

265
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,012
He dared to do this to me

266
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,012
even though I was
a fourth-rank official.

267
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:57,492
You're just a woman.

268
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,723
You mustn't take such risks.

269
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,083
Mr. Lu,

270
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:03,243
just leave this to us.

271
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:04,324
Don't worry.

272
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,404
I shall ensure her safety.

273
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:14,684
Imperial Censor,

274
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:17,164
this is a secret letter
sent by Official Lu from Wuzhou.

275
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:30,012
The sole reason that
the West Canal collapsed

276
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:32,252
was because the pine wood
that was necessary for the construction

277
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:34,444
was replaced with willow wood.

278
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:36,804
Official Zhou, please verify the case.

279
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,772
It's the same as your prediction.

280
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:46,564
After the collapse of the West Canal,

281
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,644
Shen Wenqi was captured immediately.

282
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:49,892
They drew the people's attention

283
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:51,924
to the fault of the construction plan.

284
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,843
They intend to cover up
their corrupt act.

285
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,772
I'll visit the West Canal again.

286
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:57,492
I don't believe

287
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,404
that they can do such a clean job.

288
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,243
Give Miss Li some intel.

289
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:06,324
It's easier to investigate Li Di
if we start from her.

290
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:07,243
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:18,853
Madam,

292
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,843
Official Zhou told his men
to deliver this to us.

293
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,053
(The key to the money house
is hidden)

294
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,444
(within the peony perfumed sachet
that Madam He is carrying.)

295
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,252
This Official Zhou,

296
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:31,973
how did he find out

297
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,524
what we were going to do?

298
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,892
He kept a close eye on us
and guided us step by step

299
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,044
from the time I wanted to kill Li Di

300
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,763
to the time I found Madam He.

301
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,093
He wishes to use me

302
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,603
to investigate Li Di

303
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,444
as I'm his wife.

304
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:58,252
Ru, eat up.

305
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,804
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

306
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,204
Eat up.

307
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:12,044
Eat up.

308
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:13,603
Eat up.

309
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:15,564
Old Madam,

310
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:17,813
this is goat milk and yam soup.

311
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:18,853
My missus

312
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,453
found this folk remedy

313
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:21,933
in Meizhou

314
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,083
that's good for pregnant women.

315
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,404
That's great.

316
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,644
Thank you, Madam.

317
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,164
Don't mention it.

318
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,173
Madam He,

319
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,644
let me serve you.

320
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,132
Okay.

321
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,243
That's right.

322
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:37,644
Give her more.

323
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,284
This is good for you.

324
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:45,772
What kind of soup is this?

325
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:47,333
It stinks!

326
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,213
Madam He,

327
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:49,573
goat milk invigorates our qi and blood

328
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,213
while yam helps expand our stomach.

329
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,012
This soup

330
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:53,012
is very good

331
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,612
for your child.

332
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,963
That's right.

333
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:58,012
I know this soup.

334
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,532
I drank this as well

335
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,093
when I was pregnant with Di.

336
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:02,924
Ran, you're a thoughtful child.

337
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:05,692
Ru, you should drink up.

338
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:08,404
Madam He, give it a try.

339
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:10,293
This!

340
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:10,773
You!

341
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:11,844
Madam He!

342
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:12,652
Qingli.

343
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:13,733
How could you be so careless?

344
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:14,773
Madam.

345
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,293
Go and help Madam He to get changed.

346
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:17,053
Yes, Madam.

347
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:17,773
Madam He,

348
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:19,652
let's go and get changed.

349
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:20,563
Let's go.

350
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:21,573
Go now.

351
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,243
Madam He, be careful.

352
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
(Lu Garden)

353
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,963
Greetings, Master.

354
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,043
Qing, are you satisfied?

355
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,364
Thank you, Dear.

356
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:26,700
Who is that?

357
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,333
Since he's capable
to purchase the Lu Garden,

358
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,444
I'm sure he's a wealthy guy.

359
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:32,212
Master is dashing.

360
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:33,733
His wife is beautiful too.

361
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,283
What a perfect match.

362
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:36,723
What a perfect match indeed.

363
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:39,412
I like that. You'll be rewarded.

364
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:40,803
All right.

365
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,899
Thank you, Master!

366
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,013
They're a match made in heaven!

367
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:45,652
Perfect couple!

368
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:46,644
Thank you, Master!

369
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:48,844
Look at how toady they are.

370
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,853
I like all of that.

371
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:52,124
All of you will be rewarded.

372
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:55,283
Thank you, Master!

373
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,283
Reward them, Housekeeper Yang.

374
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:01,652
All right.

375
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:02,773
Come and get your rewards.

376
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,612
Thank you, Master!

377
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:04,333
Thank you!

378
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:05,323
Thank you, housekeeper.

379
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:09,813
Dear,

380
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:12,132
the hairpin you bought for me just fell.

381
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,053
Qing,

382
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:15,684
it's dirty now. Let's buy a new one.

383
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:18,404
Everyone,

384
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,253
where's the best accessory shop

385
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:21,132
in Wuzhou?

386
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:21,853
I know where it is.

387
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,773
It's Chunli Pavilion,
which is not far away from here.

388
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:24,924
Let me bring you there.

389
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:26,250
Reward him.

390
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:26,892
Thank you, Master.

391
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:29,243
Qing, let's go and buy
some new accessories.

392
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,084
Thank you, Master.

393
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,813
This quality...

394
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:35,084
Shopkeeper.

395
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:38,124
Greetings, dear guests.

396
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:39,773
I wonder what you need?

397
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:40,523
Come.

398
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:41,853
Show me the best hairpins

399
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:43,844
you have.

400
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,452
You guys came to the right place.

401
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,773
The designs we have here

402
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:50,372
are the trendiest design
in all of Wuzhou.

403
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:51,644
They're very popular.

404
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:53,803
Everyone is using them, huh?

405
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,323
That makes them common, then.

406
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,972
How could they be good enough

407
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:59,483
for my beloved Qin?

408
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:01,493
Do you have a special collection?

409
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:02,644
Yes, sir.

410
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,803
Here.

411
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:12,723
This white jade hairpin

412
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,963
does look pretty nice.

413
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,164
It looks amazing

414
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:19,364
if you put it on
with another piece of jewelry.

415
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:20,612
Lady,

416
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,013
you have great taste.

417
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,763
You have great taste indeed.

418
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,084
Everyone can appreciate
quality goods, you know?

419
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:29,364
But can they afford it?

420
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:34,084
I'm taking

421
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,853
all of these.

422
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:37,372
All of them?

423
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:38,853
- She's so rich!
- Yeah.

424
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:39,853
- Yeah.
- She's so generous.

425
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:40,803
They're so rich.

426
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:45,283
Why are you still standing there?

427
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,404
Shopkeeper,

428
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,253
you told me some new designs arrived

429
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:53,053
just a few days ago.

430
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,573
I'm already here,

431
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:56,884
yet you're selling them to me
without letting me test them.

432
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,132
Do you still have respect
for the Gao family?

433
00:20:59,133 --> 00:20:59,892
Does it look nice?

434
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:00,773
Madam Gao,

435
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:01,932
I dare not do so.

436
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,372
Didn't you...

437
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:04,412
What did I say?

438
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,172
Did I say I didn't want them?

439
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:06,853
You didn't.

440
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:07,803
It looks good on you.

441
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,412
Since the accessories

442
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:10,612
are still in their boxes,

443
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:13,243
naturally, it's first come first served.

444
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,204
Shopkeeper,

445
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,084
I suppose you no longer
want to do business here, huh?

446
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,364
I'm taking that

447
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:21,963
as well.

448
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:26,533
Please remove it for us.

449
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:27,803
Who the heck are you guys?

450
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:29,604
How dare you try to steal my hairpin?

451
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:31,013
Miss,

452
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:32,093
Madam Gao

453
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:34,452
picked the hairpin before you.

454
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:35,093
Look.

455
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,099
There're plenty of other hairpins.
Why don't you pick them?

456
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,003
Did she say she wanted to buy it?

457
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:41,204
I want that hairpin.

458
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:42,372
All right, then.

459
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:44,644
Let's see who can afford
the highest bid, then.

460
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:45,723
Ten taels.

461
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:53,243
You think you can buy this hairpin
for 20 taels?

462
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:54,733
100 taels.

463
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:56,763
This hairpin will be mine for sure.

464
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:00,604
2?

465
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,404
200 taels?

466
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:10,283
Even so, I can afford it.

467
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,452
This means

468
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:15,604
that I'll pay double the price

469
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:17,243
that you offer.

470
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:20,084
Double the price?

471
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:22,164
They're amazing.

472
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,084
They're so rich.

473
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:26,773
Do you know

474
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:27,692
that those who dare to

475
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,723
go against me in Wuzhou

476
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:31,803
never end up well?

477
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:34,972
I don't care if you're
the mighty Madam Gao

478
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,844
or a lowly servant.

479
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:38,813
You!

480
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:40,692
Be quiet if you don't have any money.

481
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,483
You guys!

482
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:45,803
What are you guys laughing at?

483
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:47,844
Madam Gao, please don't be angry.

484
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:49,733
Just you wait.

485
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,892
I'll go back and bring my husband here.

486
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:54,084
He'll crush you with his money!

487
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:56,723
Madam Gao.

488
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,723
I already bought

489
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,692
the hairpin on your head.

490
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:02,444
You!

491
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:07,892
You and your lousy shop.

492
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:09,684
I'll never come again!

493
00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:10,612
Madam Gao, you...

494
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:12,533
Get out of the way!
What are you looking at?

495
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:13,333
Madam Gao!

496
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:14,884
Get out of the way!

497
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:17,172
Mister,

498
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:18,323
as you can see,

499
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,283
I've already offended Madam Gao.

500
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:22,093
These accessories,

501
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:23,773
including this white jade hairpin,

502
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:25,364
cost a total of 800 taels.

503
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,172
Just 800 taels, huh?

504
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,013
Dear, pay up.

505
00:23:31,014 --> 00:23:32,600
I'll go and take a look
at other accessories.

506
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:40,563
Yang Zong,

507
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:42,404
this is the down payment.

508
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,364
800 taels?

509
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,840
(Zhao Residence)

510
00:23:59,054 --> 00:23:59,884
Master,

511
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,800
the new owner of Lu Garden
has entered the city.

512
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:04,412
He brought his mistress
to the accessory shop

513
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:05,813
and splurged on them

514
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:07,972
even before he entered the residence.

515
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,283
He was attracting so much attention.

516
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:11,644
I thought it was someone capable

517
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:14,013
who bought Lu Garden.

518
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:15,773
So, it was just a dandy, huh?

519
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:17,563
Report back to me

520
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:19,204
when he does something new.

521
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:20,563
Yes, Master.

522
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:25,692
Don't be angry.

523
00:24:25,693 --> 00:24:27,723
It's not like I did it on purpose.

524
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:29,412
It's easy to end up like that

525
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:31,093
when we buy things.

526
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,333
Next time, you should tell me

527
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:33,093
your budget.

528
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:34,323
I won't exceed them.

529
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:39,164
Put it here.

530
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:46,132
What does this mean?

531
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,243
My lord,

532
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:50,323
you two were splurging out there.

533
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:52,132
We only have a limited amount of budget.

534
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,684
We need to keep them for the future.

535
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,132
Therefore,

536
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,604
we can only have this right now.

537
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:03,212
Porridge is pretty good.

538
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,013
We spent a lot on lavish dishes outside.

539
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:06,172
All of our meals were greasy.

540
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,283
Having some porridge
can clear up our stomach.

541
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:09,644
Official Lu.

542
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:14,293
Fine.

543
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:15,563
Here, Yang Zong.

544
00:25:18,814 --> 00:25:20,323
Did something abnormal happen today?

545
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:22,932
My lord,

546
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,803
ever since we moved into Lu Garden,

547
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:25,533
someone was here

548
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,212
to investigate our background every day.

549
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:28,000
Today,

550
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:29,053
I found scouts at the entrance

551
00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:29,932
of Lu Garden

552
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,323
and Chunli Pavilion.

553
00:25:32,173 --> 00:25:33,013
Seems like Zhao Chong

554
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:34,813
has great awareness indeed.

555
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:36,372
He knows everything that's happening

556
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:37,963
in Wuzhou.

557
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:39,452
That's right.

558
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:41,404
After all, you two
did attract a lot of attention.

559
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,932
Let's get back to business.

560
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:48,733
My lord,

561
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:49,853
I've dispatched 30 members of

562
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:51,212
the Magistrate Office.

563
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:52,093
I made half of them

564
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:52,800
put on a disguise

565
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,093
as the servants of the Wei Residence.

566
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:54,850
I made the other half

567
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:56,773
infiltrate the taverns and tea houses

568
00:25:56,774 --> 00:25:58,043
in advance.

569
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:01,000
Zhao Chong is obsessed with paintings.

570
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:02,333
Coincidentally, I do know something

571
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,412
about paintings too.

572
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:04,412
Why don't we

573
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:06,003
buy some paintings?

574
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:07,172
This way, we can invite

575
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,853
Madam Zhao to our residence.

576
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:09,972
We can even use them

577
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:11,844
to obtain leads related
to the Autumn Moon Painting.

578
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:17,844
You shall be in charge of it.

579
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:19,884
By the way,

580
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:22,763
Zhao Chong will be holding a banquet
at Zuimeng Bridge tomorrow night.

581
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:23,813
It's a good chance

582
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,003
for me to approach him.

583
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:26,604
I want to tag along.

584
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:31,884
Zuimeng Bridge

585
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,333
isn't a place for you.

586
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:34,573
But now, I'm Qin Qin.

587
00:26:34,574 --> 00:26:35,853
I'm not Shen Zhen.

588
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:37,253
I'm heading there on my own initiative.

589
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:39,733
We still don't know how Zhao Chong
will react to my presence.

590
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:40,932
If I get in trouble,

591
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,253
at least you can help me out

592
00:26:42,254 --> 00:26:43,452
if you stay in Lu Garden.

593
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:44,124
That's right.

594
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:51,803
Don't be impatient.

595
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,084
All right, then.

596
00:26:58,693 --> 00:26:59,523
Let's eat.

597
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,253
(Xue Money House)

598
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:06,253
Shopkeeper,

599
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:07,733
my father is old.

600
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:09,053
He's senile too.

601
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:10,924
He doesn't remember
the serial number of his safe.

602
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,763
Just find it among
the customers with the surname He.

603
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,093
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

604
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:16,892
I already told you many times.

605
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:17,573
I couldn't find.

606
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,164
Check it again.

607
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:20,803
Fine, then.

608
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:22,499
Shopkeeper,

609
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,853
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

610
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:25,283
Please hurry up.

611
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:27,253
Madam,

612
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,892
this is your first time here, right?

613
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:29,892
Let me give you

614
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:30,892
a brief introduction.

615
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:32,212
We have three types of safes.

616
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,293
Small, medium, and large.

617
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:35,013
Just tell me what you need

618
00:27:35,014 --> 00:27:36,612
to store here.

619
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,444
Of course.

620
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:38,892
The price here

621
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:40,884
is different too.

622
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:42,604
I want to store...

623
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,483
Shopkeeper.

624
00:27:46,653 --> 00:27:47,844
Let's speak in private.

625
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:49,924
Okay.

626
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,644
Shopkeeper,

627
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:58,523
(Account book)
I want to store all of my accessories.

628
00:27:58,734 --> 00:27:59,892
I'm afraid my husband

629
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:01,803
has a mistress outside.

630
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:03,364
Shopkeeper,

631
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:05,243
is your shop safe?

632
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:07,099
You mustn't let my husband find out

633
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,932
that I'm storing items
without his permission.

634
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,372
Madam, don't worry.

635
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:12,293
In our trade, we have rules to obey.

636
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:12,972
(Madam He)
We cannot...

637
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:13,533
Madam He.

638
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:14,773
We cannot reveal

639
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,364
our customers' information
to other people.

640
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:17,763
I'll get you a safe.

641
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:30,644
Shopkeeper, I...

642
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:32,452
Fine, then.

643
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:33,533
But Shopkeeper,

644
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,644
I need an auspicious number for my safe.

645
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:36,773
I'll take No. 8.

646
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:38,533
Madam, No. 8

647
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:39,684
is unavailable.

648
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,652
What about No. 18?

649
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,803
Let me check.

650
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:46,493
No. 18 is unavailable.

651
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:47,533
What about No. 28, No. 38,

652
00:28:47,534 --> 00:28:48,684
or even No. 48?

653
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,283
Please give me a second.

654
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,253
No. 48 is available.

655
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:54,932
All right.

656
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,652
I need to check it out.

657
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:57,444
All right.

658
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:00,604
Over here.

659
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:03,204
No. 48, huh?

660
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,563
No. 48.

661
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:07,523
No. 48.

662
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,733
Over here.

663
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:10,523
Madam.

664
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:12,204
This is No. 48.

665
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:21,084
Madam,

666
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,013
you don't need to worry at all

667
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:24,803
if you keep your possessions here.

668
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,253
You can come and retrieve them
anytime you like.

669
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:28,763
Our shop will be available
most of the time.

670
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,360
(No. 8)

671
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,372
Madam Li, let me bring you inside.

672
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,573
No need. I frequent this shop.

673
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,003
I'll find it myself.

674
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:53,452
Madam, this is the last safe

675
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:55,093
with the number 8.

676
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,372
Someone else would've taken it

677
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:58,444
had you come here later.

678
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:30,043
Madam Li, you're here.

679
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:33,043
Take care.

680
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:35,364
Shopkeeper.

681
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,493
I'll take that safe.

682
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:39,093
All right, then.

683
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:41,644
I'll get the key for you, then.

684
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:45,212
Madam, where's your servant?

685
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:47,372
I told her to retrieve something for me
on the carriage.

686
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,164
What? Isn't that none of your business?

687
00:30:49,254 --> 00:30:50,364
That's not what I mean.

688
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:51,444
Oh no!

689
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:52,253
Don't tell me

690
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:54,212
she ran away with my accessories?

691
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,013
Oh no.

692
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,093
I have to go and take a look.

693
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:56,773
I'll make a move.

694
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:57,604
Wait.

695
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:20,404
Qingli.

696
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:21,763
Come here.

697
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:23,803
Where's Madam?

698
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:26,924
Isn't your madam inside?

699
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,483
Is she inside?

700
00:31:28,574 --> 00:31:30,132
I didn't see her in there.

701
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,412
I thought she already left.

702
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:34,563
Official Zhou is inside too.

703
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,323
Official Zhou?

704
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:37,723
Calm down.

705
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:38,903
Hurry up.

706
00:31:38,904 --> 00:31:40,493
Shopkeeper.
My boss is running out of patience.

707
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:41,563
Hurry up!

708
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:46,243
Shopkeeper!

709
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:48,253
Sir, why are you still here?

710
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,333
This is an urgent matter.

711
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:51,204
Please check it again for me.

712
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:52,612
My boss needs to see me today.

713
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:53,813
I have to head there.

714
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:55,604
You can come again tomorrow.

715
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:56,803
But Shopkeeper!

716
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:00,963
Madam!

717
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,733
My madam and Official Zhou are...

718
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:06,452
Don't worry.

719
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:08,684
Official Zhou is a gentleman.

720
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,483
Madam!

721
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:19,444
I found the safe.

722
00:32:19,494 --> 00:32:20,892
I acquired the keys too.

723
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,723
I was the one who gave you the lead.

724
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,212
And, I saved you just now.

725
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:25,773
So, you were using me.

726
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:27,253
We have the same goal.

727
00:32:27,254 --> 00:32:28,563
How am I using you?

728
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:31,043
Madam Li, you're kicking up
a huge fuss over it.

729
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:34,333
For now, you and I have the same goal.

730
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:36,084
However, Official Zhou,
I cannot figure out

731
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:37,000
your motive.

732
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:38,452
I investigate all the
points of suspicions

733
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:39,884
and convict criminals of their crimes.

734
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,333
That's the only goal of

735
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,972
the Imperial Censorate.

736
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:44,803
Official Zhou, what about you?

737
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,003
Madam Li,

738
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:48,604
don't be anxious.

739
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:51,164
Both of you are doing this
to find out the truth.

740
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:52,892
Before this, you told me

741
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:54,372
that this was your family matter

742
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,684
and I shouldn't worry about it
since I was an outsider.

743
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:57,900
But now,

744
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,773
I suppose we can proceed with
both your family matter

745
00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:01,644
and my official matter together.

746
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,444
A copybook?

747
00:33:31,294 --> 00:33:33,323
What's the use of these copybooks?

748
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,164
These should be Li Di's secret letters.

749
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:38,773
We need to decipher them

750
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:39,853
using special ways.

751
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:40,844
Secret letters?

752
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,604
Why did he send
these secret letters out?

753
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:49,483
If you don't tell me now,

754
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:50,972
anything I do in the future

755
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:52,563
has nothing to do with you.

756
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,520
(The collapse of West Canal was caused
by the change of wood)

757
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:27,283
Was it because of the wood?

758
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:29,773
Chu Yi already verified

759
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:31,723
the issue in the West Canal once again.

760
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,363
The wood choice was the issue here.

761
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:42,564
He was the only person
in charge of the wood choice.

762
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:48,484
Was he truly the one behind all of this?

763
00:34:53,214 --> 00:34:55,124
He actually framed my father

764
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:58,164
for such items?

765
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:03,044
He paid no regard to human life

766
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:05,964
just to get his hands
on some corrupt money!

767
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:13,400
Miss Shen,

768
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,323
I never expected you
to be this good at the guqin.

769
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:16,883
The sound of your guqin

770
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,524
expresses your sorrow.

771
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,243
I suppose you miss your family.

772
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:31,892
Father loved it

773
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:34,004
when I played the guqin for him.

774
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:37,044
I wonder when I can play the guqin

775
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:39,293
for him again.

776
00:36:39,294 --> 00:36:40,564
Believe me.

777
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,403
That day will definitely arrive.

778
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:48,763
I truly miss Father.

779
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:51,084
I miss my sister too.

780
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:52,133
I miss the times

781
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:54,283
I spent together with my family.

782
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:55,693
I miss those days

783
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:57,524
when I didn't need to worry or fret.

784
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,204
Now, I finally understand.

785
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:02,723
I didn't need
to worry about anything before this

786
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,204
because I knew nothing.

787
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:07,644
I only knew how to depend on
the people around me.

788
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,723
No matter what happens,

789
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,892
Father and Sister will always be there

790
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:15,283
for me.

791
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:19,403
But now, it's different.

792
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:21,323
I'm all grown up now.

793
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,092
I should be the one

794
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:25,363
protecting my family now.

795
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:29,243
Official Lu,

796
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,484
let me follow you to the banquet.

797
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,532
Zhao Chong's informants

798
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,283
litter the streets of Wuzhou.

799
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:37,763
This is my first encounter with him.

800
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:39,403
Not only will it be a test,

801
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:41,213
but it will also be a dangerous ordeal.

802
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:42,200
I understand.

803
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:44,333
But we attracted so much attention
after entering the city.

804
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:45,452
A person like Wei Xian

805
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:47,124
will definitely bring Qin Qin with him.

806
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:48,293
Wouldn't it be more dangerous

807
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,653
if you didn't bring me to the banquet

808
00:37:49,654 --> 00:37:51,684
and Zhao Chong suspected us
because of that?

809
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,204
I can deal with him.

810
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,253
I pretended to be your wife
and followed you here

811
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:56,653
so that we could stage the full act.

812
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:57,932
But why aren't you allowing me to go

813
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,803
when you need me the most?

814
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,613
Are you worried that
I might drag you down?

815
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,684
I've already done my best.

816
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:05,803
You always did a great job.

817
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:08,923
Really?

818
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,403
I was worried that you might be scared.

819
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:15,323
If you insist on going,

820
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:18,243
we can go there together.

821
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:21,403
I'm not scared.

822
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,004
Master?

823
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:41,843
Where's Dear?

824
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:42,400
Madam?

825
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,372
A new batch of goods just arrived
at Baixiang Pavilion.

826
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:46,204
Madam is there
to do the inventory count.

827
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:48,763
Look at the time.

828
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,600
Why isn't she back yet?

829
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:51,892
Business has been booming lately.

830
00:38:51,893 --> 00:38:53,213
Goods came in a large number.

831
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,213
I'm afraid

832
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:55,803
Madam won't be able
to spend the night here.

833
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:58,532
If so, why didn't you keep her company?

834
00:38:58,533 --> 00:38:59,684
I was...

835
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:01,133
The shop was quite cold.

836
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:02,092
I came back

837
00:39:02,093 --> 00:39:03,363
to get her some extra clothing.

838
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,653
I'll go and check on her too, then.

839
00:39:05,654 --> 00:39:07,044
You mustn't!

840
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:11,843
What's wrong?

841
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:13,892
Madam has been

842
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,484
in a foul mood lately.

843
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:18,164
It's all because of Madam He.

844
00:39:18,294 --> 00:39:19,372
I'm afraid Madam

845
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:21,403
needs some time alone.

846
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:22,923
Master,

847
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:24,213
why don't you give Madam

848
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:25,803
some time alone?

849
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:28,363
I did let her down

850
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:30,403
regarding that matter.

851
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:32,932
It's fine.

852
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:34,363
I think I'll still go and check on her.

853
00:39:56,013 --> 00:39:57,084
Do you regret it?

854
00:39:59,294 --> 00:40:01,524
Official Zhou,
do you have any regrets, then?

855
00:40:04,854 --> 00:40:05,723
I do.

856
00:40:07,214 --> 00:40:08,323
And, I hate it too.

857
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,484
I regret the fact

858
00:40:12,214 --> 00:40:13,484
that I'm too timid.

859
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:15,484
I hate the fact

860
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,164
that I'm useless.

861
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,333
You're the Imperial Censor.

862
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,283
Even so, you still think you're useless?

863
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,443
Official Zhou, seems like
you're a proud person.

864
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:32,923
If I worked harder,

865
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:36,004
I could've risen to a higher rank
at an early age.

866
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:42,524
If so, I wouldn't need
to regret certain things.

867
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,084
In this life,

868
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:52,964
the suffering we face

869
00:40:53,774 --> 00:40:55,883
always appear without notice.

870
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:57,763
It's meaningless

871
00:40:58,254 --> 00:40:59,883
to regret one's decision.

872
00:41:01,174 --> 00:41:02,243
But when it comes to hate,

873
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:07,004
I'll show him what it means
to hate someone.

874
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,803
What do you plan to do, then?

875
00:41:11,854 --> 00:41:13,443
My father is imprisoned.

876
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,723
His status is unknown.

877
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,204
My sister has no one to depend on.

878
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,564
She can't even return to her own house.

879
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:24,843
It all started because of me.

880
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:28,323
What do you think I should do?

881
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:30,883
This isn't your fault.

882
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:34,283
Once a person casts away
all moral values and sincerity

883
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:36,923
and is bent on deceiving you,

884
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,684
you'll never find out.

885
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,484
Maybe there are no men

886
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:47,803
with sincere hearts in the world.

887
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:50,204
There are always exceptions.

888
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:03,412
Official Zhou, are you sincere

889
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:04,763
in trying to solve the case?

890
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:06,932
If so, Li Di should be

891
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:08,403
an important lead.

892
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:10,604
I can help you out

893
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:12,403
in any way you like.

894
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,532
I just hope that you can
get to the bottom of this case

895
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,084
for my father's sake.

896
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:22,443
I will do my best

897
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:25,004
to solve the case.

898
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,644
Official Zhou, I can never

899
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,843
repay your kindness.

900
00:43:40,174 --> 00:43:41,283
Where's your father?

901
00:43:41,373 --> 00:43:43,044
He owes us a lot of money.

902
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,644
Where is he?

903
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,684
It's been a long time since I saw him.

904
00:43:47,814 --> 00:43:49,084
Go and find him

905
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:52,644
if you want your money back.

906
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,964
Where do you think you're going?

907
00:44:00,453 --> 00:44:00,972
Give it back!

908
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:01,572
Catch!

909
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:02,972
Give it back!

910
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,843
You want to leave?

911
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:05,323
Stay put!

912
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:07,243
I need that money to buy my books!

913
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:09,084
You're buying your books with this?

914
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,684
Is this all you have?

915
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:13,763
It's not even enough for a beggar.

916
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:15,133
Take him away.

917
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:16,564
His father can come and redeem him.

918
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,813
If not, we'll sell him off.

919
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:18,412
Let's go.

920
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:19,293
Let go of me!

921
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:20,323
Stop right there.

922
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:28,813
Who are you?

923
00:44:28,814 --> 00:44:30,363
How much does he owe you?

924
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:33,204
Ten taels.

925
00:44:34,694 --> 00:44:35,684
Qingli.

926
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,323
I'll repay his debt.

927
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:42,363
Release him.

928
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:50,052
Miss, you look so pretty.

929
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:51,684
You're so kind too.

930
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:54,124
Why don't you come with us?

931
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:56,092
You can

932
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,333
keep the money.

933
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:58,564
How dare you?

934
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:03,763
I can leave with you.

935
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:06,243
However, the Minister Office

936
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:08,333
will come and lay waste
to your gambling den

937
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:09,133
in just a few days.

938
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:11,853
The Minister Office?

939
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:12,813
That's right.

940
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:14,044
You better leave!

941
00:45:14,854 --> 00:45:15,644
This...

942
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:17,484
Let's go!

943
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:24,443
Miss, why did you save me?

944
00:45:24,573 --> 00:45:26,283
You remind me of my father.

945
00:45:27,413 --> 00:45:29,164
Although you dress yourself plainly

946
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:30,644
and eat moderately,

947
00:45:31,013 --> 00:45:33,283
you'll work hard just to make money
so that you can buy books.

948
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:34,853
Father said

949
00:45:34,854 --> 00:45:35,892
people like you

950
00:45:35,893 --> 00:45:37,883
could become
the next pillar of the nation.

951
00:45:41,854 --> 00:45:42,803
Thank you.

952
00:45:44,214 --> 00:45:45,693
I'll repay the money to you
in the future.

953
00:45:45,694 --> 00:45:46,524
No need for that.

954
00:45:48,933 --> 00:45:49,800
You'll be repaying me

955
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,204
if you pass the imperial examination,

956
00:45:51,294 --> 00:45:52,883
and become a good official.
