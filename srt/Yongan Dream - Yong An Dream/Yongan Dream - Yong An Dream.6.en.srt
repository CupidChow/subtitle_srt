Yan.

19
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:47,786
Greetings, Mother.

20
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:50,307
Mother,

21
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,387
what brings you here?

22
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:53,995
Do you know how long

23
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,036
you haven't come home?

24
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:57,075
Are you not letting me come and see you?

25
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,387
I've been busy with official duties.

26
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:01,826
Busy, huh?

27
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:02,475
Mother, please sit.

28
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:03,755
So busy that you forget about me.

29
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,507
I dare not.

30
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:09,027
In my mind,

31
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:10,827
I think of you

32
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:14,027
all the time, Mother.

33
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:17,547
You've finally come to your senses.

34
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,307
Mother,

35
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:21,506
what do you mean by that?

36
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:22,666
Yan,

37
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:24,707
you're not young anymore.

38
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:25,995
There are things

39
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:27,547
that I can understand.

40
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:30,626
But we're from the prestigious
Duke Zhenguo Residence's household.

41
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:33,555
This may be only a side courtyard.

42
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:34,755
But you can't behave recklessly

43
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,307
on certain things.

44
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:39,035
What did I do?

45
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,356
Just now in the courtyard,

46
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:41,875
I saw a woman

47
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,956
with heavy makeup.

48
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:44,796
She's clearly someone

49
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,786
from a brothel.

50
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:50,035
Mother,

51
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,636
she's an important witness.

52
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,676
I have to keep her close

53
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,386
and protect her personally.

54
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:55,946
That important?

55
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,186
All right, then.

56
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:00,707
If she's a witness,

57
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,386
then it doesn't matter if I hit her.

58
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:05,267
You hit her?

59
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:07,196
Well, I thought

60
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:09,396
she came from a brothel.

61
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,236
She even told me
she was staying here temporarily.

62
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:12,755
Women like her

63
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:15,226
will pull themselves up high
when given a chance.

64
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,226
Besides,

65
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,196
you're not good

66
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,027
at handling these things.

67
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:22,595
So I let her know

68
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:25,386
the standards of the Duke's household.

69
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:41,226
Mother,

70
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,027
we're going to Wuzhou tomorrow.

71
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:46,196
Please watch over us

72
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:47,916
so we can find Uncle Lu

73
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,427
and the construction plans soon.

74
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:51,467
Only then can we save Father.

75
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:03,707
Official Lu,

76
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,427
why are you here?

77
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:18,587
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,546
My mother misunderstood you.

79
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:24,515
It's all right.

80
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,036
From the way I dressed at the time,

81
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:28,306
it's normal for her to misunderstand.

82
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,236
Your mother wants me
to leave right away.

83
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,276
I was thinking since we're setting out
to Wuzhou tomorrow

84
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:33,116
and

85
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:33,875
I won't

86
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:35,426
be coming back here anymore,

87
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:37,187
she won't find fault with me

88
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,346
if I stayed another night, right?

89
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,156
No,

90
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,786
I've explained it to her already.

91
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:45,596
Why didn't you tell her

92
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:47,116
that you're Official Shen's daughter?

93
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,315
You're a court official.

94
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:50,587
It'll tarnish your image
for taking in a criminal's daughter.

95
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:51,836
Besides,

96
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,866
how was I supposed to tell her

97
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:56,635
that I was a minister's daughter
when I dressed like that?

98
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,875
Then why did you insist
on going to Wuzhou?

99
00:04:58,876 --> 00:04:59,955
I'm willing to do anything

100
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,666
to save my father.

101
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:07,226
Give it to me.

102
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:11,866
What?

103
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:14,827
I meant the bangle.

104
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,555
Give the bangle to me.

105
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:17,707
I'll get it fixed for you.

106
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:21,476
It's all right.

107
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,836
One should compensate accordingly

108
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,627
after damaging someone else's property.

109
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:25,986
If they can't compensate,

110
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,106
they should at least try
to make up for it.

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,580
(Li Residence)

112
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:00,666
Ran.

113
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:01,786
Dear,

114
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:03,906
come and look at these.

115
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:05,546
What are these?

116
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:06,995
Ran, what are these for?

117
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:09,596
Last time at the promotion banquet,
I didn't treat the guests well.

118
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:10,515
After giving it a thought,

119
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:11,916
I was worried gossip

120
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,716
would shame the Li Residence.

121
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,100
So I prepared these high-class gifts

122
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:17,676
to send to the various departments
of the Minister of Water Resources,

123
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,836
to assist you in repairing

124
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,746
the West Canal without issues.

125
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:21,356
Take a look

126
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:22,955
and see if these gifts are appropriate.

127
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:23,836
Why are you

128
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:25,387
so considerate today?

129
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:26,796
Previously,

130
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,906
Father and Zhen encountered
a series of incidents.

131
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,356
I was at a loss

132
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,546
and panicked

133
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:34,106
that I forgot that I'm married.

134
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,666
I should prioritize the Li family first.

135
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:39,707
I was too immature before.

136
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:41,916
Your thoughts alone are enough.

137
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,156
You don't have

138
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,875
to trouble yourself
and spend so much money.

139
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,435
It's hard for you to be an official.

140
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:47,596
These gifts were purchased

141
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:48,875
with Baixiang Pavilion's profits.

142
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,796
In the future,

143
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,635
I'll definitely work hard to run the shop

144
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:52,515
and support the family.

145
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:54,666
All right. I want to show you something.

146
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,027
This is...

147
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:03,467
Is this a suet jade bangle?

148
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,836
Something as expensive as this

149
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:07,596
should be given to Mother.

150
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:08,796
Don't worry about that.

151
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:10,827
I've already prepared gifts for her.

152
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,916
Now that I've been promoted

153
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,346
and given a raise,

154
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:15,435
you don't need

155
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,916
to work so hard anymore.

156
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,435
Just stay home and enjoy your life

157
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:19,507
as my wife.

158
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,707
Thank you, dear.

159
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,746
You're so kind to me.

160
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:42,116
Look at this.

161
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,476
What treasure is this?

162
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:44,836
It's so exquisite.

163
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,676
Yes, it is.

164
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:46,587
Mother.

165
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:54,947
Greetings, Mother.

166
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:56,156
Well,

167
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:57,995
this is unexpected.

168
00:07:57,996 --> 00:07:59,635
You would actually come

169
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:01,426
to pay respects to me today.

170
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:03,267
Li was promoted at work

171
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,746
and you worked hard in preparing
the banquet on my behalf.

172
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,195
So I prepared a small gift

173
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,627
to show my filial piety.

174
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,755
Although the quality is average,

175
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:24,507
I don't always enjoy
your thoughtfulness.

176
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:33,275
The ring on your finger

177
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:34,875
looks truly extraordinary.

178
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,716
The gem is well-rounded and pure.

179
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,915
I have never seen such a treasure.

180
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:39,995
May I know

181
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:41,587
where did you buy it?

182
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:44,907
It's a gift from Di.

183
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,275
I heard

184
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,755
it was bought from the Hu merchants
in the Western Regions.

185
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:49,995
In the capital,

186
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,947
it's the only one.

187
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:56,827
Li really put his heart into it.

188
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,956
In the future,

189
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,795
I'll also follow my husband's example

190
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:01,226
to be more filial.

191
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:09,196
Madam,

192
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:11,316
I have checked the household accounts.

193
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,236
The items in Old Madam's room

194
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:14,915
were not purchased from the account.

195
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,515
Although Master has been promoted

196
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:18,236
and has a higher salary now,

197
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,907
he still cannot afford
such expensive items.

198
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:22,236
It seems that Li Di

199
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:24,067
has secretly made a fortune.

200
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:28,506
But where did this money come from?

201
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,635
Pick a few clever ladies

202
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,995
from our jewelry and cosmetics shop

203
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:33,795
to mingle with the He family.

204
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:34,667
Yes, Madam.

205
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,427
My father suffers from an old ailment.

206
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,035
Every rainy season,

207
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,866
he suffers unbearable pain.

208
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,587
I have some medicine here.

209
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:01,907
I wonder if you could...

210
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,547
You're just endless.

211
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:09,675
What do you

212
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,196
take me for?

213
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:13,386
Forgive me

214
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,106
for being senseless.

215
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:17,707
But my father

216
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,266
can't hold on much longer.

217
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,907
(I wasn't apprehending her.)

218
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,026
(But I even punished her.)

219
00:10:59,077 --> 00:10:59,995
(But why did it seem)

220
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:01,707
(I brought her home?)

221
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,787
Was I taking advantage of her?

222
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,467
Was I that brutal?

223
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,956
Oh, Miss Shen.

224
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,076
I beg you

225
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:16,067
to stop appearing in my dreams.

226
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,866
Please.

227
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:19,836
Come.

228
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:20,746
Yang Zong,

229
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:22,556
why are there so many things?

230
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,316
Don't forget this.

231
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,667
Ask Miss Shen.

232
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:26,266
These are ours.

233
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:33,986
What's this?

234
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,146
It's something I need later.

235
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:43,346
Wait, not there.

236
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,307
Put it in the carriage.

237
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:47,356
What?

238
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,746
Thank you, Official Lu.

239
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,226
Miss Shen,

240
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,956
the heavy box

241
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,556
that you brought along
turns out to be containing legal texts.

242
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:19,675
You always speak of the law.

243
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:20,875
So I should study more

244
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,187
about laws.

245
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,635
Maybe it'll be useful

246
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:24,986
to save my father later.

247
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,275
It sounds like you don't believe me.

248
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,316
Well, no.

249
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,746
Isn't it good for me to know more?

250
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:36,875
Decapitation, amputation,
exposure of body in public,

251
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:38,556
furry...

252
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,556
It's castration,

253
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,866
and penal servitude
are the five levels of punishment.

254
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,746
This one is too hard.

255
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,547
For men, it's...

256
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:57,386
For women, it's...

257
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:04,196
I only wanted to ask you

258
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,556
how to pronounce these two characters.

259
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:06,915
Who wants to get close to you?

260
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,146
Grinding grain.

261
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:10,226
Do you even know all the characters?

262
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:14,196
Why are the words so obscure?

263
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:15,635
What does "grinding grain" mean?

264
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:16,716
Hard labor.

265
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:18,596
They can just write it as hard labor.

266
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,635
The law itself is meant

267
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:21,995
for the people
to understand and adhere to.

268
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:24,436
How do we expect people to understand it

269
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,827
if it's too obscure?

270
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:27,667
Miss Shen,

271
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:30,746
are you willing to do anything

272
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:33,236
to save your father?

273
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:33,795
Of course,

274
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,076
I'm willing to do anything.

275
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:37,307
Otherwise, would I willingly
be your concubine?

276
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:41,716
I understand your desire
to save your father.

277
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,506
But you must remember

278
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:46,506
that some things can be done,
some things cannot.

279
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:49,236
What do you mean by some things can
and some cannot be done?

280
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,755
You must have a bottom line.

281
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:53,307
As long as I follow you
handling your investigations,

282
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:54,635
what possibly

283
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:55,875
could I do

284
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,307
that would cross the bottom line?

285
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:03,226
(So it's still all up to me.)

286
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,076
Miss, please take a look

287
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:25,707
and pick any that you like.

288
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,827
Miss, how many seats?

289
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,316
I'm looking for someone.

290
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,226
All right.

291
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,707
People and mountains.

292
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:41,635
The road is bumpy.

293
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:42,956
You'll feel nauseated

294
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,076
if you keep reading.

295
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,076
I don't think I feel nauseated
from the ride.

296
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,106
It's from reading.

297
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,427
Yang Zong.

298
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:52,116
Yes, Master?

299
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,275
Is there any inn nearby?

300
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,716
We were delayed in our journey.

301
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:56,035
I'm afraid we can only find an inn

302
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,187
after we cross that mountain.

303
00:15:58,597 --> 00:15:59,515
I'm all right.

304
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:01,506
I can continue the journey.

305
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,266
Don't you dare vomit.

306
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,187
No!

307
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:07,635
Madam,

308
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,100
the ladies from our shop

309
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:09,875
have been flattering

310
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:11,795
Madam He so much that she's thrilled.

311
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:12,515
They are now

312
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:14,196
on good terms with Madam He

313
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,146
and have learned quite
a bit of information.

314
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:17,795
Madam He is from Meizhou,

315
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:20,035
Li Di's hometown.

316
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:21,356
The He family in Meizhou

317
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,755
doesn't own much property.

318
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:24,947
Their lives were actually quite hard.

319
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:26,915
But two years ago,

320
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,275
Madam He suddenly left Meizhou
to move to the capital.

321
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:30,476
In just half a year,

322
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:31,395
she moved into

323
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:32,635
the current house on Minqin Lane

324
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,907
and frequently visited Xue Money House.

325
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,866
Two years ago?

326
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:38,196
Isn't that the time

327
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,986
the construction
of the West Canal began?

328
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:43,307
Xue Money House?

329
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,220
(Inn Taoyuan)

330
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,106
Halt!

331
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:53,427
Master, we've arrived.

332
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:11,796
From this moment on,

333
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,506
you're Mrs. Qin.

334
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:15,387
Yes, Wei.

335
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,836
Are you stopping for a break
or staying here?

336
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:40,875
We're staying.

337
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,387
All right.

338
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,116
Qiao, come and lend them a hand.

339
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:51,947
Sure.

340
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:56,546
You have so many things.

341
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,347
We can take care of these ourselves.

342
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:00,875
My apologies.

343
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:01,635
Apologies.

344
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:02,875
- Let me put it back down.
- Apologies.

345
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:04,195
How many rooms do you have here?

346
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:06,627
Our rooms on the ground and first floor
are available.

347
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:07,746
Perfect.

348
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:08,996
We'd like to book

349
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,556
the entire inn today.

350
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,506
Please do not accept other guests.

351
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:16,715
Of course.

352
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:17,715
I can tell

353
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:20,347
that both of you are wealthy.

354
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:21,955
Both of you

355
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,516
must be tired from the journey.

356
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:24,195
Qiao,

357
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:25,955
bring these guests to the first floor.

358
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:26,556
All right.

359
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:27,475
Please come with me.

360
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,306
Please.

361
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:33,586
Watch the steps.

362
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:36,907
Prepare some good wine and food.

363
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,316
Don't worry.

364
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,276
I guarantee

365
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:41,026
you'll be satisfied.

366
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:42,756
Hurry up and slaughter the sheep.

367
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:43,516
All right.

368
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:45,707
All of you, follow me.

369
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,867
Please get some rest.

370
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:56,276
What's the matter?

371
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:57,875
We've only begun,
and you can't take it already?

372
00:18:57,876 --> 00:18:59,107
Of course, I can take it.

373
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:00,276
I never said I can't take it.

374
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:01,347
Mister,

375
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,147
I'm here to bring water.

376
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:05,947
Come in.

377
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,516
You must be tired from the journey.

378
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,316
We don't have anything of high quality.

379
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,475
But this herbal foot soak

380
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:13,907
is the best.

381
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,387
Ma'am, aren't you going to help
to soak your husband's feet?

382
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:26,356
I soak them every night.

383
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:28,116
I'll light some incense in your room

384
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:30,546
to get rid of the musty smell.

385
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:40,266
I'm indeed tired from the journey.

386
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:46,235
The herbal foot soak is truly the best

387
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:47,907
for relieving fatigue.

388
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,147
Your feet stink.

389
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,746
That's gross.

390
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:57,867
Take it off yourself.

391
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,786
Oh, dear.

392
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,715
Is the water too hot?

393
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,316
Do you want to fetch some cool water?

394
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,627
The temperature is just right.

395
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,427
It's only soothing when it's hot, right?

396
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:21,867
I'm glad to hear that.

397
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:34,155
Dear,

398
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:35,826
does it feel good?

399
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:41,427
Yes, it does.

400
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:43,596
I'm glad you find it comfortable.

401
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,516
I'm going downstairs
to prepare you dinner.

402
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,390
Please take your time
and enjoy your foot bath.

403
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,107
Thank you.

404
00:20:58,476 --> 00:20:59,235
As a concubine,

405
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:01,116
I don't even have the right
to wash my feet.

406
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:01,955
Not only that,

407
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,516
but I also have to wash your feet.

408
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:04,875
Shen Zhen,

409
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:05,596
do you know

410
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,955
a concubine's way of life?

411
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:08,116
After my mother passed away,

412
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,996
my father never remarried.

413
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:11,707
We don't have
that bad habit in our family.

414
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,546
I want to renegotiate our deal.

415
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:16,036
You want to add another condition?

416
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:16,715
Yes.

417
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:18,316
I don't care how other concubines do it.

418
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:19,996
I'm not doing all those things.

419
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:21,356
I'm a noble concubine

420
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:23,546
whom you sought after and begged for.

421
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:24,756
You must dote on me.

422
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,400
Oh, Shen Zhen.

423
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,516
You're going back on your words
after we left the residence.

424
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:29,435
Previously, you said

425
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:30,756
I could ask you to do anything.

426
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,276
The circumstances have changed now.

427
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:34,356
Now, I'm your only wife.

428
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:36,026
You have to treasure me.

429
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:37,627
Lu Shiyan,

430
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,276
if you make me suffer

431
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:41,947
or unhappy,

432
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:43,907
I'm going to cry.

433
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,427
When I start crying,

434
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,746
I won't be able to stop.

435
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:53,627
Where are you going?

436
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,187
Wash my hands.

437
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:56,907
They stink.

438
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,675
Sir, your dish is here.

439
00:22:04,676 --> 00:22:06,200
Mister, Madam. Please come over.

440
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,316
We've just slaughtered a sheep.

441
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,316
It's as fresh as it gets.

442
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:09,387
Please, sit down.

443
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:11,715
Qiao, bring some charcoal over.

444
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:13,506
I'll be right over!

445
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:21,226
Mister, enjoy your drinks.

446
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:22,395
Let me fill your cup.

447
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:25,026
Other inns are mostly run by men.

448
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:26,756
But you're pretty unique.

449
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:29,155
This inn is actually run by women.

450
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,356
The men

451
00:22:30,357 --> 00:22:31,756
are out working.

452
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:34,226
We're just making
some extra pocket money here.

453
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:36,875
Here, try this grilled lamb.

454
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,907
Please, have a taste.

455
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,026
Well,

456
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:45,635
I haven't even started eating yet,

457
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:47,586
and you're only thinking about yourself?

458
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:51,867
It smells delicious.

459
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:58,427
Delicious.

460
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,147
It's very good.

461
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:03,756
Madam, your hairpin looks pretty.

462
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,467
I've never seen such
a pretty one before.

463
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,596
There are plenty of rare things
you haven't seen before.

464
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,076
Don't disturb the lady's meal.

465
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:12,187
Move aside.

466
00:23:16,837 --> 00:23:18,986
The charcoal is here.

467
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:23,627
Dear guests, please enjoy your meal.

468
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,675
Add more.

469
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:25,506
All right.

470
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:30,907
I'll be over there.

471
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,506
Everyone, please enjoy your meal.

472
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,667
It's really tasty.

473
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:47,316
Is the lamb leg ready?

474
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:47,875
Yes.

475
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:49,826
Dear guests, the lamb leg is ready.

476
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,596
The lamb is ready.

477
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:51,786
Time to eat, then.

478
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:55,915
This wine may be harsh.

479
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,475
But it has its own flavor.

480
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:59,986
My dear, have a sip.

481
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:02,756
Dear, I can't hold my drinks.

482
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:03,675
Just try it.

483
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:04,556
I'm here.

484
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:06,076
It doesn't matter if you're drunk.

485
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,195
Besides,

486
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,266
it's how much you choose to drink
that makes you drunk.

487
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:11,107
Have some.

488
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:15,826
Eat up.

489
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:24,506
Gentlemen,

490
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:25,867
raise your cup.

491
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:27,556
It was a long journey.

492
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:28,756
Thank you for your hard work.

493
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:30,996
A toast from me.

494
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:33,026
A toast to you, Master.

495
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,155
Qingxi, drink up.

496
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:39,147
No.

497
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:46,986
Dear,

498
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,435
I told you

499
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:49,986
I can't hold my drinks.

500
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:55,395
You truly

501
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,226
can't hold your drinks.

502
00:24:57,436 --> 00:24:59,226
The wine you serve

503
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:03,187
is truly strong.

504
00:25:19,037 --> 00:25:20,586
You tainted it with something.

505
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,306
You know what to do.

506
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:33,586
You wouldn't dare.

507
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,347
I am the Governor of Wuzhou.

508
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:40,356
Governor of Wuzhou?

509
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:42,155
Corrupt official! I'm going to kill you!

510
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:43,195
- Qiao!
- Qiao!

511
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:43,836
Calm down.

512
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:44,556
Calm down, Qiao.

513
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:45,516
If I get out of here,

514
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:47,155
I'll surely sentence you to death.

515
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:48,546
We're not afraid of you!

516
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:49,435
Corrupt official!

517
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:51,667
I'll chop you into pieces for the dogs!

518
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:52,707
That's enough!

519
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:54,667
Take Qiao away.

520
00:25:54,757 --> 00:25:55,746
Madam Zhuang,

521
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:57,707
if we hold the governor hostage,

522
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,475
can we exchange him for our husbands?

523
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,306
Shut up.

524
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:04,546
Tie them up first.

525
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:18,907
Everyone, get up!

526
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:24,746
- Let us go!
- Let me go!

527
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:26,667
Don't do anything reckless!

528
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:28,867
Qingxi.

529
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:31,400
Qingxi, wake up.

530
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,036
She didn't take the antidote just now.

531
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:33,996
The smoke

532
00:26:33,997 --> 00:26:35,036
was not very toxic.

533
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:36,546
She'll wake up soon.

534
00:26:37,716 --> 00:26:39,427
So you've planned from the beginning.

535
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:41,635
You were the one who plotted against us.

536
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,826
I merely took care of your plot.

537
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,356
I suppose this place

538
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:52,915
was originally abandoned.

539
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,667
You set it up temporarily.

540
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:55,915
You lit the incense

541
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:56,715
only

542
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,546
to cover up the musty smell
inside the room.

543
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:00,435
But the wood endured dampness,
extreme heat,

544
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:01,435
and temperature changes,

545
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:02,715
causing many cracks.

546
00:27:02,716 --> 00:27:04,387
Even if you have very few guests,

547
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,836
as long as someone stayed
in here recently,

548
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:09,387
there wouldn't be cobwebs
under the table.

549
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,036
So

550
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:12,076
to know

551
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:13,586
your next plan,

552
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,915
I sent Yang Zong to replace the wine

553
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,986
with an antidote in advance.

554
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:19,955
I wanted to see

555
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:22,627
what you're up to.

556
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:34,546
Ma'am, there are too many loopholes.

557
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,836
According to the law,
the crime of gang robbery

558
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:40,155
is punishable by death by dismemberment.

559
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:41,187
Dismemberment?

560
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:43,116
What's dismemberment?

561
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,235
What is that?

562
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:45,707
Cutting flesh from bones.

563
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,187
Cutting flesh from our bones?

564
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,107
Madam Zhuang.

565
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:56,715
I was the one

566
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,195
who plotted everything.

567
00:27:58,196 --> 00:27:59,596
They were all forced.

568
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:00,596
I don't care what you do.

569
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,955
Just come for me alone

570
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:02,675
and let them go!

571
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:04,306
- Madam.
- Madam.

572
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:05,707
Madam Zhuang,

573
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:06,635
we only took

574
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:08,306
some money.

575
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,066
We never harmed anyone.

576
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:11,796
You, corrupt officials.

577
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:13,875
You fear those with money and power.

578
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:15,235
All you know is to use the law

579
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:15,955
to bully us

580
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:17,907
who are barely surviving.

581
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:21,506
Who do we fear?

582
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:22,955
Why does she have

583
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,707
such hatred toward Wuzhou's officials?

584
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:26,387
It's Zhao Chong.

585
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:28,147
He took our husband away

586
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:30,556
to be laborers.

587
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:33,306
He won't release them
until they're dead.

588
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:36,266
As for her,

589
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:39,756
both her husband's and her son's bodies

590
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:42,786
were sent back on the same day!

591
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:47,546
My husband and my son?

592
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:49,756
That can't be.

593
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:51,667
No, it's impossible!

594
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:54,306
I didn't see them.

595
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,627
I didn't see that.

596
00:28:57,797 --> 00:28:58,907
Why did Zhao Chong

597
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:00,826
take your husbands away?

598
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:02,627
I didn't see their bodies.

599
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:03,707
Logging.

600
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:04,826
Logging?

601
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,826
Logging requires an official document.

602
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,380
For him to resort to forced labor,
what kind of wood is he logging?

603
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:11,387
I secretly followed once.

604
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,786
In the depths of the forest,

605
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,427
they're logging willow.

606
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:18,316
The logging operates day and night.

607
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:19,715
As long as they haven't died,

608
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,347
they cannot stop.

609
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:23,107
Willow?

610
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,746
Where is the timber
being transported to?

611
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:32,306
Could it be related to my father?

612
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:35,316
Mother!

613
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,786
You hit my mother!

614
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:37,395
Mother!

615
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:38,875
All of you are bad people!

616
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:40,235
Why did you come out here?

617
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,116
Didn't I tell you

618
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:41,996
not to come out

619
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,155
no matter what happens?

620
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:43,996
Mother,

621
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:45,596
we can protect all of you.

622
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:46,435
We can do it.

623
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,356
We can protect you.

624
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:50,187
Child, come here.

625
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:52,116
No, don't!

626
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:52,947
Bad people!

627
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:54,187
Don't go near them.

628
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:57,026
They're orphans from the village.

629
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,915
How can women and children

630
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,155
like us survive

631
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:02,147
in such a world?

632
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:03,955
Mother, please don't cry.

633
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:05,107
You still have me.

634
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:24,826
Mother.

635
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:13,546
What are you thinking about?

636
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,596
The wood used for the West Canal

637
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:17,667
is pine wood

638
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,800
and was purchased from Wuzhou.

639
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,475
But Wuzhou has been
privately logging willow wood

640
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:23,347
in large quantities
over the past two years.

641
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:24,786
Is there

642
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,467
a connection?

643
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:30,306
If there is a problem with this wood,

644
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:31,756
it must be related

645
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,107
to my brother-in-law.

646
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:35,746
Let's not jump to conclusions.

647
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,226
This case is complicated.

648
00:31:37,357 --> 00:31:39,506
We still don't know how much Li Di
is involved in this.

649
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:48,947
What do you plan to do

650
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:51,506
with Madam Zhuang and the rest?

651
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:54,226
The evidence of their gang theft
is conclusive.

652
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:57,427
But they are not criminals
beyond redemption.

653
00:31:57,557 --> 00:31:59,387
They were forced to do this to survive.

654
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:00,867
They had no choice.

655
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:04,475
The existence of the law

656
00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:05,907
is to punish

657
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:08,107
and deter potential wrongdoing.

658
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:09,395
If I don't address this today,

659
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,556
everyone will follow suit,

660
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:11,996
saying they had no choice as a reason

661
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,116
to absolve

662
00:32:13,117 --> 00:32:13,955
all their crimes.

663
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:16,226
Wouldn't that mean
everyone can commit crimes?

664
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:17,996
The existence of the law

665
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:19,316
is to punish

666
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:20,586
and to deter.

667
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:22,546
It can also protect.

668
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:23,500
It protects those

669
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,635
who cannot protect themselves

670
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:26,506
against injustice

671
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:27,756
and those

672
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:28,596
who cannot guarantee

673
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:30,427
their own livelihoods.

674
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:34,395
No one is born a criminal.

675
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:37,556
They all have various reasons
that lead them astray.

676
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:38,986
You can sympathize.

677
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,235
But you have no right
to forgive their wrongdoing

678
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:42,986
on behalf of those who have been harmed.

679
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:45,107
If there are other ways,

680
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:46,796
they would hope

681
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,867
to live an honest life.

682
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,036
The law

683
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,195
can be the final straw

684
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:52,635
that overwhelms them.

685
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:54,147
But it can also

686
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:55,395
be the last hope

687
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:57,347
that redeems them.

688
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:25,226
Eat something.

689
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:27,107
Thank you.

690
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:29,867
I also sent food to the others.

691
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:36,586
How do you plan to deal
with those children?

692
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,306
I don't know yet.

693
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:43,867
You travel here with a purpose.

694
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,195
That man

695
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:47,667
isn't an official from Wuzhou.

696
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:49,867
You're also not his concubine.

697
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:53,066
He was probing every single time.

698
00:33:53,236 --> 00:33:54,316
He also provoked Qiao

699
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,066
on purpose.

700
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:58,066
As for you and him,

701
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:01,235
I have enough experience to know.

702
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:02,556
I have seen all kinds of men

703
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:04,387
amid debauchery.

704
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,955
But you look like a young lady
with a proper upbringing

705
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:09,626
who has been forcibly taken away.

706
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:16,795
I will send someone
to take those children

707
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:18,666
to the orphanages in the capital.

708
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:20,347
Those orphanages

709
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,947
will receive financial aid from me.

710
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:23,387
So don't worry.

711
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:25,427
Really?

712
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:27,146
Thank you so much.

713
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:28,986
As for you ladies...

714
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:30,986
She knows Zhao Chong.

715
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,706
She has been to Wuzhou

716
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:34,467
and knows about the logging.

717
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:36,106
If she can assist in the investigation,

718
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:38,387
can her punishment be lightened?

719
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:42,706
Are you investigating Zhao Chong?

720
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:45,506
You're an official?

721
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:48,427
I'm Lu Shiyan, an Imperial Inspector
from the Magistrate Office.

722
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:51,907
You may be the Imperial Inspector.

723
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:54,827
But Zhao Chong has been rampant
in Wuzhou for a long time.

724
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:56,706
Do you have the capability to do it?

725
00:34:57,437 --> 00:34:59,227
Are you saying we shouldn't do it

726
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:01,506
because we can't?

727
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:09,355
We don't ask for leniency,

728
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:11,066
just a temporary reprieve.

729
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,307
I'm willing to risk my life to help you.

730
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:14,436
In this life,

731
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:15,675
I only want to see Zhao Chong

732
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:17,186
brought to justice.

733
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:26,747
Don't you trust me?

734
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:41,026
Madam Zhuang,

735
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,747
you hate Zhao Chong to the core.

736
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:02,626
And I need to tread carefully.

737
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:05,947
I

738
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:08,066
shall obey your every word,

739
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,626
and I will not act rashly.

740
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:16,227
We shall depart tomorrow.

741
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:18,586
I'm fine.

742
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:21,706
I'm all right.

743
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:55,186
Shen Zhen.

744
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:07,066
Don't catch my father.

745
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:09,827
Father.

746
00:37:11,117 --> 00:37:12,106
Father.

747
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:16,066
Father, don't go.

748
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:18,675
Shen Zhen.

749
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:19,635
Father.

750
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,467
Don't take my father away.

751
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:23,235
Shen Zhen.

752
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:24,666
Don't go.

753
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,467
Father.

754
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:28,706
Father.

755
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,275
All right.

756
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:32,155
Father.

757
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:33,307
I won't leave.

758
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:34,907
Stop crying.

759
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:45,267
Father...

760
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:57,916
Shen Zhen.

761
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,227
Official Lu treats me well.

762
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:03,907
So don't worry, Father.

763
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,800
(Inn Taoyuan)

764
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:27,907
That's not right.

765
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:28,827
Again.

766
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:32,436
Be more gentle.

767
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:33,586
That hurts.

768
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:35,315
If I cry,

769
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,307
his heart will ache.

770
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,267
That's it.

771
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:41,666
I'm being serious.

772
00:40:47,117 --> 00:40:48,996
Since you're his concubine,

773
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:51,315
that means he's everything to you.

774
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,956
You have to work hard in admiring him,

775
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:56,996
be gentle, and your eyes must be filled
with affection.

776
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:58,835
Come, repeat after me.

777
00:40:58,836 --> 00:41:02,396
Dear Wei.

778
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:04,827
Don't they find it embarrassing
to say it so loudly?

779
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,146
Dear Wei.

780
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:08,195
What are you doing?

781
00:41:08,196 --> 00:41:09,355
Dear Wei.

782
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:10,956
Dear Wei!

783
00:41:10,957 --> 00:41:12,876
Why aren't you in the room?

784
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:13,700
Should I be inside?

785
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:15,275
It's been a long time
since I last visited.

786
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:16,387
(Baixiang Pavilion)
That's right.

787
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:17,340
(Baixiang Pavilion)

788
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,396
- Here.
- Thank you.

789
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:19,176
I finally bought it.

790
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,066
Take care.

791
00:41:20,517 --> 00:41:21,546
Mother,

792
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:23,155
we have some new fragrances.

793
00:41:23,156 --> 00:41:25,155
I've already selected some for you.

794
00:41:25,156 --> 00:41:26,195
Have a look.

795
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,916
If you want to be filial to me,

796
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:30,626
quickly give birth to a grandson for me.

797
00:41:30,957 --> 00:41:32,347
You're right.

798
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:34,506
So many fragrances.

799
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:38,267
Where is the thing I want?

800
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:39,347
Madam He,

801
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,076
I've kept

802
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:42,116
the fragrance

803
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:43,947
you saw that day.

804
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:45,427
Bring it for her quickly.

805
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:49,355
How about

806
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:50,275
you take a look

807
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:51,616
at the other fragrances in our shop?

808
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:52,996
It's really unfortunate today.

809
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:54,315
The batch of items you wanted

810
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:55,876
was taken by someone else a moment ago.

811
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:57,235
Taken away?

812
00:41:57,236 --> 00:41:58,715
But I ordered it first.

813
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,026
Why did you let others have it?

814
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,596
They are officials' family members.

815
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:02,476
A small shop like ours

816
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:04,195
can't afford to offend them.

817
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:05,427
Officials' family members?

818
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:06,635
So what if they are?

819
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:08,146
I'm also a family member of an official.

820
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:09,315
My husband

821
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:11,387
is Official Li
of the Ministry of Water Resources.

822
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,996
Did you say
you're the wife of Official Li

823
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:19,467
from the Ministry of Water Resources?

824
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,307
Yes.

825
00:42:21,836 --> 00:42:22,787
Ru,

826
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,666
what are you doing here?

827
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:25,675
Mother.

828
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,267
Mother, do you know her?

829
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:28,996
Why does she claim

830
00:42:28,997 --> 00:42:30,596
to be Official Li's wife?

831
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:32,467
Li Di is my husband.

832
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,275
I know who you are.

833
00:42:34,276 --> 00:42:35,666
You're...

834
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:38,186
You...

835
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,900
Stop talking nonsense here.

836
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:42,436
It's a serious crime for a man
to marry another woman while married.

837
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,146
It's a serious taboo for officials.

838
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,155
You actually claim to be Official Li's wife

839
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:47,467
to harm my husband.

840
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:49,186
Who are you?

841
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,747
What's your intention?

842
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,400
You... You better leave quickly.

843
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:55,155
- Madam!
- Li Residence doesn't have anyone like you.

844
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:55,596
Mother!

845
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:56,755
Don't ever come again.

846
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:58,635
You better don't implicate my son.

847
00:42:58,636 --> 00:42:59,907
Mother!

848
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:02,827
I'm pregnant.
