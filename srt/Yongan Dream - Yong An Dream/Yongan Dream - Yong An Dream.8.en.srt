Not bad.

19

Come, let's take a look over there.

20
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,569
Well,

21
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,080
this is the famous Zuimeng Bridge,

22
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,640
where merchants and traders
from Wuzhou often gather.

23
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,159
It looks like it's crafted
by a skilled artisan.

24
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,480
Come.

25
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:03,599
Show it to me.

26
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,799
Cheers.

27
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,640
Not bad, indeed.

28
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,120
Let's drink another round.

29
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,369
I can only send you until here.

30
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,879
Zhao Chong is right inside.

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,639
Don't worry.

32
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,079
Don't push yourself too hard

33
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,400
if there's any problem.

34
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,599
You can leave it to me.

35
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,280
Don't worry, dear.

36
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,359
I can handle it.

37
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,079
That's my girl.

38
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,599
Let's go.

39
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,929
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,639
- Drink up.
- Drink.

41
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:56,359
Zhao,

42
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,688
do you know anything

43
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,879
about a wealthy merchant, Wei?

44
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,120
Not too sure.

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,288
But I heard

46
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,359
he's been buying up grain

47
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,759
and paid at a higher price.

48
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,248
Buying up grain?

49
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:11,169
Isn't he getting

50
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,240
in the way of your financial path?

51
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,329
Don't worry about it.

52
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,968
These playboys

53
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:19,209
usually arrive with so much wealth

54
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,400
and leave in disgrace.

55
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,968
With Zhao's current status in Wuzhou,

56
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,359
outsiders can forget

57
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,319
about wanting a piece of the pie.

58
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:31,440
You must not

59
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:34,449
do anything rashly.

60
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,089
Of course.

61
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,329
That's only natural.

62
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,079
We all look up to Zhao.

63
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,440
A toast to Zhao.

64
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:43,359
Cheers.

65
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,000
My name is Wei Xian.

66
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,560
How do you do, Zhao?

67
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,528
I've heard of you for a long time.

68
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:09,968
Now that I'm meeting you in person,

69
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,639
you truly live up to your reputation.

70
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,919
So, you're Wei.

71
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,769
I heard

72
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,168
you're quite an expert in painting.

73
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,449
Coming here uninvited

74
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,728
is a bit presumptuous.

75
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:23,368
So I've brought a painting
of Master Li's "Spring River"

76
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:24,368
as a gift.

77
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:25,480
"Spring River"?

78
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,480
It really is the "Spring River".

79
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,089
I can't believe he possessed
the "Spring River".

80
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,759
Is it authentic?

81
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,360
Please move.

82
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,480
How arrogant.

83
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:09,759
You're a guest from afar.

84
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,440
Please take a seat.

85
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,488
Even if you don't come today,

86
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,528
with the prominence
you're gaining in Wuzhou,

87
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,449
I'm sure in a few days,

88
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,048
I will go and visit

89
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:30,168
to invite you in person.

90
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:31,728
I dare not accept such courtesy.

91
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,168
I'm new here.

92
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,209
How could I trouble you
to come to my door?

93
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,129
I heard

94
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,480
you've been buying up
a large quantity of grain recently.

95
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,759
I assume you intend

96
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,689
to get involved in trading grain.

97
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,120
Not quite.

98
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,240
I intend to brew wine.

99
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,569
Wine?

100
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,160
With the price you're buying grain at,

101
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,209
even if you manage to brew wine,

102
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,639
this trade

103
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,889
won't be easy.

104
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,850
I have a secret wine brewing recipe,

105
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:58,399
which has an extremely
high-profit margin.

106
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,368
I heard

107
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:00,968
you have many grain shops.

108
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,089
Are you willing

109
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,968
to do this business together?

110
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,879
It'll save me time
from purchasing grain.

111
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,528
With your help,

112
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,360
this business

113
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,168
is already more than half a success.

114
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,040
Here.

115
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:16,600
A toast to you as a sign of respect.

116
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,889
Since you have such sincerity,

117
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,839
I will naturally be willing
to lend a hand.

118
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,040
Cheers.

119
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,399
Actually,

120
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,449
there's no need to rush

121
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,160
to talk business right away.

122
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,519
Fuman.

123
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,240
Greetings, gentlemen.

124
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,649
Fuman's pipa playing is exquisite.

125
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,089
You're both from Jingzhou.

126
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,569
Do you have

127
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,209
any favorite tunes?

128
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,408
Let's see if Fuman can play them.

129
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:13,719
People from Jingzhou
love Jiangling music.

130
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,399
Do you know of it?

131
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,168
As a matter of fact,

132
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,240
I do.

133
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,719
I'll do my best to play them.

134
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,848
But speaking of which,

135
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:37,488
you're from Jingzhou.

136
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,569
How come you don't have an accent?

137
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,480
You sound more like someone
from the capital.

138
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,649
Jingzhou dialect is difficult
to understand.

139
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,209
It's better to speak the capital's dialect
when you're away from home.

140
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,968
Besides, even though I grew up
in Jingzhou,

141
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,408
I've been using the capital's dialect
since I was a child.

142
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,728
After all these years,

143
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,920
I've really forgotten the local accent.

144
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,719
You are indeed a businessman.

145
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,809
I've been to Jiangling City

146
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,680
in Jingzhou too.

147
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,408
The crab roe fish fin

148
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,399
at Wangjiang Restaurant

149
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,680
is truly unforgettable.

150
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,488
I think you meant

151
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,368
Wangyue Restaurant.

152
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:17,889
Both of the names are similar.

153
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,959
Outsiders often confuse them.

154
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,209
Crab roe fish fin

155
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,170
is Wangyue Restaurant's specialty.

156
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:25,608
Although Wangjiang Restaurant's name
carries the meaning of a river,

157
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:27,800
fish is not their expertise.

158
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,129
Ah, yes.

159
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,199
I must have remembered it wrong.

160
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,488
This young lady is beautiful.

161
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,239
How should I address you?

162
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,640
My name is Qin Qing.

163
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,239
Madam Qin, judging from your accent,
you must be from the capital.

164
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,400
Yes.

165
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:51,409
The capital is indeed a place
of talented individuals.

166
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,689
Madam Qin's demeanor

167
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,608
is probably

168
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,128
not inferior

169
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,319
to those high-born ladies.

170
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,368
You're flattering her

171
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:02,839
too much.

172
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,449
That's because Madam Qin

173
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,239
is worthy of praise.

174
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,479
Well played.

175
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:14,760
Not bad.

176
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:29,760
This is our famous Yunyue wine in Wuzhou.

177
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,920
Why not use it

178
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,040
to toast Mr. Zhao?

179
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,839
A toast to you, Mr. Zhao.

180
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,999
Are you all right?

181
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:53,599
I'm fine.

182
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,560
I'm not good at drinking.

183
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:57,719
Not bad.

184
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:58,999
Fill her cup.

185
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,248
Miss Man, no need to trouble yourself.

186
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:07,049
I can pour it myself.

187
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,719
How can I let you do that?

188
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,608
You're our guest.

189
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,920
Madam Qin,

190
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,440
you don't have to be so polite.

191
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:15,560
Here.

192
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,608
She was never good at drinking.

193
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,319
She would get drunk with one cup.

194
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,160
Sorry for being rude.

195
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,400
No matter.

196
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,648
A beautiful drunk woman

197
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,359
is also a beautiful sight.

198
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:39,648
Madam Qin,

199
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:42,280
how did you end up as Wei's concubine?

200
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,599
I lost my parents at a young age.

201
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,680
Later, my uncle drove me
out of the house.

202
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:51,809
It was thanks to Master Wei's help

203
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,760
that I survived.

204
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:58,520
She is indeed a pitiable person.

205
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,008
You're favored by Wei.

206
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,409
I suppose your life

207
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,199
is better now.

208
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,329
His wife doesn't like me.

209
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,169
So I've been staying
at the side courtyard

210
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,040
and never entered the main residence.

211
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,049
Wei,

212
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,719
why didn't you stand up for her?

213
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,409
I'm helpless in family matters.

214
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,959
I have more peace

215
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,680
with her staying outside.

216
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:27,839
All right.

217
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:31,569
Another toast to Madam Qin.

218
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,640
Let's drink together.

219
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,199
It's just strange to me

220
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,289
that Mrs. Wei is
from the Wang clan of Langya,

221
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,160
which is a scholarly family,

222
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,089
is also subjected to jealousy.

223
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,280
(Is Mrs. Wei from Langya?)

224
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,248
Madam Qin, don't worry.

225
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,768
No matter what you say today,

226
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,569
Wei won't blame you.

227
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,440
Am I right?

228
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:02,839
Of course.

229
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,359
Mr. Zhao,

230
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,520
I think you were deceived.

231
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,169
How could she compare

232
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,920
to the Wang clan of Langya?

233
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,848
I think it's just a coincidence

234
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:17,008
that they share the surname Wang.

235
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,809
It's just a false appearance
of being noble.

236
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,280
Qing, you've had too much drink.

237
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,839
No, I haven't drunk that much.

238
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:23,689
Dear,

239
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,768
tell me

240
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:26,640
when you're going to divorce her?

241
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,929
Qing,

242
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,329
why don't you get some rest

243
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,440
and sober up?

244
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:32,509
Zong.

245
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,089
- Yes, Master.
- Take Madam Qin downstairs.

246
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,888
Yes, Master.

247
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:35,500
No.

248
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,128
- I asked you a question.
- Watch your steps.

249
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,198
- Let's get you sober up.
-OK...

250
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:39,400
- Dear...
- Be a good girl.

251
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,209
-Be good.
-You're already drunk. Watch your steps.

252
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,230
Go and get some fresh air.

253
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:42,968
Dear...

254
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:44,599
Too much drink brings trouble.

255
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,529
I apologize

256
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,608
that you had to witness that.

257
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,800
No matter.

258
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,640
Wei, what do you think about Miss Man?

259
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,608
She's beautiful.

260
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,409
How about I give her to you?

261
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,680
As for your Qin Qing,

262
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:04,520
I've taken a liking to her.

263
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,128
I don't have

264
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,760
the habit of coveting
other people's things.

265
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,728
She's only a concubine.

266
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,768
We're both people with great ambitions.

267
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,119
We shouldn't be bound
by trivial matters.

268
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,719
I came here today

269
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,689
to discuss business with you.

270
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,560
If you're not interested,

271
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,400
we can forget about it.

272
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,368
There's no need

273
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,319
to ruin our relationship.

274
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,569
What if

275
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm interested in Madam Qin?

276
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,999
Since you have no intention
of cooperating with me,

277
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,959
I think I shall keep

278
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,520
the "Spring River" for now.

279
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:25,768
There seems

280
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,800
to be a problem with the wine.

281
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,440
It shouldn't affect me so much
after just one glass.

282
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:32,239
That was Yunyue wine.

283
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,880
It can make one disoriented.

284
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,209
No wonder I can't remember

285
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,040
Mrs. Wei's background.

286
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,359
Luckily, I didn't give myself away.

287
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:43,839
How did it go?

288
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,079
Did you gain their trust?

289
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,160
Why aren't you speaking?

290
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:53,359
Say something.

291
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,209
Why did you take this painting back?

292
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,089
Parting on bad terms.

293
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,160
Why?

294
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,049
Zhao Chong

295
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,680
went too far.

296
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,728
Isn't it normal

297
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,929
for someone like him

298
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,319
to cross the line?

299
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,128
We've put in so much effort

300
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:10,648
just to get close to him.

301
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,719
What can't we tolerate?

302
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,319
That's...

303
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,119
No matter what,

304
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:21,680
I know

305
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,119
what can

306
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,488
and cannot be tolerated.

307
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:25,929
Get on the carriage now.

308
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,520
Lu Shiyan!

309
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,089
My father will be executed

310
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,800
in two months.

311
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,128
I don't care anymore.

312
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:34,488
I pretended to be your concubine

313
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:36,329
and entered a place like this.

314
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,239
I even washed your feet.

315
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,608
I've already done

316
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:42,280
what I should and shouldn't do.

317
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,929
The construction plans
are with Zhao Chong.

318
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,248
We're only one step away.

319
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:47,760
Why can't you tolerate it?

320
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,368
Yes, you are the Imperial Inspector.

321
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:52,160
You're only investigating a case.

322
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,239
But that's my father.

323
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,289
Why can't you tolerate it?

324
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,680
I'll tolerate it.

325
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,600
I'll find another way.

326
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:00,768
If you think of another way,

327
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,329
this matter will be delayed even more.

328
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,008
I can't wait

329
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,488
and my father can't wait either.

330
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:06,119
Do you understand?

331
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,800
What do you think of Wei Xian?

332
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,040
He's not an ordinary hedonist.

333
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,599
He's hard to read.

334
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,680
But he also has weaknesses.

335
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,280
Not bad.

336
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,640
My efforts in nurturing you
haven't been wasted.

337
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,648
If he had agreed directly,

338
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,608
I would have thought

339
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,640
it was a premeditated act.

340
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,719
But showing his emotion for a beauty

341
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,880
adds a bit of true character.

342
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,680
But judging from his demeanor just now,

343
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,839
I'm afraid

344
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,560
he was really angry.

345
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,289
No rush.

346
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,049
If there's a profit to be made,

347
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,729
as fellow merchants,

348
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,920
we naturally can't miss it.

349
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,688
Pang Hu.

350
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:11,519
Yes, Master.

351
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,969
Send some reliable servants

352
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,049
to Lu Garden

353
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,249
to look into Wei Xian.

354
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,120
Yes, Master.

355
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:22,279
Sir,

356
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:25,080
such an ordinary method

357
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,199
may not be able to find him out.

358
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,769
If this doesn't work,

359
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,440
then I'll have to send you there.

360
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,320
All right.

361
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:11,959
Watch your steps.

362
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,039
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:18,888
I was too anxious just now.

364
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,999
It's all right.

365
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,368
We may have failed this time.

366
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:25,559
But we'll definitely find another way.

367
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,519
Official Lu,

368
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,969
I know

369
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,489
you want to get to the bottom
of this case.

370
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,249
But that Zhao Chong is too much.

371
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,080
That's why you...

372
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,239
You

373
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,440
are so determined to save your father.

374
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,880
If you knew,

375
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,479
who knows what silly things
you might do?

376
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,928
I'm not silly.

377
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,049
I'm the most clever one.

378
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,719
Yes,

379
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,600
you're the most clever one.

380
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,479
Come on.

381
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,160
Get on.

382
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,880
Let's go.

383
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,009
I know

384
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,928
you're an heir.

385
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:30,569
So you have some kind of temper.

386
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,489
But

387
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,559
can you endure it next time?

388
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:36,479
We only have two months left.

389
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:38,569
All right.

390
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,848
I'll endure it.

391
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,279
It won't happen again after this.

392
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,400
You should keep quiet now.

393
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:45,329
If you keep talking,
I'll leave you on the streets.

394
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,888
You won't do that.

395
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:48,368
If you leave me,

396
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:51,920
who will be your Qing?

397
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,289
-Don't worry.
-What are you doing?

398
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,080
I...

399
00:19:58,929 --> 00:19:59,999
Yang Zong!

400
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm coming!

401
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,128
Don't just stand there.

402
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,279
Help carry her.

403
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,900
(Xue Money House)

404
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:26,128
Madam,

405
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:27,569
how did you know where I live?

406
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,160
I keep asking around

407
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:30,360
along the way.

408
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,009
Please Mister.
Stop asking so many questions.

409
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,448
Let's go.

410
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:33,128
Hurry up.

411
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,888
I'm sure I dropped my jade...

412
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:36,239
Hurry up.

413
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,680
Where did you drop it?

414
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:40,600
Why don't you help me
find it over there?

415
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:45,729
Let's go.

416
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,440
All right.

417
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:54,329
But

418
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,448
where did you drop it?

419
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,009
I can't find it anywhere.

420
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,569
Mister, I found it.

421
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,168
I found my jade.

422
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:00,168
Is this the one?

423
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:01,089
Yes, this is the one.

424
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,888
I have to go now

425
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:02,969
before I put you in trouble.

426
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,608
I'll get going, then. Thank you, mister.

427
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:05,249
I'm leaving now.

428
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,959
All right, off you go.

429
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:11,799
It feels pretty good

430
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,559
to be nice.

431
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:15,759
Sir.

432
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,448
Madam!

433
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:22,368
What should we do now?

434
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:23,999
Master is on his way
to Baixiang Pavilion now.

435
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,799
What?

436
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,239
Hurry, get on the horse.

437
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,800
(Baixiang Pavilion)

438
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,089
Master, what are you doing here?

439
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,320
I come to check on Madam.

440
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,820
(Baixiang Pavilion)

441
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:24,039
I can handle it.

442
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:45,799
Ran.

443
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,360
Ran.

444
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:14,840
Ran.

445
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,239
Did you have a nightmare?

446
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:19,688
Didn't you get proper rest?

447
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,360
I brought you some snacks.

448
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,120
Have some.

449
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,160
Ran,

450
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,719
I know

451
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:37,729
you stayed here

452
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,840
to avoid Madam He.

453
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:41,729
It's all my fault. I'll definitely...

454
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,680
What would you do?

455
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:44,799
Compensate?

456
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:47,440
How do you plan to compensate?

457
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,959
Madam He is already pregnant.

458
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,289
What can you do about that?

459
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,400
As your wife,

460
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:54,769
what else can I do

461
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,279
other than accept her?

462
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,368
If I chase her out,

463
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,279
not only Mother will blame me,

464
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,049
but what would
the outsiders think of us?

465
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,329
Yes, I know.

466
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,049
I don't expect you
to forgive me right now.

467
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,880
I only want you to know

468
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:09,600
that I only acknowledge you as my wife.

469
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:10,769
About my past mistake,

470
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,289
you can punish me however you want.

471
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,648
But if you don't go home

472
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:15,688
because of me,

473
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,608
won't I be guilty of a grave sin?

474
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:18,888
As you said,

475
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:20,600
what would others think of me?

476
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:21,969
How can I rest assured

477
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,759
when you're here alone,

478
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,080
not eating or sleeping well?

479
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,809
Ran,

480
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,719
I beg you.

481
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:32,408
Please come home with me.

482
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,249
As long as you come home,
I'll do anything you want.

483
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,080
Is that all right?

484
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:38,208
You're the one

485
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,759
I truly care about.

486
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:49,600
Let me think about it.

487
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,920
All right.

488
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,600
Then are you coming home...

489
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,199
All right.

490
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,440
Get some rest.

491
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,100
(Baixiang Pavilion)

492
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,080
Master, take care.

493
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:57,368
Water and trim

494
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:58,529
the flowers and plants

495
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,848
when needed in this courtyard.

496
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,049
Work diligently

497
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,479
and don't slack off.

498
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,529
Do you remember

499
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,769
what I just said earlier?

500
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,239
- Yes.
- Yes.

501
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,888
Chunxi Hall

502
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:12,928
is where Master Wei

503
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:14,208
and Madam Qin sleep.

504
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,208
Do not disturb them
if they don't send for you.

505
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,479
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

506
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,249
Are Master Wei and Madam Qin

507
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,680
easy to get along with?

508
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,809
That depends

509
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,569
on your performance.

510
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,729
Master Wei comes

511
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,329
from a prominent family in Jingzhou

512
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,880
with very strict rules.

513
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,168
Be alert

514
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,249
and watch your tongue.

515
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,769
All you need to do is know what to say

516
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,489
and what to observe.

517
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,759
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

518
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:35,569
Do Madam Qin and Master Wei

519
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,888
have any preferences?

520
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:37,800
Are they from Jingzhou?

521
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:39,888
You're truly only thinking
about your benefit, not mistake.

522
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,680
What did I just say?

523
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:42,759
Forgive me.

524
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,840
Come with me.

525
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,559
What's wrong?

526
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,840
Nothing.

527
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,249
Master,

528
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,448
you washed yourself

529
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:04,160
seven to eight times last night.

530
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,999
But why can't you get rid of it?

531
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,600
What did you do?

532
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:13,400
Don't you remember?

533
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,479
I remember

534
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:18,239
you had a conflict
with Zhao Chong last night.

535
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:19,920
I blamed you.

536
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,680
But I already apologized.

537
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:24,408
What does that have to do
with him taking a bath?

538
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,239
- Nothing at all.
- You threw up on him.

539
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,719
That's impossible.

540
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,120
Just let it go.

541
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,279
It's okay.

542
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,809
I did drink a lot

543
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,969
and felt a little tipsy.

544
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,809
But not to the extent
of throwing up on you.

545
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,759
It can't be.

546
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,489
All right, I'll stop talking about it.

547
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,039
I have something to tell you.

548
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,168
The day before yesterday,

549
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,489
I sent invitations to Mrs. Zhao
and the other merchants' wives

550
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,529
in Wuzhou.

551
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,208
They've replied

552
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,600
that they're visiting today.

553
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,080
There's one more thing, Master.

554
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,489
The new servants we employed

555
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,569
aren't that simple too.

556
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,569
They kept on probing

557
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,448
into Mr. Wei and Madam Qin's background

558
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:08,688
and preferences.

559
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,408
I'm sure Zhao Chong sent them.

560
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:11,529
But I thought

561
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,489
he didn't want to cooperate
with us anymore.

562
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,600
That was because Zhai Chong

563
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,640
wanted to exchange concubines.

564
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,719
So that was what happened.

565
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,920
I want to apologize

566
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,239
for my behavior last night.

567
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,160
But I think I...

568
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:45,489
During an investigation,
there are things

569
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,479
that we can and cannot do, right?

570
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,640
I also think

571
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:56,160
that's something we cannot do.

572
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,880
Last night,

573
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,479
I did misunderstand you.

574
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,848
But judging from the spies

575
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,329
Zhao Chong sent to Lu Garden,

576
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,329
it shows

577
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,049
he's very interested

578
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,719
in Master Wei's business.

579
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,120
People die for wealth,
and birds die for food.

580
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,729
As long as there is profit to be made,

581
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,400
Zhao Chong will not miss it.

582
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,569
That's great.

583
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,320
It means we still have a chance.

584
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:22,448
I'll do my best

585
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:23,759
on Mrs. Zhao's side.

586
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:27,569
About the spies,

587
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,448
if there are many spies

588
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:30,089
in Lu Garden,

589
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:30,769
it's not suitable

590
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,648
for the two of you to sleep separately.

591
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:33,800
I have asked Madam Zhuang

592
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,009
to move Master Wei's clothes

593
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,729
to Madam Qin's room.

594
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,969
Master Wei, remember

595
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,608
to rest

596
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,239
in Madam Qin's room

597
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,448
later.

598
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:42,608
All right.

599
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:43,880
Get back to work.

600
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,840
I shall take my leave now.

601
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,360
I have no problems with that.

602
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,719
Why would I have any problems with that?

603
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,320
So do you think

604
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,848
this is something we can

605
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,880
or cannot do?

606
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,489
Official Zhou.

607
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,719
Are you all right?

608
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,289
Did Li Di find out?

609
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,840
Did he trouble you?

610
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,559
No, he didn't.

611
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,440
Did you bring the copybook?

612
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,120
(Copybook)
I copied it exactly as it was.

613
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,608
Have a sit and read it.

614
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:00,640
All right.

615
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,320
It's disorganized

616
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,039
and follows no order.

617
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:13,969
There's no introduction or conclusion.

618
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,039
It seems that the content of this letter

619
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:17,529
cannot be deciphered

620
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,120
just by its surface meaning.

621
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,289
Yesterday, I saw that the letter

622
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,828
is written

623
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,680
on the most common type of paper
on the market.

624
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,249
There's nothing unusual

625
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,840
or any hidden layers.

626
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:30,009
It seems that the contents
of this secret letter

627
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,769
can only be hidden
within these characters.

628
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,640
Mrs. Li, you're indeed clever.

629
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,999
Before you arrived,

630
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:37,448
I had already thought

631
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,959
of different ways to decipher it.

632
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,239
But

633
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,840
I couldn't find the keywords.

634
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,279
The word "Tu."

635
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,130
(Copybook)

636
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,360
"Tu?"

637
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,928
The person behind this

638
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:13,729
must have disassembled

639
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,928
the contents

640
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:16,329
of the letter

641
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,168
and hidden them

642
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,239
in different positions in this copybook.

643
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:20,440
But

644
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,600
what exactly

645
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:25,199
is the specific arrangement?

646
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,160
I've dealt with a case before

647
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,039
where they used encryption

648
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,089
in their secret messages.

649
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,009
What kind of encryption?

650
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,400
A slotted panel encryption.

651
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,799
This copybook

652
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:37,608
might have

653
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:39,329
a slotted panel
specifically designed for it.

654
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,300
The recipient only needs

655
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:41,729
to align the hollowed-out part of it

656
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,080
with the pre-designed positions
on the copybook

657
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,799
to find the keywords

658
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,969
and obtain

659
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,479
the information they want.

660
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:21,680
(Measuring ruler?)

661
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:24,799
(Something ordinary)

662
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,249
(that's not placed on the desk.)

663
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,799
(Yet, it's hidden
in such an exquisite box.)

664
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,559
(These holes...)

665
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,680
Mrs. Zhao, what do you think
about the paintings?

666
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,089
There are several decent ones.

667
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,889
But

668
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,569
they are far inferior

669
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,969
compared to the ones at home.

670
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,248
That's only natural.

671
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:15,328
I heard

672
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:16,648
the paintings in the Zhao Residence

673
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:18,089
are treasures of Wuzhou.

674
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,889
I wonder if I'll have the honor

675
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,409
to view them?

676
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,599
It's difficult.

677
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:25,009
Every painting selected by my husband

678
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,089
is priceless

679
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,959
and not easily shown to others.

680
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,529
That's a pity.

681
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,248
But those are valuable paintings,

682
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:39,808
you must take good care of them.

683
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,009
You can't let them be scattered

684
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,849
around the garden like mine.

685
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,200
Of course, we take good care of them.

686
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:46,248
For those collected paintings,

687
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:47,808
my husband

688
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:48,900
has specially built a gallery.

689
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:51,009
Not only the temperature
and humidity levels are conducive,

690
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,969
but they're also categorized.

691
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,728
Landscape paintings
are on the east side,

692
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,519
and portraits are on the west side.

693
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:58,089
If one is misplaced,

694
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,880
my husband will be upset.

695
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,079
East side.

696
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,168
Mr. Zhao and Mrs. Zhao

697
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:09,328
are indeed elegant.

698
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:10,849
Unlike my husband

699
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,648
who only thinks about business

700
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,208
and making money.

701
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:15,569
He doesn't understand

702
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,159
these paintings at all.

703
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,288
By the way,

704
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,089
when he went

705
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,409
to see Mr. Zhao yesterday,

706
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,288
he might have drunk too much

707
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,400
and forgot to give him the painting.

708
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,128
That explains

709
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:26,889
why my husband

710
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,728
wasn't happy yesterday.

711
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,639
So that's the reason.

712
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:31,519
Come.

713
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,880
Bring the "Spring River."

714
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,128
The misunderstanding

715
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:43,449
is cleared up now.

716
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,449
You see,

717
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,608
these men

718
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:47,089
can be confused sometimes.

719
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,889
They still need their wives

720
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,280
to help them out.

721
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,360
That's always the case.

722
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,248
"Hundred Children
and Thousand Grandchildren"?

723
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:55,969
Madam Qin even owns this painting.

724
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,608
I have one at home too.

725
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:58,000
Qingxi,

726
00:35:58,001 --> 00:35:59,248
why did you display this one out?

727
00:35:59,249 --> 00:35:59,849
Miss,

728
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,409
I saw how chubby the children were,

729
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,039
and looked quite festive.

730
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:05,119
It's all right.

731
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,288
I guess Madam Qin

732
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,159
is eager to have a child.

733
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,529
That's right.

734
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,688
Although Madam Qin

735
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,449
is currently favored.

736
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,449
In the end,

737
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,849
she needs to be pregnant

738
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,880
to secure her position.

739
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:19,959
Yes, that's true.

740
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,248
I'm sorry you have to see this.

741
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:23,849
Qingxi, take it down.

742
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,700
Oh, don't put it away.

743
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:26,409
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

744
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,328
Madam Qin,

745
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,728
we're all mothers.

746
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,320
No need to be embarrassed.

747
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,508
Next time,

748
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:33,128
I will send over my secret prescription

749
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:34,288
to you.

750
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:35,720
It's very effective.

751
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:38,808
Then don't forget

752
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:39,969
to give it to me.

753
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,529
Of course.

754
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,559
I'll send it to you later.

755
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,560
(Chunxi Hall)

756
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:49,569
It has been

757
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,768
an exhausting day today.

758
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:52,089
Miss, you're really amazing.

759
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,248
In just a few hours,

760
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:54,449
you've already become close

761
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,280
to those ladies.

762
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,400
It's all thanks

763
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:59,208
to your "Hundred Children
and Thousand Grandchildren"

764
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:00,929
that brought us closer.

765
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,248
Then thank you
for your compliment, Miss.

766
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:04,808
I'll keep up the good work.

767
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:05,950
You're asking for a beating.

768
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:06,969
I wished I could find a hole

769
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,599
to hide at that time.

770
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,959
Miss,

771
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,800
I've been serving you for so long

772
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:13,608
and it's the first time
to seen your face so red.

773
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,089
Wait, are you going
to keep repeating it?

774
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:15,920
You...

775
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,400
Qingxi was speaking out of line.

776
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:25,159
I hope you won't be upset.

777
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,679
I want to accompany Miss by her side.

778
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,409
Should the four of us

779
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,288
play a game of cards?

780
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:33,400
Sure!

781
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,959
I'm worried about you, Miss.

782
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,840
Official Lu

783
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,248
isn't someone like that.

784
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:49,929
But

785
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,009
Official Yang told me

786
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,728
if Official Lu has any bad intentions...

787
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,599
- Yes.
- You told me...

788
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:53,929
Exactly.

789
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,840
That's right.

790
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,079
You're right.

791
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:57,320
Miss!

792
00:37:57,329 --> 00:37:58,920
What were you whispering about?

793
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,679
Qingxi said

794
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:04,559
I should rest early.

795
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,119
Yes,

796
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:08,119
we should rest early.

797
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,800
- I'll sleep here.
- You'll sleep there.

798
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,800
There's someone outside.

799
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,768
My dear,

800
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,599
you surely have such a passion.

801
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,648
Dear Wei,

802
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,959
as long as you're happy.

803
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,760
So?

804
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,119
Is he gone?

805
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,999
Yes.

806
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,360
You can take the bed.

807
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,049
No, you take the bed.

808
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,800
Listen to me

809
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,599
and sleep on the bed.

810
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:16,519
I have a question.

811
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:19,479
Have you ever dreamed of me?

812
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,449
Didn't I dream

813
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,119
about you holding my hand?

814
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,119
Have you dreamed about me too?

815
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:31,760
Yes, many times.

816
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,800
But those dreams

817
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,760
seem so real.

818
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,128
Then did you dream

819
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,720
about my father being released
from prison?

820
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,280
Well, no.

821
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:46,079
Forget it.

822
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,079
Then it's not important.

823
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,089
But

824
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,360
why does your heart ache

825
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,720
when I cry?

826
00:39:57,169 --> 00:39:58,599
I have no idea too.

827
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:01,089
Even Physician Wu couldn't diagnose it.

828
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,328
Could it be

829
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:03,849
that even heaven can't bear it

830
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,999
to see my father not saved
so you have to suffer along?

831
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,400
Just sleep.

832
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,999
I'm serious.

833
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,328
Maybe

834
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,929
after you save my father,

835
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,328
everything will be over.

836
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,688
Then the connections will be severed

837
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:18,920
and owe each other nothing.

838
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,200
(Could it really be fate?)

839
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,559
(Forget about it.)

840
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:44,159
(Anyway, the case still needs
to be investigated.)

841
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:53,760
Wait for me.

842
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,639
Are you not well?

843
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,679
I'm fine.

844
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:25,840
Could it be the illness

845
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,920
from the previous torture?

846
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,440
I don't know.

847
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,599
It's just that whenever
the weather changes,

848
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,920
I would feel uncomfortable.

849
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,679
When the court officials tortured you,

850
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,440
they acted on my orders.

851
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:43,929
Do you blame me?

852
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,079
I broke the law first.

853
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:48,079
You were only doing your duty
according to the law.

854
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,608
Besides,

855
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:51,679
you showed mercy to me.

856
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,360
I know all of this.

857
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,039
(I tortured you)

858
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:26,280
(and you tried to assassinate me.)

859
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:29,760
(Why are we acting
so affectionately now?)

860
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,720
(Could it be an ill-fated relationship?)

861
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:48,999
Wei,

862
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:50,679
is it comfortable?

863
00:42:50,729 --> 00:42:52,409
Your skill

864
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,479
is unmatched.

865
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:57,079
Qing,

866
00:42:57,729 --> 00:42:59,800
your hands must be tired. Take a break.

867
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:02,559
I'm not tired.

868
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,768
But I can't bear it.

869
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:06,760
Come, sit down.

870
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:09,969
At the banquet that day,

871
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,240
I embarrassed you.

872
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,489
In the future,

873
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,328
I must practice

874
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:16,159
to hold my drinks.

875
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:22,079
There's no need for that.

876
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:25,519
Who drinks like this?

877
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,999
What if it affected your health?

878
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:29,768
Wei,

879
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:31,808
you don't let me drink

880
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,119
and worried about my health.

881
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:36,728
Could it be that you want...

882
00:43:36,729 --> 00:43:38,079
What?

883
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,559
Oh, you know. The "Hundred Children
and Thousand Grandchildren".

884
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:45,039
Wei, you're so mean

885
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,409
for making me talk about this

886
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,529
in front of everyone.

887
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,280
It's embarrassing.

888
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:57,720
Master,

889
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,808
when people hear you want

890
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:00,569
to start a business in Wuzhou,

891
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,529
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Li,

892
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,529
and some other gentlemen

893
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,969
want to meet you.

894
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:05,889
At this moment,

895
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,959
they're all waiting in the front hall.

896
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,440
Then let's meet them.

897
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:12,248
Prepare the gold.

898
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:12,959
Okay.

899
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:14,288
Wei,

900
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:15,489
I'll wait for you here.

901
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,999
I'll let you spend

902
00:44:17,209 --> 00:44:18,679
all the gold I earn.

903
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,288
Thank you, dear.

904
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:22,400
Drink less.

905
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,079
Let's go. Yang Zong.

906
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:43,049
They all went to Lu Garden?

907
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,728
Yes.

908
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:44,369
It seems

909
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,240
they wanted to do business
with Wei Xian.

910
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:51,768
How could we let others
take away the opportunity

911
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:54,320
when it knocked at our door?

912
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,760
Go.

913
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:58,479
Invite Wei Xian to our mansion.

914
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,360
Yes.

915
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:09,889
That's great.

916
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,479
We can finally get close to Zhao Chong.

917
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,400
The fish is about to take the bait.

918
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,608
But tomorrow...

919
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:15,889
I won't go tomorrow.

920
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,179
You had a conflict with Zhao Chong

921
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,128
because of me.

922
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:19,360
It makes sense

923
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,449
not to bring me this time.

924
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,200
Correct.

925
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:23,049
Using logic and reasoning

926
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,440
to analyze a situation.

927
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,639
Even if we fake it,
we have to make it real.
