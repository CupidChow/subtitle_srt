00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,280
(Cheng Garden)

19
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:08,809
My lord, are you awake?

20
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:15,989
My lord?

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,399
Where's Shen Zhen?

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,518
She's staying at

23
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,070
the Lanyue Pavilion
in Cheng Garden for now.

24
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,719
Yesterday,

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,918
she was so happy that she fainted

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,700
after she found the construction plan.

27
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,640
I was afraid that she might discover
other secrets of

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,080
the Earl Suning Residence
when she was there.

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,309
That's why I brought her back.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,198
I brought Qingxi back

31
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,399
together with her.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,900
At least they can take care
of each other.

33
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,238
You're pretty considerate, aren't you?

34
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,149
By the way,

35
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,589
bring Shen Zhen here later
so that I can interrogate her.

36
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,790
I'm afraid she won't
be able to make it later.

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,999
The female physician said

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,719
she suffered a huge shock last night.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,839
Her mental state was shaken.

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,589
Therefore, she gave her
some strong medicine.

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,918
I'm afraid

42
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,429
she's still asleep right now.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,709
She's sleeping soundly, isn't she?

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,198
Official Lu, I have to thank you
for what happened yesterday.

45
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,839
If you didn't believe in me back then...

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,559
At most,

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,429
you'll just lose one chance.

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,678
However,

49
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:42,119
if you keep acting recklessly without
considering your capabilities,

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,399
I'm afraid

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,309
you'll lose your life in the future.

52
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,149
Although you're willing to
risk your life to save your father,

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,638
do you think your father

54
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,190
can take it

55
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,029
if you lost your life in the process?

56
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,439
That's right, Miss Shen.

57
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,478
If my lord didn't
send me to your residence

58
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,559
for an investigation

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,099
after he realized that
something was off,

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,309
I'm afraid there would be
dire consequences.

61
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,589
Official Lu, you're right.

62
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,429
I won't do it again.

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,279
Take a close look
at this construction plan.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,839
Were they drawn by your father?

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,390
Were they altered in any way?

66
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:42,190
To complete this construction plan,

67
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,478
my father traveled far

68
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,190
and visited his neighbors
in the village.

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,510
It took him two years to complete this.

70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,310
Don't cry!

71
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,510
Look at the construction plan closely.

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,998
Every single word on it

73
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:12,599
is my father's handwriting.

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,630
Are you sure?

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,589
Yes, I'm sure.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,998
Official Lu,

77
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,550
will we be able

78
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,438
to rescue my father
with this construction plan?

79
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,478
After submitting it,

80
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,599
there's a checking process.

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,558
We have to make sure that the West Canal
didn't collapse

82
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,079
due to the error
in the construction plan.

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,478
There's definitely nothing wrong

84
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,839
with my father's construction plan.

85
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,199
To err is human.

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,190
The truth is...

87
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:33,909
Shut up!

88
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,358
Official Lu, I know
that you only have eyes for evidence

89
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,358
and seek out the truth

90
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,558
without making accusations.

91
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,318
However, please do not slander my father

92
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,430
before the truth is revealed.

93
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,070
Yesterday,

94
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,550
what other discoveries did you make?

95
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,719
How were you sure that
the construction plans

96
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,349
were in Earl Suning Residence?

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,630
Xu Wei told me about it.

98
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,029
He wanted to...

99
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,039
I told him to retrieve
the construction plan

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,159
so that I could save my father.

101
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,238
He said it was simple.

102
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,200
He said the construction plan
was inside Earl Suning Residence.

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,118
That Xu Wei.

104
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,878
How did Xu Wei find out?

105
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,918
Could it be that
he blackmailed my uncle?

106
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,839
Why are they trying
to malign my father?

107
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,719
Tell me!

108
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,159
Yang Zong.

109
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,870
Yes, sir.

110
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,829
Miss Shen, please rest well.

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,150
(Magistrate Office)

112
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,669
Lu Shiyan.

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,358
I'm Earl Suning.

114
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,798
You cannot torture me

115
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,589
without an edict from His Majesty.

116
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,639
If you're unable to speak

117
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,079
or write,

118
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,918
no one will know

119
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,709
that I was the one who tortured you.

120
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,149
What are you doing?

121
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,630
Who are you trying to intimidate?

122
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,430
Lu Shiyan, listen up.

123
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,759
You better stop trying to
show off your authority in front of me.

124
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,149
Hurry and release me!

125
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,959
What are you looking at?

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,310
Beat me to death if you dare!

127
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,349
I don't need to resort to that.

128
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,719
As the commandant of justice,

129
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,469
I abide by the law.

130
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,959
Those who attempted rape
will receive 100 rods as punishment.

131
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,990
Execute the punishment.

132
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,990
Someone!

133
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,639
You! Lu Shiyan!

134
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,759
Are you doing this for real?

135
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,310
Do you know who I am?

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,950
Enough.

137
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,149
I don't know who you are.

138
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,500
I only know

139
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,558
that we're protected by the laws
established by His Majesty.

140
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,998
I'll pursue responsibility

141
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,149
against anyone who breaks them.

142
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,229
Deputy Minister Xu,

143
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,039
you should thank the Magistrate Office.

144
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,719
If we didn't make it in time

145
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,469
and stop you from raping her,

146
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,550
you'll be hanged.

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,279
My lord, both of us
come from the imperial family.

148
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,630
Let's talk this over.

149
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,759
Execute the punishment.

150
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,349
My lord!

151
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,669
Enough!

152
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,669
Earl Suning, it's your turn.

153
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,029
Speak up.

154
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,678
Why did you have
the construction plan with you?

155
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,630
I discovered it by accident.

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,199
Minister Shen

157
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,519
kept one of his items
in the money house.

158
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,838
I went and retrieved it

159
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,870
to see if I could help him out.

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,598
But why did Shen Lan say

161
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,909
you took the construction plan
under someone's order?

162
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,470
Whose order were you following?

163
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,279
Was the fire in Jin Money House
an accident?

164
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,479
Or was it a man-made accident?

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,390
Who was the person who captured
Shen Zhen in Jin Money House?

166
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,639
You went to the money house
to retrieve the construction plan.

167
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,159
When you met Shen Zhen there,
you harbored ill intention.

168
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,239
You wanted to kill
two birds with one stone.

169
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,639
You set fire to the money house to
make it as if the plan was incinerated.

170
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,039
At the same time, you faked
Shen Zhen's death.

171
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,069
After that, you would deliver her
to Xu Wei.

172
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:05,958
Official Lu, I...

173
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,119
I know my fault now!

174
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,918
Shut up!

175
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,390
Don't listen to his nonsense!

176
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,879
Why did you think I was daring enough

177
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,918
to barge into Earl Suning Residence
for an investigation?

178
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,279
It's because my spies

179
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,078
infiltrated Jin Money House long ago.

180
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,990
I kept you guys under surveillance

181
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,269
24/7.

182
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,438
Speak.

183
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,718
Whose order did you follow
to retrieve the construction plan?

184
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,830
I...

185
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,350
I have no idea.

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,958
I just received some letters.

187
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,159
They gave me some instructions.

188
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,678
In the past, the deals brought me money.

189
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,399
If I followed the instructions,

190
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,279
I would make plenty of money.

191
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,598
If I didn't,

192
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:52,390
they would cause trouble
for all of my money houses.

193
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,438
It's the same when I tried to
retrieve the construction plan.

194
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:55,838
I received a letter.

195
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,159
Official Lu,

196
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,279
I was arrested by you

197
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,838
before I knew what to do.

198
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,519
If so, how did Xu Wei find out that the plan
was in Earl Suning Residence?

199
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,239
Xu Wei

200
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,759
told Shen Zhen about it.

201
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,718
Xu Wei?

202
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,029
How could he know?

203
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,798
I'm sure he was just tricking her

204
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,510
so that she could adhere to his request.

205
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,789
What about the ledger for
the deals you made?

206
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,230
All of them were in the money house.

207
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,750
They were burned down.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,918
Earl Suning will
be detained temporarily.

209
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,718
Make him write down

210
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,999
all the deals he made.

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,750
Yes, sir.

212
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,279
Someone!

213
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,020
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

214
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,189
- Take him away!
- Yes, sir!

215
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,250
(Yanchun Palace)

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,438
Your Majesty,

217
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,429
the fabric you requested is ready.

218
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,069
Leave it over there.

219
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,230
Your Majesty, we're in trouble!

221
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,639
What happened?

222
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,759
Why are you shouting?

223
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,558
Deputy Minister Xu is in trouble.

224
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,269
He was tortured by
the Magistrate Office.

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,558
But why?

226
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,149
Deputy Minister Xu, he...

227
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,318
He tried to rape a woman.

228
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:35,069
Official Lu caught him red-handed.

229
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,269
That useless child.

230
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,318
I reprimanded him for it long ago.

231
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,429
Can't he just change his habits?

232
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,759
Official Lu did the right thing.

233
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,279
He should be taught a lesson.

234
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,039
If not,

235
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,069
he might do something
even worse in the future.

236
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,798
Your Majesty, aren't you going
to do something about it?

237
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,558
No.

238
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,669
Let the Magistrate Office deal with him.

239
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,110
By the way,

240
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,759
deliver that to His Majesty

241
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,390
after it's cleaned.

242
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,429
Hurry and deliver it to His Majesty.

243
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,390
Miss.

244
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,269
What's on your mind?

245
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,279
Official Lu left in a hurry just now.

246
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,918
When he comes back,

247
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,918
we'll leave the place

248
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,269
after bidding farewell to him.

249
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,639
This is Official Lu's garden after all.

250
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,870
It's inappropriate for you
to stay here for a long time.

251
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,510
And, Official Lu

252
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,350
is eccentric.

253
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,159
Although he acted strangely today,

254
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,159
he's the commandant of justice
after all.

255
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,549
I don't think he's that strange.

256
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,198
This isn't the first time he did so.

257
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,958
Last time, when we were in
Baixiang Pavilion,

258
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,438
he told me to cry

259
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,990
and stop crying.

260
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,069
If so, I'll go and
pack our belongings now.

261
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,590
I'll join you.

262
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,239
Official Zhou, what business

263
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,549
are you here for?

264
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,318
Official Lu, you stirred up

265
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,669
such a huge ruckus last night.

266
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,429
Of course the Imperial Censorate
needs to show some concern.

267
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,239
Official Zhou, you're loyal
to your duties indeed.

268
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,640
If you think I didn't fulfill my duties
as the commandant of justice,

269
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,318
you could submit a letter of complaint.

270
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,479
You didn't need

271
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,110
to come all the way here.

272
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,630
Official Lu, you misunderstood me.

273
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,078
I was worried that you might forget
the fact that you and I

274
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,078
were handling the West Canal case together
as you had been too busy lately.

275
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,230
If so, Official Zhou,
have you made any discoveries?

276
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:40,678
I'm incompetent.

277
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,318
Not only did I not make any discoveries,

278
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:45,110
but Minister Shen also had a mishap
in prison.

279
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,390
How is Minister Shen doing right now?

280
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,830
Someone poisoned him.

281
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,669
Although he's alive,

282
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,909
he's still in a coma.

283
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:58,519
Official Zhou, you took him with you

284
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,029
using His Majesty's written order.

285
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,069
And now, this happened to him.

286
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,309
I suppose you should

287
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,198
give His Majesty

288
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,949
an account.

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,119
Naturally,

290
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,359
I'll explain the situation
to His Majesty.

291
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,718
Official Lu, I came here today

292
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,949
to give you a reminder.

293
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,710
Prevention is better than cure.

294
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:18,309
For example,

295
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,269
the genuineness of
the construction plan itself.

296
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,909
Official Zhou, you're resourceful indeed.

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,918
Seems like it's time

298
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,269
to clean the Magistrate Office
of the lurking rats.

299
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,069
Official Lu, you're such a jokester.

300
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,029
This is a collaboration between us,
you know?

301
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,558
Official Zhou, you don't need
to worry about the construction plan.

302
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,309
I'll find someone to verify it myself.

303
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,149
I've brought said person here today.

304
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,318
Official Lu,

305
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:43,918
I'm sure you won't have any objections

306
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,990
when we're employing his services.

307
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,189
Bring him here.

308
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,669
My lord.

309
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,558
This is Li Di, deputy minister
of the Ministry of Water Resources.

310
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,390
He's the son-in-law of Minister Shen.

311
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,590
Official Lu,

312
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,678
do you have another candidate

313
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,350
who's better for the job than him?

314
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,678
Deliver it to the Magistrate Office
after verifying it.

315
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,030
Deliver it to the Imperial Censorate.

316
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,069
But...

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,230
You should put things back to
the place you took them from.

318
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,359
Deputy Minister Li,

319
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,110
I'm sure you understand that.

320
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,438
This case is handled by
both the Magistrate Office

321
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,590
and the Imperial Censorate.

322
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
The Imperial Censorate is a rank
higher than the Magistrate Office.

323
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,630
We have the authority
to make such requests.

324
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,159
I've memorized the survey data of

325
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,838
the West Canal.

326
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,479
Moreover,

327
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,279
I saw Minister Shen's
construction plan before.

328
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,669
I can verify it here.

329
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,429
Go ahead.

330
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,149
Here.

331
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,399
Official Lu, Official Zhou,

332
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,359
this is indeed the construction plan
of Minister Shen.

333
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,350
It's the same as the one
we used for the construction.

334
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:29,029
Official Zhou, you may rest at ease now.

335
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,958
If so, Official Lu,

336
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,918
please submit the plan
to the related department.

337
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,189
That is my duty.

338
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,678
My lord,

339
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,438
why don't we keep it from her?

340
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,429
It concerns her father.

341
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:51,159
I don't think it's inappropriate
for us to keep it from her.

342
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,678
Although you think it's inappropriate,

343
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,269
you'll suffer from a heart-piercing pain

344
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,870
if you do tell her about it.

345
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,119
She found the construction plan
after so much effort.

346
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,519
And, she thought she could
rescue her father with it. In the end?

347
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,669
Her father is in a coma now.

348
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,879
If you tell her about it,

349
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,870
she'll cry until the end of time.

350
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:10,110
What exactly is going on?

351
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,630
Go and...

352
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,070
My lord?

353
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,479
What happened?

354
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:17,919
My lord!

355
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,999
What happened to my father?

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,279
Why is he in a coma?

357
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,158
Hurry and tell me!

358
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:21,838
Don't come here!

359
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,439
My lord!

360
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,398
What exactly happened?

361
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:26,039
- I'll tell you if you stop crying.
- I'll tell you if you stop crying.

362
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,039
Okay? Stop crying.

363
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,719
Stop crying.

364
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,558
Hurry and tell me what's going on!
Stop crying!

365
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,078
I'll surely tell you if you stop crying!

366
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,110
Your father was poisoned
when he was in prison!

367
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,160
But he was rescued in time!

368
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,010
He'll surely regain consciousness!
He'll surely wake up!

369
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,399
He won't die
and surely regain consciousness!

370
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,669
- I'm serious. Just trust me.
- Yang Zong.

371
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,550
Stop crying.

372
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,070
Listen to me.

373
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,798
Since someone poisoned him,

374
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,919
that means he's innocent.

375
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,919
Someone wants him

376
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,878
to take the blame as soon as possible.

377
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:55,189
That also proves that
the construction plan is real.

378
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,749
Your father will be saved

379
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,390
as long as we submit
the construction plan.

380
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,870
Really?

381
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,909
Li Di, your brother-in-law,

382
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,110
verified the construction plan today.

383
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,469
He was sure that
it belonged to your father.

384
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm sure it'll be fine now.

385
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,749
I'm glad to hear that.

386
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,870
What's wrong with you?

387
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:22,919
Why do you look displeased

388
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,149
whenever you see me cry?

389
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,429
That's right.

390
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:27,838
My lord

391
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,158
hates it when other people cry.

392
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,110
When he sees other people crying,

393
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,709
he'll go crazy.

394
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:34,790
I was wondering why.

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,039
Great.

396
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,479
Qingxi and I are going to leave now.
I'm here to bid farewell.

397
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,429
No!

398
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,790
But why?

399
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,310
Xu Wei received 100 rods
as a punishment today.

400
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,239
He won't let us off this easily.

401
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,638
Did you set him free?

402
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:50,959
You actually set him free

403
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,280
after he tried to do that to me?

404
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,919
According to the law, he didn't
succeed in his rape attempt.

405
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,938
I could only give him 100 rods.

406
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:56,360
However, he harbored
obvious ill intention.

407
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,630
If you set him free,

408
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,638
other ladies

409
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,798
might encounter the same thing.

410
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,719
However, his act
didn't result in a bad outcome.

411
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,429
That means he's not punishable by death.

412
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,519
You have to wait until
it results in a bad outcome?

413
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,479
Shen Zhen,

414
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,630
you don't interpret the law like that.

415
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,429
I'll go and look for my sister.

416
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,479
Xu Wei can even manipulate Earl Suning.

417
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,078
Do you think he'll be afraid of
the Li family?

418
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,989
If you find her,
you'll only implicate her.

419
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,189
Listen to me.

420
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,039
Do not contact

421
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,630
your sister for the time being.

422
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,358
Once Xu Wei finds out,

423
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,439
you guys won't hear the end from him.

424
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,149
For the rest of your lives.

425
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,270
If so, Official Lu, will I
be bothering you if I stay here?

426
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,110
You won't bother me
as long as you don't cry.

427
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,798
Fine.

428
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,229
I'll try to hold it in.

429
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,949
Thank you so much.

430
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,519
My lord, do you intend

431
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,118
to keep her here

432
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,118
for a long time?

433
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,429
What else can I do?

434
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,550
She cries no matter what she encounters.

435
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,669
If I keep her here,

436
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,679
at least I can think of a way
to calm her down.

437
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,909
If she's outside,

438
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,759
I'm afraid

439
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,399
you guys will have to hold a funeral
in Duke Zhenguo's Residence soon.

440
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,390
My lord, don't say that.

441
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,270
If not,

442
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,390
I'll get rid of...

443
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,798
I already fainted

444
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,199
from her crying alone.

445
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,199
If she dies,

446
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,199
what do you think

447
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,158
will happen to me?

448
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:21,798
No.

449
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,078
My lord, that's not what I mean.

450
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,919
My lord,

451
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,429
I'm just trying to share your burden.

452
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,310
Qingxi.

453
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,310
Greetings, Miss Shen.

454
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,479
Miss Shen, we're female physicians.

455
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,239
Official Lu said

456
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,199
you've been worrying too much lately.

457
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,838
He sent us here

458
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,909
to give you a checkup.

459
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,558
I'm fine.

460
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,519
I'm doing great.

461
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,759
I don't need any checkups.

462
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,959
Please thank Official Lu for me.

463
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,919
This is unnecessary.

464
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,350
Please don't be courteous.

465
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,638
What are you guys doing?

466
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:16,798
-Come.
-What are you guys doing?

467
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,759
Miss, don't be nervous.

468
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,030
It's just a body checkup.

469
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,949
What have you guys discovered?

470
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,919
Miss Shen has slender limbs,

471
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,509
excellent facial features,
and a gorgeous figure.

472
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,118
Was there anything abnormal about her?

473
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,759
Miss Shen has a wider pelvic bone
than usual.

474
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,519
She'll surely give birth
to many kids in the future.

475
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,469
Why are you telling me that?

476
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,479
I'm asking you guys

477
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,110
if there's anything abnormal about her.

478
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,479
Have you checked her eyes?

479
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,669
Her eyes were so beautiful.

480
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,078
There was nothing abnormal about them.

481
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,270
What about her chest area?

482
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,638
Her heartbeat increases rapidly
when we touched her.

483
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:10,719
I think

484
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,669
she's a sensitive and thoughtful person.

485
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,270
Lu Shiyan

486
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,759
wants to have a child with you.

487
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,989
Are you sure about that?

488
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,158
Yes.

489
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,070
The female physicians said

490
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,270
that you had a wider pelvic bone
than usual.

491
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,158
They even said

492
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,189
that you would give birth
to many kids in the future.

493
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,479
It's no wonder
he didn't allow us to leave.

494
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,959
He did so keep you here

495
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,909
so that he could court you.

496
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,070
Miss,

497
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,390
what do you think?

498
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:42,149
What do I think?

499
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:42,919
Of course I want

500
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,550
to have nothing to do with him.

501
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,039
Right now,

502
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,350
I just want to save my father.

503
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:47,959
All right.

504
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,199
I'll definitely protect you.

505
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,759
I won't let Lu Shiyan
take advantage of you.

506
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,350
What advantage?

507
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,030
I'm coming in.

508
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,429
Official Lu.

509
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,909
What are you doing here?

510
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:00,709
I have something

511
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,390
to tell your missus.

512
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,558
Leave for now.

513
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,878
I won't.

514
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:05,878
It's still daytime.

515
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:07,429
You better not cross the line!

516
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,558
Get out.

517
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,078
I!

518
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,919
Qingxi, you may leave first.

519
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,469
But Miss...

520
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,919
I'll stand in front of the door.

521
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,590
Shout my name if you need help.

522
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,558
Let's go.

523
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,390
Come on.

524
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,590
Stop dragging me.

525
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,870
Let's go.

526
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,110
You see,

527
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,158
don't be scared.

528
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,118
I have something serious

529
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,149
to tell you.

530
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,158
I...

531
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:48,949
Wait!

532
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,669
Listen to me first.

533
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,318
My father is still imprisoned.

534
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,830
And, he was framed too.

535
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,989
He has to come out in one piece.

536
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,030
If not,

537
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,030
I won't consider anything else.

538
00:23:59,159 --> 00:23:59,878
If you want

539
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,429
your father to be released from prison,

540
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,630
you better listen to me seriously.

541
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,878
You have to resolve my issue first.

542
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,189
Why are you acting just like Xu Wei?

543
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,759
Don't let your imagination run wild.

544
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,110
You misunderstood me.

545
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,110
It's like this.

546
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,669
Whenever

547
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,110
you cry,

548
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,709
my heart aches.

549
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,630
But...

550
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,199
Isn't that the same thing?

551
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,919
No.

552
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,318
I mean, I feel a piercing pain.
It's not that my heart aches.

553
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,949
It feels like

554
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:38,030
there's a dagger
piercing through my heart.

555
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,199
Sometimes,

556
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,199
it feels like

557
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,358
there's a hand clenching my heart
so tightly that I can't breathe.

558
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,999
If you cry profusely,

559
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,590
I'll fall unconscious.

560
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,638
You saw it before.

561
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:49,358
It happened when we were
in Earl Suning Residence.

562
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,598
Official Lu,

563
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,118
although I'm a young lady,

564
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,118
do you really think
that I'm a three-year-old kid?

565
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,519
Who are you trying to deceive?

566
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,550
Try it, then.

567
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,870
Cry.

568
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,158
Why should I cry and stop

569
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:02,358
when you tell me to?

570
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,679
Don't forget.

571
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,630
The construction plan is in my hands.

572
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:06,759
Lu Shiyan!

573
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,310
You despicable scum!

574
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,310
Stop.

575
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,790
I can't.

576
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,469
It stings so much.

577
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,469
Stop crying.

578
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,149
It stings!

579
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:09,669
Stop...

580
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,509
Stop crying.

581
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,110
It stings.

582
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,110
What's wrong with you?

583
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,270
Are you sick?

584
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,350
Stop crying!

585
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,598
Someone!

586
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,158
He's sick!

587
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,030
My lord!

588
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,479
Help him out!

589
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,469
Yang Zong.

590
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:33,759
Slowly.

591
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,870
Don't cause him any pain.

592
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,989
Let's go.

593
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,870
He did look like he was in pain.

594
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,070
Does it still hurt?

595
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,390
I'm fine now.

596
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,790
By the way, my lord,

597
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,158
I heard

598
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:48,790
that there was a sorceress nearby.

599
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,679
I heard that she had divine skills.

600
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,519
Why don't we find her?

601
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,350
Maybe she can do something
about your condition.

602
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,479
Those kinds of people

603
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,509
only know how to spread
fallacies and heresies

604
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,158
so that they can deceive the ignorant.

605
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,598
But look at your condition.

606
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,749
Don't you think
it's some sort of a heresy itself?

607
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,709
Miss,

608
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,318
I think Official Lu

609
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,189
is sick in the head.

610
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,479
If he does

611
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,989
have feelings for you,

612
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,149
he should cherish you.

613
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,199
Now,

614
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,239
it's as if he has a weird fetish.

615
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,519
He said

616
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,679
his heart would be in pain
whenever I cry.

617
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,878
And, it's a piercing pain.

618
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,590
That's nonsense.

619
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,390
I felt the same.

620
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,999
But when I looked at him,

621
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,709
he did seem like he was in pain.

622
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,519
Miss,

623
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,919
don't let him fool you.

624
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,540
He's just taking advantage
of your kindness

625
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,439
by pretending to be pitiful

626
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,749
so that you won't leave him.

627
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,590
Really?

628
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,149
Qingxi, get me some mustard root.

629
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,759
Miss, is this enough?

630
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,590
Okay. You may continue.

631
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,709
It's so spicy!

632
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,039
Miss, stop eating!

633
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,149
Continue!

634
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,870
It's so spicy!

635
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,239
Miss,

636
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,838
the mustard root is super spicy!

637
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,878
I'm sure he was fooling you!

638
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:38,759
Stop eating!

639
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,358
You'll damage your stomach!

640
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,078
It's not enough!

641
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,909
Give me more.

642
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,390
My lord!

643
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,989
Shen Zhen, don't eat that!

644
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:55,638
My lord, be careful!

645
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:56,669
Don't eat that!

646
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:57,919
Don't eat that!

647
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,638
My lord, be careful!

648
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,429
I'll sew your mouth shut
if you keep eating!

649
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,590
My lord!

650
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,838
- Give it to me!
- Don't come near me!

651
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,310
- Give it to me!
- Don't come near me!

652
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,030
Stop crying!

653
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,550
It looks like it's working.

654
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,270
Don't you dare!

655
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,679
Try me if you dare!

656
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,110
How can I make you stop?

657
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,558
I want to see my father.

658
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,989
No one is to visit the case suspect.

659
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,590
Fine!

660
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,469
I promise you!

661
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,919
I promise you!

662
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,118
Qingxi, he said yes!

663
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,350
My lord!

664
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,630
Miss, this is great.

665
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,429
My goodness.

666
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,700
I'll confiscate your pestle and mortar!

667
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,558
Miss, I didn't know
that you could do this.

668
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,509
That was spicy.

669
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,919
Was it worth it?

670
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,830
Yeah.

671
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,719
- I need water.
- Let's go.

672
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,550
I need water.

673
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,189
I was too impulsive.

674
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,390
I shouldn't have told her the truth.

675
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,509
My lord.

676
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,509
Yang Zong,

677
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,270
the sorceress you mentioned before,

678
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,590
I need to see her.

679
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,919
Okay.

680
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,310
I'll make the necessary preparations.

681
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,030
7,000 candles for a single person.

682
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,709
The longing is engraved in your bones
with no cure to be found.

683
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,398
7,000 candles for a single person.

684
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:15,669
The longing is engraved in your bones
with no cure to be found.

685
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,790
Who are you?

686
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,550
(Who exactly are you?)

687
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,630
(Miss Shen,)

688
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,270
(was that really you?)

689
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,189
(Why did you enter my dream?)

690
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,149
(Why was I crying too?)

691
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,798
Zhen is missing?

692
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,439
That's right.

693
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,999
The shop in Baixiang Pavilion is closed.

694
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,519
No one responded
when I knocked on the door.

695
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,638
The shopkeeper next door said

696
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,469
that no one entered or left
the shop for two days.

697
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:23,798
I was wondering

698
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,558
why my eyelids
had been twitching lately.

699
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,550
And,

700
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:29,189
Earl Suning Residence was sealed off.

701
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,598
Prepare a carriage.
I need to look for Zhen.

702
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,550
Madam,

703
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,398
Old Madam seized all of the carriages

704
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,199
and carts

705
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,030
as she didn't want you
to leave the residence.

706
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,909
If so, we can head there on foot.

707
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,229
Madam!

708
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,078
Hurry up.

709
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,759
Madam, be careful.

710
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,949
Make way!

711
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,358
Be careful.

712
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,239
Hurry!

713
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,390
Sorry about that.

714
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,199
Thank you, Official Zhou.

715
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,838
Madam Li, looks like you're in a hurry.

716
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,199
Where are you heading?

717
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,189
Why don't I send you there?

718
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,398
Official Zhou, I still need your assistance
in my father's case.

719
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,110
I won't bother you with trivial affairs.

720
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,158
I'm not busy.

721
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,550
Now, we just need to wait for
the construction plan to be verified.

722
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:06,719
Did you find the construction plan?

723
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,590
Yes.

724
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,798
Deputy Minister Li

725
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,669
verified the construction plan
for us a few days ago.

726
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,270
Didn't he tell you about it?

727
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,519
My husband has not entered the residence

728
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,398
for the past few days

729
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,909
because of the West Canal case.

730
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,749
It must've been tough on him.

731
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,398
I have something to attend to.

732
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,630
I'll make a move first.

733
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:26,550
By the way,

734
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,350
the construction plan

735
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,310
was found in Earl Suning Residence.

736
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,189
That's all I can reveal.

737
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,509
Madam Li, you're an intelligent woman.

738
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,749
I'm sure you understand what I mean.

739
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,759
If so, Official Zhou,

740
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,479
do you have any news of
my sister, Shen Zhen?

741
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,350
Not yet.

742
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:48,630
However,

743
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,100
I can inquire about her on your behalf.

744
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,350
Thank you, Official Zhou.

745
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,229
I'll make a move first.

746
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,279
Madam,

747
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,239
I have the feeling
that Official Zhou is...

748
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,310
Mind your words.

749
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,749
Father is still
in the Imperial Censorate.

750
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,109
We still need to depend on Official Zhou
to take care of him.

751
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,678
Why would

752
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,900
the construction plan
be found within Earl Suning Residence?

753
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,029
How did Zhen get herself
in trouble over there?

754
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,790
Finding Zhen is our priority.

755
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,278
Let's check out the places

756
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,839
that Zhen frequents.

757
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,670
Okay.

758
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,319
You dreamt that you were assassinated.

759
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,830
Maybe it was caused by
the enmity your enemies harbored

760
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,109
when you closed all those cases
many years ago.

761
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,949
I'm afraid you're too focused
on your cases.

762
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,069
When one is obsessed about something,

763
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,509
one will dream about it easily.

764
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,989
However, it felt like those dreams

765
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,029
did occur in reality.

766
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,429
If so, what did you dream about?

767
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,629
It was chaotic and fragmented.

768
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,118
I tortured her.

769
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,629
After that, she assassinated me.

770
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,879
However, it felt like she was
shedding tears because of me.

771
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,549
It looked like
she was praying for something.

772
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,069
The key is,

773
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,589
the person I saw in my dream

774
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,310
is just like someone
I know in real life.

775
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,710
What brought you to that conclusion?

776
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:15,960
The perfumed sachet she wore

777
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,399
is just the same
as the person in my dream.

778
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,359
And, my heart aches

779
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,830
whenever she cries.

780
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,029
Since when did your heart start to ache?

781
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,029
On our first encounter.

782
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,839
I lost consciousness from the pain
after she cried.

783
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,399
What were you doing back then?

784
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,989
I was arresting her father.

785
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,638
And, I seized her residence.

786
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,390
What did you do after that?

787
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,109
I searched her body

788
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,670
and destroyed the item her late mother
left behind for her.

789
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,909
Mister, you've been a bad boy.

790
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:08,078
The tie in your dream
is your trial in reality.

791
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,429
This is the heart-piercing pain

792
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,790
that you must go through.

793
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,069
What does that mean?

794
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,030
(With sincerity comes success)

795
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,390
In your dream,

796
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,399
you guys missed out on each other.

797
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,479
That's why she kept shedding tears.

798
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,718
In reality,

799
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,278
you guys should've been a couple.

800
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:47,319
However, you offended her

801
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,429
and made her shed too many tears.

802
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,879
Is there a cure for this?

803
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,870
I don't want her to drag me down.

804
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,479
So, you actually have
no feelings for her?

805
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,989
Of course not.

806
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,158
Bring her here.

807
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,589
I'll try to do something about it.

808
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,830
All right.

809
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,150
I shall take my leave.

810
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,549
Wait.

811
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,839
You guys might become complete strangers

812
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,549
and cannot keep in touch after this.

813
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,989
Have you made up your mind?

814
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,989
We were unrelated in the first place.

815
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,790
There's no need for us to keep in touch.

816
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,159
Shen Zhen!

817
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,790
(Lanyue Pavilion)

818
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,390
Are you here?

819
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,670
Open the door.

820
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:39,959
Qingxi!

821
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,710
Shen Zhen!

822
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,638
I'm here.

823
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,359
Open the door!

824
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,549
You mustn't!

825
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,750
No!

826
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,319
My lord,

827
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,758
could it be that Miss Shen

828
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:53,319
is trying to

829
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,710
make your heart ache again?

830
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,670
Shen Zhen,

831
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,989
didn't you say you wanted
to see your father?

832
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,350
I'll take you there right now.

833
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,989
Today...

834
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,909
Not today.

835
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,310
You're not allowed to look!

836
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:29,310
Seems like you made things
difficult for me at your own expense, huh?

837
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,678
Get her the anti-swelling pill.

838
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,469
-What are you laughing at?
-Let's go.

839
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,310
Follow me to
the Imperial Censorate tomorrow.

840
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,678
Okay.

841
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,319
After that, follow me somewhere.

842
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,469
Where will we be going?

843
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,589
Will you follow me there or not?

844
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,150
Yes, Official Lu.

845
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,638
Now, you know

846
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,319
how to show me respect, huh?

847
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,439
Official Lu, I'm sure
I'll have to trouble you in the future.

848
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,429
That's why I should try to be nice.

849
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,319
I won't use my trump card

850
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,799
unless

851
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,350
it's necessary.

852
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,029
Official Lu, you don't need to
worry about that.

853
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,589
Shen Zhen,

854
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,350
I'll remember this look of yours

855
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,750
for a long, long time.

856
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,670
- Official Lu.
- Official Lu.

857
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,949
Official Lu!

858
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,359
I brought Physician Wu here

859
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,919
to give Minister Shen a checkup.

860
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,479
Please allow me to notify
Official Zhou first.

861
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,238
This case is handled by both
the Magistrate Office and the Imperial Censorate.

862
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,399
I need to make a report before

863
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,799
I can see the suspect, huh?

864
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,310
If so, do you need me

865
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,549
to make a report to His Majesty first?

866
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,830
I dare not do so.

867
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,509
Official Lu!

868
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,710
Open the gate.

869
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,509
Shen Zhen.

870
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,509
Physician Wu, how is my father?

871
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,039
Minister Shen is fine.

872
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,399
If he rests well and
takes his medicine every day,

873
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,909
he'll recover very soon.

874
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,718
Thank you, Physician Wu.

875
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,750
Please give him a prescription.

876
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:50,870
I'll tell the Imperial Censorate
to take care of him.

877
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,909
All right.

878
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,230
- Thank you, Official Lu.
- Shen Zhen.

879
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,589
I'll give you some time here.

880
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,350
Do not cry.

881
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,230
Father.

882
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,109
Don't be scared.

883
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,949
We already found the construction plan.

884
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,870
Your innocence can be proved

885
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,118
after they're done
verifying the construction plan.

886
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,710
By then,

887
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,629
we can be reunited.

888
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,750
Father,

889
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,270
you must recover soon.

890
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,598
My lord,

891
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,830
I'll tell her to leave.

892
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,989
Give her more time.

893
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,310
I brought her here.

894
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,429
Mister, do you want to
reconsider your decision?

895
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,190
No need for that.

896
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,350
What a shame.

897
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,350
If so, you may leave first.

898
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:33,750
Wait.

899
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,999
Where are we?

900
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,429
What are we going to do?

901
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,439
Just follow her instructions.

902
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,710
Miss, follow me.

903
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,799
(You guys might become complete strangers)

904
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,479
(and cannot keep in touch after this.)

905
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,989
(Have you made up your mind?)

906
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,150
Don't worry.

907
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,109
I'll be outside the door.
