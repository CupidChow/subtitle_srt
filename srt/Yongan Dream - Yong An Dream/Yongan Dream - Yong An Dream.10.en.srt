00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,368
Master Zhao wants you to confirm

19
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,529
whether Wei Xian
is in the mansion tonight.

20
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,719
He wants confirmation
with your own eyes.

21
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,359
With my own eyes?

22
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,159
At this time?

23
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:54,648
Are you sending me to my death?

24
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,529
If you don't die here,

25
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,769
do you think

26
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,120
you can still survive?

27
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,999
(If Madam Qin is in trouble,)

28
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,159
(Wei will definitely appear
if he's at home.)

29
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,488
(Help! Help!)

30
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:11,168
Miss.

31
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:11,809
What's going on?

32
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,320
Fuman has fallen into the lake.

33
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:14,209
Into the lake?

34
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,888
(Help!)

35
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,049
- I'll go and check.
- Miss.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,888
The guards have already gone over.
So just stay here.

37
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:18,809
(Someone!)

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,168
Guard the Chunxi Hall well.

39
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,008
If I don't go,

40
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,519
they will suspect us.

41
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,529
Hurry, someone!

42
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,849
Miss Man has fallen into the lake.

43
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,369
What happened?

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,328
Go and save her quickly!

45
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,168
She's right there.

46
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,529
Save her quickly!

47
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,849
- She's just over there.
- Hurry!

48
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,000
Madam Qin! Oh, Madam Qin,

49
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,568
Miss Man fell into the lake.

50
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,448
Please go and save her.

51
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,048
Don't worry.

52
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,529
The guards will do their best
to find her.

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,440
She's right over there.
I'll take you there.

54
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,280
Watch out!

55
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,448
(We found her!)

56
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:00,440
Help!

57
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,480
We found her! We found her.

58
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,129
Madam Liu.

59
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,809
You two,

60
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,519
help Madam Liu out of the water.

61
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,209
Miss Man, Madam Liu.

62
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,809
Go and change into dry clothes.

63
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,040
Don't catch a cold.

64
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,119
Okay, everyone! Get some rest.

65
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,328
All right. All of you can leave.

66
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,409
Come, let's go.

67
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,079
- Let's get some rest.
- Let's go.

68
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,079
They sure had a hard time.

69
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,488
That's great.

70
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,200
Madam Zhuang finally reunites
with her family.

71
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,328
At this time,

72
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,679
Mr. Sun and the rest
should be out of Wuzhou now.

73
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,288
Madam Zhuang and the rest want to wait

74
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,849
until we complete
our investigations here.

75
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,440
If people were missing,

76
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,880
Zhao Chong would be suspicious.

77
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,168
We'll have to hurry, then.

78
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,839
So they can all reunite
with their families.

79
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:51,839
All right.

80
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,440
So tell me,

81
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,560
what do you think

82
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,560
about Fuman's act today?

83
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,369
I don't think

84
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,399
she fell into the lake.

85
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,768
She came to Chunxi Hall

86
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,440
just to find your whereabouts

87
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,689
and Madam Liu bumped into me on purpose.

88
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,728
If you didn't appear

89
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,119
when something happened to me,

90
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,849
there's only one possibility.

91
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,320
It means you're not at home.

92
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,249
When Fuman saw you at Chunxi Hall,

93
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,320
she hurried to the lake
and pretended to be drowning.

94
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,839
So that was what happened.

95
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:20,849
You knew

96
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,288
they used you as a bait.

97
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,488
Why did you fall into their trap?

98
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,168
What if I didn't

99
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,599
return on time?

100
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,728
If both of us didn't show up,

101
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,608
wouldn't they be even more suspicious?

102
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,649
I asked Qiao

103
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,409
and two guards

104
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,839
to stay at Chunxi Hall.

105
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:33,769
If Fuman really

106
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,320
discovers something,

107
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,248
I'll ignore all consequences

108
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:38,519
and detain her.

109
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,320
And you?

110
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,560
Me?

111
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,928
I have so many guards.

112
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,719
What could possibly happen?

113
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:46,889
Oh.

114
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,839
I think there's something fishy
about Fuman.

115
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,048
She's from Yongping County.

116
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,209
She knows some medical skills
and pharmacology.

117
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,488
Judging by her age,

118
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,479
her family should be
in the medical profession.

119
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,248
She came to Wuzhou five or six years ago

120
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,719
and her family ran into trouble.

121
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,808
Look at this.

122
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:03,440
The incense she gave me yesterday

123
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,760
doesn't seem right.

124
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,368
Tomorrow, I'll send Yang Zhong

125
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,599
to investigate this.

126
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,488
I think there's something Zhao Chong

127
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,209
is suspicious

128
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,680
about Wei Xian.

129
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,440
If we don't get rid of that suspicion,
it'll be hard to get close to him.

130
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,839
Any news from Jingzhou?

131
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,920
Nothing for now.

132
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:27,680
However, I plan to meet

133
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,399
with Fuman tomorrow.

134
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,969
Fuman is both beautiful and talented.

135
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,248
With Wei Xian's character,

136
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,808
if his heart is not moved at all,

137
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,360
it would be hard to believe.

138
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,769
It's pitiful
that she fell into the lake.

139
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,440
If you go and see her tomorrow,

140
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,839
the timing will be right.

141
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,769
Why are you looking at me?

142
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,728
Whatever she does tomorrow,
just go along with her

143
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,279
and see what she's up to.

144
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:53,000
What if

145
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,760
she has ill intentions toward me?

146
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,399
You're a man.

147
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:02,279
Are you afraid of her?

148
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,800
It's not...

149
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:06,719
Someone's outside.

150
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,360
Qing, it's time to rest.

151
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,409
- Here.
- This is delicious.

152
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,529
Ru,

153
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,048
eat more meat.

154
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:55,440
Thank you, Mother.

155
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:56,500
Master,

156
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,329
a thief has broken into the courtyard
in Minqin Lane.

157
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,839
Broken into?

158
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll go and take a look.

159
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,688
Sit down.

160
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,529
You're pregnant.

161
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,969
Who would want to steal

162
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,440
from that small courtyard of yours?

163
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,409
But Li...

164
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,248
How about this?

165
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:11,728
Take two guards with you

166
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,039
to go and check.

167
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:13,880
Yes, Master.

168
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,409
Perhaps,

169
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,449
it wasn't a break-in.

170
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,128
It might be

171
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:20,769
some couple

172
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,079
having a tryst there.

173
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,089
Eat up.

174
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,159
Yes, indeed.

175
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,168
Wasn't the house bought

176
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,240
for that reason?

177
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,409
Didn't I move
all the valuable things here already?

178
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,608
What else are you worrying about?

179
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,519
Eat up.

180
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,920
- Yes, eat.
- It's nothing.

181
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:44,409
If the ledger

182
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,560
was kept in Li Di's small courtyard,

183
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,688
why wasn't he worried

184
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,680
when it was broken into?

185
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,928
Either the ledger

186
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,519
is not in the small courtyard,

187
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,009
or this ledger

188
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,800
is hidden very well.

189
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,839
But where could it be?

190
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,368
Madam, don't think too much.

191
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:02,569
Official Zhou

192
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,649
will definitely help you figure it out.

193
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,920
Have some water.

194
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,048
Madam, is your hand okay?

195
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:10,928
I'm fine.

196
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:12,079
Get up.

197
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,200
Dear.

198
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,849
Li, you're back.

199
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,680
Yes.

200
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:26,649
Why is your clothes wet?

201
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,719
Oh... Well...

202
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:30,009
I hurried back just now

203
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,649
and accidentally spilled tea on myself.

204
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,640
Dear.

205
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,879
How can you spill tea on yourself again?

206
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,408
I've missed you too much.

207
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,999
So I didn't pay notice
while drinking tea.

208
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:40,368
How did this happen again?

209
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:42,119
Come, let's help you get changed.

210
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,040
Okay.

211
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,479
Water.

212
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,280
(Lu Garden)

213
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,280
This is the taste of your hometown,
Yongping County.

214
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,959
These are all local dishes from Wuzhou.

215
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,400
If you want to try Yongping dishes,

216
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,520
I'll make them for you another day.

217
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,520
Sure.

218
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,759
By the way,

219
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,479
Madam Qin twisted her foot yesterday.

220
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,528
Thank you for treating her.

221
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,359
After she returned to the room,
she was completely fine.

222
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:22,400
Have you studied medicine before?

223
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,359
Just a little.

224
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh,

225
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,608
I also know how to blend medicine
for medicinal baths.

226
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,608
Medicinal bath?

227
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,329
Yes.

228
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,969
The medicinal bath she prepared

229
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,079
is the best.

230
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,479
Medicinal baths are good for health.

231
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,160
Why don't I prepare it for you?

232
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:41,999
Sure.

233
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,160
Follow me.

234
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,599
Medicinal bath?

235
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,239
Could there be hidden motives?

236
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,929
Qingxi,

237
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,449
what's wrong with the lady today?

238
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,200
Master Wei went to Dongli Garden.

239
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,209
Why do I have to be concerned

240
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,400
about him going to Dongli Garden?

241
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,329
Qingxi,

242
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,599
the flowers you picked today
are not good.

243
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,040
But

244
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,169
didn't you always say

245
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,888
that natural things
always look beautiful

246
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,440
no matter how you look at them?

247
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,320
Why are they not beautiful to you today?

248
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,520
I think it's Master Wei who's not good.

249
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,089
But

250
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,089
I think Master Wei is a decent person.

251
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,999
He's not the kind to easily change
his affections.

252
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,839
What do you mean by "affections?"

253
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,209
We're here to solve the case.

254
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,839
He's doing his duty.

255
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,368
Besides,

256
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:46,359
why does it matter to me
if he's easily swayed?

257
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,359
Master! Master!

258
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:52,449
Madam Qin,

259
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,809
have you seen my Master?

260
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,849
What's wrong?

261
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,128
Why are you panicking?

262
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,368
We've received news from Jingzhou.

263
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:59,128
Wei Xian has a scar here.

264
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:00,768
I think Zhao Chong sent Fuman here

265
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,719
to confirm this matter.

266
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,368
Mr. Wei, the medicinal bath is ready.

267
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,440
Let me remove your clothes.

268
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,008
I can do it myself.

269
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,449
Didn't I come here

270
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,728
precisely to do these things?

271
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,408
Let me help you.

272
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,809
I think we should forget it.

273
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,289
It may be a medicinal bath.

274
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,560
But if Madam Qin finds out,

275
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,809
she may not think that way.

276
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,929
Don't worry.

277
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,689
Madam Liu is watching outside.

278
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,248
Madam Liu is so petite.

279
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:36,200
She can't stop Madam Qin.

280
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:38,400
I think we should forget it.

281
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,248
Besides, the smell
of this medicinal bath

282
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:41,728
is too strong.

283
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:43,449
Madam Qin definitely can't stand it.

284
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,728
Wei, this medicinal bath

285
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:48,209
may smell a bit now.

286
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,479
But it won't have a smell afterward.

287
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,809
You should try it.

288
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,599
Come.

289
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,680
Madam Qin! Madam Qin!

290
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,969
Madam Qin, no.

291
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,209
Madam Qin, you can't.

292
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,879
Mister Wei is taking his bath.

293
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:02,879
Get out.

294
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,239
What are you doing?

295
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:06,689
Wei!

296
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,408
Qing,

297
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,248
Miss Man is helping me prepare
the medicinal bath.

298
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:10,488
- Look.
- Medicinal bath?

299
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:11,008
See?

300
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,440
It's a medicinal bath.

301
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,408
I think you're trying to drug me!

302
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,040
Madam Qin,

303
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,320
how can you be so unreasonable?

304
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,008
Unreasonable?

305
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,160
Did you just criticize me?

306
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,200
Wei, she scolded me.

307
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,929
Oh, Qing.

308
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,099
Don't get upset, okay?

309
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,008
We'll return to our room.
We'll talk when we get there.

310
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,648
No, you can't leave.

311
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,128
Today,

312
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,800
I want to make things clear.

313
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,209
Make things clear?

314
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,089
What rights do you have

315
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,520
to talk to me?

316
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,359
Wei,

317
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,368
it was Mr. Zhao who suggested

318
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,008
that you take me back home.

319
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:46,169
If you didn't want to,

320
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,809
you could have refused him.

321
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,528
Why did you agree to Mr. Zhao

322
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,248
and treat me like this?

323
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,248
It's hard for me
to refuse his hospitality.

324
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:54,608
Is it just that

325
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:56,089
or do you also

326
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,079
have feelings for me?

327
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,239
Absolutely not.

328
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,719
Did you hear that?

329
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,560
Madam Qin,

330
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,680
I never wanted to compete with you.

331
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:11,600
Why are you like this?

332
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:13,008
You're lying without batting an eyelid.

333
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,408
You're precisely competing with me now.

334
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:15,320
Let's go.

335
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:16,449
No, you can't.

336
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,289
Come with me!

337
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,560
No, don't!

338
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:19,640
Come!

339
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,289
No, I won't allow it!

340
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm pregnant!

341
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,479
Really?

342
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:32,400
The physician has checked.

343
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,160
Then you must not get angry.

344
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:36,680
Let's go back first.

345
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:48,569
Let's get inside the room.

346
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,160
Be careful not to disturb the baby.

347
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,119
I've finally got you back.

348
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,528
Did you find anything?

349
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:02,888
There is a scar

350
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,560
on Wei Xian's waist.

351
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,368
No wonder

352
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:07,809
she kept trying to take off my clothes.

353
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,049
As a man,

354
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,969
you let a lady

355
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,849
take off your clothes?

356
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,408
Well, she failed.

357
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:14,520
I have to fight this to the death.

358
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,560
If Zhao Chong's suspicions
are not resolved,

359
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,079
what should we do after this?

360
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,119
Sir.

361
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,888
How's the situation?

362
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:42,768
Besides the kitchen,

363
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,608
I've searched
all other places with water.

364
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,728
But I found nothing.

365
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:46,488
Also,

366
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:47,849
Li Di has sent two guards

367
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,119
to patrol the small courtyard
at random times.

368
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,368
Keep an eye on them.

369
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,289
We'll play it by ear.

370
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:53,999
Yes, sir.

371
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,640
Let's go to the kitchen.

372
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,920
Water.

373
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,728
I know

374
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,888
why Li Di remained so calm

375
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:39,520
when the small courtyard
was broken into.

376
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,999
This is a water circulation device.

377
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,089
I heard my father

378
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,488
and Li Di talk about it before.

379
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:47,119
So I have some recollection.

380
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:48,800
As water is added,

381
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,079
the water level
in the bamboo tube rises.

382
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,849
When the float on top

383
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,888
reaches a certain height,

384
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,560
it connects to the internal water tank
and activates the device.

385
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,648
However, the water level

386
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,209
must reach a specified scale.

387
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,959
There can be no deviation.

388
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,239
There are four bamboo tubes in total.

389
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,289
Each

390
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,879
with ten scales.

391
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,040
If we try them one by one,

392
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,920
there will be over ten thousand
possible combinations.

393
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,520
What combination would Li Di use?

394
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,800
Is there anything or anyone

395
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:20,879
he particularly cares about?

396
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,440
His mother,

397
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,839
Madam He,

398
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,959
or

399
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:27,599
you.

400
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:29,800
What Li Di cares most

401
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,400
about is himself.

402
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,929
When is his birthday?

403
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,800
He was born on the second day
of the third month.

404
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,680
But the numbers three and two
only represent two scales.

405
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,160
Let's try.

406
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,479
What about the other two?

407
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,999
What Li Di cares most about...

408
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,820
(Safe Number 18)

409
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,440
Oh, I know.

410
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,719
The combination
is three, two, one, eight.

411
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,408
Three and two represent himself.

412
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,350
One and eight is the number
of his safe at the money house.

413
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,368
What he cares the most about

414
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,039
are only himself and money.

415
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,280
(Ledger)

416
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,608
Why is the door opened?

417
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,120
Let's go inside and check it out.
Let's go.

418
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,608
Hide here.

419
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:14,489
What about you?

420
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,160
Don't worry about me. Get inside.

421
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,519
Did you notice anything?

422
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,840
Nothing.

423
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,039
Who's there?

424
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,799
There's someone outside.
Go and take a look.

425
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,360
Don't touch me.

426
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:21,999
Don't wet the ledger.

427
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,559
Why are you worried about the ledger
at a time like this?

428
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:27,200
Are you worried about me

429
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,600
more than the ledger?

430
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:35,880
Who's there?

431
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,688
I found this money pouch.

432
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:38,569
Is this yours?

433
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,408
No, it's not.

434
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,089
Leave now.

435
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,039
Not yours?

436
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,039
Just leave.

437
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
(Baixiang Pavilion)

438
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,559
Your clothes are wet too.

439
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,319
You should head back and get some rest.

440
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,920
Don't catch a cold.

441
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,920
I know you're hurt

442
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,120
and guilt-stricken.

443
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,200
You blame yourself for everything

444
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,479
that happened to the Shen family.

445
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,640
You wish all this

446
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,719
would disappear in an instant.

447
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:52,200
Even if it means sacrificing yourself.

448
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,640
But, Shen Ran.

449
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,080
Please remember this.

450
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,640
There are many people in this world
who care about you.

451
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,688
Your father, your sister,

452
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:06,440
and...

453
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,719
They will suffer greatly
if anything happens to you.

You're up.

465
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:44,999
You fainted just now.

466
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,719
It should be due to excessive worry.

467
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,360
A good rest will help.

468
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,719
Is the ledger useful?

469
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,039
Of course.

470
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,688
Every receipt,

471
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:01,809
delivery quantity,

472
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,160
value,

473
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,880
and the whereabouts
of the embezzled funds

474
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,999
are clearly recorded.

475
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,208
Can this prove

476
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,640
Li Di's crime?

477
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:11,200
Also,

478
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,400
there is news from Official Lu

479
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:16,519
that they've found the timber yard
of the logging

480
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,009
and evidence linking the person
Li Di is reporting to

481
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,080
is indeed Zhao Chong from Wuzhou.

482
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:23,479
Your father's construction plans

483
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,039
are also with Zhao Chong.

484
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,168
If Official Lu can arrest Zhao Chong,

485
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:28,849
he can save my father.

486
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,840
So

487
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,368
putting Zhao Chong on trial is the key.

488
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,968
This matter is so serious.

489
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:35,249
There must be someone in the court

490
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,608
colluding with them.

491
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:37,368
Li Di can't be

492
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:38,368
the only one

493
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:39,759
involved in this.

494
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,049
But no matter what,

495
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,719
we have gained something.

496
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,329
By the way,

497
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,489
did Official Lu's letter

498
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,080
mention my sister?

499
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,440
I can't believe

500
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,249
Zhen went to do such a dangerous thing.

501
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,999
She didn't even write to me.

502
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,360
You should take care of yourself first.

503
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,729
Official Lu will definitely

504
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,319
take good care of your sister.

505
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,799
It's getting late.

506
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,120
I should get going now.

507
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:25,479
Wait.

508
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,569
It's windy outside.

509
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,120
You should cover yourself.

510
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:46,600
Thank you.

511
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:26,920
What's wrong?

512
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:28,360
You can't draw?

513
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,759
No.

514
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,600
Is there something wrong with the brush?

515
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,769
The brush works finely.

516
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,880
You gave me

517
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:38,440
this brush.

518
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:34,600
Master!

519
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,640
Master!

520
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,719
I...

521
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,039
I was just helping him draw a scar.

522
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:44,400
Master,

523
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:45,999
I've obtained information
on Fuman background.

524
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,999
The Bai clan of Yongping?

525
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,648
Madam Qin, why is your face

526
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:57,600
flushing today?

527
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,479
The weather is a little warm.

528
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:03,968
It's already the late autumn.

529
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:05,600
Is it still warm?

530
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:10,360
Leave.

531
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,759
I won't be in your way.
Please excuse me.

532
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:22,719
So

533
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,719
shall we continue?

534
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,680
Master.

535
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,089
Zhao Chong sent a messenger

536
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,840
saying he had grain in stock.

537
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:06,049
But he wants to test

538
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,120
the extent of your capacity.

539
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,529
How much is he expecting?

540
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,200
Ten chests of gold.

541
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:17,360
It seems that the fire
at the timber yard

542
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:19,880
has put Zhao Chong
in a difficult situation.

543
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,519
The repair of the West Canal is urgent

544
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:24,729
and he urgently needs money

545
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,559
to solve this batch of willow wood.

546
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:29,368
Notify the Wei family of Jingzhou
to send the gold first.

547
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:30,559
We'll make up for it

548
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,049
after returning to the capital.

549
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,799
Okay.

550
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,799
If we can get rid of Zhao Chong's
suspicions tonight,

551
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:39,840
we can close in on them.

552
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:41,959
I'll get going.

553
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,279
Should I keep an eye on Dongli Garden?

554
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,759
You're pregnant.

555
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,640
So you should rest in Chunxi Hall.

556
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,680
You...

557
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:54,400
I only want to help you.

558
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,279
Master Zhao said
he'll give you one more day.

559
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,688
If you still can't confirm

560
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:04,089
Mr. Wei's identity,

561
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,769
not to mention your antidote,

562
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,289
even your younger sister

563
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,400
may not survive.

564
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,319
Just glaring at me like this won't help.

565
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:15,208
I know you and your sister
have had a tough life.

566
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:16,920
But what can you do about it?

567
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,809
Get this done quickly

568
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,648
and see if you can plead with Mr. Zhao

569
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:21,809
for mercy.

570
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,360
Beg him?

571
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:25,799
As for the drug,

572
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,128
you should do it as soon as you can.

573
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:28,279
How can I do that?

574
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,208
I can't even see him.

575
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,688
That's something

576
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:33,799
you have to figure out.

577
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,039
Miss Man!

578
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:38,799
Speaking of the devil.

579
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,999
How can a man resist a beauty like you?

580
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,719
Get out of my way.

581
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:47,769
Miss Man.

582
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,368
Wei.

583
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,249
Come here.

584
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,208
Why are you here?

585
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:51,360
Let's have a drink together.

586
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:53,289
Aren't you afraid that Madam Qin...

587
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,208
Stop talking about her.

588
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:56,648
What can she do to me?

589
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:58,400
She listens to me.

590
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,559
Come, have a drink.

591
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,529
I shall stay to see if you

592
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,608
and Miss Man

593
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,920
need anything.

594
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,600
Madam Liu, I didn't know
you had such a hobby.

595
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:13,840
Well, not at all.

596
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:15,489
I shall take my leave, then.

597
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,408
Wait.

598
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:17,719
Come back here.

599
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:19,888
Go and prepare the bath.

600
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:22,519
I'm spending the night here.

601
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:23,809
All right.

602
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,360
I'll go and prepare it now.

603
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,928
Wei, why don't we have some tea first?

604
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:29,529
Come.

605
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,249
You can sober up.

606
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,329
Why tea? Let's enjoy wine instead.

607
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,648
Watch your steps.

608
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:34,719
Fill it up.

609
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:37,279
Be careful.

610
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:51,880
Wei, let me help you.

611
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,440
It's a little cold.

612
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,920
Let me test the water temperature.

613
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,009
It's a little cold now.

614
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm afraid of catching a cold
if I get in.

615
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,519
Is that so?

616
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,600
You can leave.

617
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,719
I'll get some wine.

618
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,840
Miss Man, the wine is here.

619
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,120
Madam Liu,

620
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,489
the water is too cold.

621
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,928
Fetch the hot water.

622
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:39,799
Yes.

623
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,840
Wei,

624
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,640
let's drink some wine
to warm ourselves up.

625
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:08,200
Wei, here you go.

626
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,440
A toast to you.

627
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,920
Why don't

628
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,400
we have a toast together?

629
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,559
Madam Liu!

630
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:39,999
If I were you,

631
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,319
I wouldn't yell.

632
00:32:43,889 --> 00:32:45,329
You're not Wei Xian.

633
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,680
Does that matter?

634
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,529
It's all good

635
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,049
as long as Madam Liu thinks I am.

636
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,200
She saw my scar.

637
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,719
Miss Man,

638
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,279
you're nothing but a pawn.

639
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,319
If you die here today,

640
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:00,329
it won't affect

641
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,120
my dealings with Zhao Chong.

642
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,039
But your younger sister

643
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,999
will live alone without anyone
to depend on.

644
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,600
She might have to follow your path.

645
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,489
You know everything?

646
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,640
Maybe there's still something
I don't know.

647
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,279
It depends on

648
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,920
whether you still want to live or not.

649
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,959
If I tell you,

650
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:39,648
what can you do?

651
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:40,880
Without eliminating Zhao Chong,

652
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:42,640
you and your sister

653
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,769
will never see the light of day again.

654
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,640
The light of day?

655
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:52,168
Zhao Chong poisoned me

656
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,208
with Xulingzi poison.

657
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:55,719
Once taken,

658
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:59,400
without the antidote,
it's certain death.

659
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,809
The Xulingzi poison belong
to the Bai family?

660
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,880
Yes.

661
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,888
But Xulingzi's antidote

662
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:08,239
is extremely complex to make.

663
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,399
And Zhao Chong also bought the formula.

664
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,729
My parents have long since passed away.

665
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,689
In this world,

666
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,200
only Zhao Chong has the antidote.

667
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,040
The Bai family's misfortune,

668
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:22,239
which led to your parents' deaths
and separation from your sister.

669
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,399
Was it all Zhao Chong doing?

670
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:27,040
Yes.

671
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,879
Later,

672
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,480
I was brought to Wuzhou.

673
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,640
My sister's whereabouts are unknown
until this day.

674
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,729
But I'm sure

675
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,759
she's with Zhao Chong.

676
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,209
They are using my sister's life

677
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,560
to threaten me,

678
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,000
saying that as long as
I complete the task,

679
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,680
they will free me

680
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,879
and reunite with my sister.

681
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:54,560
Do you believe that?

682
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,200
No, I don't.

683
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,960
But what can I do?

684
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,160
(Magistrate Office)

685
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:16,680
It's up to you

686
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:18,680
to trust the officials or the bandits.

687
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,399
You're an Imperial Inspector?

688
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:26,129
I've confirmed

689
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,960
the scar on Wei Xian's waist.

690
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,120
I saw it with my own eyes.

691
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:37,649
Mr. Wei has prepared

692
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,289
the ten chests of gold,

693
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,640
which were urgently sent from Jingzhou.

694
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,480
Has Wei Xian taken Xulingzi?

695
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:47,729
It's been taken care of.

696
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,799
Remember to make him take it every day.

697
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:52,088
If he dares to disobey me in the future,

698
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:54,200
I will end his life.

699
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,799
Yes.

700
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,080
This month's antidote.

701
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,399
Listen to me well.

702
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,560
In a few days,

703
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:20,239
Wei Xian will be addicted.

704
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,319
You're truly a beauty.

705
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,088
Someone in the capital is investigating

706
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,000
the West Canal case.

707
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,759
Could it be Wei Xian?

708
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,849
Didn't you have suspicions

709
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,239
about him before?

710
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:07,729
Fuman has confirmed his identity.

711
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,609
And Xulingzi

712
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,368
has been given to him.

713
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:12,359
Then he's clear from suspicion.

714
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,319
Not necessarily.

715
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,640
In case he is being threatened
by someone.

716
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,928
It's his ten chests of gold

717
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:22,879
that I must get my hands on.

718
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:27,528
It's to make up

719
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:30,279
for that batch of willow wood
you've lost.

720
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,719
Forgive me for my incompetence.

721
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:34,169
Tell Wei Xian to come here.

722
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes.

723
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,729
Wei, you're here.

724
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,799
Zhao,

725
00:37:58,569 --> 00:37:59,839
sorry to keep you waiting.

726
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,719
Greetings, Mr. Zhao.

727
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,919
Pang Hu, you can leave first.

728
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,649
My cousin is a rough person.

729
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,960
So don't mind him.

730
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:36,040
No matter.

731
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:37,488
No need to worry, Zhao.

732
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,719
I'm much obliged.

733
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,600
Please sit down.

734
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:42,319
Thank you, Zhao.

735
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,329
Originally, I thought

736
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,289
it would cause a rift

737
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,319
between you two.

738
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,919
Now, it seems I was worried for nothing.

739
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,408
Zhao, you may not know this.

740
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,729
If you didn't invite me,

741
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,649
I'm afraid Qing wouldn't even talk

742
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,568
to me now.

743
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,319
That's not it.

744
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:09,249
I was a little angry before.

745
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,129
But

746
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,439
I have to thank you for the painting
you gave me.

747
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,968
Now, even if there was Miss Man

748
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:17,769
or ten or eight more of her,

749
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,640
I can accommodate them.

750
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,888
Madam Qin, you're indeed pregnant.

751
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:26,008
Be careful now.

752
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:27,008
Mrs. Zhao.

753
00:39:27,009 --> 00:39:27,849
I heard you're here.

754
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,200
So I came specially for you.

755
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,528
You're already pregnant.

756
00:39:31,529 --> 00:39:32,088
Don't drink

757
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:33,249
with them here.

758
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,888
Let's go and admire
some paintings with me.

759
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,368
It's fine.

760
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:37,769
Even if she can't drink,

761
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,888
it would be nice if she could stay

762
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,399
and pour wine for Zhao.

763
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,399
Madam Qin,

764
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,448
Wei said

765
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,048
you like landscape paintings.

766
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,368
Recently, we have obtained
two new landscape paintings.

767
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,359
Are you interested?

768
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,359
Landscape paintings?

769
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:57,209
Then I'll take advantage
of your generosity

770
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,609
to broaden my horizons.

771
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,480
Let's go.

772
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,209
Since Qing got pregnant,

773
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,448
her body has been weak.

774
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:05,120
She would feel lazy to move
after a short walk.

775
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,560
I shouldn't trouble you, Mrs. Zhao.

776
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,249
It'll spoil your fun.

777
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,769
It's better than staying here.

778
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,528
Later,

779
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:12,968
it'll be even more unbearable for her

780
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:14,129
to smell of meat and alcohol.

781
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,879
Let's go and admire the paintings.

782
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:20,769
Come on.

783
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,329
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Zhao.

784
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,439
It's nothing. Walk slowly.

785
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:25,399
Why?

786
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:26,209
Are you that reluctant

787
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,160
to see Madam Qin leave?

788
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,928
Usually,

789
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,448
I've spoiled her too much.

790
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:34,048
I'm worried she'll behave senselessly

791
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,160
and trouble Mrs. Zhao.

792
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:38,289
It's no trouble at all.

793
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,488
From now on, you and I are family.

794
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:41,359
Come, let's drink.

795
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:42,719
Let's enjoy some drinks.

796
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,600
Take your time.

797
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:51,528
Compared to your collection,

798
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:52,609
my previous ones

799
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,399
are simply unbearable.

800
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:55,368
Ever since

801
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,368
you mentioned

802
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:58,209
you wanted to visit the gallery
that day.

803
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,249
I've kept it in mind.

804
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,689
After much persuasion,

805
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,809
I finally got my husband to agree.

806
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,649
Thank you for your kindness, Mrs. Zhao.

807
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,769
My only regret is not growing

808
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,879
another pair of eyes
to admire all of these.

809
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:12,088
Don't worry, take your time.

810
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:13,040
Okay.

811
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,200
Just admire all you want.

812
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:43,239
You're...

813
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,560
Where's Mrs. Zhao?

814
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:48,488
Don't come near me.

815
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:49,088
Wei

816
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:49,809
is currently

817
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,120
with Mr. Zhao.

818
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,359
Mrs. Zhao!

819
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,129
Open the door!

820
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,209
I'm afraid your husband

821
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,160
has already been captured.

822
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:04,080
What are you talking about?

823
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:05,849
We came after being invited here

824
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,080
to discuss cooperation.

825
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,088
Is this how Mr. Zhao

826
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:09,408
treats his guests?

827
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:10,849
Stop the nonsense.

828
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,719
Wei family of Jingzhou?

829
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,480
We've received news

830
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:16,319
that he's a fake.

831
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,448
Fake?

832
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:19,160
Tell me.

833
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,480
What are your intentions?

834
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:24,759
What are you talking about?

835
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,640
You're a fine lady.

836
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:29,568
Don't make me use force.

837
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:30,568
Sir,

838
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:32,448
I've been with him for five years.

839
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,839
How could he be fake?

840
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,680
You're not lying to me, are you?

841
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,120
How can he be fake?

842
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,048
Back then, Mrs. Wei

843
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:44,600
even gave a scratch on my face.

844
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,960
Could it be

845
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,399
that he's really lying to me?

846
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,160
Can you tell me?

847
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:52,439
Don't try and change the subject.

848
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:54,609
Tell me why you're in Wuzhou.

849
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,448
We're here to do business.

850
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,329
We're purchasing grains to brew wine.

851
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,249
Tell me the truth!

852
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,520
I'm telling the truth.

853
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,040
He wouldn't lie to me.

854
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,408
I'm even pregnant now.

855
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:07,448
He promised

856
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:09,439
he would take me back
to the Wei Residence.

857
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:13,040
I'm going to confront him now.

858
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,279
Confront him?

859
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:20,359
I'm afraid both of you can never leave
the Zhao Residence alive today.
