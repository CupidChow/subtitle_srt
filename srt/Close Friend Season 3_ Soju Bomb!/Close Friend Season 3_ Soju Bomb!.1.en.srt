Sathu-se-yo!

00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,319
I pray for Project T's debut.

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
Huh?

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,079
Maybe I should pray in Korean?

Hi, Mom.

11
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,159
Mm.

12
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,530
Yes, I bought shampoo.

13
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Mm. I miss you too.

14
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,159
Okay. Please look
after Dobby for me.

15
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,719
What? Dobby isn't a gecko.
He's a lizard.

16
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,280
You'll be the first to know
once we get to debut.

17
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,080
Bye.

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,039
- Best!
- Hey!

22
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,159
Come on!

23
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,520
- Best, what's going on?
- What's happening?

24
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,439
You guys are finally here.

25
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,599
Best, what do you mean when
you said we're getting to debut?

26
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,120
These past three years
aren't going to waste, right?

27
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,480
The god of Han River has
finally heard our prayers!

28

- Sathu-se-yo!
- Sathu.

30

How sacred!

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,199
Okay, get a grip on yourselves
and listen carefully.

32
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,399
- Okay.
- Okay?

33
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,050
The thing is

34
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
- the other day...
- Uh-huh.

35
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,480
The record company called us over
to do a promotional video, right?

36
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,879
Soo-Young texted me today to say

37
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,879
the president's calling
for an urgent meeting with us.

38
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,959
What else do you guys
think that could be about?

39
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,050

40
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,170
- Except...
- Except...

41
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,079
- Our debut!
- Our debut!

42
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,839
All together!

43
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
- Project T!
- Project T!

44
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,360
Excuse me?

45
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,079
We've decided

46
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,879
to disband Project T

47
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,439
and to terminate

48
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,680
all of your contracts

49
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,879
with us.

50
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,680
All of you will be

51
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,000
sent back to Thailand

52
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,319
in seven days.

53
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,800
I didn't quite catch that.

55
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,079
Do you mind translating for me

56
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,040
in Thai?

57
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,279
The company decided
to disband Project T.

58
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,959
You have to pack your things and fly
back to Thailand in seven days.

59
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,120
Are you saying...

60
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,839
You're all fired.

61
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,639
Hey.

62
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,800
Seriously, do you actually
find this acceptable?

63
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,120
The company just dropped us!

64
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,639
What are we going to do now?

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,759
Where are we going
to find money for our expenses?

66
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
If I'd known,

67
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,920
I would've prayed in Korean.

68
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,000
Guys, maybe we shouldn't be
so stressed about this.

69
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,600
We're still young.

70
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,560
I think it's an opportunity for us
to do something new.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Despite the fact

72
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,920
that we've sacrificed
our adolescence to become idols?

73
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,959
How much time have we wasted
these past three years?

74
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,759
How many opportunities have we lost?

75
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,360
We went through grueling rehearsals

76
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,480
and followed
all of their stupid rules.

77
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,519
We barely had a life.

78
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,519
And you're just going to give up?

79
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,279
Whatever.

80
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,560
I'm not going to let this slide,
and you guys can't either.

81
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,920
So what do you want us to do?

82
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,240
Are you going to beg
the president so he'd give in?

83
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,039
When are you going
to accept reality?

84
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,240
We've all been dropped.

85
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If I'd known,

86
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,639
I'd have skipped
rehearsals ages ago!

87
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,679
Why did I follow their rules?

88
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,519
What's the point?

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,159
They still treated us like that.

90
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,330
Look at Au.
He's been doing it since he was 14.

91
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,210
He's never even tasted booze!

92
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,840
That's rich coming from you.

93
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,159

Today,

101
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,639
we're going
to get completely wasted!

106
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,120
Here. I'll open it.

107
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,720
Uh... isn't that too much?

108
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,960
No, that's how it is.

109
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,210
That table's doing the same thing.

110
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,159
What table?

111
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,440

00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,679
Definitely.

113
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,840
I thought you had the guts.

114
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,200
Shut up and drink.

115
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,759
- That's right. Drink up.
- You too.

116

120
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,159

What? You're on social media?

124
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
Of course. I just signed up.

- Someone just followed me.

128

00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,559
- What?
- I thought it was a girl. Darn it.

130
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,240
Earth, do you want to pray?

131
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,159
I know an incantation.

132
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,960

133

That's all I can say.

141
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,080
I should find
someone to teach me more.

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,159

Korean, can't you?

A little,

145
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,120
but I understand everything.

146
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,960
Is this your first time?

147
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,080
What? You should enjoy your youth!

148
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,120
Is this how you really
want it to be?

149
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,200
What's that over there?
It looks interesting.

150
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,039
Do you want to find out?

151
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Shall we have fun together then?

Twenty.

154
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,559
- One.
- Two.

155
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,399
- Three.
- Four.

156
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,120
Ah!

157
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,240
Even though you didn't count
the numbers I set,

158
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,919
you still have to drink
if you pull away at the same time.

159

- Love shot!
- Love shot!

- Love shot!
- Love shot!

164
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,360
- Love shot!
- Love shot!

165
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,200
- Love shot!
- Love shot!

apple.

172
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,119
What? This is foul!

173
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,960
- Hey.
- Hand it over, Earth.

174
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,039
Come on.

175
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,759
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

176
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,890
Drinking beer
the normal way is boring.

177
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,480
I'll introduce you
to something unique to Korea.

178
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,119
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

179
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,920
- Whoa!
- Wow!

180
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,319
- Soju Bomb!
- Oh!

181
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,079
You okay?

182
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,319
We're going to vomit
this time around.

183
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,680
You don't have to try
if you're scared.

184
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,359
All right.

185
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,920
- Soju Bomb!
- Soju Bomb!

186
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,559
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

187
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,119
Shoot!

188
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,720
Huh?

189
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,079
So drunk that you cracked your head?

190
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,279
So pretty.

191
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,920
And do you like it?

192
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,319
Meow.

193
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,440
Aw. So cute.

194
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,240
Haven't we tried hard enough?

195
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,480
What's wrong?

196
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,119
We're trainees who never got

197
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,000
to live our teenage lives.

198
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,200
We spent our time

199
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,920
following the company's rules.

200
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,410
But they bailed on us in the end.

201
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,799
We were so stupid.

202
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,720
Oh, so you guys are idol trainees.

203
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,920
I heard the rules are super strict.

204
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,759
We... uh...

205
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,650
The record company
terminated our contracts.

206
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,359
So we came here together

207
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,839
to break the rules.

208
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,519
Are you crazy? Are you going to
let them treat you like that?

209
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,680
You have to get back at them!

210
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,799
We're just kids.

211
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,400
That stupid company came up
with those stupid rules.

212
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,200
Let's trash their signs!

213
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,240
- Come on!
- Let's do it!

214
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,599
All right!

215
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,359
Hey.

216
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,359
Hey, Au!

217
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,720
Ten ironclad rules for trainees!

218
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,160
Rule number two!

219
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,799
- Number two!
- What is it?

220
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
No dating.

221
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,599
Au!

222
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Rule number six! No tattoos!

223
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,559
Here! Your turn!

224
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,039
- Smash it!
- Smash it!

225
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,759
Hey! What are you doing?

226
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
I think we got away!

227
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,039
- Did we?
- We did!

228
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,440
I'm so exhausted!

229
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,920
You guys are so cool!

230
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,440
That was so awesome!

231
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,519
There's still one bottle left tho.

232
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,079
Then let's keep going!

233
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,400
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

234
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,960
- What?
- Are you up for it?

235
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,559
- Whoo!
- What's with you?

236
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,519
Are you drunk?

237
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:22,839
- Aw. So cute.
- Go away. Leave me alone.

238
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,200
Soju!

239
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,599
Oh, please. Leave me alone.

240
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,720
- Hey, guys.
- Huh?

241
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,440
Don't forget about me, okay?
After going back to Thailand,

242
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,160
don't forget me,

243
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,839
all of you.

244
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,680
- What's his name again?
- Beats me.

245
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,599
What?

246
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Hey, look at him!

247
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,000
Au's transformed again!

248
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,960
Look!

249
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,640
Au, you're so cool!

250
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,359
Look at him!

251
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,839
I think he's being a toad this time.

252
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,799
Higher!

253
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,519
- So cool!
- Higher, Au!

254
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,039
- So cool!

255
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,119
Higher!

256
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,920
Come on.

257
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,519
Oh, he's being King Kong!

258
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,640
Higher!

00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,240

Controlling power equipment
wirelessly on the white sand beach.

265
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,240
Six. Playing with fireworks

266
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,599
Shoot!

267
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,079
Win! Dunk!

00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,200
Ugh!

290
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240

291
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,359

00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,279
This isn't Seoul.

00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,759
Welcome to Busan, kids.

297
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,519
- Busan?
- Busan?

298
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,200
No wallet, no phone. Nothing.

299
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,880
We can't go back to Thailand
without our passports.

300
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,960
I'll handle it.

301
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,160
