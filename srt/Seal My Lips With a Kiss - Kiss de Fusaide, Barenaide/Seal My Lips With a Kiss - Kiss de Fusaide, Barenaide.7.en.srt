1
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:25,092
Mr. Mizoguchi.

2
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:30,266
Did you fall asleep?

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,116
Jeez.

4
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,006
Mr. Mizoguchi.

5
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:51,956
Today

6
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,836
was a tiring day.

7
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:29,986
Sato.

8
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:40,436
You're so pretty.

9
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:48,246
Who is

10
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:50,686
the one you love?

11
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:00,746

[Episode 7]

23
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:04,966
Kaede.

24
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:18,546
Huh?

25
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,466
It's Mr. Shioya.

26
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,706
Or rather,

27
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,036
why were you sleeping with Mizoguchi?

28
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:51,076
He drank an enormous amount of beer,

29
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:57,246
then, I also ended up dozing off.

30
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:01,676
Shall we wake him up?

31
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,416
Mr. Shioya.

32
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:12,926
Mr. Mizoguchi's right here.

33
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:17,366
I hurried to finish work and come home,

34
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:20,696
but the party was already over,

35
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,206
and you two were happily sleeping.

36
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:33,076
There's nothing I can say about that.

37
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:51,376
But it's nice to see you're feeling better.

38
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,286
Mr. Shioya is sulking!

39
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,476
How super rare!

40
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,786
Is it morning already?

41
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,426
It's still night.

42
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:13,206
You drank way too much.

43
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:15,986
If you're gonna sleep,
then please sleep on a futon.

44
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:19,616
What, you were sleeping, too?

45
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:24,466
- I was, but not to the point of drooling.
- What was that?

46
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:31,076
C'mon, I told you not to do that! Annoying.

47
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:33,516
At least have some water.

48
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,716
Ms. Sato.

49
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:49,576
Sir.

50
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:51,706
Do you have a moment?

51
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:53,562
Okay.

52
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:55,966
I wanna talk about Ms. Usuda.

53
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:04,346
Mr. Mizoguchi shared with me some details.

54
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:18,706
The other day, I tampered
with a contract without authorization,

55
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:20,936
and caused a lot of trouble.

56
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:26,456
Therefore, I would like to take responsibility
and resign.

57
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,806
I am truly sorry for all this.

58
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:41,236
Well then, I'll take my leave.

59
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,506
Please wait.

60
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:04,436
Ms. Usuda, you really don't believe
this solves everything, right?

61
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:10,536
If you're going to quit,

62
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:14,746
then please do so after providing
proper working conditions for Ms. Sato.

63
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,736
Isn't that what taking responsibility means?

64
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,326
You came to bow your head to me many times,

65
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:45,366
and to learn about the job.

66
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,976
You did nothing wrong.

67
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,556
I'm sorry.

68
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:06,116
But what I did is unforgivable.

69
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:12,166
I understand that better than anyone.

70
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:18,746
Ms. Usuda!

71
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:24,556
I wasn't properly handed over my duties.

72
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:27,732
What?

73
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,096
There are still many things

74
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,566
I want to learn from you.

75
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:40,356
Ms. Sato.

76
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:50,826
Sir, Sato said this too.

77
00:08:50,826 --> 00:08:53,936
I'll be sure to follow up from now on.

78
00:08:55,576 --> 00:09:01,786
Well, fortunately, it seems
it hasn't inconvenienced our clients,

79
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:07,886
so I'll be sure to let you oversee
the handovers from now on, and report to me.

80
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,096
Yes, sir.

81
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:16,796
Thank you for your help.

82
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:21,786
It was nothing. We can't resolve things
by leaving them the way they are.

83
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:27,996
There are some things
that Ms. Usuda did which I do get.

84
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:34,486
It seems that she really trusted Ms. Oribe.

85
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:43,716
But, I think it's ridiculous
to end things by quitting.

86
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:53,546
That's why, I was happy
that you spoke on behalf of me.

87
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:07,266
There's something I have to apologize
to you as well.

88
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,138
What?

89
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,306
Before you were transferred,

90
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,926
I also heard unflattering rumors
about you from Ms. Usuda.

91
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:22,666
And I took those stories at face value.

92
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,436
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,956
Ah, please raise your head.

94
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:40,386
It just shows that's how much you trusted her.

95
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:45,316
Besides, it's different now, right?

96
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,756
I wonder.

97
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:56,256
Just kidding, you're doing fine.

98
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:01,596
Come on, cut that out.

99
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:03,986
You're messing it up.

100
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,726
If it happens again, I'll get back at them.

101
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:12,026
These looks so good.

102
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:23,466
There are so many cakes.

103
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,406
They look tasty.

104
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:28,016
We work hard, so let's eat hard.

105
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:30,896
Thank you very much.

106
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:35,536
He looks happy.

107
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,186
Sweet.

108
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:53,806
This is the first time I've seen someone
stacking plates at a cake buffet.

109
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:58,156
I'll get some more. I'll get some for you, too.

110
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:00,676
Thank you very much.

111
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,033
So cute.

112
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:11,596
I don't hear much about it at work,

113
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:15,096
but he sure is popular.

114
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:23,896
I wonder if I can truly be his girlfriend.

115
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:32,906
I found something you might like,
so I brought both of these.

116
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,296
You seem to be enjoying this.

117
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:45,526
Because I'm with you.

118
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:53,626
Kaede?

119
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:58,816
I'm happy, too.

120
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,816
Being with you that is.

121
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:11,796
I hope this happiness lasts forever.

122
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,446
What's wrong?

123
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:41,016
Sato.

124
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:44,326
They found Shioya.

125
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,796
Found him?

126
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,926
- Isn't it a bit insane?
- Yeah.

127
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:54,756
Where has a guy that hot been
hiding this whole time?

128
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:58,686
- I wonder if he has a girlfriend.
- Let's ask Mr. Shioya next time.

129
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:02,495
It seems they found out about him
at the earlier system presentation.

130
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,466
What?

131
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,356
How long has he been working here?

132
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,986
IT is made up of men.

133
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:11,726
He doesn't even attend the drinking parties.

134
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,496
His existence has been erased until now.

135
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,906
True.

136
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:17,336
Right?

137
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,356
He's been treated like a rare character until now,

138
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:23,626
but all the young ladies seem
to have finally found him.

139
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:27,746
But why is this troubling you?

140
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:33,876
They want me to introduce them to him
so they can get closer.

141
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,936
For real?

142
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:40,756
Then disputes arise,
and somehow I end up mediating things.

143
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,846
It's always been like this since college.

144
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,256
Disputes?

145
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,966
He's like that with everyone.

146
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:54,556
He's not exactly that articulate,
and it ends up upsetting girls.

147
00:14:57,636 --> 00:15:00,206
I hope it doesn't turn out like from back then.

148
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:02,316
'Back then' meaning?

149
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:05,466
Oh, it's nothing.

150
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:10,336
Why do you wanna know so much about him?

151
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,926
Well…

152
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:16,966
Well, it's just he's been taking care of me, and…

153
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,156
It's only natural to take care of one's juniors.

154
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:21,366
You don't have to worry about that.

155
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:23,146
Please stop it.

156
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:25,556
Think about compliance.

157
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,666
Hey.

158
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:31,086
Oh, did I interrupt something?

159
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,996
- What?
- What?

160
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:37,996
Oh, sorry. Were you talking with Mr. Mizoguchi?

161
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:42,356
No, it was, um, unrelated to work.

162
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:49,716
- I have a favor to ask you, Ms. Sato.
- Okay.

163
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,176
I was supposed to
go on a business trip next weekend,

164
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:55,476
but I got a meeting that very day
that I must attend.

165
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:01,046
- That sounds tough.
- So, could you go on that trip for me?

166
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:03,756
It's mainly an exchange meeting,
so it doesn't require much preparation.

167
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,046
Yes, that's fine.

168
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,376
Thank you.

169
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,116
Okay.

170
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:17,926
- Here are the materials.
- Okay.

171
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:25,146
You'll be with Mr. Mizoguchi, so don't worry.

172
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:26,714
Huh?

173
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,276
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

174
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:40,436
It's delicious.

175
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:43,946
That's great.

176
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:49,256
Um, Mr. Shioya.

177
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:57,926
Next weekend, I'll be going on
an overnight business trip with Mr. Mizoguchi.

178
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:02,186
Just letting you know.

179
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,986
What kind of reaction

180
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,176
is this?

181
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,176
Kaede.

182
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:18,556
Yeah?

183
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:30,236
I don't think it's a big deal, but be careful.

184
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:35,356
Gotcha.

185
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:40,826
But I think I'll be okay with him.

186
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:52,406
You shouldn't be so careless.

187
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,921
Huh?

188
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:03,886
If you're held down by force,
then there's nothing you can do.

189
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:07,156
There's no way he'd do that.

190
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,646
Mr. Shioya?

191
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,296
For practice if that happens.

192
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,556
Resist me with all you've got.

193
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:48,726
Hey,

194
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,176
if you don't fight.

195
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,396
Oh, my god.

196
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,386
Then I'll have my way with you.

197
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,086
Hey.

198
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:35,066
You're not fighting back.

199
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,026
That's because…

200
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,136
I can't bring myself to fight back

201
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,686
if it's you.

202
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:03,246
I want you to give me more.

203
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,846
Mr. Shioya.

204
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:24,836
Kaede.

205
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,226
It's been a while since I last saw you at home.

206
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:02,876
What is it?

207
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:04,996
Even at home, you still work.

208
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:09,246
Ah, the business trip.

209
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:12,406
I heard you're going with Ms. Sato.

210
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:15,936
- How did you know?
- She told me.

211
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:19,956
I see.

212
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,176
Don't do anything weird.

213
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,097
Huh?

214
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:34,216
I'm not like you
who messes with the boundaries with girls.

215
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,086
What does that mean?

216
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,766
It's about Natsume.

218

Thank you for waiting.

Joining us in this project
are the people from Cyber Crest.

230
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:52,346
I'm Natsume Misaki, nice to meet you.

231
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:58,326
Ms. Natsume.

[Next Episode]
I don't care who you like.

233
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:10,436
You still can't lie, can you?

234
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,806
Do you wanna go out with me?

235
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:14,976
No, forget it.

236
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,156
Mr. Shioya, what's wrong?
