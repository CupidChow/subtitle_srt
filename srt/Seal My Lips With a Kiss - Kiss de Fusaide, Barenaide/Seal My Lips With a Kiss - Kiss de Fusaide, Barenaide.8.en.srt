00:00:01,612 --> 00:00:05,700
Joining us in this project
are the people from Cyber Crest.

2
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm Natsume Misaki.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,723
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:15,993
Ms. Natsume.

5
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:22,032
Mr. Mizoguchi, did you have breakfast?

6
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,302
Mr. Mizoguchi?

7
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:28,123
What is it?

8
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:31,103
I was just wondering if you had breakfast.

9
00:00:32,376 --> 00:00:33,744
I had coffee on the Shinkansen.

10
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,713
Huh, is that all?

11
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,519
I didn't have time, and I'm used to it.

12
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:44,388
Um, if you'd like.

13
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:46,703
What's this?

14
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,603
I've got onigiri.

15
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:49,623
Thank you.

16
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:52,162
Why do you have so much?

17
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:55,963
Well, they all looked delicious.

18
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,303
I couldn't decide.

19
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,037
I've been thinking,

20
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:02,404
you eat quite a lot, don't you?

21
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:04,875
Does it matter?

22
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:09,323
Yeah, it's good to eat a lot.

23
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:11,083
Don't do anything weird.

24
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:14,785
The one I like is…

25
00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:26,143
You were trying to mess up my hair again,
weren't you?

26
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,599
Please stop it already.

27
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,734
We're about to meet our client.

28
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:34,180
Sorry.

29
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:38,823
Sorry, I need to make a call.

30
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:39,824
Go ahead.

31
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:57,861

[Episode 8]
Based on today's meeting,

43
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,271
we will prepare some plans on our side.

44
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,184
We'd appreciate that.

45
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:50,003
Well, that's all for today,
so let's meet again next Wednesday.

46
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:51,543
Good work today.

47
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:54,243
- Good job.
- Good job.

48
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:01,291
Um, Mr. Shioya?

49
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,943
You were my senior at Meito University, right?

50
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,003
- Yes.
- I thought so.

51
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,585
I was your junior.

52
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,136
Misaki, it is him!

53
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,043
Long time no see, Shioya.

54
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,083
Long time no see.

55
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,784
Did you know Ms. Natsume?

56
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,053
We were classmates back in college.

57
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:33,463
Both of them were really popular.

58
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,066
They were the Madonna and Prince.

59
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:39,783
That famous, huh?

60
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,801
Wow, I thought she might've been
his ex-girlfriend or something.

61
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,375
Could that be it?

62
00:03:58,115 --> 00:03:59,750
Yeah, you can say that.

63
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,955
But, it's all in the past now.

64
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,243
For real?

65
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:11,013
It's the first time I've heard
such a story about you.

66
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,283
Now, let me show you to the staff cafeteria.

67
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,123
- This way.
- Okay.

68
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:20,336
- We'll talk in detail over there.
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

69
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,943
- This way.
- Wow. Just now…

70
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:37,668
You still can't lie, can you?

71
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:04,715
We'd like to propose by expanding
from local level events to national ones.

72
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:06,623
Please look at the next document.

73
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:10,921
As has been conducted thus far,
making the grand shift from local events

74
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,790
to the prefectural large-scale events.

75
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,228
- Excuse us.
- Sato.

76
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,895
Good job.

77
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:22,165
I'm seeing good responses to the presentation.

78
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,868
Well, they are our valued clients.

79
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:30,207
You have talent
in quickly grasping people's hearts.

80
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,542
Thanks for the flattery.

81
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:34,603
I'm being sincere.

82
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:39,243
I gotta work hard at being as good
as a salesperson as you are.

83
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:43,653
- Really?
- Yes.

84
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,443
[Shioya, I'm going on my business trip!]

85
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:50,703
[Take care, can you call today?]

86
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:57,934
Hey, Sato.

87
00:05:58,564 --> 00:05:59,863
Yeah?

88
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:05,008
- Are you chatting with someone?
- Mr. Mizoguchi, Ms. Sato.

89
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,979
Your glass is empty!

90
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:12,433
- Here, drink up, drink up.
- Sorry, thank you.

91
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,803
Chug, chug, oh, yeah!

92
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:17,483
I'll be glad to.

93
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,418
If you're gonna make her drink,
then you're gonna have to go through me.

94
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,497
Mr. Mizoguchi?

95
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:30,243
Don't you know, Sato?

96
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:34,484
My liver is as strong as Rickson Gracie.

97
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:43,518
Oh, there you go!

98
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:47,851
Alright, the night is long!

99
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:49,920
- C'mon.
- Let's drink, then!

100
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:52,556
This way.

101
00:06:56,993 --> 00:06:59,162
Mr. Mizoguchi, here's your room.

102
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:00,925
Oh.

103
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:06,145
I'm sorry for having you drink my share.

104
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,543
I mean, you can't handle your liquor, right?

105
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,051
I appreciate your concern.

106
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,146
I'll go buy some water.

107
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,084
Wait.

108
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,129
Mr. Mizoguchi?

109
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:36,803
Sato.

110
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:53,203
I don't care who you like.

111
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,890
What?

112
00:07:58,283 --> 00:08:00,871
So think more about me instead.

113
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:21,611
I can't.

114
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:26,917
The one

115
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:30,453
I like is…

116
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:52,042
Where did Sato go?

117
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:03,086
Mr. Mizoguchi, I got you some water.

118
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,721
You.

119
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:09,726
What happened?

120
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:15,131
Was it a dream?

121
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,035
Huh? Wait a sec.

122
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,072
Are you okay?

123
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:24,441
Are you gonna vomit?

124
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,203
No.

125
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:33,183
Are you okay?

126
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:37,803
Hey,

127
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:39,443
Sato.

128
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:41,403
Yeah?

129
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:48,098
Is Shioya the one you're in love with?

130
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,539
That obvious, huh?

131
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:00,176
Figures.

132
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,679
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,250
I've been consulting you on many things,
so I figured I should've told you sooner.

134
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:22,999
I'm gonna sleep.

135
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,150
I wonder if Mr. Mizoguchi is okay.

136
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,090
[Shioya]

137
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:53,396
Mr. Shioya, all in a day's work.

138
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,303
All in a day's work.

139
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:58,639
I got back to my hotel room just now.

140
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:00,823
Now?

141
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:03,239
That's late.

142
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:09,212
Mr. Mizoguchi drank alcohol
on my behalf at the party.

143
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:11,881
I was watching over him.

144
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,385
Watching over him?

145
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,903
He looked so bad that it has me concerned.

146
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:22,392
Should I get him something?

147
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:27,497
Nah, you don't have to.

148
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:32,758
But, he did all that for me.

149
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:35,472
I see.

150
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:40,577
Mr. Shioya.

151
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,279
Are you okay?

152
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:49,943
You don't sound so well.

153
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,624
It's not that.

154
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,101
Hey, Kaede.

155
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:08,505
Yes?

156
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:13,843
Do you wanna go out with me?

157
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,424
No, just forget it.

158
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:33,062
Be careful on your way back.

159
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:35,723
Good night.

160
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:37,703
Yeah.

161
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,103
And good night to you.

162
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:02,192
Of all people, it had to be Shioya.

163
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:17,907
I'm sure Sato will end up like Natsume.

164
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:21,344
[9 years ago]

165
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:25,281
Hey, Shioya, can you lend me your notes?

166
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:29,003
Sure.

167
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:32,203
I was wondering,
do you have time after the next class?

168
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:33,923
I wanna take you somewhere.

169
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:36,423
I'm down with that.

170
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:39,011
What do you usually eat?

171
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:40,563
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,918
He and I have a study session today.

173
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:46,303
See you later.

174
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:51,708
- Sweet.
- Shioya.

175
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:56,846
How many times do I gotta tell you
not to hang with girls you're not interested in?

176
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:01,317
What are you talking about?

177
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:03,653
C'mon,

178
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:08,483
I'm begging you not to
take everything at face value.

179
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:15,073
For some reason, all the girls you turn down
come to me for advice, and it's been a pain.

180
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:18,835
When you put it that way.

181
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,703
Want some?

182
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,717
You scoundrel.

183
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:37,883
If you're even in a bind,
don't count on me bailing you out.

184
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,111
Cute, cute.

185
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,559
Misaki and Shioya.

186
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,603
Did you hear?

187
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:46,863
Misaki and Shioya are together.

188
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:49,032
I heard it straight from her.

189
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:52,468
Did Shioya win over our Madonna?

190
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:59,175
Hey, is it true that you and Natsume are a thing?

191
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:02,983
A thing?

192
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:06,503
We just went to a bookstore.

193
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:12,755
If you don't mind,

194
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:19,803
would you like to go out with me?

195
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:25,843
- Sure, but where to?
- Really? I'm glad!

196
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:29,363
So, you have some time later?

197
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,223
You wanna go to a bookstore?

198
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:35,123
I said I can.

199
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,220
You scoundrel.

200
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:49,158
I thought you were a bit slow,
but not to that extent.

201
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:53,343
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:59,692
Natsume thinks you two are lovers.

203
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:01,682
What?

204
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:05,074
Everyone's talking about it.

205
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,203
I gotta make it right.

206
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:11,663
Make it right?

207
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:14,183
Easier said than done.

208
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:20,356
Besides, Natsume is gonna get hurt.

209
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:30,700
I'll try talking to her.

210
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:45,381
So he really is going out with her.

211
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:07,117
Natsume?

212
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:09,472
What's wrong?

213
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:19,782
Mizoguchi, I wonder how Shioya feels about me.

214
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:24,320
You're dating, right?

215
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:33,162
The thing is, he turned me down,

216
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:35,164
and said he was sorry for any misunderstandings.

217
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,835
Huh?

218
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:45,341
But, I asked if we could try.

219
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:50,146
So that's what went down.

220
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,085
But I never had a chance.

221
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:02,825
Shioya has no interests in
who I'm with or where I am.

222
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:10,003
In the end, he doesn't love me one bit.

223
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:23,346
The thing about Shioya is
he can be very serious.

224
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:29,652
Even so, even if it's a lie,

225
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:33,789
I wanted him to say he liked me the most.

226
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,113
Not even a chance.

227
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:08,624
If anything, it would've been better
if you liked me.

228
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:25,143
[Natsume]
What?

229
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:33,476
Are you okay?

230
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,418
Yeah.

231
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,019
Or are you still hungover?

232
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,203
Well, I can go straight home today,
so I'll go home and sleep.

233
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,962
Yes, please take care of yourself.

234
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:48,548
Good work.

235
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:50,666
Ah, hey.

236
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:57,306
About what we talked about yesterday
regarding Mr. Shioya.

237
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:06,249
Hey, just wait.

238
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,299
What are you doing?

239
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:15,352
I've had a long day today,
so I don't wanna talk about Shioya anymore.

240
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:19,223
See you.

Mr. Shioya.

Please, wait.

Mr. Shioya.

259

260

everyone will eventually leave you.

[Next Episode]
Why won't you tell me anything?

266
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,728
I wanna talk about Ms. Sato.

267
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,498
Shioya, how about we try again?

268
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:11,200
Being with Mizoguchi

269
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,402
[This drama is purely fictional.]
might make Kaede happier.
