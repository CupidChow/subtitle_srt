When I told him I would move closer to the company,

39

Mizoguchi said it'd be more convenient to live close

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,056
and half forcefully moved in.

41
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:48,820

42
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:52,653

But you'll have to pay for it later.

188
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,486
Darn it.

189
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:30,620
I want to discuss Sato-san in the Sales Department.

190
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,020
I hope you can take care of her.

191
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,388
Please, she seems distressed lately.

192
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:45,720
Right.

193
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,750
You know her from General Affairs Department.

194
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:55,253
"Sato"?

195
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:57,930
Then Sales Department's welcome party

196
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,450
for this year officially begins!

197
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:04,400
- Cheers!
- Hooray!

198
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,480
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

199
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,753
Great work, everyone!

200
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,952
Matsuyuki, what do you think of Sato-san?

201
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:23,653
What? I'll say what I think.

202
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,886
Well, she's a serious person.

203
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:29,652
She does need more time at work.

204
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,120
After all, she is Usuda-san's successor,

205
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,656
and people would compare them.

206
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,953
You are right.

207
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:40,940
Mizoguchi-kun, you need to pay attention

208
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,570
to the person taking over my position.

209
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,600
Do you mean Sato-san from General Affairs Department?

210
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,020
I heard from a colleague at General Affairs Department

211
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,986
that she was incompetent at work.

212
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,686
She seems like someone who plays around.

213
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:58,048
Is that so?

214
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:01,968
But during the interview, she seemed quite serious.

215
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:06,786
Moreover, I heard she especially likes to please men.

216
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:09,432
Is that true?

217
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:13,476
So she will act obedient and cute in front of you.

218
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:16,153
Be careful not to be deceived.

219
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:19,076
If you say so…

220
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:21,024
Moreover, in this situation,

221
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:23,053
her true nature should be showing by now.

222
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:24,853
Here you go. You're the main character. Drink, drink.

223
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,504
I'm sorry, but thank you.

224
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:34,486
- But you don't need to look after me.
- Your glass is empty.

225
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:37,853
In the current situation, instead of saying she likes to please men,

226
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:43,153
it seems more like she struggles around men.

227
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:48,120
Those going for a second round, please follow me!

228
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,686
Shall we ask Sato-san to come?

229
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:54,068
They say she likes to please men so she should say yes.

230
00:16:56,553 --> 00:17:00,200
Wait, Sato-san. Are you coming for the second round?

231
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,296
Do you want to go have a drink with me?

232
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:08,486
Well, I… that…

233
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:11,568
Sorry, I'll discuss something with Sato-san.

234
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:14,420
- I will confirm tomorrow's work with her.
- What?

235
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,786
Discussing work at this kind of time?

236
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,820
That's right. You guys go ahead.

237
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,452
- See you.
- Okay.

238
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:28,920
Mizoguchi-san.

239
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,686
I don't think I can work in this condition.

240
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,986
It was an excuse.

241
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:37,558
What?

242
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:46,253
Thank you.

243
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:50,736
I couldn't drink anymore; thank you for rescuing me.

244
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,453
You didn't have to drink so much.

245
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:58,552
But they poured drinks specially to welcome me.

246
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:01,392
I appreciate everyone's kindness.

247
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,920
Really?

248
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,888
Are you okay?

249
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,270
I am… so sorry for dragging you down

250
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,810
since I was transferred to Sales Dept.

251
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,500
Now on, I'll do my best to learn

252
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,020
and avoid such situations again.

253
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,764
I will also work hard to restore everyone's trust in me.

254
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:27,253
Are you handling a customer complaint?

255
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:30,316
No, I'd never treat you as a customer complaint subject.

256
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:32,520
Of course not.

257
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,186
But my attitude wasn't good, either.

258
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:42,353
Why do you look so surprised?

259
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:44,286
Well,

260
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,764
I thought you were such a person to whom apology is a loss.

261
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,160
That's a rude thing to say.

262
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,886
Pardon me.

263
00:18:55,886 --> 00:19:01,052
Somehow, she is very different from the rumors.

264
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,220
I ask you.

265
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,020
- Do you truly like to please men?
- Hey!

266
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,653
Not at all!

267
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:11,353
I have always had a crush on the same person!

268
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:14,236
Is that so? How long has it been?

269
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,756

But...

273
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:41,553
should I say I'm happy just looking at him?

274
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:45,853
You sound like a student's crush.

275
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,588
You should confess to him quickly.

276
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,056

What?

280

"I'm too drunk to go home."

281

"Please come and take me home."

282
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:15,520
You're laughing very hard.

283
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,386
You're a laugh-after-drinks type, right?

284
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:25,288
This is the first time I've seen her laugh.

285
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,853
I should be going.

286
