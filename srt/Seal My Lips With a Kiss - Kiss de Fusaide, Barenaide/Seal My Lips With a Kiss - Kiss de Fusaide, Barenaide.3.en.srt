00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,632
You can't leave.

3
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:21,732
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:27,432
I like you.

5
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:30,732
I have always

00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,375
liked you.

[Episode 3]

20
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:24,560
My head hurts.

21
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,175
Wait… what?

22
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,032
Why…

23
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:43,498
Yesterday at the welcome party,

24
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,683
I drank a lot.

25
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:48,365
- Mizoguchi-san has become more friendly.
- See you.

26
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:49,832
You should confess to him quickly.

27
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:51,198
And then…
[Shioya]

28
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:55,143
I remember until I made a call.

29
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:57,719
Did I really…

30
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:09,639
sleep with Shioya-san?

31
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,187
Sato-san.

32
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:22,987
Good… morning.

33
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:27,498
Good night.

34
00:02:27,498 --> 00:02:32,265
So… so cute!

35
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,803
No, I need to tell him how I feel,

36
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:38,099
even though we've done it.

37
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,465
Even if we've done it!

38
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:43,565
Shioya-san, could you get up for a moment?

39
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:52,099
I'm awake now.

40
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:03,499
I like you, Shioya-san.

41
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,883
What?

42
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:33,571
Sorry, that was my alarm clock.

43
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:36,332
I see.

44
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,427
I'll go home.

45
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,787
Okay.

46
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:49,543
Sato-san, take your time.

47
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:55,747
Okay, thank you.

48
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:58,503
I'll borrow the bathroom.

49
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,265
What kind

50
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,232
of reaction was this?

51
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:20,891
Was I dumped? Or not dumped?

52
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:23,599
I don't get it.

53
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,565
- Sato.
- What?

54
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,699
What? It's already lunch break.

55
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:33,765
I haven't finished this yet.

56
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:36,671
If you don't rest, your performance will deteriorate.

57
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:38,499
Let's go eat.

58
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,265
Pardon?

59
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,759
Is yours a melon pan?

60
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,865
Yes.

61
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,799
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

62
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:48,132
So you called last night, right?

63
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:54,555
After I called him, we met up.

64
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:58,732
Oh, you met up. That's progress.

65
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,165
Speaking of which,

66
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:08,598
when I woke up in the morning, we were in bed together.

67
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:10,198
Isn't that nice?

68
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,965
So does that mean you are dating now?

69
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:22,267
Actually… I don't remember anything.

70
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,165
What?

71
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:31,883
Did something happen last night?

72
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,898
You totally messed up!

73
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:43,265
Hey! Don't laugh!

74
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:46,839
That was my first time drinking so much in my life.

75
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,498
Sorry, sorry.

76
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:51,999
So you don't know if you're dating?

77
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:55,732
That's why I confessed to him in the morning.

78
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:57,965
And what was his answer?

79
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:02,932
That's the point. He didn't react.

80
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,265
So you were dumped.

81
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,432
No!

82
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:13,598
Wait, I don't know.

83
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:16,059
If he likes you, he would have reacted, right?

84
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:19,465
I understand you don't want to think that way.

85
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:21,223
Perhaps you should move on.

86
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:22,811
No.

87
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:26,365
I'd rather take this as an opportunity

88
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,571
to make him notice me.

89
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,799
I didn't expect you to be so tough.

90
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,265
Because

91
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:44,831
he is the reason I became who I am now.

92
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:47,732
Just be confident and be yourself.

93
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:54,375
I can't give up this feeling so easily.

94
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,965
I'll eat now.

95
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:07,998
Hey.

96
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:11,598
You're quite cool.

97
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,167
Excuse me?

98
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,965
Nothing.

99
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,832
I am here to show you my perfect strategy.

100
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:22,798
Let's go there together again.

101
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:24,232
What shall we eat next time?

102
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:25,665
Really?

103
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:27,132
I agree.

104
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:29,023
Usuda-san.

105
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,807
Coming.

106
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:46,132
I'm so nervous.

107
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,665
Straightforwardly ask him out.

108
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:50,270
Find if he's interested in you.

109
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,380
[Mission: Make a date; assess it.]

110
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,165
I want to go on a date with him.
[Shioya]

111
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,255
If he has feelings for you,

112
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:58,551
he should agree to go on a date.
[Shioya]

113
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,365
Send a message not too formal or casual,
[Thanks for helping me.]

114
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:03,795
that is hard to refuse.
[If it's not much trouble]

115
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,215
It's so hard.

116
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:06,310
Don't be afraid.
[Shall we go out this weekend?]

117
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,660
The key is courage.

118
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,265
"Courage."

119
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,698
Courage!

120
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:18,665
Send.

121
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,767
Well done.
[Mission Complete!]

122
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:34,232
[Sure. Is Sunday okay?]

123
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,798
He replied instantly.

124
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:41,132
It's so good to be alive!

125
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:45,598
This means he likes me, right?

126
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:49,732
Wait.

127
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,932
I shouldn't be over excited,

128
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:59,432
before his response to my confession is confirmed.

129
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:05,665
I had planned to be calm.

130
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,298
Sato-san?

131
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:15,465
But Shioya-san is so handsome today, as always.

132
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:18,795
The whole world is shining.

133
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:23,265
Thank you, God.

134
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:26,465
Is something wrong?

135
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:31,932
Please don't worry. Let's go.

136
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:53,198
You're not watching penguins but people.

137
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:56,083
I plan to conduct a preliminary survey.

138
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,765
"A survey"?

139
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:02,232
There's a marine life exhibition proposal.

140
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:05,503
Oh, the project Mizoguchi got?

141
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,191
Yes.

142
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:10,498
I plan to take some notes.

143
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:13,798
Seals are also very popular.

144
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,732
Also, peculiar creatures

145
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:19,965
like spotted garden eel and umbrella octopus.

146
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:24,132
The undersea world is profound and fascinating.

147
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:27,363
I want to work hard to create a proposal

148
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:29,899
that more people can see.

149
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,431
You're still as enthusiastic as ever.

150
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,765
Oh no.

151
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,132
Well, Shioya-san.

152
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:47,132
I thought of work on a weekend. I'm so sorry.

153
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:50,665
No, I think it's fine.

154
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:54,099
Thank you.

155
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:13,831
Is Shioya-san bored with me?

156
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,635
The ocean sunfish isn't bad.

157
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,371
What?

158
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,232
I think ocean sunfish will surely be popular.

159
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:31,919
But I heard that ocean sunfish die easily.

160
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,099
That's a rumor.

161
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:37,299
Is that so?

162
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:40,899
The ocean sunfish is not that fragile.

163
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:48,399
I want to see the ocean sunfish that you like, Shioya-san.

164
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:55,132
The ocean sunfish.

165
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,407
Actually...

166
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,332
It's swift.

167
00:11:58,332 --> 00:12:05,365
I need to find out what Shioya-san... really thinks of me.

168
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,632
Is something wrong?

169
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,099
No, nothing.

170
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,799
Let's go.

171
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,735
Okay.

172
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:25,931
But I fear it may destroy our current relationship.

173
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,199
So I can't ask anything.

174
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:39,007
I didn't expect that after the aquarium, we would eat seafood.

175
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:44,579
Fish are ideal to view and to eat.

176
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,799
I've learned a lot today,

177
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,403
many things I didn't know about you.

178
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,165
Is that so?

179
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,515
But in the end,

180
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:04,907
I didn't ask the most important question.

181
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,599
I'm heading that way.

182
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:15,799
Be careful.

183
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,223
All right.

184
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:34,523
Well,

185
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,299
can we chat for a bit more?

186
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:54,032
So what did you want to talk about?

187
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,399
Well…

188
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:03,765
What exactly am I to you, Shioya-san?

189
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,165
What?

190
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:11,232
How should I put it?

191
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:15,747
I'm wondering, what stage are we?

192
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,832
I think we're… dating.

193
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:31,265
What?

194
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,232
Da… dating?

195
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:38,165
You and me?

196
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:42,595
If I misunderstood, I apologize.

197
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:45,071
I…

198
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:51,363
I don't have much experience dating girls.

199
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,527
Wait… But…

200
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,410
I…

201
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,860
That morning,

202
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,799
- when I told you I liked you,
- I like you.

203
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,307
you didn't react, and…

204
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,832
Oh, that's because…

205
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,515
Luckily, the alarm rang.

206
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:22,275
I almost wanted to take her again.

207
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,965
That night, you said you liked me

208
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:35,299
so I thought we started dating then.

209
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:40,332
Pardon me,

210
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:45,565
I was very drunk that night.

211
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,265
To put your mind at ease,

212
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:56,459
I'll say it seriously again.

213
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,220
Sato-san,

214
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,600
please... date me.

215
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,851
Excuse me, I'm thrilled.

216
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:55,223
Nice to meet you,

217
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,847
"My Boyfriend."

218
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,932
Nice to meet you, too.

219
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:27,995
I won't make you that anxious again.

220
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:35,975
What did you just say?

221
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:52,132
Please… please wait a moment.

222
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:55,332
I'm not mentally prepared yet.

223
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,032
I can't wait.

224
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:08,295
I can't wait now.

225
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:36,099
When you're so cute,

226
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,299
I won't be able to control myself.

227
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:52,732
Shioya-san.

228
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,665
What's wrong?

229
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:57,511
Shioya-san, you are…

230
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,027
actually very passionate.

231
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,687
I guess.

232
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:20,432
Someone is calling.

233
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:22,365
We can ignore it.

234
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,711
But…

235
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,911
It could be urgent.

236
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,332
We can ignore it.
[Mizoguchi]

237
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:52,065
But that's Mizoguchi-san!

238
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,132
Hello.

239
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,410
Oh.

240
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,739
That's no longer important.

241
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,299
Got it.

242
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:26,659
I'll contact you tomorrow.

243
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:34,595
Now? I'm with Sato-san.

244
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,471
You want to talk to her?

245
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,287
But if you say that…

246
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:45,765
Here you go.

247
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,032
It's… powered off.

248
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,765
When did it shut off?

249
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:56,665
At the call's start.

250
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,065
Shioya-san.

251
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,998
You're naughty.

252
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:09,915
I suppose.

253
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,415
You are so cute when you try to be quiet.

254
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:26,691
♫ Indulge until I can barely stand ♫

255
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:31,619
♫ Before getting dizzy, wave a goodbye ♫

256
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,427
♫ Pour love and hate to fill the lack of innocence syndrome ♫

♫ Give me more, give me more, give me more! ♫

258

♫ Different, broken, melting instinct ♫

259
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:48,332
I won't let anyone else hear you like this.

260
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:50,565
It's for me only.

261
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,632
Shioya-san.

262
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,163
♫ Wobbling ♫

263
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,183
Shioya.

264
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,932
You shut off your phone purposely, right?

265
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:08,711
You're overthinking it.

266
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:12,671
Seriously, I wanted to report to you on what you said.

267
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:14,254
What I mentioned?

268
00:22:14,254 --> 00:22:16,465
About Sato.

269
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:20,027
I realized she's a good person.

270
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:22,887
Why would such weird rumors spread?

271
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:30,255
But I still hope she can improve her slow speed at work.

272
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:33,365
Speaking of which,

273
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,555
she mentioned that the handover didn't go smoothly.

274
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:36,639
That's impossible.

275
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:40,465
That was from Usuda-san who always focuses on work.

276
00:22:40,465 --> 00:22:43,398
She also gave her a very thick manual.

277
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:45,375
"Manual"…

278
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:04,132
I... will protect you.

279
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,332
Kaede, you are my girlfriend, right?
[Next Episode]

280
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:10,865
I won't hand you over to anyone.

281
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:14,098
If Shioya is gentle with you, don't get him wrong.

282
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:16,598
The person I like is…

283
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:19,555
I have something to tell you about Sato.
