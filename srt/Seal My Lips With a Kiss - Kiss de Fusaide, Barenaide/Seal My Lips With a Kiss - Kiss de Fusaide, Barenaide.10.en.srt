1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,870
That's unusual, coming home
in the morning, that is.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,010
I'm dating Sato now.

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,290
What?

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,140
- What are you joking about?
- I'm not joking.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,830
We've been dating shortly after she went to Sales.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,020
That far back?

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,830
Why didn't you say anything?

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,620
Back then, she wasn't doing so well in Sales.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,550
In addition, there were also strange rumors.

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,640
She tried to tell you a few times,

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,530
but I decided it still wasn't the right time.

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,170
I get it.

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,800
But, I can't believe you,
who is never interested in others,

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,320
would really fall in love with someone.

15
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,460
Just like with Natsume back then.

16
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,070
Only to end up getting hurt.

17
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,870
- That was…
- I would never do that.

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,968
What?

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,520
I'll show you how serious I am.

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,820
Hey, did you hear about Mr. Shioya from IT?

21
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,820
I heard his ex-girlfriend is getting married soon.

22
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,110
That's what you wanted to say?

23
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,870
- It means we have a chance, right?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,690
- Should I ask for his contact details?
- No way.

25
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,170
It may cause the spread of odd rumors again,

26
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,710
so I figured it'd be best if everyone at work

27
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,120
didn't know about our situation.

28
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:29,510
Despite being my idea, I'm still feeling lonely.

29
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,390
Ms. Sato.

30
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,040
Mr. Mizoguchi.

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,470
What's wrong?

32
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,900
Let's hang out today.

33
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,140
Hey, where are we going?

34
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,000
We need to talk.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
To talk?

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,860
It's not something we can talk about at work?

37
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,360
Did you hear anything from Shioya?

38
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:07,060
What? Ah, no.

39
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,660
Nothing in particular.

40
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,980
Alright.

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,890
Excuse me.

42
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,064
What?

43
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,181
Hey.

44
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,760
Um, what are these pictures for?

45
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,580
It doesn't matter, let's go.

46
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,010
Mr. Mizoguchi, I'm already…

47
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,960
It's Mr. Shioya.

48
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:52,660
[Shioya]
Hey!

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,230
Mr. Mizoguchi?

50
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,460
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,900
I'd rather you not take it.

52
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,030
For now, just think about me.

53
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,224
- Let's go.
- But…

54
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:15,940
♫ Indulge until I can barely stand ♫

55
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,900
♫ Wave goodbye before feeling dizzy ♫

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,680
Did something happen with Mr. Shioya?

57
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,230
You know, I've never beaten Shioya before.

58
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,410
But this time, I don't wanna lose this bet.

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
Bet?

60
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,070
That's right.

61
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,110
I betted on you.

62
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,830
Um, Mr. Mizoguchi?

63
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,320
What?

64
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,460
What do you mean by 'bet'?

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,400
Shioya is always so transparent,

66
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,030
and I've never seen him desperate.

67
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,470
You do have a point…

68
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,770
And yet, he always surpasses me
despite me being desperate.

69
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,180
So, unless I go all out,
I have no chance of beating him.

70
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,880
He has everything I don't.

71
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,470
That's not true.

72
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,750
There are many things that only you have.

73
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,510
And, he told me that you are
the one who everybody adores.

74
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:05,184
What?

75
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,110
I've been told many times

76
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,580
that Shioya has high hurdles to jump
while I'm perfect where I'm at.

77
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,200
Earlier, you said you've never beaten Mr. Shioya.

78
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,120
But I'm positive he also feels the same way.

79
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,700
He said that?

80
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,520
No way.

81
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:53,330
Shioya doesn't say much, but he keeps watch.

82
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,050
Not just during happy or fun times,

83
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,250
but also when you're trying hard
or having a tough time.

84
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,370
He's always watching quietly close by.

85
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,620
Well, I'm positive that you know more.

86
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,580
There's no beating you.

87
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,043
What?

88
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,510
Like with Ms. Usuda,

89
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,290
you're able to face others honestly.

90
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,370
And that truly makes you strong.

91
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,610
I'm not strong at all.

92
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,460
When things got rough and I wanted to run away,

93
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,250
I had someone who told me to give it all I've got.

94
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,680
Those words were what truly saved me.

95
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,840
I don't have to be strong.

96
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:41,820
I just figured that I should
go all out with how I truly felt.

97
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,420
Hey, Sato.

98
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,320
Yes?

99
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,630
I like…

100
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,070
Mr. Shioya?

101
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,660
Wow, that was rather quick.

102
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,470
The man here is pretty sweaty.

103
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,470
I'm not giving her to anyone.

104
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:53,470
Hey. Are you leaving?

105
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,990
Yeah, my work here is done.

106
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:10,660
Sato, I'm glad your two years
of unrequited love have borne fruit.

107
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,660
Thank you.

108
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,910
What was that all about?

109
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
I wanted to test myself.

110
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,590
Test yourself?

111
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,270
To see how much I love you.

112
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:42,208
What?

113
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,690
Because I told him we're now dating.

114
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,620
Oh, so that's it.

115
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,590
Oh, that Mr. Mizoguchi.

116
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,530
But you were indeed worried.

117
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,100
I'm really grateful to him.

118
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,150
Being with you like this is all thanks to him.

119
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,590
What are you talking about?

120
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,010
That's for another time.

121
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,050
But somehow, I feel relieved.

122
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,060
Having someone knowing
about our relationship is nice,

123
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,200
don't you think?

124
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,090
Do you want something to drink?

125
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:54,944
Well.

126
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,640
I didn't expect him to make such a face.

127
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,720
See, you can do it.

128
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:21,510
Next time we meet,
I have to act like nothing's wrong.

129
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,680
- Shioya…
- Mr. Shioya!

130
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,590
Thank you for your advice last time.

131
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,870
- Good morning, what's happening?
- Well.

132
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,290
To thank you, how about
I treat you to something to eat?

133
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,990
- Sounds good. Let's do it.
- Great.

134
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,032
Are you okay with this?

135
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:57,757
- What to eat?
- Whatever you like.

136
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,590
- Huh?
- We can go eat…

137
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,080
- They're definitely after him.
- We're good with anything.

138
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,570
As long as you can come.

139
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,360
It's not my place to say anything.

140
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:10,970
How about this one?

141
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,192
- It's high class, huh?
- Yeah, totally.

142
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,660
- Yes.
- So should we go?

143
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,960
Kaede.

144
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,500
Hey, Ms. Sato?

145
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,688
Huh?

146
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,131
What is this?

147
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm dating Sato Kaede.

148
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,190
No way, wait a minute!

149
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,960
Really? Seriously? I didn't know.

150
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,710
- Isn't she known to be flirtatious?
- Yeah, that's right.

151
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,850
- Totally.
- For real?

152
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,090
- Did you know?
- No, I didn't.

153
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,792
- Do you think he knows?
- How come?

154
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,776
He must've known.

155
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,968
- It's real.
- But I don't think…

156
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:27,840
Kaede works hard, and is a straight arrow.

157
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,730
Even through hard times,
you have the strength not to be defeated.

158
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,180
You understand the pain of others.

159
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,500
That is what I love about you.

160
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,090
Mr. Shioya.

161
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,480
Eventually, I'd like to marry you.

162
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,632
Wait?

163
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:18,178
What?

164
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,760
Shioya, no need to go all out.

165
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,790
I showed how serious I am.

166
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,470
As you can see, he's crazy about her.

167
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,200
Hey, say something.

168
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,150
Well, it's true.

169
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,650
Ms. Sato.

170
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,200
Congratulations.

171
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,960
Ms. Usuda.

172
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,400
Well done, Shioya.

173
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,090
I never believed you'd reveal it like this.

174
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,830
Hey, Ms. Sato!

175
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,880
I heard you got proposed to in front of everyone.

176
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,120
- I thought this only happened in dramas.
- Same here.

177
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,470
This is too good to be true.

178
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,910
Why didn't you say so sooner?

179
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,970
Congratulations.

180
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,040
Congratulations, Ms. Sato.

181
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
Congrats.

182
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,056
Are you fine with this, Mr. Mizoguchi?

183
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,470
Me?

184
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,800
What are you talking about?

185
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,290
Oh no, isn't this touching?

186
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,890
Wanna get something to drink today?

187
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,040
Can it.

188
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,140
Come on, everyone, let's get to work.

189
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,060
Hurry up and go.

190
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,170
There we go.

191
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:53,805
This is great.

192
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,300
I was so surprised
I thought my legs would give out.

193
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,720
It was all I could think of.

194
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,900
I don't want to cause you
any more discomfort due to such rumors.

195
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,440
I just didn't want you suffering alone anymore.

196
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,710
Daisuke.

197
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,530
So I wanted everybody to hear
that I was ready to do this.

198
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,320
Um, what you said back then.

199
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,460
Getting mar…

200
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,000
About getting married?

201
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:16,600
From now and forever, I wanna be with you.

202
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,930
For saying all that without asking how you feel.

204
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,740
But it's not something
that we have to take care of right away,

205
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,870
since we're busy with work and all.

206
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,980
Kaede?

207
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,790
Let's get married.

208
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,626
What?

209
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,280
Of course, I think there are many things
we'll have to overcome,

210
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
but rather than postponing such problems,

211
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,380
I want to do what I can now.

212
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,280
With you, I know I can do it!

213
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,470
So, let's get married!

214
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,450
You're really something, Kaede.

215
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,480
Were you just laughing?

216
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:43,240
It's just I figured that the woman
I fell in love with is pretty cool.

217
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,800
It makes me love you even more.

218
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,570
Daisuke.

219
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,830
Yeah?

220
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,190
I love you.

221
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,410
More than anyone in the world.

222
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,100
Me too.

223
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,080
♫ Obviously, you already know. Shhhhhh ♫

224
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,020
Early as always.

225
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,560
I've got a lot to do

226
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,890
since I'm taking over Mr. Mizoguchi's role.

227
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,050
That's awesome.

228
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,450
I'm now capable of doing the job
as Ms. Usuda taught me,

229
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,630
so I gotta give it everything I've got.

230
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,590
It's great that you're working hard.

231
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:14,580
Well?

232
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,950
But don't forget about me, okay?

233
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,540
There's no way I'd forget you.

234
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,110
I mean, it'd be awkward if somebody saw us.

235
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,550
Why?

236
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,540
Why, you ask?

237
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,670
Because I'm okay with people knowing about us.

238
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,100
♫ So sweet that it's unsettling ♫

239
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,880
♫ About to be and want to be discovered.
Still not discovered today ♫

240
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,810
♫ I just want to see the real you ♫

241
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,310
♫ I confirmed it on my lips ♫

242
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,120
♫ The moment you were a little embarrassed ♫

243
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,330
♫ Kiss you ♫
