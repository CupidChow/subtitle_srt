Yes, the handover has been a bit rough.

184
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,407
Did you talk to anyone?

185
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:15,607
I discussed it with the Department Head.

186
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:18,940
But she said since there is a manual, I should be fine.

187
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,740
Did you talk with Mizoguchi?

188
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,007
Usuda-san would have given it to me now.

189
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,574
I…

190
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,507
I joined the company at the same time as Mizoguchi; I know him well.

191
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:36,440
Do you want me to talk to him for you?

192
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,740
No, he's very busy!

193
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,026
I don't want to bother him.

194
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:44,607
Is that so?

195
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,494
But I really like advertising.

196
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:54,222
I want to put in my utmost effort

197
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:56,780
so our ads will catch people's attention.

198
00:13:57,607 --> 00:14:00,707
You said the same thing during training, didn't you?

199
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,370
You remembered.

200
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:07,200
A last question for you:

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,540
In what way do you want to work in the future?

202
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,307
Let's start with Sato-san.

203
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,974
You don't need to be nervous.

204
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:19,274
It's just a routine question.

205
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,940
Actually, I want to become like a person I know.

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,840
When I was looking for a job,

207
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,607
I passed by the Affiliate Technology Hall

208
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:35,174
and saw them preparing for an event.

209
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,407
The system seemed to have suddenly failed,

210
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,774
and at that time,

211
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:47,207
"We must make it ready for the customers at the event tomorrow,"

212
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,874
said a person in charge of the repairs.

213
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:52,007
How should I put this?

214
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:55,140
He was not just doing it for himself,

215
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,474
but for others who might be affected.

216
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,398
I hope to work with that kind of mindset.

217
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,640
It makes me happy.

218
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,740
That was a long time ago.

219
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,074
I think you are a diligent, enthusiastic person.

220
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:20,178
You flatter me.

221
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,806
Actually,

222
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,410
even if I try hard, I'm still not as capable.

223
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:40,974
Let me know if you need help.

224
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,974
You look not only exhausted,

225
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:50,478
but also a little depressed.

226
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,074
If you have time to ask me repeatedly,

227
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:00,018
why not put in a little effort yourself?

228
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,674
You're amazing,

229
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,258
and you're working hard.

230
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:28,318
Why did he notice me?

231
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:32,082
whether two years ago or now?

232
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,750
I like... Shioya-san.

233
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,326
Shioya-san, I should probably head back now.

234
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,286
The clothes haven't dried yet.

235
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,770
I can't let you go home this late at night.

236
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:11,574
I can provide you a place to sleep.

237
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:14,058
You can go to the office tomorrow morning.

238
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,440
I'm sorry for the bother.

239
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,142
"A place to sleep"…

240
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:29,140
Such a sacred place!

241
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:31,674
"Sacred"?

242
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:35,898
No! It's nothing.

243
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:39,174
I have a sleeping bag so you can use the bed.

244
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,407
No, I c-can't do that.

245
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,340
I can sleep in the hallway.

246
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,607
You don't have to do that.

247
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,474
I see.

248
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,674
You would worry, right?

249
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,740
Tie my hands with this.

250
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:19,607
You can trust that I won't touch you.

251
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,898
Tie your hands?

252
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:28,614
Sleeping in the same room with a guy must make you feel uneasy, right?

253
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:32,607
No, I can't do that to you.

254
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:35,962
I would sleep in the living room,

255
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:38,210
but I have a roommate.

256
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:50,322
I want you to trust that I won't do anything.

257
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,674
I'm truly sorry.

258
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:08,440
You're tied up due to me.

259
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,518
No, this is…

260
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,874
I'm back!

261
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:15,890
Shioya, I'm back.

262
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,540
Sorry.

263
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,666
He sounds drunk.

264
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,440
Your roommate is…

265
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,807
Shioya!

266
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:33,070
Are you asleep?

267
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,740
Shioya.

268
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,182
Shioya.

269
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:44,107
Shioya.

270
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,307
Sato…

271
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:51,114
You're not only slow at work, but you also tied up Shioya.

272
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:54,740
What on Earth are you thinking?

273
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,640
That was close.

274
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,907
Shioya.

275
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:03,674
Wait, Shioya?

276
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:05,707
Not here?

277
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:07,674
Sato-san.

278
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,074
What's going on?

279
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:15,954
Sorry, I tried to hide on impulse.

280
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:19,440
If we were seen by him,

281
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,502
my image in his eyes would get worse.

282
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,907
Did he go drinking?

283
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,174
That's unusual.

284
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:39,340
Great, he didn't find out.

285
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:43,174
You don't want Mizoguchi to find out?

286
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,174
Yes, he's the last person I want to find out about this.

287
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,820
Is that so?

288
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,420
I understand.

289
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,842
Let's not get caught.

290
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:59,086
Thank you.

291
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,838
I'll untie the rope for you.

292
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:09,942
Wait, sorry.

293
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:12,842
I accidentally made it too tight earlier.

294
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,600
I remember he bought the latest comic issue.

295
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:30,982
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:32,780
It's okay.

297
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,370
Just stay still and be quiet.

298
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,046
Strange, where did he put it?

299
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:45,970
Shioya-san's body is so warm.

300
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,682
Are you all right, Sato-san?

301
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:58,158
Is this a dream?

302
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,240
I can't imagine I'm this close

303
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,540
to the warmth

304
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:09,698
of the one I love.

305
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:16,798
If it's a dream, I might as well…

306
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:23,207
I like you, Shioya-san.

Don't you have a crush on Mizoguchi?

This is the first time I've seen her laugh.

318

Mizoguchi, I have something to say.

319
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:15,830
I've already decided on no more involvement with you, Sato-san.
