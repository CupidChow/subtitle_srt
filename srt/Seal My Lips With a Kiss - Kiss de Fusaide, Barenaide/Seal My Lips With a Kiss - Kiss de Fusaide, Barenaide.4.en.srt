183
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,476
If you say so…

184
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:05,916
I easily believed Usuda and jumped to conclusions.

185
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:11,916
Mizoguchi-san, did you encounter something unpleasant at work?

186
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,482
If there's anything I can help with, please let me know.

187
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:21,416
No, I'm just curious, that's all.

188
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,782
You don't need to worry about it.

189
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,782
That's good.

190
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,382
By the way, did you have dinner with Shioya yesterday?

191
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:43,282
Yes, we went to dine together.

192
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:47,249
Then I even stayed overnight.

193
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,608
But I can't say that.

194
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:51,116
You must have had a hard time.

195
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:54,782
He is very silent and aloof.

196
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,916
No, not at all.

197
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,860
He has been famous for his poker face.

198
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,616
You went to the same college, right?

199
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:07,816
Yes, we were also in the same department.

200
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,682
Well,

201
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:17,816
what was Shioya -san like during college?

202
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,616
Super popular.

203
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:24,316
Su… super popular?

204
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:28,016
That guy clearly looks aloof, yet he's unexpectedly considerate,

205
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,582
and he is kind to everyone.

206
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:34,480
That contrast makes girls misunderstand.

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,382
In other words,

208
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:42,482
he's like a player?

209
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,496
No.

210
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,784
It's not like that.

211
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,149
I see.

212
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,616
If Shioya is gentle with you, don't get him wrong.

213
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:07,616
"G-Get him wrong"?

214
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,882
Unless that guy clearly says he likes you.

215
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:16,600
But you already like someone so it won't matter to you.

216
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,116
Actually,

217
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:29,749
the person I like is…

218
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:33,049
Good afternoon.

219
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,416
Matsuyuki, you showed up just in time.

220
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,649
Can you work overtime today?

221
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:41,682
Did something happen?

222
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:44,676
We need to organize the presentation for Morga Games.

223
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,949
Oh, y-you don't have to do that.

224
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:49,576
What's left is my work.

225
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:52,482
If we all work together, we will finish it in no time.

226
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,116
Yes, let's work together.

227
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,549
Sato-san, you rarely ask for help.

228
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,916
I'm really worried if you can manage on your own.

229
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,082
Matsuyuki-san.

230
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:06,116
Since it's decided, let's go inform the others.

231
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:08,349
You…

232
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:12,182
Thank you so much.

233
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,949
But Shibano-kun said he had a date with his girlfriend tonight.

234
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,882
Who cares?

235
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:20,349
You don't have a girlfriend so just don't ask him.

236
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:22,016
I don't know.

237
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,932
If you don't change that, you won't get a girlfriend for life.

238
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,416
Thank you for your valuable opinion.

239
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,712
Shioya-san with glasses.

240
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:39,516
Such a feast for my eyes!

241
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,000
Thank you for making such a treat for me.

242
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,649
You're welcome. I know you like sweets.

243
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:54,349
How is work lately?

244
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:59,849
Thanks to everyone's help, it seems it will wrap up smoothly.

245
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:02,316
Is that so?

246
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:06,249
It's because you talked to Mizoguchi-san.

247
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,116
He helped me in many ways.

248
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,949
Glad I could help.

249
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:20,682
If Shioya is gentle with you, don't get him wrong.

250
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,732
I might have misunderstood him.

251
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:31,116
Besides, he hasn't explicitly said he likes me yet.

252
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:36,180
Sato-san, is there more of this?

253
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:41,052
That was so fast. I'll go get it.

254
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:52,582
I'm… sorry.

255
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,182
I'm okay.

256
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:02,648
The same thing happened before.

257
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,582
No.

258
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:19,382
If not, I wouldn't be here.

259
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:27,424
I'm glad that I said I like you back then.

260
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:35,749
I've also always liked you.

261
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,964
I'm an idiot.

262
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,000
Shioya-san explicitly said he likes me.

263
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:49,982
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:57,082
Sato-san?

265
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,982
I'm really sorry.

266
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:09,020
I've been wondering if you date me out of responsibility.

267
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,849
I misunderstood you.

268
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:20,924
Sorry, I'm often told that I don't express myself enough.

269
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:22,582
No.

270
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:26,949
Shioya-san, it's not your fault.

271
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,216
It's me.

272
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,936
I still can't believe it even now.

273
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,648
Do you really like someone like me?

274
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:00,882
It's not "someone like you."

275
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,804
I like you, Sato-san.

276
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:17,544
♫ Indulge until I can barely stand ♫

277
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:22,616
♫ Before getting dizzy, wave a goodbye ♫

278
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:26,349

♫ Give me more, give me more, give me more! ♫

280
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,449
Just teasing.

281
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:34,982
You're really annoying.

282
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:40,982
Your lips taste like cake.

283
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:48,682
Let me taste all of you.

284
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:42,382
Shioya-san.

285
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:46,168
I like you.

286
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,116
I like you, too.

287
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:56,084
I might have liked you even before you liked me.

288
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,224
What?

289
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,548
If you were a cake,

290
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:21,556
I would eat you every day.

291
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,280
[Bitter]
[Sweet]

292
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,015
I'm back.

293
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:36,808
Can we talk?

294
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:41,364
I have something to tell you about Sato.

295
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,508
What is it?

296
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:50,068
As you said, there were gaps in the handover.

297
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,732
No, not gaps.

298
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,020
Usuda-san deliberately left things out.

299
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,615
Are you sure?

300
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,515
I've already confirmed it.

301
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:10,880
It's even a miracle no problem arose so far.

302
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,904
Really?

303
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:20,704
Did you talk to Sato-san about it?

304
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:24,068
I plan to tell her next Monday.

305
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,104
But since I joined the company,

306
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:31,649
Usuda-san has always been supportive.

307
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:34,060
Honestly, I have mixed feelings right now.

308
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:36,882
So...

309
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:40,852
to avoid my being overly biased,

310
00:22:41,782 --> 00:22:44,724
can you join us?

311
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:08,249
I'll definitely protect you, Sato-san.
[Next Episode]

312
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:10,149
I have something to tell you. Come to my place tonight.

313
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,349
I feel I must make it clear.

314
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,449
Why are you so cool?

315
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:18,476
Where Mizoguchi touched you must be disinfected.
