1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,190
Oh, welcome back.

2
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,450
Glad to be home.

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,920
Oh, do you want something to drink?

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,586
Cocoa.

5
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:32,426
Then, never mind. Your cocoa is way too sweet.

6
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:37,786
Hey, Shioya.

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,653
Are you doing a project with Natsume?

8
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:47,373
I got a call from her yesterday saying you were.

9
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,960
So, you still hear from her.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,533
Well, we did graduate together.

11
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,900
We go out drinking now and then.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,093
I see.

13
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:02,813
You're gonna see more of each other.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,066
As for that project,

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,386
I'm thinking of getting a replacement.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,813
Really?

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,186
I feel for the sake of Ms. Natsume,
she shouldn't be seeing me.

18
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:18,720
She is happy.

19
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,733
Because she thought she'd never see you again.

20
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,106
Which is why she is.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,266
Happy?

22
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:32,173
It seems a lot happened back then.

23
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:37,146
Rather than avoiding her,
why not just talk to her?

24
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,506
Okay.

25
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:48,613
Geez, I've always been tasked
with following up on the girls who like you.

26
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,546
Show some respect, will ya?

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,746
You're right.

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,760
♫ Obviously, you already know. Shhhhhh ♫

29
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,130
♫ Bold lines ♫

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,010
♫ Hey, want to say, can't say,
won't say. Absolutely ♫

31
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,830
♫ Showing a side never seen before ♫

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,960
♫ Obviously, you already know. Shhhhhh ♫

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,160
♫ Bold lines ♫

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,950
♫ Hey, want to say, can't say,
won't say. Absolutely ♫

35
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,420
♫ So sweet that it's unsettling ♫

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,220
♫ About to be and want to be discovered.
Still not discovered today ♫

37
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,270
♫ I just want to see the real you ♫

38
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,400
♫ Kiss you ♫

39
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,213
Why won't you tell me anything?

40
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:04,493
Thank you for your hard work
on the business trip, Ms. Sato.

41
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,240
And thank you, Ms. Matsuyuki.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,490
I'll share you the details of the meeting
of the business trip later.

43
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,666
Thank you.

44
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:16,480
So, how was it?

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,866
It went smoothly.

46
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,693
And I learned a lot.

47
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,000
Not that. Mr. Mizoguchi.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,580
Mr. Mizoguchi?

49
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,133
Did any incidents happen?

50
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,786
Incidents?

51
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:36,786
He got really drunk at the networking event.

52
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:39,226
That's not what I meant.

53
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,586
That sounds so lame.

54
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:47,733
Maybe I'll follow the IT guy's
ex-girlfriend story.

55
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,066
The IT guy?

56
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,920
You know? Mr. Shioya, the one
people have been talking about.

57
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,660
Apparently, there's a very beautiful ex-girlfriend
in the same project.

58
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,813
What the heck?

59
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,853
He hasn't told me a word about that.

60
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,600
Hey, is the story about
Mr. Shioya's ex-girlfriend true?

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,853
Yeah, she was incredibly beautiful,
and they seemed like a perfect match.

62
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:16,920
It'd be a shocker if they hooked up again.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,900
This is interesting.

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,573
A perfect match?

65
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:39,035
- Good work.
- Good work.

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,906
Shioya.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,106
Can I have a word?

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,493
I've finally gotten in touch with Oribe.

69
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,170
She told me about what happened.

70
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:10,280
She said it was all a lie.

71
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,226
She did?

72
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,480
As a colleague, as a close friend,

73
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:25,146
as someone who was closest to her,

74
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:27,746
I should've noticed her mistakes.

75
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,626
I'm truly sorry.

76
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,986
For you, what was Ms. Oribe like?

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,346
She was always by my side during tough times.

78
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:57,090
To me, she was important
to the point that she changed

79
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:03,560
my life and values, and I really loved her.

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,226
I'm really sorry.

81
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,280
I also understand the feeling
of believing in someone really well.

82
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,226
So, you don't have to apologize anymore.

83
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:35,706
Thank you.

84
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,346
It's not my place to say this, but,

85
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,666
I'm glad you also have someone
you can go to during your rough times.

86
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:52,573
You're going out with that guy
from the IT department, right?

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,453
Yeah.

88
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,413
Actually, we are.

89
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:14,266
It's not something I can say
since I bought into the rumors,

90
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,213
but it seems that there are still people
who are misunderstanding you like I did.

91
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,493
Ms. Sato thinks she's so cute, huh?

92
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,093
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Right?

93
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:30,933
Plus, it seems she's really into guys.

94
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:37,960
I think it's best not to mention at work
that the two of you are dating.

95
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,613
I will try to deny it as much as I can, though.

96
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,613
Got it, I won't say a word.

97
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:56,493
Not just me, but it may cause trouble
for Mr. Shioya as well.

98
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,520
I absolutely don't want that to happen.

99
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,280
You're as strong as ever.

100
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,066
No, not at all.

101
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,946
I'm too scared to ask what I really want to know.

102
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:19,960
What are you saying?

103
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,213
You're not the type to run away, right?

104
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,880
You saved me, after all.

105
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,493
Ms. Usuda.

106
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:39,960
Thank you.

107
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,200
I thought we'd never talk again.

108
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm truly sorry for what happened back then.

109
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,146
I ended up hurting you.

110
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:13,053
For the longest time,

111
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
I've been regretting it.

112
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:23,053
I see.

113
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:28,240
You've been regretting it.

114
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:38,320
Well then, would you like to go out again?

115
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:48,426
I can't go out with you.

116
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,320
I'm the one who should apologize.

118
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,866
Just kidding.

119
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:08,853
You really can't lie, can't you?

120
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:10,240
You haven't changed.

121
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,680
Hey, how about going to a hotel buffet tomorrow
around lunch for some limited-time sweets?

122
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,413
You also like sweets, right?

123
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,480
I do.

124
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,906
- Well then.
- I heard you have a seminar tomorrow.

125
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,880
Well, one day wouldn't hurt.

126
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,906
It's limited and can only be eaten now.

127
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:32,520
But, that wouldn't be good for you.

128
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:36,226
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

129
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,386
We've got exams,

130
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,893
so I thought we should be studying.

131
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,093
But you replied to other people, didn't you?

132
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:50,586
Because they were asking about the exams.

133
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,440
In that case, I'd appreciate it
if you'd reply to me, too.

134
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:06,373
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,586
Take more interest in me.

136
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,600
I think it'd be odd

137
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,920
if I commented on your actions.

138
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,560
Figures. I knew it.

139
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,240
You don't like me, do you?

140
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,893
Well.

141
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:35,680
Even if it's a lie, just say you like me.

142
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,453
- Ms. Natsume.
- Forget it.

143
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:46,920
With that attitude,

144
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:52,000
everyone is gonna leave you.

145
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:59,840
Now, I understand that you were

146
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,973
saying that you were thinking
about my best interests.

147
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,986
Even though the trial relationship was my idea,

148
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,586
I'm truly sorry for saying those awful things.

149
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:20,413
No, it was my words that were lacking.

150
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,453
Well, that's true.

151
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,573
Your words may have been lacking.

152
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:39,333
But, I wanted to care for you.

153
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,680
I see.

154
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,840
I'm glad to hear that.

155
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:50,826
Since we managed to meet again,

156
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,266
I figured I wanted to tell you.

157
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:57,466
I'm glad to have heard how you feel.

158
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,680
After all, if you don't want to lose someone,
you really have to talk it out.

159
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,462
Lose someone, you say.

160
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:18,946
I'm with you all the way.

161
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,360
Could it be that there's someone
you're in love with?

162
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,760
I see, then you have to talk properly.

163
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,466
Thank you, Ms. Natsume.

164
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,771
Come on!

165
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,573
These feelings aren't something
you can easily give up on.

166
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:15,160
The one I love is…

167
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,133
Crap.

168
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:26,720
I want you to listen without being put off.

169
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:40,960
But I was scared that someday you'd choose

170
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,320
Mizoguchi.

171
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,626
Sorry for saying something weird.

172
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:58,720
Why him?

173
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:02,506
Shioya is cool,

174
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:05,666
but you don't know what's on his mind, right?

175
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,893
But Mizoguchi's more considerate
and interesting, right?

176
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:10,176
I hear you!

177
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,760
Shioya seems more boring to be with.

178
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,426
Shioya.

179
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:15,680
Because

180
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,880
it was Mizoguchi who was always adored.

181
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,733
I can't make you laugh like he can.

182
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,706
So you might be

183
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,533
happier with him.

184
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,146
When I thought of it that way,

185
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,200
I didn't know what to do.

186
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:04,600
But, it's only you that I don't wanna lose.

187
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:32,906
To me, you're my one and only.

188
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:41,850
I am always thinking about you.

189
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,826
So, please relax.

190
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:02,000
Thank you, Kaede.

191
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:08,826
I will stop worrying about things by myself.

192
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,466
From now on, I'd like to communicate properly.

193
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:22,786
You got it.

194
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,720
Hey, Mr. Shioya.

195
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:33,906
I have a suggestion.

196
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,626
What?

197
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:43,386
I was wondering if we should be more like
one of those foolish couples.

198
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,293
Foolish couples?

199
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:54,586
We should be happy together
to the point that we don't care.

200
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,600
Meaning?

201
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,853
Can I call you by your first name?

202
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,373
I've been wanting to do it for a long time.

203
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,053
Do it.

204
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:20,250
Now's your chance.

205
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,266
Dai… Dai…

206
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,626
Mr. Daisuke?

207
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,173
No need for 'mister.'

208
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,592
I…

209
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:46,013
Then, Daisuke?

210
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,380
We can be more casual.

211
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,960
That's a bit much.

212
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:57,586
You leave me no choice.

213
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:00,693
Then let's drop the formalities.

214
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,853
We're charting into complicated territory.

215
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:16,866
Come on, we're gonna get
more intimate, right, Kaede?

216
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:27,800
I'll do my best.

217
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,640
Daisuke.

218
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,640
Good girl.

219
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,253
Kaede, I love you.

220
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:09,866
Me too.

221
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,733
I love you.

222
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,120
Daisuke.

223
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:12,946
Good morning.

224
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,706
Good morning.

225
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I said we can drop the formalities.

226
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:27,586
But, it'd cause complications
if the people were to know.

227
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,680
What's wrong?

228
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I thought we'd be better off

229
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,973
if everybody didn't know about us.

230
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:58,430
It may cause the spread of odd rumors again,

231
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:03,813
so I figured it'd be best if everyone at work
didn't know about our situation.

232
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,133
Alright.

233
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,840
But we should at least tell Mr. Mizoguchi.

234
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:20,146
But it's all a matter of finding the right timing.

235
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:26,930
♫ Wave goodbye before feeling dizzy ♫

236
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,160
That's unusual, coming home
in the morning, that is.

237
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:33,240
♫ Give me more, give me more, give me more ♫

238
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,786
I need to tell you something.

239
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,480
Why so serious?

240
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:40,960
This is about Ms. Sato.

241
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:44,686
What?

242
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm dating her now.

243
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,222
What?

244
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,550
♫ Indulge until I can barely stand ♫

245
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,386
♫ Wave goodbye before feeling dizzy ♫

246
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:07,693
[Next Episode]
I'll show you my how serious I am.

247
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:10,373
Did something happen with Mr. Shioya?

248
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,706
Just think about me for now.

249
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:15,533
I think it'll trouble Daisuke, too.

250
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,333
I tried showing how serious I am.

251
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,226
[This drama is purely fictional.]
I won't give you to anyone.
