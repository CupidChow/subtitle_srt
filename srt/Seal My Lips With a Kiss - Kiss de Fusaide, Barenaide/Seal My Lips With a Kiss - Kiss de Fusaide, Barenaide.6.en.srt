1
00:00:00,772 --> 00:00:03,582
- About Oribe-san…
- Shut up.

2
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,720
I know it all!

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,572
You cornered Oribe and made her resign.

4
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:13,094
What?

5
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:18,096
You fed lies to the boss and caused her to quit.

6
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:20,865
I didn't do it.

7
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:22,184
Really.

8
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:25,003
You still won't admit it.

9
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:29,108
It's your fault that she lost her job.

10
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:32,677
I'll never forgive you for that!

11
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:36,448
You think it's my fault?

12
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,436
No, it's not.

13
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:55,099
Hey, Shioya.

14
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:59,402
The person who made Oribe-san resign was me.

15
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:02,792

[Episode 6]

29
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:50,690
Hey, Shioya.

30
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,658
What was that just now?

31
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:55,093
Just stating the facts.

32
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:59,097
I made Oribe-san quit.

33
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,302
You're protecting her.

34
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:04,495
As I thought,

35
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:07,716
you're quite good at getting men on your side.

36
00:02:07,716 --> 00:02:08,677
That's not true.

37
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:12,181
Oribe told me directly.

38
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,296
Why?

39
00:02:13,296 --> 00:02:16,340
Why do you have to quit, Oribe?

40
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:22,700
Didn't we promise to work hard together when we got hired?

41
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:27,225
I was set up.

42
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,661
What?

43
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:33,747
That girl got to the boss and spread lies about me,

44
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:36,234
all to get rid of me.

45
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:40,305
Who would do such a thing?

46
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:50,548
Sato Kaede.

47
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:00,793
No way...

48
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:03,028
No use making excuses.

49
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:05,715
She's deceiving you guys, too.

50
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:08,632
That's not true.

51
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:11,469
What's not true?

52
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:16,400
Two years ago, under company orders,

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,179
I investigated harassment allegations against an individual.

54
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:24,783
While probing, I happened to find out

55
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:29,787
that individual had an affair with Oribe-san.

56
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:34,226
Oribe? Had an affair?

57
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:39,197
That is why she quit.

58
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,267
I can't believe it.

59
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:44,637
I heard this girl seduced our boss and got Oribe to quit.

60
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:50,805
Whom did Oribe-san tell you Sato-san was flattering?

61
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,339
Chief Yui.

62
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:54,446
What about that?

63
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:12,764
The very person I was investigating for harassment allegations was Chief Yui,

64
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:15,333
the previous Chief of General Affairs.

65
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,057
What?

66
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,880
And...

67
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,500
he had an affair with Oribe-san.

68
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,947
While investigating Chief Yui's harassment allegations,

69
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:33,851
the affair came to light, and I reported it.

70
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:39,958
He was denounced, and Oribe-san chose to resign.

71
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,824
That can't be.

72
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,888
But Oribe never mentioned any of that.

73
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:47,298
She likely couldn't mention the affair.

74
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,972
Lies.

75
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:02,447
Why?

76
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,584
Oribe.

77
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:09,354
Why?

78
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,294
Usuda-san.

79
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,009
Sato-san.

80
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:43,821
Mizoguchi has taken Usuda-san to the station.

81
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,552
Really?

82
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:53,264
I'm sorry, Sato-san.

83
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:59,003
Why are you apologizing?

84
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:07,675
Because Usuda-san was harassing you.

85
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,881
I didn't realize it.

86
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:13,783
Don't be sorry. I should thank you.

87
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:16,520
Thank you very much.

88
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,158
I should also properly thank Mizoguchi-san.

89
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:32,003
You don't have to pretend to be strong.

90
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,544
Let me share your burden.

91
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:45,483
Finally,

92
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:51,356
I now understand

93
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,395
what was going on back then.

94
00:06:58,397 --> 00:06:59,982
Could I have a moment, please?
[2 years ago]

95
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:00,900
- Yes.
- Sure.

96
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,786
As of today, General Affairs officially has a new member, Sato Kaede-san.

97
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:06,912
I'm Sato.

98
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:08,634
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,775
Nice to meet you, Sato-san.

100
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:11,877
Pleased to meet you.

101
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:15,514
This is Oribe-san; she will be mentoring you.

102
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:18,254
Please ask her about any tasks from now on.

103
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,502
Sure.

104
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:20,783
I'm Oribe.

105
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:23,693
Nice to meet you, Sato-san.

106
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,512
Nice to meet you.

107
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,544
Now, I'll show you this floor's departments.

108
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:30,562
Here is General Affairs,

109
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:33,998
and over there is the IT Department.

110
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:39,802
You'll exchange fairly many documents with them so be sure to remember.

111
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:40,859
I understand.

112
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,412
If you need to know anything, just ask.

113
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,592
So let's do our best.

114
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,979
It's my pleasure.

115
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,901
Oribe, please take care of this.

116
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,385
Okay.

117
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,854
- For sales?
- Yes.

118
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:56,021
Do your best.

119
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:57,752
No need to tell me.

120
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,659
- Have a good day.
- I'll go now.

121
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,592
Oribe-san, were you hired along with Usuda-san?

122
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:10,502
Yes, since our time as contract workers.

123
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:13,893
You both seem very close.

124
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,792
Yes.

125
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:20,111
She can be hard on others and herself,

126
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:24,232
but all the more reason why I trust her.

127
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,857
That's why Usuda and I are friends.

128
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:34,386
Count me in. I'll work hard like you two.

129
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,211
Yes, you do that.

130
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,192
I have high hopes for you.

131
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:42,300
By the way, I'm leaving on time today.

132
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,487
Have you a date?

133
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,212
Is it that obvious?

134
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,152
I'll finish quickly.

135
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,176
I'll go to Accounting.

136
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:53,070
Catch you later.

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,180
Then...

138
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:59,817
I never noticed anything.

139
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:11,415
Chief Yui, thank you for your work.

140
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,131
Same to you.

141
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,694
Is it just you, Sato-san?

142
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:18,842
I just wanted to checked something,

143
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:20,773
but I'm leaving now.

144
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,712
Good.

145
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,609
You're a hard worker, Sato-san.

146
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:26,252
Thanks.

147
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:29,001
If you have any problems, you can ask me,

148
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,972
with no hesitation.

149
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,885
Thank you.

150
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,599
Keep up the good work.

151
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,538
At first…

152
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:56,807
I thought it was just my imagination.

153
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,710
But…

154
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:01,879
Chief Yui

155
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:10,288
purposely arranged meetings for us to be alone,

156
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,660
and he sent personal messages.

157
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,729
These instances

158
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,116
kept happening.

159
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:40,251
Then one time, he asked me

160
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,156
to stay late.

161
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,892
Sato-san.

162
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:51,244
Sorry for being late.

163
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:53,564
I was stuck in a meeting.

164
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,903
So what's this consultation about?

165
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:03,508
I just want to get to know you better.

166
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,594
This won't do.

167
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:07,006
Let's do it outside.

168
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:09,113
I've reserved a place.

169
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:12,452
No, we can talk here.

170
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,632
What, are you being cautious?

171
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,089
It's just business.

172
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,535
Please stop!

173
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:21,092
Ouch!

174
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,731
You think you can take that attitude with me?

175
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:28,852
Well...

176
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,752
Chief…

177
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:33,671
Sato-san.

178
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:37,772
Do you have a moment?

179
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:41,752
The application you submitted today has errors.

180
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:48,222
Chief Yui. May I borrow Sato-san for a moment?

181
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,572
You got it.

182
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:54,192
We can do the consultation another day.

183
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,498
I can't let this go on.

184
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,453
I need to tell someone.

185
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:04,996
What did you want to talk about?

186
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,107
That's what I thought.

187
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:10,692
What's wrong? You look serious.

188
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,212
Well…

189
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:19,750
About these messages…

190
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,552
What?

191
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:32,032
The Chief sent me these that go above my duties.

192
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,282
And…

193
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:35,892
[This weekend may not work.]

194
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:37,152
[If it's late, I'll adjust for you; don't worry.]

195
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:38,454
[We're off the next day; let's enjoy the night.]

196
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:39,692
[Why think? I'll take care of you.]

197
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,452
[But it might not work.]
[Don't be like that.]

198
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:47,172
The Chief… wouldn't send something like this.

199
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:49,048
No, but…

200
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,972
He would never do it.

201
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:54,852
Are you trying to seduce him?

202
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:57,888
I'd never do such a thing!

203
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:01,325
You're the worst.

204
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,112
Since that day…

205
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:14,147
Excuse me, Oribe-san,

206
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,694
I need to ask about month-end processing.

207
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,460
Sorry, I'm busy now.

208
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,378
Please ask someone else.

209
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:22,232
"Someone else"?

210
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:30,021
They all stopped talking to me.

211
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:34,258
Back then…

212
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,690
I didn't know

213
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,630
what was happening.

214
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:51,670
At that time,

215
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,140
all I could do was report it to the company.

216
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:06,057
All I could do... was just watch,

217
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,343
right there, how he was.

218
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,595
You think you can take that attitude with me?

219
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:14,598
I couldn't help.

220
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:19,137
Are you telling me

221
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:29,277
that the Chief's investigation wasn't under company orders?

222
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,017
But on your own?

223
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm definitely

224
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,830
on your side, Kaede.

225
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:05,216
The person who saved me...

226
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:13,624
was you, right, Shioya-san?

227
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,897
I couldn't do much.

228
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:23,552
I'm sorry.

229
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,642
That's not true.

230
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,914
Back then,

231
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:43,421
I thought that

232
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:48,192
I was going to have to endure it

233
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,830
and wait for the transfer.

234
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,392
But…

235
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,572
Sato-san. Do you have a moment?

236
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:10,178
Shioya-san, you always showed up when I'm was in trouble.

237
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,052
Oh.

238
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,632
Well…

239
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:18,355
What was it again?

240
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:27,798
And this…

241
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,912
Sweets?

242
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:36,374
Here. Take some, if you like.

243
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,312
Thank you.

244
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,773
Delicious.

245
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:11,909
You

246
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,446
saved me.

247
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:25,989
Just be confident and be yourself,

248
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:28,492
because your work performance is better.

249
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:33,597
You were watching over me.

250
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:38,068
What you said to me

251
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:43,607
has always been my emotional support.

252
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:50,214
Since I didn't do anything wrong,

253
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:55,052
I did my very best.

254
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:13,270
I truly thank you

255
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,410
for saving me.

256
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:26,984
Sorry for saying it so late.

257
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,312
Don't be.

258
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:53,143
Why do you always notice these things?

259
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:55,112
Pardon?

260
00:18:55,113 --> 00:19:00,192
We didn't talk that much back then.

261
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,389
Because I love you,

262
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,732
for the longest time.

263
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:23,308
What do you mean by the longest time?

264
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:29,743
You mentioned a person in charge of the system recovery work.

265
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:34,518
That was me.

266
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:36,047
We must make it ready for the customers at the event tomorrow.

267
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,222
Let's do our best!

268
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:44,372
Since it was work, I thought it was natural.

269
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:45,597
But…

270
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:49,092
Natural is natural.

271
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,636
How should I put this?

272
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:55,705
He was not just doing it for himself,

273
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:58,980
but for others who might be affected.

274
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:04,281
I hope to work with that kind of mindset.

275
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:12,086
I felt what we were doing was reaching others.

276
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,561
Since then, I've been curious about you, Kaede.

277
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,232
I watched you all this time.

278
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,560
Incredible.

279
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,338
It feels like a dream.

280
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:38,315
Which is why I will always stand by you

281
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:41,251
forever, Kaede.

282
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:45,556
Yes.

283
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,759
Thank you.

284
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:54,582
Oh, there you are.

285
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:57,801
Let's drink up today.

286
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,303
What?

287
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:06,561
Figures, nothing beats beer.

288
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:09,447
Shioya-san isn't even here yet.

289
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:11,749
How many drinks was that?

290
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:15,812
He said he'd return as soon as he finished work, didn't he?

291
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:19,224
I know, but I feel sorry for him.

292
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:23,294
It's fine, because we're doing this for you.

293
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:25,630
You've worked hard this whole time

294
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,899
so drink all you want today!

295
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:30,067
Thank you.

296
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:34,338
Sorry about before.

297
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,174
Why?

298
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:41,078
Why are you apologizing?

299
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:44,249
Well…

300
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:49,019
You've been helping me this whole time, right?

301
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,422
I truly appreciate it.

302
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:55,410
Gosh.

303
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,513
- You're really…
- Oh, come on.

304
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:02,466
Hey, cut it out.

305
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,668
I sure messed it up.

306
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:10,158
Hey, you're drunk, aren't you?

307
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:12,576
Oh, don't nag.

308
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:19,984
My next beer…

310
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:40,105

What?

319
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:08,099
I'll be on a business trip with Mizoguchi-san.
[Next Episode]

320
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,103
Resist me with all you've got.

321
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:11,284
Don't try anything weird.

322
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:13,805
I'll keep my distance with girls, unlike you.

323
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:16,403
Who is the one you love?

324
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:19,977
I hope this happiness continues forever.
