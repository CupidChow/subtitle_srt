Of course, I was.

No problem.

So what did you want to talk about?

00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:27,119
Actually, it's a bit complicated.

56
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:31,983
So I wanted Shioya to be a neutral third party.

What do you mean by "complicated?"

58
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:42,755

Yes, there was missing data,

and I wasn't allowed to ask certain questions.

68
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:16,911
But I thought it might be because Usuda-san is too busy.

I hope that's the case, too.

But…

71
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:30,535
During the transition, could Usuda-san

may I first speak with Usuda-san?

89
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:10,577
I think Usuda-san is passionate about work.

I agree.

This is Usuda-san's handwriting.

185
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:09,644
I'm certain.

186
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:18,511
[Changed to ¥12 million without assurance]

187
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:24,395
[Person in charge changed from Yokogawa-san to Yamamoto-san]

188
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,577
[Changed to ¥12 million without assurance]

189
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,044
Why?

190
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:36,060
This time, Shibayama noticed beforehand,

191
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,510
to fix the issue with the contract.

192
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,244
However…

193
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:42,911
If it went unnoticed,

194
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,211
things would have been terrible.

195
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,259
Where are you going?

196
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,386
I want to talk to Usuda-san!

197
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:01,044
She almost hurt the entire Sales Dept. just to frame me.

198
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,311
I will never forgive her!

199
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,944
Sato!

200
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:09,511
Sato, wait a moment.

201
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:15,007
Shioya, quickly stop her!

202
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,477
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

203
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,144
What's going on?

204
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:26,144
How should I put it?

205
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:28,244
Please let go of me.

206
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:30,144
Calm down first.

207
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:33,011
Didn't I say I would arrange your talk with Usuda-san?

208
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:36,277
While I wait for that, something like this might happen again!

209
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:40,577
Then it will impact the company's profit!

210
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:43,444
I see, I think I understand what happened.

211
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,963
If so, please let go of me!

212
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,777
Don't you want to know Usuda-san's reasons?

213
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,377
If you talk to her directly now,

214
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:57,444
Usuda-san won't reveal anything.

215
00:16:57,444 --> 00:17:02,695
Still, everyone might be in a worse situation with me.

216
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:06,844
I must go and settle the matter!

217
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,577
Do you really think that will settle it?

218
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:25,167
To be blunt, I doubt your current approach

219
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:29,335
will achieve what you truly want.

220
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:33,177
Do you really think that would be good?

221
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:56,177
I… was hasty.

222
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,377
I apologize.

223
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,777
I'm glad you calmed down.

224
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:07,971
But what should we do about it?

225
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,670
Even if we go to Usuda-san,

226
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,440
will she really tell us the truth?

227
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:18,155
Then... let's strategize.

228
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:25,211
Let's arrange it this way.

229
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,377
I understand.

230
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:30,477
All right, I'll arrange it.

231
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,377
I'll return to work now.

232
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:38,955
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

233
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:50,444
I must also apologize to you, Shioya-san.

234
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:53,511
Let's go back to work, too.

235
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:02,711
I'm sorry about earlier.

236
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,144
I was harsh.

237
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:11,911
I'm the one who should apologize.

238
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:15,010
If not for your words,

239
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,840
I would have acted rashly.

240
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:22,977
Thank you for stopping me.

241
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,344
Don't take it all on yourself.

242
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:41,040
If anything else happens,

243
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,780
you must rely on me.

244
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:52,575
Okay.

245
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,177
Mizoguchi-kun.

246
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:00,611
Is he not here yet?

247
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:12,244
Please come in.

248
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:18,577
What's going on?

249
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:30,777
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

250
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:37,044
But... I have something to say to you.

251
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:40,044
I had an appointment with Mizoguchi-kun.

252
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:43,177
I have nothing to say to you.

253
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:48,344
It's important.

254
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,944
I can't believe you thought of such a thing.

255
00:20:57,044 --> 00:21:00,935
After Usuda-san enters, we will leave you two alone.

256
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:06,344
Then keep our phone call open.

257
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,644
We will block the door.

258
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,675
If anything happens, we will enter at once.

259
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:14,477
Don't worry.

260
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:16,177
Okay.

261
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,077
[Changed to ¥12 million without assurance]

262
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:24,895
Isn't this your handwriting with the altered incorrect amount?

263
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:27,844
No, that's not my handwriting.

264
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:28,844
But…

265
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:32,777
Are you trying to threaten me with baseless accusations?

266
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:39,310
There's one more thing:

267
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,777
The Handover Manual excluded important information.

268
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:46,187
Many projects don't have written records.

269
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:49,344
Only incompetent workers would shift the blame onto others.

270
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:51,877
Mizoguchi-san confirmed it for me.

271
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:56,477
The vital data required was missing from the very start.

272
00:21:57,877 --> 00:21:59,455
Really?

273
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:05,706
So you instigated Mizoguchi-kun to come to me at that time.

274
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,591
No, I did not.

275
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:10,077
Mizoguchi-san just confirmed it with me.

276
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:16,271
Seducing men to frame others is your method, right?

277
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,339
What?

278
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,607
I won't allow a despicable woman like you in the Sales Dept.

279
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,647
If not for you, she wouldn't have…

280
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,877
Are you talking about Oribe-san?

281
00:22:33,515 --> 00:22:37,939
Is this Oribe-san, the one who left two years ago?

282
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,210
Why suddenly mention her?

283
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,910
- About Oribe-san—
- Shut up!

284
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,610
I know it all!

285
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,610
You cornered Oribe and made her resign.

286
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,611
What?

287
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,410
[Next Episode]

288
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,991
Usuda and I are friends.

289
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:12,810
I will always stand by you forever, Kaede.

290
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,071
Shioya-san was the person who saved me.

291
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:20,048
[This drama is a work of fiction.]
