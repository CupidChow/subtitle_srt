00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,980
I have stage-2 cancer.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,920
Why do you sound so serious?

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,710
Marwin agrees to hire me to work at his gallery.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,830
I like Kim.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,030
She wouldn’t fall for someone like you. Get over it.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,980
Stop bothering me and messing up with my life.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,870
Why does everything change so fast?

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,870
I’ll take it that you allow me to pursue you.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

23
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,810
Yes, Toon?

24
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,300
I called to wake you up. See you at noon.

25
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,050
You have an award show to attend this evening.

26
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,430
Mhm.

27
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,300
I’d like to thank everyone for this award.

28
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:50,590
Thank you for all the opportunities given to me.

29
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,840
I alone wouldn’t be able to make it this far…

30
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,040
without a great support from many people around me.

31
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,630
Thank you to my mother, to Toon – my manager, and to my tiny group of best friends.

32
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,710
Thank you for being a safe zone for me.

33
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,170
You always support me in everything that I do.

34
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,760
I’d like to give this award to everyone,

35
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,800
even though it’s nothing compared to what they have done for me.

36
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,420
Thank you all the viewers and my fans too…

37
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,550
for always supporting my work.

38
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,950
Although many people might find my personality unlovable, like what you have seen on the news.

39
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,420
But this is the true nature of an entertainment industry.

40
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,460
I can be an angel, or I can be a bitch. I can also be a comedian if you want me to.

41
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,430
That’s because I’m an actress.

42
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,000
(Applause)

43
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,660
Easy there. Slowly.

44
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,040
Careful!

45
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,880
Okay.

46
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,010
Let’s put it over here.

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,250
Okay

48
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,180
Make sure you leave some space between each dress, okay?

49
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,540
Yes.

50
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,520
So that our customers can browse them easily.

51
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,010
Oh, jeez!

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,590
Isn’t that Miss Dawan, a famous actress? Is she your friend?

53
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,100
Umm, why don’t you go and finish your work upstairs.

54
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,760
Okay.

55
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,640
What’s up, Wan?

56
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,220
What brought you here? I thought you were a ghost.

57
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,980
Are you here to show me the award?

58
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,780
Rising female star of the year.

59
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,770
I think the title should be longer though.

60
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,620
Rising female star, who is so full of herself, of the year. Right?

61
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,480
Fine. I’ll put it back.

62
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,930
So, why are you here then? I guess it’s not to show me your award.

63
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,360
Maybe I should change my job.

64
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,580
Instead of opening a dress rental shop, I’d probably do better with a mental health clinic.

65
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,510
Spit it out. What’s bothering you?

66
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,970
I like Kim.

67
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,080
Let’s be on our own way.

68
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,580
Stop bothering me and messing with my life.

69
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,940
So, yesterday when you went talking to Marwin, he told you he likes Kim?

70
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,430
Yeah

71
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,740
I’m scared.

72
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,820
You’re scared Kim would fall for Marwin, aren’t you?

73
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,960
Mhm.

74
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,600
Then you must tell her how you feel. Do it before he confesses to her.

75
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,990
Or else you’ll lose her forever.

76
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,140
I’ve told you before.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,830
I can’t tell her how I feel.

78
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,090
Listen, I don’t know what makes you think you can’t tell her how you feel.

79
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,120
But are you going to just sit here and watch someone else snatches her away?

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,000
So what?

81
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,200
Why is your relationship with Kim always seem so complicated?

82
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,610
Since high school, Kim seemed to like you back then.

83
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,880
Why didn’t you confess to here then?

84
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,110
You dropped a pencil case.

85
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,580
Ouch.

86
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,660
Hey, new kid! Try to do better!

87
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,640
I’m Dawan. What’s your name?

88
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,460
(Crying)

89
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,370
Why didn’t you get changed?

90
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,070
I don’t know how.

91
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,430
Then why are you standing here like a fool? Go and ask your friends for help.

92
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,190
Why don’t you help her?

93
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,980
She doesn’t know how to do it. Why did you have to call her a fool?

94
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,990
If we’re already smart, we wouldn’t have come to school to study.

95
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,500
Let’s go, Kim.

96
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,830
You, son of a bitch!

97
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,280
(Crying)

98
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:53,740
(Crying)
Why?! Why?!

99
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,620
Did you know that Kim’s dad is gay?

100
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,460
- Her dad ran away with a guy next door.
- Mali!
- What are you talking about?

101
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,430
Wan.

102
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,610
It’s good you’re here.

103
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,010
- That’s enough
- Stop it, Wan!

104
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,020
Here, the snacks and drinks you both like.

105
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:36,690
Here, take it.

106
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,470
Look at my mouth! How can I drink it! Ouch! That hurts.

107
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,530
You two have fought for over a week already.

108
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,050
When will you two make up to each other? It’s so frustrating.

109
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,000
You want me to forgive her?

110
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,530
She’s the reason why everyone in this school knows about my dad and Kim’s dad.

111
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,630
Serve you right!

112
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,920
Jeez! Fine! I’m sorry. I didn’t meant it.

113
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,380
Huh? What did you say?

114
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,390
She said she’s sorry. She’s willing to do anything.

115
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,660
Yeah.

116
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,470
Careful!

117
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,840
Yeah.

118
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,540
You said you’d do anything?

119
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,740
Yeah.

120
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,420
Good. Follow me.

121
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,820
Where are we going?

122
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,440
Just follow me.

123
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,490
Ouch! Even walking hurts.

124
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,320
Ouch!

125
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,320
Hey, you.

126
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,540
What is it?

127
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,840
Mali, apologize to her.

128
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,010
Quick! Apologize for everything you have wronged her.

129
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,720
I’m sorry.

130
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,600
Huh? What did you say?

131
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,050
I’m sorry.

132
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,870
I can’t hear it.

133
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,990
I’M SORRY!

134
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,920
Good.

135
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,290
Well, I’m sorry too for thinking that you were the one who locked me up in the locker room.

136
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,630
From now on, Kimhan will also be in our gang.

137
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,380
If anyone disagree, you can leave the gang.

138
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,620
Jeez, so slow.

139
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,620
You too, Samorn.

140
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,940
We’re friends now.

141
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,400
Don’t any of you dare to pick on her ever again.

142
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,710
I’m so sorry, Kim.

143
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,260
- Hello, Miss Ae.
- Hello, girls.

144
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,730
Is Kim all right? She hasn’t been to school lately.

145
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,550
She probably caught a cold. She only stays in her room and hardly comes down.

146
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,910
Can I go see her?

147
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,770
Sure.

148
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,550
- We’ll wait here then.
- Okay.

149
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,930
Kim’s mum, what are you doing?

150
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,720
Oh, I’m taking all these stuff to my office.

151
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,570
Ahh, what’s your job?

152
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,830
I’m a wedding planner?

153
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,580
(Door knocking)

154
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,660
(Door knocking)

155
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,850
Get well soon, so that we can go to school together again.

156
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,980
[Mali: I heard someone said that kissing can cure your cold.]

157
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,580
If I kiss you, will you really get better?

158
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,580
Wan! What are you doing?!

159
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,050
I…I was just going to put a blanket over her.

160
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,570
Oops, she won’t be able to breathe.

161
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,520
Oh, her hair is messy.

162
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,180
Hey, are you hungry? I’m so famished.

163
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,880
Oh, it’s cold now.

164
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,970
I’ll bring it down then.

165
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,620
Why are you acting weird?

166
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,550
Well, you bring it down then.

167
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,230
I’m leaving.

168
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,900
A patient food?

169
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,350
I’ll just have a bite, Kim.

170
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,130
Wait, you’re sick, aren’t you?

171
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,750
Will I get sick too? Wan! Wait for me!

172
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,770
Cheers! Woohoo!

173
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,980
Cheers to Wan. Our friend is going to be an actress!

174
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,110
Congratulations! You finally got into the X Gent agency.

175
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,110
Let’s take a picture with her.

176
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,760
Yeah, nice pose.

177
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,810
Miss Wan, can I have your autograph, please?

178
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,720
I won’t give you for free.

179
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,730
So arrogant. And she’s not famous yet.

180
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,540
- Eww, so bitter.
- What's wrong?

181
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,240
How can adults drink this?

182
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,970
But it’s kind of nice too.

183
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,800
Can you give me more?

184
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,730
Finish this one first and I’ll give you more.

185
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,500
Aren’t you going to congratulate me, Kim?

186
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,460
Congratulations.

187
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,520
Really?

188
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,890
Of course.

189
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,680
From now on, you’d get to kiss a lot of handsome guys.

190
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:40,170
From what I’ve heard, they don’t kiss for real. It’s the work of a camera angle.

191
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,500
You didn’t know that? Let me show you.

192
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,020
Like this. First method…

193
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,260
See that? My lips barely touched her.

194
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:58,350
Suppose you can’t avoid lips touching, then they’d use a second method like this…

195
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,840
Put your thumb on your co-star’s lips and kiss it.

196
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,690
However, for the third method, in case you can’t avoid kissing each other’s lips…

197
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,600
Then just go with it.

198
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:21,170
Argh!!

199
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,610
Don’t you laugh at me, Wan. You of all the people should know it best.

200
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,620
Of course, anyone knows about this.

201
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,680
When you’re an actress, you must be able to get into the character.

202
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Don’t just talk the talk. If you can really do it, then show us.

203
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,500
Suppose Mon and I are the audience while you are the male lead and Kim the female lead.

204
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,080
Okay, 5 4 3 2 action!

205
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,020
Burp!

206
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,860
Burp!

207
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,720
Sorry. It’s the beer.

208
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,940
Jeez, it smells so bad. You should’ve gone and puke if you’re going to burp like that.

209
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,520
But although you can avoid kissing, you can’t avoid being hugged.

210
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,240
You’re quite a jealous type, aren’t you?

211
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,490
Did you mean ‘worry’? Why would she be jealous? You’re not her girlfiend.

212
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,830
Yeah, that’s what I meant.

213
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,040
Hey, are your mum home today?

214
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,660
Nope.

215
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,340
She has to be at the wedding site. She’d be back in the morning.

216
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,720
I have something special for you to watch.

217
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,530
No stand-in or any use of camera angle. You’d love it.

218
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:59,580
So? Do you like it? No stand-in like I said.

219
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,400
You, perve! Why did you make us watch a porn movie?

220
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,550
What are you thinking? Aren’t you embarrassed?

221
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:22,350
Hmm, I was just thinking whether the actors really get turned on when they play this kind of scene.

222
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,890
Or is just an acting?

223
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:30,580
And do they find it disgusting to do that oral sex scene?

224
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,500
I also want to know how it feels or smells like when you have sex with someone.

225
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,650
I want to try it.

226
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,410
Try what?

227
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,430
Tasting it.

228
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,540
(Choking)

229
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,050
(Choking)

230
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,260
(Choking)

231
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,400
(Choking)

232
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,440
On this Valentine, I’m going to say yes to the first one who gives me gifts or flowers.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

235
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:10,541
Wan.

236
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:12,851
Hmm?

237
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:17,541
What soap do you use?

238
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:22,271
A lavender soap.

239
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,621
Can I…smell you?

240
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:31,531
Mhm.

241
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:52,661
Smells so nice.

242
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,521
What about you?

243
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,961
What soap do you use?

244
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,651
A baby soap.

245
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:22,871
That’s why.

246
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:26,831
Your skin is so…

247
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:30,931
soft like a baby.

248
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:38,421
Can I…touch you?

249
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:41,981
Mhm.

250
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:32,371
Goodnight.

251
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,371
Can I get a little closer…

252
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,651
to smell the scent of a baby soap?

253
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:11,051
Mhm.

254
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:13,181
Sure.

255
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:27,271
A baby soap…

256
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,491
smells so nice.

257
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:32,371
Kim.

258
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:36,431
Can I…

259
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:39,401
taste you?

260
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:07,881
Do you like it?

261
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:10,851
Yeah.

262
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:18,301
Can I taste more of you?

263
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:30,431
In our dream, you can do anything you want.

264
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:16,581
Hey.

265
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:17,271
Hm?

266
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:23,881
I dreamt about…that with Kim.

267
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:25,091
What?!

268
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:33,221
Have you ever dreamt about it with me?

269
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:37,191
Eww, no way. That’s disgusting.

270
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:41,521
Hey.

271
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,211
What.

272
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:45,401
- From what I’ve told you…
- Aha.

273
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,781
Do you think I’m gay?

274
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:55,501
It was just…your fantasy imagination. It was just a dream.

275
00:31:55,841 --> 00:32:01,021
It didn’t mean you’d turn gay and like girls instead of boys.

276
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:05,071
You two have a lot in common.

277
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:07,221
Both of your fathers left you.

278
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:09,131
Your home are next to each other.

279
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:13,841
So, that might make you two feel connected or bonded with each other.

280
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:15,811
Just forget about it.

281
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:16,871
Yeah

282
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:17,711
Really?

283
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:18,511
Yeah

284
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:20,871
Let me ask you this.

285
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:29,281
Do you still feel a tickle in your heart when you see a guy’s six-pack abs?

286
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:32,901
Oh, I can’t take it.

287
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:34,591
Why?

288
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,501
- Or is it because…
- Aha.

289
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:42,941
I’m too pretty that no man is good enough for me?

290
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:43,651
Umm.

291
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:45,891
So cocky.

292
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,411
I’ll give you 100 out of 10 for your self-confidence.

293
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:54,271
Or maybe you should really get a boyfriend.

294
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:58,091
So that you’d finally see this dream as something nonsense.

295
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,771
Or maybe, let’s try this.

296
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:01,481
Aha.

297
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:02,301
Close your eyes.

298
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:04,231
Don’t open them.

299
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,401
- Imagine as I tell you.
- Aha.

300
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,251
Fantasize it.

301
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:09,631
A handsome guy.

302
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,751
With his perfect abs. First ab.

303
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:13,871
Second ab.

304
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:15,971
Thrid ab.

305
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:17,771
Fourth ab.

306
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:19,641
Fifth ab.

307
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:21,131
Sixth ab.

308
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:22,881
- Seventh..      /      - Jeez!

309
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:23,551
What?

310
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,271
I can’t.

311
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:27,661
What’s wrong with you?

312
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:30,721
Let’s do this then.

313
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:31,561
What?

314
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:36,931
On this Valentine, I’m going to say yes to the first one who gives me gifts or flowers.

315
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:40,751
Good idea. I like that.

316
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:42,631
Brilliant.

317
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,131
Guys.

318
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:46,861
Water.

319
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:50,961
It’s 10 baht.

320
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:55,011
Sell it to me then.

321
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:56,441
- Here, your water.
- It's just this much left.

322
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:03,041
It’s not Valentine’s day yet, you don’t have to give it to me now.

323
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:03,931
Huh?

324
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:11,131
Give it to Mon. She was dancing her face off.

325
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:12,421
Okay.

326
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:33,851
Wan.

327
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:35,061
Wan.

328
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:53,851
Of course, you’d get a lot. You’re a celebrity.

329
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:57,041
- I’m just a normal girl. This is a lot for me.
- Everyone.

330
00:34:57,481 --> 00:35:01,071
A hot girl is here

331
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:06,121
- What’s the fuss?
- There’s still room on my back. Please feel free.

332
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,481
- Jeez!      /     - What?

333
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,691
Did you buy stickers and put them on your own shirt again?

334
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:11,321
- Mon.    /    - What?

335
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:11,901
Shut up.

336
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,171
Why would you tell everyone I bought these stickers?

337
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:18,601
But it’s true. You’ve done this since the 7th grade.

338
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:19,891
Damn you.

339
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:22,601
Now that you girls are here.

340
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:28,911
I’m going to do a lucky draw to choose the person who’d be my girlfriend.

341
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:30,401
- Let’s put them over here.
- Wait.

342
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:31,221
Wait.

343
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:32,991
Just put it there.

344
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:34,251
- Got it.     /     - Okay.

345
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:35,161
Done.

346
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:36,391
Go on then.

347
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:37,321
All right.

348
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,451
The lucky draw is about to begin.

349
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:44,141
I’ll go out with the first name that got drawn up.

350
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:45,761
Okay.

351
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,721
A little to the left. Left. Left!

352
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:49,791
Girls.

353
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:53,081
Teacher Charuay wants to see all of you.

354
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:55,961
She has something to talk to you. It’s urgent.

355
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:56,731
What?

356
00:35:56,831 --> 00:35:58,951
- Jeez, Mali.    /     - What?

357
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:01,011
- What did we do?     /     - Yeah.

358
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:02,961
No idea. We didn’t do anything.

359
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,881
- Such a waste of time.
- Let’s hurry and go see her.

360
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:05,921
I don’t want to have a problem with her again.

361
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:06,781
- Let’s go.    /    - Fine.

362
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:15,421
That sucks.

363
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:16,211
Yeah.

364
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,331
- What’s wrong with her?
- Yeah.

365
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:20,521
She called for us but she was still teaching in class.

366
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:21,061
Yeah.

367
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:22,271
- Such a bully.     /     - Yeah.

368
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:23,731
- I think she hates us.
- Why on earth did she call for us?

369
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:24,311
Yeah.

370
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:27,791
Hey! Where are all the gifts?

371
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:30,431
They’re all gone!

372
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:33,971
And so is Kim.

373
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:37,831
Hey, you guys are back.

374
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:40,751
- Kim.     /     - Hm?

375
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:42,181
Have you seen her gifts?

376
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:43,551
Huh?

377
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:45,731
Where are they?

378
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,171
They were still here when I went to the toilet.

379
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:56,731
Hey, maybe someone is jealous of you because you got a lot of gifts.

380
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:58,451
So, they stole all your gifts.

381
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:00,301
We have to tell the teacher.

382
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:00,761
Let’s go.

383
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,131
- Wait.      /     - What?

384
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,241
It’s okay.

385
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:05,711
We’ve caused enough troubles to the teacher.

386
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:11,001
But without those gifts, we are never going to find out the first person you’d go out with.

387
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:11,781
Yeah.

388
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:15,781
Who took them? You really don’t know?

389
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:17,111
No.

390
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:34,981
Kim.

391
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:37,191
Yes?

392
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:41,171
I have something for you. Hang on.

393
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,191
Here

394
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:51,991
Why did you give it to me?

395
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:55,051
Well…I thought you might be hungry.

396
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:11,741
Is it good?

397
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:15,361
Mhm, really good.

398
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:21,531
I thought you’d give me a Valentine gift.

399
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:32,431
Here.

400
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,701
Your Valentine’s gift.

401
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:38,871
Take it.

402
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:51,291
You’re so sweet. You got a Valentine gift for me.

403
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:01,471
Hmm, it’s so good.

404
00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:03,281
Mhm. And soft too.

405
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,661
Don’t forget to use them.

406
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:14,861
I have a gift for you too.

407
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:27,571
Here.

408
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:32,901
My hands are full.

409
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:35,221
Oh.

410
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:36,691
Give me that.

411
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:42,681
- I’ll open it then.     /     - Aha.

412
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:31,971
(Phone ringing)

413
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:33,971
(Phone ringing)

414
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:35,971
(Phone ringing)

415
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:37,971
(Phone ringing)

416
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:45,321
Wan, are you with Kim?

417
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:48,791
Get out of there, now.

418
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:50,771
I have something to talk to you.

419
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:53,811
Umm…

420
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:58,901
My agency called to ask for some information.

421
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:02,431
I’ll go talk to them over there.

422
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:03,321
Mhm.

423
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:04,701
Okay.

424
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:12,051
What is it, Mon? What’s so excited?

425
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:17,661
Listen carefully. I was walking home while drinking a red soda pop.

426
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:20,881
I was alone and about to throw away the cup because I finished it.

427
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,781
I don’t know why, but I kept craving for a red soda pop today.

428
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,931
Jeez! Just get to the point!

429
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:33,421
Okay, I was about to throw away the cup and I found a trash bin.

430
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:35,151
But do you know what I found there?

431
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,111
How would I know?

432
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:41,331
Your gifts.

433
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:43,101
What?

434
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:46,331
And do you know who put them here?

435
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,171
It was Kim.

436
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:51,061
What?

437
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:52,451
I knew because…

438
00:41:52,631 --> 00:42:00,341
I recognized the bag she was holding when she came to tell us to go see Teacher Charuay.

439
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:05,441
You should T-A-A. Are you with me?

440
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:10,341
What’s TAA?

441
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:13,831
It’s think and analyze, you idiot!

442
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:16,651
Think about it.

443
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:21,811
First, Kim tricked us to go see Teacher Charuay.

444
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:26,621
Second, she took all your gifts and throw them into the bin.

445
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:31,801
- Third, she came to us exactly…
-  A little to the left. Left.
- Girls.

446
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:36,031
…when you were about to do the lucky draw. Right?

447
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:37,951
Now, can you TAA?

448
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:42,011
Hmm, what do you want to say?

449
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:48,221
Let me ask you, did she give you a gift today?

450
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:51,421
Yeah.

451
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:53,341
That’s it!

452
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:56,411
I just hit a jackpot!

453
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:58,481
Can’t you see?

454
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:01,341
Exactly what I thought!

455
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:04,951
This means you didn’t get a gift from anyone but her.

456
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:08,321
So, we can only conclude that…

457
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,551
Kim.

458
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:10,441
Wants.

459
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:11,081
To.

460
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:12,011
Be.

461
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:13,001
Your girlfriend.

462
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:17,251
Wan.

463
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:18,931
Yes?

464
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:20,631
Are you done? What took you so long?

465
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:24,591
Oh, I’m just done.

466
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:25,521
Okay.

467
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,301
What’s wrong?

468
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:36,501
Mhm.

469
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,051
Do you like the gift that I gave you?

470
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:43,931
Mhm.

471
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:46,101
I like it.

472
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:48,831
So much.

473
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:51,731
Very much.

474
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,931
Happy Valentine’s Day then.

475
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:02,021
Yeah, happy Valentine’s Day to you too.

476
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:06,181
Let’s go home.

477
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:08,221
Okay.

478
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:10,371
Let’s go

479
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:32,231
I want to ask you something.

480
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,951
I shouldn’t have done that to Ae.

481
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:37,591
What did you do?

482
00:44:53,071 --> 00:45:00,031
My Marvellous Dream is You

483
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:07,730
My Marvellous Dream Is You

484
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,030
Hey, Samon.

485
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,460
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

486
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,730
Bye. Go home safe.

487
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,370
That’s it. Wan!

488
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,220
Hey…

489
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,700
I have to call Wan.

490
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,950
Wan!

491
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,930
Wan!

492
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,570
(Phone ringing)

493
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,140
Huh? Why is she calling?

494
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,060
(Phone ringing)

495
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,510
(Phone ringing)
Have you seen Wan? No?

496
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,750
(Panting)

497
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,640
(Panting)

498
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,640
(Panting)

499
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,820
Why did you call me?

500
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,220
Wan!

501
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,380
How long have you been here?

502
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,100
For a while now.

503
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,190
I saw you running around the building.

504
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,450
Jeez, you bitch.

505
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,590
Ouch.

506
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,610
Ouch.

507
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:18,980
Are you ready?

508
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,590
Yes.

509
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,360
Kim is in there.

510
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,590
I am ready

511
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,470
Are you really ready?

512
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,660
Umm, not so sure.

513
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:40,350
You have to, now. You liking her…

514
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,540
It is not strange at all.

515
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,660
- This is an all-girl school.
- Aha.

516
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,240
- Wherever we look, we can see only girls.
- Aha.

517
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,560
- Right? Okay?
- Okay.

518
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,160
Good.

519
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
- Um       /      - Let’s go.

520
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,120
Did you bring it?

521
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,810
- Yes.      /     - Good.

522
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,160
Give it to me.

523
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,490
Hurry.

524
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,140
Shoot! Where’s it?

525
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,660
Where?

526
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,980
Don’t tell me…

527
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,640
That you forgot?

528
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,880
Yes, I forgot.

529
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,920
You forgot?

530
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,650
Yes, I forgot!

531
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,330
Oh my gosh.

532
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,860
What to do now?

533
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:35,650
Stop!

534
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,650
Pull ourselves together.

535
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,150
- Okay, you hurry back and get it.
- Hurry back.

536
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,840
- I’ll go talk to her to buy you some time.
- Okay.

537
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,940
No matter what, you have to confess your feelings for her today.

538
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,520
- Confess to her.
- Okay?

539
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

540
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,100
Okay.

541
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,410
- Wan.     /     - Yeah?

542
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,060
Run!

543
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:58,680
Okay

544
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:07,030
Hi, Kim.

545
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:08,750
What are you doing?

546
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,100
What are you doing?

547
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:13,260
- Drawing.
- I see.

548
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,130
Can you draw me?

549
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,380
- Huh?
- I want a portrait of my own.

550
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,000
Can you draw it for me?

551
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,650
- Are you okay? You seem weird today.
- Yeah, I’m cool.

552
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:26,170
Ah.

553
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:40,130
[Heard the sound of mother kissing each other]

554
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,770
[Hey, where are you? Come here quick!]

555
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:49,940
[Kim is almost home.]

556
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,720
[You have to hurry up.]

557
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,550
[Or else it won’t be a surprise.]

558
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,170
( The sound of a sliding steel door.)

559
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,690
(Message in the box)
[Do you want to be my girlfriend?]

560
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,110
So, why didn’t you confess to her back then?

561
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:27,110
I was going to tell her how I felt.

562
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,410
But something unexpected happened.

563
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,450
So I couldn’t  tell her.

564
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,980
Was it about your dad?

565
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,200
No, it’s more than that.

566
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,930
After that day,

567
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,670
Mum and I decided to move away.

568
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,770
Then I…I just…

569
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:05,620
pretended to ignore the feelings I had for her.

570
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,180
(Sigh)

571
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,290
I don’t know what made you decide not to confess to her back then.

572
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,800
But it’s all in the past now.

573
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,890
Things might have changed.

574
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,840
You should tell her before you lose her to someone else.

575
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,730
But I…

576
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:29,590
Jeez, Wan! If this were a drama series, the audience would have felt so frustrated right now.

577
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,730
In the end, you took her back from Jessie to work for you.

578
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,510
And even took her to stay at your place.

579
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,930
If it were me, I would just be honest with her.

580
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,050
Then we can celebrate and everyone’s happy. That’s it.

581
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:44,990
(Sigh)

582
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:49,930
How can you keep all these secrets with you for so long?

583
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:52,710
Because I’m good at it.

584
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,610
Because you’re a jerk.

585
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,910
You have to confess to Kim.

586
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,350
This is your last chance.

587
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,080
One last chance.

588
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,570
Wan, this medicine is so good.

589
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,640
It makes me stop craving for alcohol.

590
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:04,240
I saw the news on TV today, about the award show that you went to.

591
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,100
You looked so beautiful.

592
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:16,430
Wan…are you all right, sweetie?

593
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,910
Why are you so quiet?

594
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,820
Mum.

595
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,990
I have something to ask you.

596
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,650
It’s about when we still lived in that house.

597
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,440
About the day I saw you kissing Miss Ae.

598
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,820
That was a long time ago, Wan.

599
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,610
Why are you asking me now?

600
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,470
Because I didn’t ask you then even though I was dying to know.

601
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,590
Why did you and Miss Ae do that?

602
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,610
(Crying)

603
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,430
(Crying)

604
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,020
(Crying)

605
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,950
I really can’t get it, Ae.

606
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,970
(Crying)
How could they do this to us?

607
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,290
(Crying)

608
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,330
(Crying)

609
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:42,780
From now on…

610
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,380
(Crying)
How could my daughter and I live…

611
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:52,960
(Crying)
…without him?

612
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,570
(Crying)

613
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,680
(Crying)

614
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,160
(Crying)

615
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,990
(Crying)

616
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,300
(Crying)

617
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,220
(Crying)

618
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,800
(Crying)

619
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,800
We have to focus on taking care of our kids right now.

620
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:42,630
(Crying)

621
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,880
(Crying)

622
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,230
(Crying)

623
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,070
(Crying)

624
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:59,370
(Crying)
I have no one left.

625
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,550
(Crying)
No one.

626
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,290
(Crying)

627
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,310
(Crying)

628
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:08,960
(Crying)

629
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,870
Let’s pull ourselves together, and face the truth.

630
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:15,730
(Crying)
We have to live for our kids.

631
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,660
(Crying)

632
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,820
(Crying)

633
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,850
(Crying)

634
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:30,660
(Crying)

635
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:08,310
I think…

636
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,790
I think you’re drunk.

637
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:23,570
Ae.

638
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,020
I’m so sorry.

639
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,830
I..

640
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:37,940
I think I’m going to move away and stay with my mother.

641
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,970
I don’t want to be surrounded by this environment.

642
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:46,660
(Sigh)

643
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:55,500
I’ll just…

644
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,100
I’ll just go…rest for a bit.

645
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:10,020
I’ll go home then. Kimhan should be home by now.

646
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,060
I don’t know too.

647
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,700
I don’t know why I did that.

648
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:44,380
I just know I was devastated your dad left us.

649
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:52,190
Ae and I tried to think of the reason…

650
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,800
the reason why they left us.

651
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,310
But the more I thought about it,

652
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,310
the more angry I got.

653
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,080
But Ae always consoled me.

654
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,090
She told me to try not to think about it.

655
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,290
And accept the truth.

656
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,330
But I didn’t want to do that.

657
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:21,240
I just let the anger took over me.

658
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,040
I was so confused back then.

659
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,330
That was why you decided to move out?

660
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,530
It was probably because…

661
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,720
I was so weak back then.

662
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:52,340
Every time I thought about…Pongpol and Tim being together,

663
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,580
how they had secretly get intimated…

664
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,100
under our own roof.

665
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,690
It made me do something bad to Ae.

666
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,230
But Ae told me…

667
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,100
that if they both didn’t really love each other,

668
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,570
they wouldn’t have done what they did to us.

669
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,230
Ae is so strong.

670
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,370
We had to go through the same tragedy.

671
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,980
But she was able to stand strong…

672
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,470
and told me to accept the truth and let it go.

673
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:36,310
I shouldn’t have done that to Ae. It was so terrible of me.

674
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,610
Not terrible, Mum.

675
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,840
You probably did that because…

676
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,020
you were weak and confused.

677
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,130
Because you were drunk.

678
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,130
It was probably like…

679
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,790
Like a dream.

680
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,360
Like a dream.

681
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,070
What dream?

682
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:07,440
A strange dream.

683
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,580
I’ve dreamt of Kim since very little.

684
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,870
Even until now.

685
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,490
What do you think is happening to me?

686
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,940
What does it mean?

687
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:32,850
(LINE Chat) Kimhan.
Today
Dawan: Kim…I have something to tell you.

688
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,930
Dawan: I’ve actually wanted to tell you long ago…

689
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:39,530
Dawan: Well…I…

690
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:44,930
Dawan: I’ll tell you at the celebration party tomorrow then.

691
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:49,970
Dawan: See you tomorrow.

692
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,880
Cheers

693
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,430
Yay!

694
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,490
Thank you so much, Pat.

695
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,330
For being a perfect imaginary boyfriend for Wan.

696
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,070
And thanks to you too, Minnie.

697
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,900
For coaching Wan in acting.

698
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:15,950
Wan.

699
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,240
In the next two weeks, the Hollywood team will fly here for the final audition.

700
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,900
Please do your best.

701
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,340
I’ll cheer for you.

702
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,580
Thank you, Coach.

703
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,470
And…congratulations.

704
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:35,960
About what?

705
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:37,960
Well…

706
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,820
Don’t tell me…

707
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,990
that Coach and Toon are…dating?

708
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:56,100
Aww, you’ve never mentioned about it before.

709
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,740
Come, let’s drink to that.

710
01:04:58,980 --> 01:04:59,520
Oh.

711
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,110
Come.

712
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:05,790
Toast to both of you for finally dating each other.

713
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:06,510
Oh, quit it.

714
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,580
You’re blushing.

715
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:12,440
Wan, are you waiting for someone?

716
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:16,250
I’ve asked Kim to come celebrate with us too.

717
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,040
She’s also a part of my success.

718
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,630
Kim, where are you?

719
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,180
I’m leaving the gallery.

720
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,770
I’ll wait for you in front of the restaurant then.

721
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:46,440
I’ll let you two enjoy your time alone together for a while.

722
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,850
I’ll be right back.

723
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:56,850
Here.

724
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,080
Aren’t you going to remove the shell for me?

725
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:01,430
I’ll do it.

726
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:33,080
- Wan, please come with me.
- Pat.

727
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,820
- Wan.
- What?

728
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,720
I need your help.

729
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,630
It’s a very important thing.

730
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,570
What is it?

731
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,270
Can you come with me?

732
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:42,370
This way.

733
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,550
What is it?

734
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:44,830
Over there.

735
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,300
What is it, Pat?

736
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,230
Surprise!

737
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,640
What are all these balloons for?

738
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,000
It’s for this…your gift.

739
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:01,750
Come and open it.

740
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,540
Yes, come and open it.

741
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,260
Open it.

742
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:15,990
What is it, Pat?

743
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:18,520
Yay!

744
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:24,970
Wan.

745
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:27,910
Look.

746
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,910
What do you want me to look?

747
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,350
Here

748
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,000
A blank paper?

749
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,520
- Pat.
- This one.

750
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,510
What are you trying to do?

751
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,960
Making a scene for the social media?

752
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,870
No, this is for real.

753
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:56,690
What?!

754
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,730
I aleady gave you the gift.

755
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,440
So, I won’t give it to you this time.

756
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:03,000
But I’ll ask for something instead.

757
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:05,350
What the heck, Pat?

758
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,040
I really like you.

759
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,080
Please be my girlfriend.

760
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:21,990
- Say yes!
- Say yes!

761
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,770
This is not what we have agreed with Toon.

Kimhan: I’m afraid I can’t go now. I’m not feeling well. Anyway…congratulations!

764
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,130
I’m going to confess my feelings to Kim.

765
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:08,680
Wan told me how you feel about me.

What’s up?

769
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:12,427
Guess where am I right now?

770
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:20,257
Where? In space, on Uranus? Or with avatars on Pandora?

771
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:21,317
You, ass…

772
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,377
I’m on my way to confess to Kim.

773
01:10:27,377 --> 01:10:32,287
Wait. You’re going to tell her you love her?

774
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:38,687
Yes, just like what you told me earlier. If I don’t do it now, I might lose her forever.

775
01:10:39,017 --> 01:10:42,037
Hey, gotta go. I’m almost at her place.

(Doorbell ringing)

777
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,087
Oh, please come in.

778
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:23,517
Wan is here to see you.

779
01:11:29,817 --> 01:11:30,837
Are you okay?

780
01:11:34,687 --> 01:11:36,487
Can you do me a favour?

781
01:11:44,877 --> 01:11:45,977
Umm…

782
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:51,997
I’m so sorry. Kim is sleeping right now. She’s probably exhausted from work.

783
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:57,217
Do you want me to tell her when she wakes up that you came by?

784
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:00,407
That’s all right. Thank you so much, Miss Ae.

785
01:12:04,357 --> 01:12:07,147
How’s your mother? Is she well?

786
01:12:07,807 --> 01:12:08,907
She’s fine.

787
01:12:09,587 --> 01:12:12,107
What about you? How are you?

788
01:12:13,457 --> 01:12:14,247
I’m good.

789
01:12:17,227 --> 01:12:20,637
She misses you.

790
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:33,057
I’d get going then, so you can get on with your work.

791
01:12:34,217 --> 01:12:35,587
Please excuse me.

792
01:12:35,827 --> 01:12:37,967
Okay. Let me walk you out.

793
01:12:58,157 --> 01:12:59,407
- Mum.
- Hmm?

794
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:00,637
Can I help?

795
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:01,957
Sure.

796
01:13:03,277 --> 01:13:07,287
I think it’s a little loose over here. We should take in half a centimeter on each side.

797
01:13:07,397 --> 01:13:08,027
Okay.

798
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:24,497
Thank you for lying for me, Mum.

799
01:13:27,477 --> 01:13:29,557
Why don’t you want to see her?

800
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,027
I’m tired.

801
01:13:36,347 --> 01:13:38,577
I just want to focus on my work and on you.

802
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:44,137
I still think you should go talk to her.

803
01:13:45,057 --> 01:13:51,467
No need, Mum. We’ll end up fighting anyway. It’s better this way.

804
01:14:07,407 --> 01:14:08,207
How’s it going?

805
01:14:16,697 --> 01:14:17,527
Well done.

01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:38,557

01:14:42,637 --> 01:14:44,477
Mali: Oh, I thought you guys already knew.

812
01:14:44,477 --> 01:14:46,437

01:14:46,437 --> 01:14:48,997
Samon: ?????

814
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:51,877
Mali: I called to ask her about her mother.

815
01:14:51,877 --> 01:14:55,597
Mali: That’s why I knew she got admitted.

816
01:14:55,597 --> 01:14:58,677
Samon: She never told us anything.

817
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:02,677
Mali: She probably didn’t want to bother us.

818
01:15:02,677 --> 01:15:04,877
Samon: But she’s our friend and she’s sick.

819
01:15:04,877 --> 01:15:06,997
Samon: It’s not a bother at all.

820
01:15:06,997 --> 01:15:09,237
Samon: Which hospital?

821
01:15:09,237 --> 01:15:12,677
Samon: Let’s take turns to visit her.

822
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:17,077
Mali: Okay. See you, Kim.

823
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:22,877
Samon: Wan, want to come with me?

824
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:29,877
Samon: No reply…That’s it.

01:15:35,317 --> 01:15:36,027

826
01:15:37,687 --> 01:15:38,787
Kim!

01:15:39,237 --> 01:15:42,687
Oh my goodness!

828
01:15:43,897 --> 01:15:44,807
Hello, Samon.

829
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:46,777
Oh, hello…Marwin?

830
01:15:47,147 --> 01:15:47,757
Yes.

831
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:48,767
Why are you here?

832
01:15:50,097 --> 01:15:51,257
To look after Kim.

833
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,907
Oh, I see.

834
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:00,997
What’s he doing here?

835
01:16:03,127 --> 01:16:04,027
What’s he doing here?

836
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:13,447
Where’s Mali and…

837
01:16:13,447 --> 01:16:16,957
Mali has to look after her baby.

838
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:21,847
Wan has a drama shooting. I’m here on behalf of them.

839
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:28,127
How are you feeling? Why did you have a nervous stomach all of a sudden?

840
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:32,257
I was worried the work might come out badly. So, I got stressed out.

841
01:16:32,657 --> 01:16:33,667
Are you sure?

842
01:16:34,207 --> 01:16:34,927
Mhm

843
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:37,157
Okay.

844
01:16:37,157 --> 01:16:38,017
(Phone buzzing)

845
01:16:38,697 --> 01:16:40,337
Please excuse me. I have to take this call.

846
01:16:41,257 --> 01:16:42,757
Okay.

847
01:16:42,877 --> 01:16:43,657
(Phone buzzing)

848
01:16:53,467 --> 01:16:55,667
Did you and Wan have a fight?

849
01:16:55,847 --> 01:17:00,307
Why didn’t you both answer me in our group chat? Did you guys fight?

850
01:17:01,937 --> 01:17:02,857
Forget it.

851
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:06,187
There, you guys really did fight.

852
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:11,667
In our gang, you two are closest to each other.

853
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,837
You should have been honest to each other and cleared it up.

854
01:17:16,057 --> 01:17:22,067
But let’s forget about that. Now I want to know what’s going on between you and Marwin.

855
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,067
So, what are you two?

856
01:17:24,297 --> 01:17:26,477
A boss and an employee.

857
01:17:27,617 --> 01:17:31,787
Bullshit. What kind of boss will come to look after you all day like this?

858
01:17:32,017 --> 01:17:32,947
What are you and him?

859
01:17:35,287 --> 01:17:36,847
A boss and an employee.

860
01:17:40,637 --> 01:17:41,637
Really?

861
01:17:42,847 --> 01:17:43,647
Yeah.

862
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:48,517
But I don’t think so. He probably wouldn’t care for his employee this much.

863
01:18:10,927 --> 01:18:17,967
Damn it, Wan. Is a phone just a morning alarm to you?

864
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:22,097
Oh, but I can talk to her via an app.

865
01:18:27,817 --> 01:18:34,197
Kim is sick because of you. You must come and clear it up with her fast!

866
01:18:34,387 --> 01:18:37,797
She’s like this because of you!

867
01:19:20,017 --> 01:19:21,047
Thank you so much.

868
01:19:22,077 --> 01:19:26,247
You just hired me, but I’ve already taken a long sick leave like this.

869
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:34,717
I rather think I’m very fortunate. Apart from opening a gallery, a hospital is surely another interesting business.

870
01:19:35,047 --> 01:19:38,657
I also know a lot of doctors and hospital owners.

871
01:19:39,387 --> 01:19:43,247
You can call off sick anytime you want. Think of it as our company’s welfare.

872
01:19:43,767 --> 01:19:51,357
We have hot news about the shipped couple who are a talk-of-the-town right now. Dawan, our rising female star of the year, …

873
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:57,117
…has just confirmed her relationship with Pat, a rising male star from the famous drama series.

874
01:19:57,117 --> 01:20:03,207
Their fans are so happy they’re making the hashtag #cutestcelebritycouple trending on every social media.

875
01:20:03,237 --> 01:20:09,967
Let’s support them and see whether this sparking romance would develop into something more lasting.

876
01:20:11,877 --> 01:20:13,767
Your best friend still hasn’t called?

877
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:21,147
I guess being a celebrity is not easy at all. You hardly have time for yourself.

878
01:20:22,927 --> 01:20:25,797
Or even to visit your best friend at the hospital.

879
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:32,637
So, does this mean they’re dating?

880
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:35,387
Even though she’s my best friend,

881
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:37,547
I don’t know everything about her.

882
01:20:39,707 --> 01:20:43,647
It’s her personal life. She can do whatever she wants.

883
01:20:46,697 --> 01:20:49,657
It’s late. You should go back home.

884
01:20:51,067 --> 01:20:52,587
By tomorrow, I’ll be able to walk out of here.

885
01:20:53,897 --> 01:20:56,837
I’ll work hard to compensate for those days I’ve taken off.

886
01:20:58,857 --> 01:21:01,807
What kind of boss gets shooed off by his own employee?

887
01:21:03,657 --> 01:21:04,997
Anyway, please rest.

888
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:10,867
I’ll wait for your answer when you’re fully recovered.

889
01:21:13,057 --> 01:21:16,037
Umm, I have something to ask you.

890
01:21:16,897 --> 01:21:21,907
Wan already told me how you feel, but…

891
01:21:22,217 --> 01:21:23,457
Please rest, Kim.

892
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:28,897
You’re not feeling well. You shouldn’t think about turning anyone down right now.

893
01:21:29,357 --> 01:21:33,387
You can give me your answer when you feel better.

894
01:21:35,127 --> 01:21:38,707
Thank you for being so kind to me.

895
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:42,027
My pleasure.

896
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,957
Rest well. I’d get going then.

897
01:22:19,497 --> 01:22:24,077
Yes, Mum. I have everything here taken care of. Please don’t worry.

898
01:22:25,677 --> 01:22:29,887
You have to give the groom and bride a run-through. I can get a cab home.

899
01:22:30,917 --> 01:22:32,037
See you at home.

01:22:33,197 --> 01:22:34,037
Yes.

901
01:22:46,607 --> 01:22:47,317
(Incoming message)

902
01:22:53,557 --> 01:22:58,437
[Reminder: Almost Wan’s audition date. Don’t forget to remind her.]

903
01:23:05,717 --> 01:23:08,677
Dawan

904
01:24:19,357 --> 01:24:20,197
[Heard Pat's voice from inside the room]

905
01:24:20,197 --> 01:24:21,677
Please don’t leave me.

906
01:24:40,957 --> 01:24:41,547
Kim

907
01:24:43,057 --> 01:24:44,547
When did you get out of the hospital?

908
01:24:45,307 --> 01:24:48,197
Umm…I’m sorry for interrupting.

909
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:52,407
I just want to grab my things here and go home.

910
01:25:04,937 --> 01:25:08,707
Wan, I’m moving out.

911
01:25:10,867 --> 01:25:11,557
Wait.

912
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,307
Why are you moving out?

913
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:18,887
In case you might want someone to move in and stay with you.

914
01:25:23,317 --> 01:25:28,237
Please don’t misunderstand us. It was nothing.

915
01:25:29,347 --> 01:25:33,627
I’m here to rehearse the script with her. We have an audition tomorrow.

916
01:25:36,547 --> 01:25:37,367
Here’s the script.

917
01:25:38,177 --> 01:25:47,997
Well, this is her place. She has the right to let anyone do anything here. Please feel free.

918
01:25:57,967 --> 01:26:00,137
Please excuse me then.

919
01:26:05,047 --> 01:26:07,577
I’m leaving. See you later, Dawan.

920
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:17,197
Do you want to move out that much?

921
01:26:18,537 --> 01:26:22,207
Are you moving out to stay with someone else who’s not your mum?

922
01:26:25,767 --> 01:26:30,337
Are you here to pack all your things and move in with Marwin?

923
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:39,507
What on earth are you talking about?

924
01:26:40,037 --> 01:26:42,517
I saw him stay by your bedside at the hospital every night.

925
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,827
He was glued to you no man can even get close.

926
01:26:46,347 --> 01:26:49,197
Why did he have to care for you that much?

927
01:26:50,897 --> 01:26:52,087
Did you sleep with him already?

928
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:02,937
Tell me, Kim! Have you slept with him?

929
01:27:03,987 --> 01:27:05,317
Answer me, Kim!

930
01:27:06,407 --> 01:27:08,117
Stop insulting me.

931
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:14,207
Whether I’d sleep with him or anyone, it’s none of your business.

932
01:27:15,957 --> 01:27:17,267
Stop bothering me.

933
01:27:32,157 --> 01:27:33,177
You can’t go!

934
01:27:34,797 --> 01:27:39,057
You have to stay with me. Go and tell him you’ll quit working for him.

935
01:27:39,567 --> 01:27:43,927
Tell him you’d come back to work with me. So that we won’t have to fight because of someone else again.

936
01:27:46,537 --> 01:27:51,237
But your career is ruined because we stay close to each other.

937
01:27:53,647 --> 01:27:54,957
We’ve talked about this.

938
01:27:57,617 --> 01:27:59,717
- We’ve talked about this.
- I don’t care.

939
01:28:00,477 --> 01:28:02,647
But I can’t go back to you.

940
01:28:07,957 --> 01:28:09,637
Marwin said he likes me.

941
01:28:14,137 --> 01:28:15,757
And I like him too.

942
01:29:13,397 --> 01:29:14,617
Are you jealous?

943
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:16,257
Yes.

944
01:29:17,927 --> 01:29:18,877
Why? What is she to you?

945
01:29:20,557 --> 01:29:24,047
Excuse me, are you Dawan?

946
01:29:24,087 --> 01:29:28,077
Does the shooting set agree to postpone the date for Wan?

947
01:29:29,187 --> 01:29:33,387
How’s the relationship between you and Marwin?

948
01:29:34,357 --> 01:29:36,457
Do you really want me to have a boyfriend?

949
01:29:37,777 --> 01:29:38,677
Of course.

950
01:29:48,317 --> 01:29:50,337
Mum, Wan disappeared.

951
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:53,377
Wan! Open the door! Wan!

952
01:30:06,197 --> 01:30:12,727
🎵All I can do is saying ‘I love you’ during the night🎵

953
01:30:13,297 --> 01:30:19,427
🎵Holding you tight until we’d meet again🎵

954
01:30:19,577 --> 01:30:26,237
🎵Counting down to the day we’d meet🎵

955
01:30:26,667 --> 01:30:33,357
🎵Missing those time we spent together🎵

956
01:30:34,047 --> 01:30:42,937
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream. The dream that can never…🎵

957
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:46,167
🎵…come true.🎵

958
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:49,477
🎵I want to cherish all the moments…🎵

959
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:52,877
🎵And memorise every second…🎵

960
01:30:52,877 --> 01:31:01,877
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say love you in real life🎵

961
