1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:04,274
Wan, you’re trending on Twitter right now.

2
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:07,748
Who released the clip?

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:09,828
Jessie.

4
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:13,885
It’s tiring to keep putting on an act all the time.

5
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,354
But it’s the only way out for you.

6
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:21,622
It’s our first time hanging out together and you have to witness all this. I’m sorry.

7
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:23,131
Remember what I told you earlier?

8
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:28,860
We’re here to ask Pam and Dokrak a favour, so try not to get moody and upset Pam.

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,097
It’s been a long time since we last went to the beach together.

10
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:32,480
I’ll book a hotel now.

11
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:41,531
Wan.

12
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,240
(Door knocking)

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,131
Wan.

14
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,622
Wan.

15
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:54,822
I’m in here, Kim.

16
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:59,154
Are you done? We have to check in by noon.

17
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:02,091
Kim, I can’t go with you.

18
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:03,085
Huh? Why?

19
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:07,485
Toon just called. She said the management wants to talk to me and Pat about a work project.

20
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,228
What should I be wearing? Please help me pick one.

21
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:18,228
It’s a good news then.

22
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:22,902
You’re getting more work because people are shipping you with Pat.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,708
Let’s go with…

24
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:27,542
this one then.

25
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:39,360
Aren’t you mad that I couldn’t go with you?

26
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:43,360
You go get ready for work.

27
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,148
I can go alone.

28
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,531
We already paid for the room. That’s a lot of money.

29
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,377
Wear this watch and this ring, okay?

30
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,508
How are you going to go there?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,931
When you’re at work, I often hang out alone anyway.

32
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,382
Don’t feel guilty about it.

33
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:12,320
You can join me after you’re done with your work.

34
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:19,840
Okay, I’ll go see you right away after the meeting.

35
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay.

36
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,765
Go get dressed now or you’ll be late.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,497
Okay.

38
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,160
(Phone ringing)

39
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:32,068
(Phone ringing)

40
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,348
(Phone ringing)

41
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:35,154
Hello, Toon.

42
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:39,062
I’m getting dressed. I won’t be late.

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,931
I know. See you.

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,725
Kim.

45
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,628
Why don’t you just wait here first?  We can go together after the meeting.

46
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,040
When will you finish?

47
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:40,011
No idea. It’s up to the management.

48
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:45,931
If I have to wait for you, we might both wouldn’t make it there.

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,954
You go on to the meeting. It’s almost time.

50
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,497
You can follow after the meeting is done.

51
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:52,605
I’ll get going then.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

67
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,700
MALI MOLI: Jeez, how can my baby finish all this milk?! It keeps leaking!
WAN DAWAN: Done talking with the management. It went well. Thank you everyone for your support. Don’t forget to have lunch!

68
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:38,860
NAMAMI.CATCUTE: Is it cute, everyone?

69
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,820
Trend Update: What styles are currently trending and being updated together?

70
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,100
Manudngenduean: Recently, I'm really into entertainment news.
Chaeleak: Hot News! Jessie is so fierce today. Can’t believe she’d say that during the interview. Get ready if you’re in for a gossip.

71
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,420
Samorn mornnn: Very upset, wanting someone to take care of.
Dokrak: I miss Dr. Pam the most. I can't wait for Saturday and Sunday to come.

72
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,940
Chaeleak: Hot News! Jessie is so fierce today. Can’t believe she’d say that during the interview. Get ready if you’re in for a gossip.

73
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:48,137
I saw the news about Dawan stealing back her personal stylist from me.

74
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:51,714
To be honest, I’m still in shock right now.

75
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,828
I still can’t get used to it.

76
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:58,662
I never thought Dawan would be this selfish.

77
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:04,297
Did she do that because I took her close friend from her first?

78
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,605
Well, that’s possible. Or she might see me as her rival.

79
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:12,340
As you already know, we are both casting for the Hollywood role.

80
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:15,474
Do you want to say anything to your rival then?

81
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:20,537
Please be more considerate in whatever you do.

82
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:22,822
And please try to me more polite with me.

83
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:26,502
I know she’s probably stressed out right now but…

84
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:39,702
(Phone ringing)

85
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:40,960
(Phone ringing)

86
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:42,651
(Phone ringing)

87
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:44,685
Kim.

88
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,828
Hey, Wan.

89
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,965
What’s with that face?

90
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,748
Jessie just called but I didn’t take it.

91
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:55,542
That’s good. Don’t answer her call and just ignore her.

92
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,502
Mhm

93
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,937
Are you done with the meeting?

94
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:02,708
Toon wants me to have lunch with Pat. What are you doing?

95
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,137
I’m done checking in. Now strolling on the beach.

96
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:08,274
Here, can you see it?

97
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:15,120
Wow! Looks so nice. I’ll try to ditch Toon and go there right after this.

98
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:16,228
Okay.

99
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:18,434
See you.

100
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,200
Wan.

101
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,548
Have a seat, everyone.

102
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:45,542
Let’s start then, shall we?

103
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,051
Yes.

104
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:49,680
I can order more if you need anything.

105
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,577
- Oh, thank you.
- Go on.

106
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:53,645
Wan.

107
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:08,540
Wan.

108
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:09,691
Are you hungry?

109
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:11,725
Yeah.

110
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:14,194
Do you want anything more?

111
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,028
That’s all right.

112
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:24,205
About the drama that I’ve just discussed with Miss Praiya, are you two interested?

113
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:28,537
I am. And it’ll be great if my co-star is Wan.

114
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:32,422
So that more people will be shipping us as a couple. Right?

115
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:36,754
Well, Miss Praiya’s agency is very reliable anyway.

116
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:39,222
If you can take care of it, then I have no problem.

117
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Good.

118
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,520
And one more thing.

119
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,200
Her agency will have a merit-making event tomorrow.

120
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,777
She wants you both to attend too.

121
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,331
But I have to…

122
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,822
Hey, you must go.

123
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:58,000
All the management executives will also be there.

124
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,571
If you want to stay in this industry for long, you’d better start building connections.

125
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:06,571
Also, you’re still young. Being there would show that you respect them.

126
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,765
Trust me, you should go.

127
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,740
Kimhan: Hurry up and join me, Wan. The sea is so beautiful.

128
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:44,594
Can I take a picture with you?

129
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:47,268
I’ll just go say hi to my friends first. I’ll be right back, okay?

130
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,862
Okay.

131
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,620
- Hello, Toon.
- Hi.

132
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:51,588
Hi, Pat.

133
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,200
Hi, Wan.

134
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,971
Can I sit with you?

135
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:58,582
Please have a seat.

136
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:03,600
What a coincidence.

137
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,040
It’s not an acting class but we still bump into one another like this.

138
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,428
I’m full. Let’s go.

139
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,440
Oh, hold on.

140
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,131
Are you in a hurry?

141
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:17,542
I’ll let you in on a little secret about the Hollywood project.

142
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:20,960
So that you’d be prepared beforehand.

143
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,148
What secret?

144
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,691
I just happened to know that my cousin in the US is a friend of the director of this project.

145
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:36,834
So?

146
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:41,268
I’m telling you this because I want you to be prepared for the result.

147
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:43,600
You need a lot of connections to survive in this industry.

148
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,702
The more people you know, the more chances of work you’d get.

149
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:53,330
But if you’d consider being nice to me,

150
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,617
then I might be able to talk to the director to give you a small role in this project.

151
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,811
Come, let’s try it.

152
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,365
Try begging me.

153
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,714
No need. If I had to be nice to you,

154
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,765
I’d rather quit being an actress.

155
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:11,474
They are all professionals. I’m sure they won’t just choose anyone because of the connection.

156
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:14,525
They’re more likely to choose someone because of their abilities. Am I right, Toon?

157
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:16,822
Don’t worry, Wan.

158
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,474
Oh, I’m not worried.

159
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:24,050
But you are, aren’t you?

160
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:28,388
That’s why you’re trying to bluff me with your nonsense.

161
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:35,725
Jessie, I think it’s best for you two to stay away from each other. What you said earlier…

162
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:37,897
I don’t think it’d benefit you.

163
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,600
It’ll only make you look worse.

164
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:52,628
Enjoy your meal then.

165
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:54,697
I won’t bother you any longer.

166
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,331
- Let’s continue, shall we?
- Yeah

167
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,377
Wan, let’s eat.

168
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,817
I’m leaving.

169
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,320
See you at the event tomorrow.

170
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,502
- See you.
- See you.

171
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:25,005
Wan, are you okay?

172
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:26,251
Yeah.

173
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:28,510
Well, see you tomorrow then.

174
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:32,548
Wan.

175

(Phone ringing)

179
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:05,645
Hey, Wan. Are you on your way? Drive safely, okay?

180
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:08,914
Kim, I can’t go.

181
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:13,737
I have an important event that I must attend tomorrow.

182
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
I’m so sorry.

183
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:19,600
Do you want to come back? So that you won’t have to be there alone.

184
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:22,662
I think I’ll stay.

185
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:26,354
Do you want me to give you a wake-up call tomorrow?

186
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:27,725
Don’t worry.

187
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,817
I’ll go sleep at Mum’s home tonight.

188
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,697
It’s close to the event venue. I’ll ask Mum to wake me up.

189
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:36,102
Can you give me another chance?

190
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,742
Let’s go abroad next time, shall we?

191
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:42,880
Easy there.

192
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,577
Let’s just make the domestic trip happen first.

193
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:47,570
Go home safely.

194
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:30,400
Kim, you should get yourself a boyfriend.

195
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:33,497
Where are you going?

196
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,788
Huahin, Mum. I’ll be right back.

200
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:39,057
Hey!

201
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:40,188
Hey!

202
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,714
Excuse me!

203
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:50,051
Over here!

204
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,043
Did you get hurt?

205
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,988
Oh, it’s not mine. I don’t know whose it is.

206
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:09,148
I mean…did you get hurt because of my drone?

207
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,045
No.

208
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:13,068
I’ll be right there.

209
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:45,605
Is it okay? Did I break it?

210
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:49,788
Just a little technical malfunction. Shouldn’t be a big problem.

211
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,737
I’m really sorry about earlier.

212
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,491
My drone might have gone too close that it made you startled.

213
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:57,876
That’s all right.

214
00:18:01,943 --> 00:18:02,929
Wow.

215
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:06,634
You’re quite good at this.

216
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,605
You’re using a wet on wet technique too.

217
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,263
Do you like watercolour painting?

218
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,983
Umm…yes.

219
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,560
So…do you also like to paint?

220
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:23,228
Well, I own a gallery so I just know some technical terms in painting.

221
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:26,863
Please come by when you’re free.

222
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,120
I won’t bother you then.

223
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:33,880
Please get on with your painting.

224
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:35,983
Okay.

225
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:38,771
I’m really sorry again.

226
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,045
For flying a drone and…

227
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:42,623
startled you.

228
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:48,143
Okay.

229
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,337
Enough.

230
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,171
One more.

231
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:02,497
- That’s enough.

Hey, Kim. What’s up?

239
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:23,000
Hmm, are you lonely? Is that why you called me?

240
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,565
Yeah.

241
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:28,188
I called Wan but she didn’t pick up.
I guess she must be sleeping.

242
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,188
Are you busy?

243
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,314
Well, kind of.

244
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,388
I’m making another baby.

245
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:38,931
But the baby still didn’t get a chance because you just interrupted.

246
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:40,531
Hi, Kim.

247
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,228
Well, sorry to interrupt.

248
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,011
I’m hanging up then.

249
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,125
Neh, it’s all right. We can talk.

250
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:48,943
My hubby is easy to turn on.

251
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,708
Kim, I really think you should get yourself a boyfriend.

252
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:58,314
You can’t just keep waiting for Wan and have everything in your life revolve around her.

253
00:19:58,428 --> 00:19:59,603
Get a boyfriend.

254
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:05,137
And look what happened? Now that she’s busy, you have to go alone again.

255
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,788
Yeah, but I’m used to it.

256
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:11,057
Kim, you can’t get used to this kind of thing.

257
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:15,720
What if one day Wan decides to date her co-star that she’s shipped with?

258
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:17,091
What will happen to you then?

259
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:18,840
I think you’d better get yourself a boyfriend.

260
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:23,583
Starting from tonight, go on a hunt and take him back to your room.

261
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:27,045
Are you mad? I’m not that kind of girl.

262
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:29,823
I’m going to hang up.

263
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:33,491
Not gonna bother you anymore. Go and make another baby.

264
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,783
Well, if there’s anything, just give me a call, okay? Bye!

265
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,925
Hey, babe.

266
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:03,663
Where are you going?

267
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,920
Huahin. I’ll be right back, Mum.

268
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:10,668
Hmm, you said it like you were just going to a grocery store nearby.

269
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:14,543
It’s late. Driving a long distance at this hour is very dangerous.

270
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,571
It’s not that far. I’ll get there in a jiff.

271
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:20,634
Get to the hospital, you mean.

272
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:27,045
If anything happens to you,
your dream to become a Hollywood star will also fly out of the window.

273
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:34,040
And the reason you didn’t go to the beach with Kim is because you really had to work.

274
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:37,057
I think Kim would understand.

275
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,634
I don’t want to break my promise.

276
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:51,525
You’re just like me when I was younger.

277
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:54,451
Hot-headed.

278
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,480
You’ll do anything you want to do.

279
00:21:58,463 --> 00:22:01,091
My mother told me to go study abroad.

280
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,834
But I chose to stay and go on a date with your dad instead.

281
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,143
Then I got pregnant.

282
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,223
So, we had to get married.

283
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:18,005
But in the end…

284
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,337
it didn’t turn out well.

285
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:28,543
I don’t want you to end up like me.

286
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:45,320
Mum!

287
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,028
I think you should stop drinking.

288
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:53,388
Hmm…I will, after I finish this bottle.

289
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:56,268
Come pour me a glass.

290
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:25,731
Same order.

291
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:38,748
Does that lady come alone?

292
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:39,811
Yes.

293
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:47,434
Excuse me?

294
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:49,388
Are you here alone?

295
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,611
Oh, Mr. Drone.

296
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,251
I’m Marwin.

297
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:59,091
- The one who flew a drone and startled you.
- I’m Kimhan.

298
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:00,988
You can call me Kim.

299
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:02,874
Am I interrupting something?

300
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:04,828
Can I sit with you?

301
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,925
Sure.

302
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:07,880
I came alone.

303
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
It’s good to have some company.

304
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:17,891
Well then, can I have the honour to buy you a drink tonight?

305
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,983
Aww, it’s all right.

306
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:24,611
Please. Think of it as a test for my new bartender.

307
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh, do you own this place?

308
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:30,474
Yes.

309
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:34,554
I thought you own an art gallery.

310
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:39,045
Oh, that’s another business I’m looking after.

311
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:41,043
Please wait a moment.

312
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,411
Hey, give me one strawberry margarita.

313
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:23,468
You can’t even walk straight. Are you drunk?

314
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:25,548
Just a bit.

315
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:32,520
I saw your painting this morning. It was really good.

316
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:34,063
Are you an artist?

317
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:35,754
No.

318
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,240
I’m a personal stylist for an actress.

319
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:39,937
Ahh.

320
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:43,091
Painting is just a hobby that I like.

321
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:46,920
So, what kind of painting do you usually do?

322
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,245
Can you do a portrait painting for me?

323
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,783
I’m not quite good at that.

324
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:56,337
But…I used to do it once for someone.

325
00:25:57,788 --> 00:25:58,588
Who is it?

326
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:00,583
Is he your boyfriend?

327
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:02,634
Just a friend.

328
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:10,623
Well then, can I buy the painting you did today?

329
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,074
Sure.

330
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:17,605
But…can you please finish painting it after this?

331
00:26:18,474 --> 00:26:20,977
It’s not done yet so I’m afraid I can’t sell it for now.

332
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:25,045
No worry, you can sell it to me once it’s done.

333
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:31,731
Anyway…why are you so interested in my painting?

334
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:35,183
Well, I’m a collector.

335
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,543
Wherever I go, if I come across a beautiful artwork, I always want to buy it for my collection.

336
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:43,594
Especially for the painting. It’s my favourite.

337
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:48,017
Where do you usually sell your paintings?

338
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:49,754
I don’t.

339
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,440
I just keep them at home.

340
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:58,394
Oh, don’t you want to sell them or have them displayed at the gallery?

341
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:04,120
I’m sure many people would be interested to buy paintings done by a talented artist like you.

342
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:07,103
Oh…I do.

343
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:11,628
It has always been my dream to have my own gallery.

344
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:14,405
But…that’s for later.

345
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,645
Right now, I want to help make my friend’s dream come true first.

346
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:25,354
This friend of yours must mean a lot to you.

347
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:27,480
A lot indeed.

348
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,965
Here we are.

349
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:33,560
Thank you for walking me here.

350
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:35,765
I’ll go up to my room now.

351
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:39,354
If you need anything, please feel free to call me.

352
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,434
Or you can tell my staff.

353
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,771
Okay.

354
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,005
Oh, and one more thing.

355
00:27:47,685 --> 00:27:50,245
Please don’t forget to give your rating for our hotel.

356
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,280
See you later.

357
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,965
Kim.

358
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:56,028
Yes?

359
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,468
Oh.

360
00:27:58,063 --> 00:27:58,965
I’m sorry.

361
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:00,543
Thank you.

362
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,783
Good night.

- Kim, I can’t go with you.

375
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,834
- (Incoming call / Phone buzzing)
- Something urgent came up.

376
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:16,851
Toon said the management wants to do a project with me and Pat.

377
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,577
That’s a good news then.

378
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,643
You’re getting more work because people are shipping you with Pat.

379
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,868
I can hang out alone.

380
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:35,708
When you’re at work, I often hang out alone anyway.

381
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:39,788
Next time, let’s go abroad.

382
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,628
Take it easy, Wan. Let’s make a domestic trip happen first.

383
00:29:44,337 --> 00:29:45,623
Go home safe.

384
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:54,954
Kim.

385
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,325
Kim.

386
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:58,360
Kim.

387
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:03,388
(Fireworks)

388
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:10,603
(Fireworks)

389
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:12,683
[Sorry]

390
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:20,188
Kim.

391
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:21,708
Kim.

392
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,754
Kim!

393
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:29,663
I’m sorry.

394
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:31,777
You don’t have to say sorry.

395
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,200
If you’re still going to do the same.

396
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:37,640
Kim.

397
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,153
Kim!

398
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:44,485
Kim

399
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:46,483
You don’t have to say sorry.

400
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:48,074
- If you’re still going to do the same.
- Kim!

401
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,897
If you’re still going to do the same.

402
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:52,120
- You don’t have to say sorry.
- Kim!

403
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:52,897
Kim!

404
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:54,863
Wan.

405
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:56,463
(Knocking on the car window)

406
00:30:58,965 --> 00:30:59,754
Wan!

407
00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:02,257
(Knocking on the car window)

408
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,943
Dawan!

409
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:06,177
(Knocking on the car window)

410
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,937
It’s about to start. Let’s go.

411
00:31:10,363 --> 00:31:11,023
Okay.

412
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:13,240
(Incoming call / Phone buzzing)

413
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:15,034
Hello?

414
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:18,703
Yes, I’m right here.

415
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:20,337
At the car park.

416
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:24,177
- I’ve already parked my car.
- Dokrak!

417
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,771
- Hey, Toon. Hello.
- Hello.

418
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:28,508
Come, come.

419
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:34,348
Wan, this is a dress for the merit making event.

420
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,228
Kim sent me details last night. It’s exactly this dress.

421
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:38,725
Here it is.

422
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,885
Wow! It’s gorgeous.

423
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:43,617
So finicky. No this, no that.

424
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:45,628
This fabric makes you itchy.

425
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,663
That one makes you look fat.

426
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:50,017
The dress must be at an ankle length because of the bruise on your leg.

427
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:51,148
So finicky!

428
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,348
Umm…

429
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:55,777
Well, Kim is very caring when it comes to anything about you.

430
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:57,560
Her brief was so detailed.

431
00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:59,034
- Hey.    /    - Yes?

432
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:01,491
Let’s show her the dress that she has to wear to the award show.

433
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:03,983
Oh, okay. Can I have the iPad, Babe?

434
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:08,828
I’ve prepared a lot of choices for you. Please take a look.

435
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:11,114
Not this one.

436
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:12,348
Can’t wear this.

437
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:13,560
Not this.

438
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,148
These 3 are okay.

439
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:17,125
Can I try them on first?

440
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:19,434
Okay.

441
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:25,823
So…after we’re done with this, let’s go to Dokrak’s studio.

442
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:27,160
Are you okay with that?

443
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,843
- Yes.      /      - No.

444
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:29,937
You have to.

445
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:35,160
Well, let’s get going then.

446
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,754
- I’ll see you later, okay?
- Yes, I’ll get everything ready.

447
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:39,753
Bye.

448
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,948
Babe.

449
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:46,245
Babe.

450
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:48,794
- Yes?
- It’s my day off. Does it really have to be this much?

451
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:53,023
Hmm…think of it as helping Kim, okay?

452
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:55,994
Please.

453
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,245
Let’s have dinner together after it’s done.

454
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:00,325
Let’s order dessert too.

455
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,257
Please.

456
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:03,514
Please.

457
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,163
I’ll let you kiss me as a reward.

458
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:16,794
Come, let’s get in the car. The air con might help cool you down.

459
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:23,263
If you’re going to have it fixed this much, wouldn’t it be easier to change the model?

460
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:27,251
Can you come back soon? Dokrak really can’t understand what I want.

461
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:28,668
I’ll drive you there.

462
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:29,800
Aren’t you in a hurry?

463
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:51,963

464
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:59,052
My Marvellous Dream Is You

465
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,380
What did you do with the sleeve?

466
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:08,117
It’s still not properly done.

467
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:10,494
And isn’t it too exposing around the bosom?

468
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,329
Why is it not done yet? How can I try it on then?

469
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:15,523
The design you want is quite hard to make. I’ll…

470
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:18,300
Isn’t that your job to figure it out? How will I know what it’d like on me?

471
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:21,512
I’ll try to fix it for you.

472
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:24,826
If you’re going to have it fixed this much, wouldn’t it be easier to change the model?

473
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,043
Umm, Babe.

474
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,723
It’s okay, Babe. I can do it.

475
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:32,722
You can do it, right?

476
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:35,146
Then hurry up.

477
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:43,100
The award show is in two days.

478
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:46,094
If you keep complaining, she won’t be able to make it in time.

479
00:34:46,677 --> 00:34:47,420
(Sigh)

480
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:53,786
Or do you want to try on another dress? That one is quite beautiful too.

481
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,386
No.

482
00:34:56,814 --> 00:34:59,809
If it were Kim, she’d have had it done a long time ago.

483
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,746
That’s because she was always pulling an all-nighter to work for you.

484
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:07,854
I only want to wear the dress that Kim designs for me.

485
00:35:09,694 --> 00:35:11,534
Then why do you keep having it fixed?

486
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,289
So that it’ll be perfect.

487
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,712
But Dokrak has to waste her time fixing your dress.

488
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,529
Usually on my day off, Dokrak and I would go out together.

489
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:25,992
You’re such a nuisance.

490
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,277
But that’s her job as a stylist.

491
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:29,877
But she’s also human.

492
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:32,872
Umm, I’ll take care of it.

493
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:34,003
Don’t worry, okay?

494
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,106
Please calm down. I’ll take care of it. Right, Toon?

495
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,232
- I can fix it. Don’t worry.
- Sorry to bother you.

496
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:42,883
Come, let’s go see the dress.

497
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:45,637
Come on, please come and help me.

498
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:46,677
(Sigh)

499
00:35:47,432 --> 00:35:48,792
I have to go now.

500
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:51,557
There’s a problem at Tack’s advert shooting.

501
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,683
What’s wrong?

502
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:58,300
Tack can’t pronounce the name of the brand properly.

503
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,020
They have to reshoot it. I have to go clear this up.

504
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,786
I’ll go get some air then.

505
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,232
Check out, please.

506
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:15,306
Good morning.

507
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:17,443
- Please wait a moment while our maid is checking your room.
- Okay.

508
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,477
Can I also have a glass of water, please?

509
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,266
Yes, ma’am. Please have a seat first.

510
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,334
(Sigh)

511
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,483
(Sigh)

512
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:37,420
- Here’s your water.
- Thank you.

00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:07,032
Hey, Wan.

518
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:09,706
Finally, Kim.

519
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,037
Can you come back soon?

520
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,906
Dokrak really can’t understand what I really want.

521
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:16,952
Can you come back and help her?

522
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,974
Okay, I’ll be there soon.

523
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:25,272
Are you all right?

524
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:26,872
Just a hangover.

525
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:31,877
You didn’t pick up my call last night because you went out drinking?

526
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,603
Yeah, I left my phone at home.

527
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:37,820
Whom did you go with?

528
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:39,969
Friends.

529
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,592
Oh, Mon and Mali were there too?

530
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:45,786
No, a new friend.

531
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,312
I have to hang up now.

532
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:53,009
I’ll go help you with the dress once I’m back.

533
00:37:57,877 --> 00:37:59,934
Excuse me? Is everything okay?

534
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:01,443
Yes, ma’am.

535
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,317
Thank you for your visit. We hope to see you again.

536
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:27,660
Ouch.

537
00:38:36,506 --> 00:38:38,780
Please give me your keys. I’ll drive for you.

538
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:39,820
Huh?

539
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:41,832
Your car keys. Aren’t you in a hurry?

540
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,969
You can’t drive like this.

541
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,146
Hurry up.

542
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:47,820
But…

543
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,689
I’ll pay for the petrol fee.

544
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,603
Oh, it’s an EV car.

545
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:56,952
Yes.

546
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:59,772
Well…

547
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:02,689
Aren’t you in a hurry?

548
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:07,054
What if you get into an accident because you still have a hangover?

549
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,786
That would only delay you more.

550
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:10,997
Keys, please.

551
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:13,957
Umm.

552
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:19,214
Okay.

553
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:21,443
Please get in.

554
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,792
Actually, I can drive.

555
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,672
Hurry up or else you’ll be late.

556
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:30,860
It’s all right. I can drive.

557
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:32,460
Fine then.

558
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:38,243
If you don’t want to,

559
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:40,586
I’ll go first.

560
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,717
Okay.

561
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:47,637
You can drive faster.

562
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:51,020
If you want me to go faster,

563
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:52,860
I guess I’ll have to swap your car with a Jet plane.

564
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,300
Why are you in a rush? Is this job really important?

565
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:58,380
A little.

566
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:01,032
I have to go fix something for my friend.

567
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:03,363
I don’t think it’s a little.

568
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:05,362
You look impatient.

569
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,066
Are you usually like this?

570
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,637
Is this friend the one you mentioned about last night?

571
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:12,494
This person must be so important to you.

572
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,980
You even throw away 2 more nights at the beach and go back earlier.

573
00:40:16,392 --> 00:40:19,260
Yes, we’re so close.

574
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:21,500
We’ve been through a lot together.

575
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:24,003
This person means a lot to me.

576
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:33,740
Hey, I’m on my way. Almost there now.

577
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:36,323
Just hang on.

578
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:38,322
I’ll be there soon.

579
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:41,500
Who is it?

580
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,043
Easy there.

581
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:45,272
- Tim.
- Hey.

582
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:48,037
- Here, let me help.
- Okay.

583
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:53,557
(Pencil case falling)

584
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:03,077
You dropped this.

585
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:08,300
Ouch.

586
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,614
Hey, new kid. Try to do better.

587
00:41:13,374 --> 00:41:14,712
I’m Dawan.

588
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:15,854
What’s your name?

589
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:53,260
Mon. Wan. I was on duty this afternoon and I met that new kid.

590
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:03,866
Hey, new kid. Are you also like this when you’re home?

591
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,477
Hey, did you hear what I said?

592
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:12,163
But that day when you called me, I really didn’t lock her up.

593
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:14,162
I just hid her bag.

594
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:30,712
(Door opening)

595
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:35,432
(Crying)

596
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:37,306
(Crying)

597
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:47,500
(Kicking on the door)

598
00:42:47,492 --> 00:42:48,277
Hello?

599
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,289
Hello?

600
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:52,803
Hello?

601
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,454
(Crying)

602
00:42:58,929 --> 00:42:59,580
Hello?

603
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:04,049
(Crying)

604
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:06,186
(Crying)

605
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:08,666
(Crying)

606
00:43:08,662 --> 00:43:09,454
Hey.

607
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:12,414
(Crying)

608
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:15,123
(Crying)

609
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:15,900
Hey.

610
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:22,003
I heard that the new kid, Kimhan, hardly talks because she has depression.

611
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:26,803
(Crying)

612
00:43:29,032 --> 00:43:29,706
(Crying)

613
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,443
(Crying)

614
00:43:51,717 --> 00:43:53,466
(Crying)

615
00:43:55,214 --> 00:43:56,712
(Crying)

616
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:18,700
And do you know why…

617
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:20,129
- Why?
- she is depressed?

618
00:44:20,654 --> 00:44:22,700
(Crying)

619
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:26,723
(Crying)

620
00:44:26,722 --> 00:44:32,803
(Crying)
Why?! Don’t go. Please come back.

621
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:41,672
- It’s because…
- Mali.

622
00:44:41,672 --> 00:44:43,352
- Her dad ran away with a guy next door.
- What are you talking about?

623
00:44:43,649 --> 00:44:45,523
Wan, it’s good that you’re here.

624
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,512
Do you know Kim’s dad is gay?

625
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:49,157
He ran away with a guy next door.

626
00:44:51,134 --> 00:44:53,032
Hey, why don’t you get changed?

627
00:44:54,323 --> 00:44:55,660
I don’t know how.

628
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:57,946
Why are you standing like a fool here then?

629
00:44:58,403 --> 00:45:01,123
Go and ask your friend to help you.

630
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:03,877
Why don’t you help her?

631
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,169
She doesn’t know how to do it.

632
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,654
Why did you have to call her a fool?

633
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:12,689
If we’re already smart, why on earth would we come to school?

634
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,117
Let’s go, Kimhan.

635
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:15,557
You, son of a bitch.

636
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:21,043
Did you really call my daughter like that?

637
00:45:21,454 --> 00:45:23,534
You are a teacher.

638
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:25,843
How can you say something like that to a child?

639
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:27,569
These kids have no manners.

640
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:29,489
Neither do you.

641
00:45:29,546 --> 00:45:31,683
See that? You have such ill manners.

642
00:45:31,682 --> 00:45:33,112
Haven’t your parents taught you anything?

643
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,232
Is that why you behave so badly like this?!

644
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,020
(A slap on the face)
Ouch!

645
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,917
- Mum!
- Children, please leave.

646
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:38,837
Please accept our sincere apology.

647
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,980
I really want to know…

648
00:45:44,323 --> 00:45:46,426
what you wrote for me in that letter.

649
00:45:48,232 --> 00:45:49,283
I’m not going to tell you.

650
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:52,152
You’ll find out when you get the letter.

651
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,814
Wan. Kim. Hurry up.

652
00:45:55,763 --> 00:45:56,917
Screammm

653
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:57,362
(Girls teasing each other)

654
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:59,374
Stop it. Wan, stop!

655
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:02,734
Get her!

656
00:46:02,757 --> 00:46:03,934
Come here.

657
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:21,969
I’ll get off here.

658
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,963
One day when we get to know each other better,

659
00:46:26,962 --> 00:46:29,294
I hope you’d tell me more about that close friend of yours.

660
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:31,489
Yes.

661
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:34,494
So, how will you go back home?

662
00:46:36,014 --> 00:46:37,557
I’ll call a cab.

663
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:40,529
See you later, Kim.

664
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,552
Don’t forget to finish that painting for me. I’ll be waiting.

665
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:49,272
Oh, and one more thing.

666
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,277
After you help your friend making a dream come true,

667
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:54,666
don’t forget about your dream too.

668
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,163
Okay.

669
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,357
- Go on in.
- Yes.

670
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:13,432
See you then.

671
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:17,020
Please drive safely.

672
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:39,866
You did everything to make her pleased and happy.

673
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:41,397
But what about yourself?

674
00:47:42,174 --> 00:47:43,900
Is the owner of the gallery here?

675
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:45,980
I want to talk to him.

676
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:08,692
My Marvellous Dream is You
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @DreamGLIDF

677
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:15,799
My Marvellous Dream Is You

678
00:48:39,996 --> 00:48:40,807
Dokrak.

679
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:43,939
Kim!

680
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:46,350
You’re back

681
00:48:48,624 --> 00:48:50,281
Thank you for coming to help.

682
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:53,116
I’m so relieved now that you’re here.

683
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:55,687
You go sit there and wait.

684
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:57,184
I’ll take care of it.

685
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,167
Okay.

686
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,796
What do you need to fix?

687
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,699
- I’ll show you.
- Where?

688
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:07,339
Umm, I’m not sure if..

689
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:08,716
- This one?
- Yes.

690
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:09,481
Kim.

691
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:12,270
How can you put up with her? She’s so spoiled.

692
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:17,359
Babe, don’t distract her from work.

693
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,189
Let’s get to work, Dokrak.

694
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:24,309
This one should be on the top, over here.

695
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:14,149
- Do you like it, Wan?
- Aha.

696
00:50:14,649 --> 00:50:17,399
I’ll go changed and will wait for you at my place.

697
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:20,119
I’ll stay for a while to discuss with Dokrak about the dress first.

698
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:21,439
Okay.

699
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:28,329
You’re the best, Kim.

700
00:50:29,049 --> 00:50:31,449
Only you know what Wan wants.

701
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:35,119
Otherwise, I must be pulling an all-nighter to fix the dress for her.

702
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:38,319
Thank you so much for coming back to help.

703
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:45,569
Are you okay, Kim? You don’t look well.

704
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,299
Yeah, I’m just a bit hungover.

705
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,319
You should’ve gone home to rest.

706
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:56,949
Instead of coming here to help that pompous actress.

707
00:50:57,149 --> 00:50:58,279
Babe.

708
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:04,189
It’s true. You did everything to make her pleased and happy.

709
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:05,799
But what about yourself?

710
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,059
Seriously, what do you get from doing this?

711
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:14,109
Don’t tell me seeing her happy also makes you happy.

712
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,799
You have a life of your own too, Kim.

713
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:24,149
Okay, I’ll go wrap up everything then.

714
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:48,209
Kim.

715
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:49,789
You’re back.

716
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:52,299
What do you want to eat for dinner?

717
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:53,439
I’ll order it for you.

718
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:56,249
Just pick whatever you like. Anything is fine with me.

719
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:00,439
Dokrak just couldn’t understand what I want.

720
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:02,449
And Pam isn’t helping at all.

721
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:03,909
She kept saying they had to go on a date.

722
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:05,069
Boring.

723
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,999
Nobody knows me as much as you do.

724
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:12,009
You have to try to trust other people too.

725
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:15,669
Why would I do that?

726
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:19,479
I’ll have you back as my personal stylist soon.

727
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:25,079
Now that our fans are going crazy shipping me and Pat,

728
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,459
I got two more dramas to work on with him.

729
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:33,159
People already forgot that scandal about our clip.

730
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:36,679
Now we can focus on going to Hollywood.

731
00:52:37,399 --> 00:52:38,619
It’s perfect.

732
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:43,589
It’s not that easy, Wan.

733
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:47,659
The point is, we can’t closely together from now on.

734
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:50,199
Jessie will always keep an eye on us both.

735
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:58,819
I think you must learn to accept the truth that I can no longer work for you like before.

736
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,479
Then don’t work at all.

737
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:07,669
I’ll earn the money for us both. I’m rich anyway.

738
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:12,629
No, I want to work.

739
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:15,769
Wait.

740
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:19,459
Whom are you going to work for?

741
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:21,519
For which actress are you going to be a stylist for?

742
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:25,179
I’m going to do what that I love.

743
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:27,589
The one that makes me happy.

744
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,599
What do you mean?

745
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:33,659
Aren’t you happy working with me?

746
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:37,669
It’s not like that.

747
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:40,989
I want to do something for myself.

748
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:45,709
I’ve worked for you for such a long time.

749
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:50,249
So long that I never get a chance to follow my own dream.

750
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:54,419
This is the best timing.

751
00:53:57,749 --> 00:53:58,489
Fine.

752
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:02,249
Whom will you work with?

753
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:48,979
Hey, is the owner of the gallery here?

754
00:54:49,629 --> 00:54:51,049
I want to have a word with him.

755
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:53,339
Yes, please wait a moment.

756
00:54:53,709 --> 00:54:57,819
Wait. Don’t tell him that I’m Dawan.

757
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:59,089
Yes, Miss.

758
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:03,609
Umm, are you Dawan?

759
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:09,099
- You recognized me?
- Yes.

760
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:12,229
- (Sigh)
- Can I have a picture?

761
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,429
Sure.

762
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:22,129
- Will you send it to me?
- Huh?

763
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:23,609
Why would I do that?

764
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:25,799
We took it with your phone.

765
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:28,979
Oh, then give me your phone.

766
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:34,169
Thank you.

767
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:37,669
Miss Dawan, this way please.

768
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:39,929
Don’t say my name.

769
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,379
Mr. Marwin, someone wants to see you.

770
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:52,599
Who is it?

771
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:55,819
It’s Miss Dawan, the actress. She’s so popular right now.

772
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:15,159
ahem

773
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:19,209
ahem

774
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:30,829
What do you want to talk to me?

775
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:34,519
I only need a minute.

776
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:41,459
This person is going to apply for a job at your gallery.

777
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:48,039
You must not hire her.

778
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,989
Why shouldn’t I hire her?

779
00:56:52,669 --> 00:56:55,439
Because I just asked you so.

780
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:02,069
Wan.

781
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:05,309
What are you doing here?

782
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:12,159
She told me to not hire you, Kimhan.

783
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,879
My Marvellous Dream Is You

784
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,839
Fine. I’m not going to work here.

785
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:51,139
I’ll go take some rest first.

786
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:55,769
(Crying)
I must stay strong and be on my own.

787
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:58,059
I’ve tried, Wan.

788
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:01,069
But I can’t do it.

789
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:04,429
Why did you do this?

790
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,039
Haven’t I already told you not to do it?

791
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:09,119
Let’s be on our own way from now on.

792
00:58:09,629 --> 00:58:12,209
Please don’t mess up with my life anymore.

793
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:14,059
Marwin

794
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,189
Mr. Marwin, can I have a word with you?

795
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:20,339
Marwin.

796
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:24,459
What did Dawan want from you?

797
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:44,789
🎵All I can do is saying ‘I love you’ during the night🎵

798
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:51,379
🎵Holding you tight until we’d meet again🎵

799
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:57,989
🎵Counting down to the day we’d meet🎵

800
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:05,279
🎵Missing those time we spent together🎵

801
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:14,979
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream. The dream that can never…🎵

802
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:18,249
🎵…come true.🎵

803
00:59:18,249 --> 00:59:21,219
🎵I want to cherish all the moments…🎵

804
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,869
🎵And memorise every second…🎵

805
00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:33,599
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say love you in real life🎵

806
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:52,399
