1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,291
Miss!

2
00:00:01,554 --> 00:00:03,120
Aren’t you going to stay for the wedding?

3
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:04,057
I’m busy.

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,108
- Kim!    /    - Kim!

5
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,982
I want to get out of here.

6
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,868
Wait!    /    Wait!

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,057
I’ll run away with her.

8
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,268
Kim! Where are you going?!

9
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,651
Life was so tough when you weren’t by my side.

10
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:21,074
From now on, no matter what will happen, we’ll go through it together.

11
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:22,811
I really love her, Mum.

12
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,102
Mum!

13
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,291
Wan told me…

14
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,691
that you want to open an online store for your clothing brand.

15
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,302
Is there anything we can help?

16
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:35,874
From now on, the DREAM brand will no longer exist only in your dream.

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,302
I love it.

18
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:38,891

What do you think?

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,702
An applause for you. It’s fabulous!

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,748
- Kim, your dad is awesome.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,451
The website he created for your brand looks so amazing. It’s drawing a lot of attention.

38
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,811
It makes me want to hire your dad to create a website to promote my baby.

39
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,005
Wow, incredible.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,228
What nonsense are you talking about?

41
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,365
- What?
- It’d make more sense to promote my shop.

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,022
Jeez, Mon. Your shop will close down soon. I’ll give you 2 more months.

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,040
What a foul mouth.

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,988
- It’s true. You’ve tried over a hundred types of business already.
- Coming.

45
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:46,205
Here come the desserts.

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,434
- Let’s take a break first.
- Wow, looks so good.

47
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,474
No, you can’t eat it.

48
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,714
- Huh, why?
- Thank you.

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,634
- Try it.
- It’s amazing.

50
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,460
I’m sure it will be a blast.

51
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:56,994
Do you want to try it?

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,782
Oh, this one is also nice.

53
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:06,080
Ahem, you two…

54
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,428
Since you decided to date each other, you’ve probably become a cripple.

55
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,320
Yeah, such a lovey-dovey. Don’t forget that…

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,428
Oh my goodness. We’re still here too.

57
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:15,840
Yeah.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,497
- It’s not just the two of you here.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:19,931
- Oh, that’s right.
- What?

60
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,200
Do you know when they started to like each other this way?

61
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:30,457
I just knew that Wan had a secret crush on Kim.

62
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,445
- What? How?
- Well, remember when Kim was sick,

63
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,451
- and we went to her house?
- Aha.

64
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,285
You were talking about a Japanese manga…something about kissing to cure the cold.

65
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,702
Don’t tell me…

66
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,902
Wan, what are you doing?

67
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:46,720
I…

68
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:50,457
I was going to cover her with a blanket.

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,600
- That’s right.
- Oh!

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,554
I saw it with my own eyes.

71
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,013
- That Wan was kissing Kim.
- Oh, my god.

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,066
Why didn’t I see it?

73
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,120
How would I know?

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,106
- Wait.     /    - What?

75
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,973
How come I never know about this?

76
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,240
She has never told me before.

77
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,200
I don’t know. Ask her then.

78
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
Be quiet.

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,493
- Hey.    /    - What?

80
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,133
I got something much better.

81
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,480
- Did you steal a kiss?
- About who?

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,466
You’ll be surprised. Kim, can I tell them?

83
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,800
Oh, my god.

84
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
Can you not do that?

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,706
Stay out of this.

86
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,106
- Stop.
- You have to tell your side too.

87
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,440
- Quiet.
- No, I’m going to tell them.

88
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,613
- Wan was sick on that day.
- Aha.

89
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,506
- She got a cold.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,813
- So she went to take a nap in the classroom.
- Classroom.

91
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,306
- Then you know what?
- What?

92
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,346
- Kim.    /     - Aha.

93
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,173
- A girl like Kim.
- Yes?

94
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,000
Stole a kiss from Wan.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,653
Aaah!

96
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,480
I was so shocked! She stole a kiss from Wan!

97
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,693
- I was like, ‘Oh my gosh!’.
- Oh my gosh!

98
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:59,213
- You’re the best!
- You’re the best!
- Yeah.

99
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,266
You’re quite something too, huh?

100
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,480
So surprise.

101
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,773
- Calm down, you two.
- Take it easy.

102
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,466
- By the way.    /  - What?

103
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,693
If you’re done with commenting about our website,

104
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:11,840
you can go home now.

105
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,306
So that I can spend time alone with Kim.

106
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,946
Hold on. We’ve just done you a favour,

107
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,813
and you’d get rid of us like this?

108
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,626
Yeah.

109
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,773
Why would you stay then?

110
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:23,106
Uh-ho.

111
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,453
Fine. If you two really want to make out,

112
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,080
we’ll just stay here and watch.

113
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,040
- Yeah.
- What do you say?
- Yeah.
- Right here.

114
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,066
Do you think I can’t do it?

115
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,160
- Yeah, I dare you to do it right here. Now.
- Okay.

116
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,293
Just go back, guys.

117
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,853
Aaah!

118
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,213
Oh my goodness.

119
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,760
Mon, you barely close your eyes!

120
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,173
Stop it.

121
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,560
Wan.

122
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,053
Wan.

123
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,813
Are you sure you’re not staring?

124
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,866
- Just go.    /    - Why?

125
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,760
This is nothing at all.

126
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,853
- Oh really?
- I’m not leaving yet. Give me more.

127
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,093
What should we do, Kim?

128
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,866
Wan…

129
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,693
So?

130
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,186
Oh, my god.

131
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,773
- That was hard!
- Wan.

132
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,346
Aaah!

133
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,906
Aaah!

134
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,200
- I can’t watch it!
- They make me miss my hubby.

135
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,173
Stop it.

136
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,386
- I can’t watch.
- Me too.

137
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:25,500
- Now, you two stop screaming and go home.
- Why?

138
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:26,880
I still haven’t eaten the cake.

139
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,186
- What are you doing?
- What about the cake?

140
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:37,373
- Get out.
- No.
- I’m not going.
- Go.

141
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,066
Aaah!

142
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,453
Kim.

143
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,426
Look at her. She’s so cruel!

144
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,506
Let’s eavesdrop them.

145
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:46,413
Wait.

146
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,600
What?

147
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,173
I wasn’t kidding when I said …

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,533
I wanted to make out with you.

149
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,320
Kim, I can’t hold it anymore.

150
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:39,373
I love you, Wan.

151
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,933
I love you too.

152
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,373
🎵Can we sleep like this for a while?🎵

153
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,506
🎵I want to keep you by myside like this.🎵

154
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,160
🎵I don’t want to wake up at all.🎵

155
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,813
🎵Let me keep looking at you for a little longer🎵

156
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,946
🎵I want to stay close to you for a little longer🎵

157
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,173
🎵I don’t want to see you only in my dreams🎵

158
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,426
🎵When you’re not around, everything seems so dull🎵

159
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,600
🎵All I can do is counting down the days until I’d see you again🎵

160
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,840
🎵See you in my dream tonight🎵

161
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:52,460
🎵I saw you in my dream again 🎵

162
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:59,013
🎵Do you know how much you make me feel?🎵

163
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:07,240
🎵Loving each other in a dream for only 8 hours a night is never enough 🎵

164
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,386
Here it is.

165
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:19,160
There. Do you like it?

166
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,546
It’s beautiful.

167
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:24,653
Snacks are ready.

168
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,800
Let me help.

169
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,146
This one looks really nice.

170
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,866
Yeah. I like it too.

171
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,866
Kim, are you ready?

172
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:40,520
Yes.

173
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:48,906
(Clapping)

174
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,693
Hello, everyone! This is a brand-new collection from DREAM.

175
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,120
The first dress in our collection is this one.

176
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,840
A light blue dress.

177
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,666
With some details in the top part. It also comes with beautiful beading patterns.

178
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,613
Wow, isn’t it gorgeous, everyone?

179
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,813
There are many more dresses from our brand for you to choose from.

180
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,373
Wan, please pick one and show it to them.

181
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,653
You got it.

182
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:14,973
This one comes as a set.

183
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,200
With cute knitting patterns around the neck and the waist.

184
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,173
You can wear them in many occasions.

185
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,973
Is anyone interested in this outfit?

186
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,826
It’s all right. Let’s see the next one first.

187
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:29,720
Hi, Mali! Hi, Samon! Are you guys interested?

188
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,640
For this one, it’s a fluffy knitted pink shirt…

189
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:38,133
matched with plaid-pattern shorts. They look beautiful together.

190
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,613
Oh, we’ve got an order for two.

191
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,386
(Bell ringing)

192
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:45,360
Sold! They are yours now.

193
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,800
Hey, the live got cut off.

194
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:51,506
What happened?

195
00:13:58,826 --> 00:13:59,933
Did they block you?

196
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,360
Our page got blocked too.

197
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:07,146
Why?

198
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:17,253
Kim, don’t look so stress.

199
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,946
We promise we’ll buy clothes from you every day. You have our words.

200
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,740
I’ll also help you come up with a way to fix this problem.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

203
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,707
Feel free to order anything that you want to eat.
It’s my restaurant, so it’s my treat today.

204
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,867
Come on, loosen up a bit. You’ve been through a lot lately.

205
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:09,813
Mhm.

206
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:14,027
Kim, don’t look so stress.

207
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,877
- We promise we’ll buy clothes from you every day. We’ll buy every collection there is.
- Yeah.

208
00:15:24,877 --> 00:15:26,213
- Okay?    /    - Mhm.

209
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,720
Don’t stress yourself out.

210
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,360
I’ll also help you come up with a way to fix this problem.

211
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:37,187
Why did the live get cut off every time they tried to sell their clothes?

212
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,667
- Hey.     /     - What?

213
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,867
Someone must have reported them on Facebook.

214
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:47,720
That influencer you sent her your clothes to do a review,

215
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:50,067
she just deleted all her posts about your brand.

216
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:55,480
Pat also apologized to me earlier.

217
00:15:56,067 --> 00:16:00,733
His agency made him delete all the posts because they don’t want to upset Marwin.

218
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:06,147
Pat still has to attend a lot of event for the brands which are under Marwin’s company.

219
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:11,227
I guess those who deleted their posts must have done so because of the same reason.

220
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:18,813
I kind of understand them though. They have to protect themselves too.

221
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,827
Who would want to go against a big investor and main sponsor of their agency like that?

222
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,133
But what they did was right.

223
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,573
I also don’t want to feel bad for causing them a lot of trouble.

224
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:41,400
I’m so sorry for stressing you out with our problem.

225
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:43,997
- Don’t say that.
- Not a problem at all.

226
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:45,627
- We want to help.    /    - Yeah.

227
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,307
(Phone buzzing)

228
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,213

229
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:51,960
(Phone buzzing)

230
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:54,840
Yes, Toon?

231
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:02,267
What job?

232
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:05,120
- Huh? A job?    /    - Really?

233
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,440
Umm

234
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,080
Let me think about it first.

235
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,493
What did she want?

236
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,560
Yeah, what is it?

237
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:23,640
She said someone wants to hire me.

238
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,347
- Who’s it?    /    - Who?

239
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:30,787
Pleng Sadubpin. She wants me to be the main protagonist in her MV.

240
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:31,557
- Oh!    /    - What?!

241
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:32,507
Are you serious?

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,587
- Hey    /   - Just say yes!

243
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,307
- It’s Pleng Sadubpin! Can you believe it?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:39,467
- Her song is a talk-of-the-town right now.
- Yeah.

245
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:42,467
Her last song got about…

246
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,397
- a million views!    /    - Yeah.

247
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,327
- You should do it!
- Yeah. Take this job. Trust me.

248
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:48,407
Yeah, take it!

249
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,987
Hey, what’s with that face?

250
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:52,117
Yeah.

251
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:54,173
Don’t you want to be an actress anymore?

252
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:02,080
I do, but it’s a girl’s love MV, like a romantic love between girls.

253
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:04,160
So what?

254
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,000
Why didn’t you say yes then?

255
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:08,440
Yeah.

256
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:16,653
Or are you afraid that people would think you get to star in this MV because you like girls?

257
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,013
It’s not like that at all.

258
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:28,200
I already gave my words to your mother that I will not keep our relationship a secret.

259
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:36,160
I’m just afraid that when the MV is aired, there’ll be comments from viewers.

260
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,840
What if there are bad comments? I don’t want you to feel bad when you read them. I want to protect you.

261
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:46,560
(Sighing)

262
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,827
What if I want you to do it? Will you do it for me?

263
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,720
I don’t care about those comments.

264
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:02,947
I’d be glad if you accept this job offer.

265
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:12,667
Because it would actually mean you are proud to be in a relationship with a girl.

266
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,440
Wan, I totally agree with her.

267
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,547
And I also have a great idea.

268
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:39,773
You take this job and tell them you’d the costumes from DREAM .

269
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,557
Yeah.

270
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:42,693
- Right?    /    - That’s right.

271
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:45,447
Tie-in your brand and promote it in the MV.

272
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:50,247
It’s also a chance for you to make a comeback as an actress.

273
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:51,293
That’s right.

274
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,387
- Yeah.    /    - Do it.

275
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:56,093
- If no one is willing to do a review for your brand…
- Aha.

276
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,317
You just do it yourself then.

277
00:19:58,317 --> 00:19:59,107
- The end.    /    - Done.

278
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,520
- Good.    /     - Very good.

279
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,200
Fabulous.

280
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,347
I’m such a genius.

281
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:06,007
Come, let’s have a toast.

282
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:06,547
Yeah.

283
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:10,007
To Wan and her opportunity to comeback as an actress.

284
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,107
Okay. Cheers!

285
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,407
That’s right.

286
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:14,640
Cheers!

287
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,400
This way, Pleng. Please go in.

288
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,077
This way please.

289
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,067
Oh, wow!

290
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,467
This is the setting we’ve prepared for the shooting. Colourful, isn’t it?

291
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,287
Wow.

292
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:30,007
Do you like it?

293
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:32,480
Yes, very much. Just like what I’ve planned.

294
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,277
This is our director.

295
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:35,517
She’s here.

296
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,573
Hello.

297
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:43,120
And these are our MV actresses and their stylist.

298
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:45,327
This is Pleng, the MV singer.

299
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,397
Hello.

300
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:48,847
This one is Prim.

301
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,597
And this is Dawan.

302
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,167
They will be starring together in your MV.

303
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,493
This one is our stylist, Kimhan.

304
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,367
Hi, nice to meet you all.

305
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:00,127
- I actually had a peek at the dresses that you designed.
- Prim, please come with me.

306
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,747
They look gorgeous. I love them.

307
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:03,200
Oh, thank you.

308
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:09,987
🎵I just know that being loved feels so good🎵

309
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:16,077
🎵I never thought I’d have a chance until the day you came into my life🎵

310
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:18,857
🎵I secretly wonder what kind of person you are🎵

311
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:22,487
🎵Even when I’m not myself, you still don’t mind me.🎵

312
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,213
🎵You still think I’m pretty, and always smile for me.🎵

313

328
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:30,027
🎵But you still never leave me🎵

329
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:32,707
🎵I know I’m not perfect🎵

330
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:35,527
🎵But you said I’m just perfect for you🎵

331
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:38,207
🎵So, where else would I run to?🎵

332
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:41,120
🎵I give myself up to you. I don’t think I can love anyone else🎵

333

00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:21,517
Everyone come packing up stuff.

354
00:24:21,517 --> 00:24:23,613
So, how is it? Are you tired?

355
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,400
I’m fine.

356
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,487
Not tired at all.

357
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:27,520
Okay, everyone.

358
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:27,947
So chill.

359
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:33,107
- Let’s give it up for Dawan.
- Woohoo!
- (Clapping)

360
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:35,727
- Thank you so much. Thank you, Dawan.
- (Clapping)

361
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:36,587
Thank you.

362
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:39,787
- Thank you to Kimhan for her beautiful costumes too.
- Thank you.

363
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:46,253
Dawan, thank you so much for today. You were so amazing.

364
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:48,437
It’s been a pleasure to work with you.

365
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:49,327
Likewise.

366
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:52,527
- Everything is done.
- Everything is okay, right?

367
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:56,747
Well done.

368
00:24:56,747 --> 00:25:00,560
- I hope your song will be a big hit.
- Thank you.

369
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:03,317
This is your first time but you did a really good job today.

370
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:04,467
- Thank you.    /    - I’ll walk you out.

371
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:05,147
Yes.

372
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,507
- Goodbye.    /    - Goodbye.

373
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,773
Thank you.

374
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:09,267
See you later.

375
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:13,507
Wow, your acting was amazing, Dawan.

376
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,307
I really like it.

377
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:18,917
- Your costumes are so beautiful too. I love them all.
- Oh, thank you.

378
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:23,317
Well, I wish you two a long lasting love.

379
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:25,247
- Please excuse me then.
- Okay.

380
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,557
See you later. Bye bye!

381
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,053
- Goodbye.   /   - Goodbye

382
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,573
Good job.

00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:32,200

384
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,080
(Phone buzzing)

385
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:35,493
Yes, Dad?

386
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:38,307
What?

387
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,747
What did you say?

388
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,360
(Sigh)

389
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:47,680
Okay.

390
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:55,507
What’s the matter?

391
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:58,040
(Sigh)

392
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,667
Dad, what happened?

393
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,400
They all got rejected and returned to sender.

394
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:06,147
But that’s impossible. How could every single order get rejected?

395
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,453
Your website has been hacked too.

(Sigh)

400
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:06,157
They are here.

401
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:08,637
Dad, what happened?

402
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:12,371
I don’t know. They all got rejected and returned to sender.

403
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:16,357
But that’s impossible. How could every single order get rejected?

404

(Sigh)

406
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,584
There’s something suspicious about this.

407
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:39,531
Why are there only weird comments on our page?

408
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:40,611
Let me see.

409
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:43,797
They are all fake accounts. Look, Dad.

410
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:50,037
You’re right. No posts, no followers.

411
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,971
This means they created these fake accounts to damage our brand reputation.

412
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:57,424
Who did it?

413
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:00,264
And for what?

414
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:06,664
It’s definitely Marwin.

415
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:10,757
- (Sigh)	   /   - (Sigh)

416
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,611
Kim, give me Marwin’s phone number.

417
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:17,771
What are you going to do?

418
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:19,491
Just give it to me.

419
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,211
(Sigh) Probably another one.

420
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,544
(Sigh)

421
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:05,751

Dawan: Marwin.

422
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:07,351
Dawan: I’m begging you.

423
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:09,871
Dawan: Can you please let me meet you?

424
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,711
Dawan: I want to apologize.

425
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,171
(Sigh)

426
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:17,784
Uh-ho.

427
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:23,477
Here we go. Finally, home.

428
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,557
They all got rejected.

00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:30,077

433
00:30:06,024 --> 00:30:07,504
Dad, how is it?

434
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:09,717
No followers at all.

435
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:19,651
- How about this one?
- No.

436
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,077
- Can you try sending to my email again?
- Okay.

437
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,277
- I’ll try to log in again.
- This one also doesn’t work.

438
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:33,411
- This one too.   /   - (Sigh)

439
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:34,877
What are you doing, Dad?

440
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:39,704
Tim and I are trying to get your website back.

441
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:45,331
I already took a nap but Tim hasn’t slept since last night.

442
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:49,091
You should go rest, Dad.

443
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:53,464
I won’t be able to sleep if I still can’t fix it for you.

444
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,984
Let me try it a bit more. Okay?

445
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:57,304
Hey.

446
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:00,424
No.

447
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,797
Or should we just forget about it…

448
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:08,237
and create a new website instead? We don’t have to use this name as our brand too.

449
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:11,064
Also, I will not model for the brand this time.

450
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:12,797
So that Marwin wouldn’t know about it’s my brand.

451
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:18,264
If they are that powerful,

452
00:31:18,864 --> 00:31:20,424
they will know anyway.

453
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:31,904
Not this one too.

454
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:09,824

455
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:11,821

(Phone buzzing)

458
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,144
Yes, Toon?

459
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:22,184
It’s that Marwin again, Wan.

460
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:23,784
What did he do this time?

461
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:29,757
The MV that you just finish shooting. It won’t be released because you’re the lead role of the MV.

462
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:31,304
(Sigh)

463
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:33,717
What does this have to do with Marwin?

464
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:37,784
He knows the promoter of this agency, the one who paid for the MV shooting.

465
00:32:38,904 --> 00:32:41,437
Jeez, he’s going to far with this.

466
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:46,051
Why does he drag other people who barely know me into this too?

467
00:32:47,744 --> 00:32:49,357
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it.

468
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:53,504
Wait, Wan.

469
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,424
Toon, have a seat first.

470
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:00,544
(Sigh)

471
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:02,957
(Sigh)

472
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:05,077
Please drink some coffee.

473
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:07,117
Thank you.

474
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:10,277
Poor Dawan.

475
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:13,277
Is there anyway that we can help her?

476
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,331
I don’t think so.

477
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:21,571
Kim and Wan have to fix this by themselves.

478
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:40,277
It’s all right, Wan.

479
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:44,024
I’ll find a way to contact him again.

480
00:33:55,291 --> 00:34:01,491
Loving me only makes your life getting worse.

481
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:08,077
If we could turn back the time,

482
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,624
would you still choose to be with me?

483
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:21,131
But we can’t turn back the time.

484
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:24,611
Now, I choose you.

485
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:29,477
So that we can also be together in the future…

486
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:32,064
no matter what will happen.

487
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:01,837
Please never forget the best thing that’s happening to us right now.

488
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,584
That is we get to love each other.

489
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:09,051
(Sigh)

490
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,291
He told us to come at 9am.

491
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:19,197
But this is 3pm already.

492
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:21,477
Mhm.

493
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:27,224
He’s probably testing us.

494
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:30,784
He might want to let us know that

495
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:33,597
if we’re not willing to wait, then we can just leave.

496
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,504
I think he might not be coming in today.

497
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:43,437
Let’s go back, Kim.

498
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:45,851
We can come again tomorrow.

499
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:49,917
Mhm.

hey

502
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:08,117
It’s Marwin. He sent me a message.

503
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:09,101
Marwin: Meet me at the office at my hotel.

504
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:12,931
He told us to go to his hotel.

505
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:16,437
Let’s go, Wan.

506
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:29,291
(Sigh)

507
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:44,877
Hello.

508
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,731
We’re here to see Mr. Marwin.

509
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:52,344
- Yes, he’s already waiting for you.
- Thank you.

510
00:37:58,504 --> 00:37:59,317
(Sigh)

511
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:31,571
I can only give you 10 minutes.

512
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:33,944
Please get to the point.

513
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:36,597
We just want to apologize.

514
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:41,197
Do you have to come all the way here to do that?

515
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:48,064
I know you’ll never forgive me for what I’ve done.

516
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:55,357
I won’t blame you at all if you would lash it out on me alone.

517
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:58,037
But you dragged other people into it too.

518
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:00,784
They don’t deserve this.

519
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:05,064
So, you came all the way here to apologize to me…

520
00:39:05,437 --> 00:39:07,544
because what I did affect your work, right?

521
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:09,837
If it hadn’t bothered you,

522
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:12,157
you would have just continued with your life…

523
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:15,704
and acted like what happened to me was something normal, wouldn’t you?

524
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:19,811
That’s not true. We’ve never thought like that.

525
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:24,771
All this time, Kim has been feeling so guilty for what she did to you.

526
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,184
We have tried so many times to apologize to you in person.

527
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,251
Really?

528
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:32,424
I’m so touched.

529
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:37,437
I’m the one who made you like this, right?

530
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,157
You’ve become the Marwin that I barely know.

531
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:45,251
Yes, I’m a new person now.

532
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:49,411
And I like myself like this better than the old me.

533
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:51,891
When I decided to help with my family business,

534
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:55,477
I was so glad to see the numbers in our company’s bank account increasing every day.

535
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:57,824
To be superior and have someone working under me.

536
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:00,544
I can do whatever I want.

537
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,731
I can fire anyone.

538
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:13,757
When I was able to have them under my control,

539
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:17,784
I started to extend my power to another part, which is the music label.

540
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:22,357
The owner of that music label is my distant cousin. My family also has a share in it.

541
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:26,864
I happened to know that Miss Sadubpin was working on a new song.

542
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:28,877
So, I had an idea that…

543
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:32,251
it might be interesting to portrait the song…

544
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:35,157
as a girls’ love.

545
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:36,771
You planned everything from the beginning?

546
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,824
I’d rather say I was inspired.

547
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:42,531
So I gave the music label some money to make the MV for this song.

548
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:43,664
And told them to contact you.

549
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,397
When everything was done, I cancelled it.

550
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,051
Because I didn’t like the lead role of the MV.

551
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:50,197
It feels so good…

552
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,904
to destroy someone else’s hope.

553
00:40:56,277 --> 00:40:57,997
If you’re that angry with me,

554
00:40:58,704 --> 00:41:00,637
why didn’t destroy me alone?

555
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:06,891
Miss Sadubpin and other people who dedicated themselves to this MV, why put them in trouble too?

556
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:09,011
Did it make you feel bad?

557
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:13,797
Do you feel so sorry and ashamed for causing those people troubles?

558
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:17,531
That’s how I felt when you took my bride away from my wedding.

559
00:41:20,197 --> 00:41:22,131
You humiliated my parents.

560
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:26,451
You dragged other people into it and made them disappointed.

561
00:41:28,664 --> 00:41:30,971
That’s the feeling that you two should always remember.

562
00:41:32,237 --> 00:41:37,117
What should I do to make you forgive us?

563
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:39,544
You don’t have to do anything.

564
00:41:41,771 --> 00:41:45,211
Just like when you and Kim ran away from my wedding. I didn’t do anything either.

565
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,357
I already asked you if you would let me marry Kim.

566
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:52,251
You insisted that I should marry her, just so that you could destroy my wedding later.

567
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,984
I only did the same to you.

568
00:41:54,517 --> 00:41:55,624
I’m sorry.

569
00:41:57,637 --> 00:41:58,917
I’m really sorry.

570
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:03,957
I have nothing to say except that…

571
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,637
I really understand how you feel.

572
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:09,837
If I were you,

573
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:14,971
I would have done the same.

574
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:18,211
Then you should know…

575
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:23,051
that I will never accept an apology from both of you.

576
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,224
It’s been 10 minutes. Your time is over.

577
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:51,344
We know we have wronged you so badly.

578
00:42:52,277 --> 00:42:54,011
And we feel so bad about it.

579
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,704
That’s why we came all the way here to see you…

580
00:42:57,544 --> 00:43:00,757
even though you didn’t want to see us, and left us waiting for hours.

581
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:05,624
But we still waited because we knew it was what we should do.

582
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:08,837
But when I heard everything from you,

583
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:12,664
how you felt and what you have done,

584
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,731
that guilty feeling I used to have just simply disappeared.

585
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:19,757
You don’t have to forgive us.

586
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:25,824
We can’t force you, or even ask for anything from you.

587
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:29,757
We deserve to pay for what we did to you.

588
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:32,691
Let’s go, Wan.

589
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:06,691
I’m now in a relationship with Kim.

590
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:09,117
She’s the person I’ll spend the rest of my life with.

591
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:13,784
I don’t want you to see it as something unusual. I just want to be honest with myself and everyone.

594
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:07,195
Hi, can you please bring out the souvenirs?

595
00:45:07,192 --> 00:45:09,608
And please make sure the reception desk is clean and tidy.

596
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:11,808
Don’t forget to put the name tags on the table too.

597
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:13,008
Thank you.

598
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,128
Please put the name tags here.

599
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:23,115
Okay, thank you.

600
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:48,742
Are you okay, Wan?

601
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:53,422
What should we do, Kim?

602
00:45:58,115 --> 00:46:00,542
We already did all we could.

603
00:46:01,848 --> 00:46:03,222
Whatever will be, will be.

604
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:08,262
Do you think I should go apologize to everyone…

605
00:46:08,915 --> 00:46:11,742
for causing them troubles?

606
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:15,835
Wan, I already told you.

607
00:46:16,422 --> 00:46:20,088
No matter what you’ll do, I’ll always stay by your side.

608
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:31,275
(Incoming message)

609
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:33,968
Toon: You have received a new message.
Toon: Wan, the management finally agreed to release the MV.

610
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:37,155
Toon: It’ll be released in the next 2 weeks.

611
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:41,915
Kim, read this.

612
00:46:53,982 --> 00:46:55,782
It’s definitely Marwin.

613
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,848
What should I do?

614
00:47:00,355 --> 00:47:01,928
Should I call him to say thank you?

615
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:04,315
Up to you.

616
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:07,955
I’ll send him a LINE message then.

617
00:47:36,082 --> 00:47:44,722
Dawan: Thank you, Marwin. I don’t know why the MV can finally be released.
But I believe you have something to do with it.

618
00:47:51,442 --> 00:48:00,482
Marwin: You don’t have to thank me. I didn’t do it for you. This is all business.
Every businessman always expects a return on their investment.

619
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:08,122
Dawan: Well, thank you anyway.

620
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:20,242
Marwin: If you really want to thank me for what I did, and want me to forgive you;
please tell Kimhan not to hate me.

621
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:46,488
Please check over there too. Yes, over there.

00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:38,688
What did you agree to star in the girls’ love MV?

631
00:49:38,682 --> 00:49:41,208
I just wanted to try something new.

632
00:49:41,202 --> 00:49:44,382
But some people are saying that you decided to do it….

633
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:46,882
because you want to introduce your girlfriend to the public.

634
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:49,675
Well, that too. She’s so adorable.

635
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:51,672
I can’t help showing her off to everyone else.

636
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:52,342
Right?

637
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:56,742
So, you now admit that you’re dating a girl.

638
00:49:56,742 --> 00:49:58,875
You’ve never mentioned about it before.

639
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:00,595
It’s good that you asked.

640
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:01,742
I’m going to make it official then.

641
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:04,595
Kim and I are now in a relationship.

642
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,368
She’s the woman I’ll spend the rest of my life with.

643
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:12,048
I don’t want to make it look like something unusual or something wrong.

644
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,435
I just want to let everyone know about it.

645
00:50:13,432 --> 00:50:15,488
I want the world to know about it.

646
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:18,275
Aww…that’s so sweet.

647
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:22,235
I think love is love,

648
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:24,448
regardless of what gender you are.

649
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:27,888
I hope everyone will be happy for me and my relationship with her…

650
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:31,928
now that the same-sex marriage is finally legal in our country.

651
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:36,782
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

652
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:45,875
Go on in.

653
00:50:45,888 --> 00:50:48,275
Wait. Let me recheck it again.

654
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:49,262
Turn around.

655
00:50:50,528 --> 00:50:52,288
Okay, let’s go.

656
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:56,648
- Is the sound system ready?
- Ready

657
00:50:56,962 --> 00:50:59,528
Are you guys ready?

658
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:00,608
Please do your best.

659
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:03,248
- It’s time for the show.
- Okay.

00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:05,982

664
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:18,715
- Are you nervous?
- Mhm.

665
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:21,368
Do your best. I’ll be cheering for you.

666
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:23,288
Thank you.

667

678

682
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:47,642
🎵Loving each other only in a dream, just 8 hours every night is never enough for me.🎵

🎵I'm not sure if you really exist🎵

🎵Are you feeling the same?🎵

686
00:53:06,992 --> 00:53:11,022

Gorgeous.

687
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:17,342
🎵Hold hands together all the time, whether awake or dreaming🎵
Gorgeous.

00:53:58,955 --> 00:54:00,462
Amazing work.

695
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:03,155
Congratulations.

696
00:54:07,922 --> 00:54:10,422
- Hug her, hug her.
- Kiss her, kiss her.

697
00:54:10,422 --> 00:54:15,595
🎵See you in my dream tonight🎵

(Applaouse)

706
00:54:58,152 --> 00:55:01,915
kiss her again, again.

707
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:27,128
Come on, Kim.

708
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:27,635
Let’s dig it up after 10 years from now.

709
00:56:28,672 --> 00:56:31,768
I really want to know what you wrote to me.

710
00:56:34,688 --> 00:56:39,302
Too bad I didn’t get to read your letter last time.

711
00:56:39,742 --> 00:56:41,595
But you got to read mine, though.

712
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:56,395
I kept it with me.

713
00:56:56,862 --> 00:57:00,502
I sneaked out and dug it up before they’d do it.

714
00:57:01,382 --> 00:57:02,715
Please read it.

715
00:57:29,622 --> 00:57:31,128
To Kimhan.

716
00:57:32,128 --> 00:57:36,502
It took me a long time to write this letter to you.

717
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:44,275
I didn’t know how I should express my feelings through these words to make you understand how I truly feel.

718
00:57:45,888 --> 00:57:47,928
Because a letter has no sound.

719
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:53,768
So when you read it, there might be a chance of misinterpretation.

720
00:57:54,675 --> 00:57:55,955
I’ll try to make it short.

721
00:57:57,102 --> 00:58:03,102
But if you can’t understand the meaning of this letter, please ask me right away.

722
00:58:06,982 --> 00:58:13,582
It means I love you, Kim.

723
00:58:27,288 --> 00:58:31,115
I can’t read any further. The letters got smudged by ink.

724
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:37,088
I’ll tell you about it then.

725
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:44,048
I wrote it myself so I can remember every single word.

726
00:58:48,555 --> 00:58:53,742
All this time when we were together, everything that I did...

727
00:58:55,222 --> 00:59:01,928
was because I cared about you, as a friend would do to another.

728
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:05,182
But I’m usually not like this.

729
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:11,715
I don’t why I’m like this when I’m with you.

730
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:18,302
Standing up for someone…

731
00:59:20,622 --> 00:59:23,142
requires a great deal of courage.

732
00:59:26,662 --> 00:59:31,515
But if you ever have to be in a difficult situation,

733
00:59:33,355 --> 00:59:35,208
I will never hesitate to stand up for you.

734
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:46,488
As a friend, I’m such a valuable one, aren’t I?

735
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:57,355
But if you look carefully, there’s something more than just friends about it.

736
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:06,608
I have something strange to tell you.

737
01:00:08,342 --> 01:00:12,542
You might be laughing when you read up to this part.

738
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:17,728
We had met before.

739
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:24,168
Long before you’d move in next door. I used to dream of you.

740
01:00:28,648 --> 01:00:33,355
You were my imaginary friend, a friend whom I never knew what she looked like.

741
01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:39,302
In my dream, we were playing and growing up together.

742
01:00:39,675 --> 01:00:44,128
I had only realized what she actually looked like when I finally met you.

743
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:49,342
That imaginary friend in my dream has always been you.

744
01:00:50,862 --> 01:01:01,608
I could never figure out whether I love you because I love that friend in my dream,
or it is the other way around.

745
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:08,022
But whether in my dream or while I’m awake,

746
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:10,502
I do love you, Kim.

747
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:18,515
I don’t know if we’ll be able to look each other in the eyes after you read this letter.

748
01:01:20,728 --> 01:01:23,488
Will our relationship stay the same?

749
01:01:25,522 --> 01:01:32,968
If you find the content of this letter unacceptable, please throw it away. I wouldn’t blame you at all.

750
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:37,902
No matter what our relationship would be,

751
01:01:39,835 --> 01:01:41,528
I will always love you.

752
01:01:43,155 --> 01:01:50,528
I want you to know that you have always been the one for me, both in my dream and in my life.

753
01:01:51,622 --> 01:01:53,728
And it will never change.

754
01:04:35,402 --> 01:04:41,442
My Marvellous Dream is You
