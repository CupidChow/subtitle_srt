00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:03,291
Today is the last day that I’ll work for you.

2
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:05,417
From now on, I’ll be working for Jessie.

3
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:07,611
Please look after her for me.

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,548
I’ll stay with my mum and won’t come back here again.

5
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:14,034
I really don’t trust that Jessie girl.

6
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:17,400
I watched this clip over and over again.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,140
You two don’t look like ‘just friends’ in this clip.

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,685
I’m lonely. I can hardly sleep when I’m alone.

9
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:24,297
Do you want to go see the doctor?

10
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:26,502
Back at the same place.

11
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,017
That only reminds me of the past.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

27
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:09,622
Hey, Jessie.

28
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:13,570
Kim, please pick me up at my place at 9 tomorrow morning.

29
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,160
But before that, also stop by to fetch me a non-sweet iced americano and a freshly baked croissant.

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,891
Oh, and don’t forget to pick up my bag at the spa shop near Siam before you come in.

31
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,020
But that’s completely an opposite direction to your place.

32
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:27,371
Can I go get the bag after work?

33
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:29,828
Then you should wake up earlier.

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,108
If you can’t do it, you know what will happen to Wan, right?

35
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:35,931
I gotta go, need to get the laser done.

36
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:41,828
(Incoming message)

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,740
Cheers!

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,760
Let’s celebrate. Wan is going to be a celebrity!

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,420
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,170
- You finally got accepted to the X-Gent agency.
- Can I take your picture?

41
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,988
Kim, aren’t you going to celebrate for me?

42
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:19,508
Congratulations.

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,308
Are you really happy for me?

44
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,737
Yeah.

45
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:25,988
I’m so happy for you.

46
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:31,828
From now on, you’d get to kiss a lot of guys.

47
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:35,400
(Screaming)

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,171
Mali! You perv! Why did you want us to watch a porn movie?!

49
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:43,291
You’ll have to do it when you are older anyway.

50
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:46,342
What are you thinking, Kim?

51
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:48,285
Aren’t you embarrassed?

52
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,468
I’m thinking about how they shot this scene.

53
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,651
Did the actors really feel something, or was it just an act?

54
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,000
- I want to try it.
- Hmm

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,674
Try what?

56
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,222
Kissing.

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,205
If I kiss you,

58
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:22,605
will your cold get better?

59
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,382
(Crying)

60
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,217
(Crying)

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,582
(Crying)

62
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:43,840
(Crying)

63
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,640
(Crying)

64
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,834
(Crying)

65
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:51,874
(Crying)
Why?! Why?!

66
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:56,594
(Crying)	Why?! Why?!

67
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,674
(Crying)	Why?! Why?!

68
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:06,502
(Crying)	Why?! Why?!

69
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,857
(Crying)

70
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:34,114
Just like what Mum said.

71
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
Being back at the old place…only reminds you of the past.

72
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,628
Coffee.

73
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,994
I’ll go talk to the producer about the new advert.

74
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:15,828
You stay here and do your best.

75
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,268
Coach Minnie is the best here.

76
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,057
Many of her students have won an acting award.

77
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,782
Of course, I’ll do my best.

78
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:25,120
The Hollywood team has arranged all this for me.

79
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,720
I’m going to do my best.

80
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:37,085
Sure, I’ll get back to you about the product.

81
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,080
Roughly, how many days will it be?

82
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:41,520
Yes.

83
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,462
Yes.

84
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,560
Er

85
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,290
Hello, Toon. Where’s…

86
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,234
Kim, hurry up.

87
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:56,285
Yes? Oh, I’m sorry. Just bumped into someone I know.

88
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,850
Oh, hello there, Dawan.

89
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,417
Don’t tell me you’re also here for an acting class.

90
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:07,462
It’s an acting academy, do you think I’m here for scuba diving?

91
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:26,285
Jessie, you have to go for a fitting after this workshop.

92
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:27,554
Let me see the schedule.

93
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:46,640
Kim.

94
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:49,394
Can you help removing my shoes?

95
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:56,640
Wait, can’t you just take off your own shoes?

96
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,680
Aren’t you being a little too pampered?

97
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:01,622
It’s none of your business.

98
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:07,257
Do you forget that Kimhan is now my personal manager?

99
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,542
She’s also my stylist, looking after my attire from head to toe.

100
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:14,948
Kim, I’m waiting.

101
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:20,251
Wan.

102
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:24,651
Don’t do it.

103
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,497
Wan, I’m working for Jessie.

104
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:33,490
I can do it.

105
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,822
Hi, everyone.

106
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,868
Wow, you all are punctual.

107
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,828
If you’re ready, let’s go inside.

108
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:49,360
I’ll go change first.

109
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:51,657
Let’s go.

110
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,371
Kim, please look after my ipad and my shoes for me.

111
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:56,388
Thank you.

112
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:12,708
Okay, for the first exercise…

113
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,714
we’d do some improvisation.

114
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:21,337
I’m going to ask you to keep talking to each other by using numbers.

115
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,811
I’ll give you the scenario for this first exercise.

116
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:29,965
Let’s say Jessie used to steal a boyfriend from Dawan.

117
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:33,897
So, Wan is here to take him back.

118
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:34,880
Got it?

119
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:35,954
Yes.

120
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,468
The most important thing is the inner feeling of your character.

121
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:40,800
You can start when you’re ready.

122
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,262
1

123
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:43,565
2

124
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:44,754
3

125
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,114
4

126
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:47,748
5

127
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:49,268
6

128
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:50,845
7

129
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,320
8

130
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:54,628
9

131
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:55,520
10

132
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:56,537
11

133
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,434
12 ,13

134
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,720
Brilliant!

135
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:02,068
23

136
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,680
24

137
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:05,280
25

138
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:06,685
26

139
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:07,954
27

140
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,011
28

141
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:11,257
29

142
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,194
30

143
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,325
31

144
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:17,360
What were you thinking or feeling when you count those numbers?

145
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,737
Well, just like what you told us to think.

146
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,131
32

147
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:22,400
33

148
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:23,622
34

149
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:25,131
35

150
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:29,280
Wan did a great job. Jessie, don’t let her win.

151
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:31,051
45

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,262
46

153
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,485
47

154
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:34,914
48

155
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,514
49

156
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:37,620
Well done!

157
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,360
Give and Take

158
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,965
If you ask me,

159
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:42,460
both of you did a really good job.

160
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,771
You didn’t hesitate to express your feelings, or worry about what you’d say.

161
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:47,211
50

162
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:48,742
51

163
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,388
52

164
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:51,817
53

165
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:52,891
54

166
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:54,297
55

167
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:59,017
You two were doing it at the same tempo.

168
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,371
She attacked you at this tempo, and you retaliated back at the same tempo.

169
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,240
56

170
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:03,462
57

171
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:04,891
58

172
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:10,440
Now, let’s try to feel more than what you speak out.

173
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:11,954
67

174
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:13,371
68

175
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:14,834
69

176
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:16,400
70

177
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:19,234
Who’s the victim here?

178
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:21,657
81

179
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:22,891
82

180
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:24,571
83

181
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:25,622
You.

182
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:29,954
She’s going to take back the one you stole from her.

183
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,702
But that was because you love him.

184
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:33,817
84

185
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:34,971
85

186
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:36,114
86

187
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,310
87

188
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,331
88

189
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:41,474
You fought for life but she took all the credits.

190
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,920
But now you already have what used to belong to her.

191
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,782
She even dares to come take it back from you.

192
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,490
89 , 90 , 91

193
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,571
92 , 93

194
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,891
She stole your loved one.

195
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,920
But what if it wasn’t her fault?

196
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,605
What if your loved one also loves her too?

197
00:11:58,971 --> 00:11:59,794
98

198
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,097
99

199
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:02,765
100

200
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,982
Make a good use of the improvisation.

201
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,605
Don’t worry about the tempo.

202
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,314
Keep attacking, no backing down. 	Don’t worry about anything.

203
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:11,622
Ready?

204
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:15,348
Please start when you’re ready.

205
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,702
1 , 2 , 3 , 4

206
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:23,234
Wan.

207
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,782
She took your loved one.

208
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:29,154
5

209
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,457
6

210
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:31,680
7

211
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,537
8

212
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
How important is loved one to you?

213
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:38,080
Think about the good moments you spent together.

214
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,782
What do you want to say to her?

215
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:41,302
Do you want to curse her?

216
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,382
All those swear words you have in your mind, just say it.

217
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:46,891
9

218
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:47,885
10

219
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,154
11

220
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,457
12

221
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,531
13

222
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:55,508
Who’s the victim here?

223
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:58,000
14

224
00:12:58,662 --> 00:12:59,691
15

225
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:01,908
16

226
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:03,645
17

227
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:05,200
18

228
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:08,068
19 , 20 , 21 , 22

229
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:10,925
You could have started by talking to her nicely.

230
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:14,411
But then she wouldn’t listen anyway.

231
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:16,011
23

232
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,651
24

233
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,045
25

234
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,977
26 , 27 , 28

235
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,502
What’s the problem here? Why does she have to hurt you?

236
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:27,740
29

237
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,537
30

238
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,650
31 , 32 , 33

239
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,885
You can also imagine other background stories for your character.

240
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,600
What has the other done to you?

241
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:41,394
34

242
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:43,005
35 , 36

243
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,011
37

244
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,280
38

245
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:49,828
If it hurts so much…

246
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,217
that you want to let go of your physical control,

247
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:57,760
then let it be.

248
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:59,211
39

249
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:00,125
40

250
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,160
41 , 42

251
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:03,154
Wan!

252
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,554
Are you okay, Jess?

253
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:08,571
I’m okay.

254
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,160
Okay, girls.

255
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,097
Let’s take a deep breath.

256
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,171
Take a deep breath, both of you.

257
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,845
Wan, you have to concern about the safety of your co-star too.

258
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:20,388
Are you okay, Jess?

259
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:21,371
Yes, Coach.

260
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:23,370
If you’re not all right, just be honest, okay?

261
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,160
Okay.

262
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,680
Let’s take a break first. Go freshen up and drink some water.

263
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,274
We’ll do another exercise after the break.

264
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,080
- Okay?
- Yes, Coach.

265
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:37,497
Kim, give me water.

266
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,582
If you know any talented stylist who is also very patient, please let me know right the way.

267
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:23,348
Thank you.

268
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,600
Thank you.

269
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:43,748
Toon, I bought it for you too.

270
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:51,771
How did you know I also like Latte?

271
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,365
So, you do?

272
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,365
I have a habit of analysing the characters in the films or dramas.

273
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:02,822
You look tough and cool on the outside,

274
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,754
but you’re more likely to be very sweet and gentle inside.

275
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,651
So, I figured you might prefer a Latte.

276
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:10,125
Am I right?

277
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:12,982
Cheers?

278
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:19,097
I’ve got to go. The class is waiting.

279
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:26,057
Why? Why do you have to hurt me like this?

280
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,057
What did I do to you?

281
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:29,930
You didn’t even love her.

282
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,000
Why did you take her away from me? It hurt so much.

283
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:34,902
Please give her back to me.

284
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:12,857
What’s the matter, Kim?

285
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,604
Can you find a stylist for Wan?

286
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:21,234
Not yet.

287
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:24,331
I’ve asked around but still couldn’t find anyone.

288
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:26,685
Wan is really picky.

289
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,251
She said you’re the best stylist for her.

290
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,257
I don’t know what to do now.

291
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:41,165
I know someone.

292
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,222
Do you want me to talk to her?

293
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:44,262
Sure.

294
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,005
Thank you so much.

295
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,281
Give me more water.

296
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:04,218
Wan, our client has confirmed on the new advertisement.

297
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,544
Let’s sort out your schedule.

298
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:08,435
Later then. I have to do the workshop first.

299
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:17,007
All right, everyone.

300
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,698
Break time is over.

301
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,744
Are you ready?

302
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,595
Let’s move on to the second exercise.

303
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:24,990
This time, you'd get into your role.

304
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,252
The previous exercise was just a warmup.

305
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,881
You got to draw out your emotions and feel them.

306
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,630
Now, let’s try getting into your role.

307
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,180
We’d analyze the character.

308
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,475
- And analyze...
- I’m here!

309
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:39,304
Hello, Coach.

310
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:42,161
- I’m not late. It was the traffic jam.
- Aha.

311
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:45,150
Wow, who are these people Coach? Lots of them here today.

312
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,395
Pat, can you hear me?

313
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,018
- Yes.
- Please remove it.

314
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,247
Your shoes too.

315
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,052
- Put them away.
- Okay.

316
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:57,144
Pat.

317
00:18:58,161 --> 00:18:59,407
My student.

318
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,944
He’ll be my assistant in this exercise.

319
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,470
You might not believe it but he’s going to become a lead actor soon.

320
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,790
He played a supporting role in the last series.

321
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:10,560
Just one series and he got famous.

322
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,687
Oh, just like Wan then.

323
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:14,755
She starred in one series and got famous after that.

324
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:19,727
Yeah, some people have to play many roles before they’d become famous.

325
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,532
Coach, why didn’t you tell me there’re many people here today?

326
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:26,572
You know both of them anyway. It’s Jessie and Dawan.

327
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:28,424
Dawan?

328
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:32,778
You should’ve told me Dawan would be here.

329
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:36,184
I’m your FC, Dawan.

330
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:38,972
I watch all of your advertisements.

331
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:40,732
I really like her.

332
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:41,944
Just a minute.

333
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,515
- Are you Dawan’s manager?
- Yes. I’m.

334
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:49,190
Can you please take a picture for me? Just one.

335
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:51,290
Okay.

336
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,584
- Thank you.
- No problem.

337
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,652
Dawan, can you take a picture with me?

338
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,830
Jessie too. Just one photo.

339
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:00,001
Come and sit here.

340
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:02,355
- Come on, just one photo.
- Of course.

341
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,521
Please move a bit closer.

342
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:12,812
All right then. 1 2 3!

343
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,138
Okay.

344
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,220
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

345
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,030
- Can I post it on my social media? There’s nothing secret here, right?
- No, you can’t.

346
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,350
Why? Oh…okay.

347
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,670
- You can’t.
- Okay.

348
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:25,510
Take this back.

349
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,361
Okay, are you ready?

350
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:31,715
Yes.

351
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,292
Jessie.

352
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:36,538
Okay.

353
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:41,041
First, let’s take a deep breath.

354
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:41,841
Pat.

355
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:43,852
Pat.

356
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:45,167
Pat!

357
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:46,778
Huh? Okay.

358
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,441
Okay, I’m ready.

359
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:51,875
Have you memorized your script?

360
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,178
Yes.

361
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:55,910
Let’s start from…Wan and Pat.

362
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:56,880
Jessie, just sit there and watch first.

363
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,727
Yes, Coach.

364
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,675
Ready?

365
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,035
Come.

366
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,047
Let’s start.

367
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:18,047
Coach, I’m too nervous to act with her.

368
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,418
I’m so excited.

369
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,410
Pat.

370
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:28,652
Haven’t I told you that a good actor must be able to get into the role?

371
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:30,750
- I know.
- Aha.

372
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,430
But I’m nervous.

373
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,595
Why are you nervous?

374
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:38,744
Because you’re still Pat and not the character you’re playing, aren’t you?

375
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:41,210
What do I have to do?

376
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,138
What’s your character?

377
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,824
I’m Kirk.

378
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:46,287
Who’s she?

379
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:48,801
She’s Sam.

380
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,367
Kirk and Sam.

381
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:54,160
Okay.

382
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:56,755
Now, focus and let’s do it.

383
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:04,972
Sam, talk to me first.

384
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:05,955
Let me go.

385
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,430
Let me go.

386
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:10,618
I said let go!

387
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:15,475
I know you’re upset but I did all that because of you.

388
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,110
I’m begging you. Please don’t break up with me just because of this.

389
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,755
Just?

390
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,521
You said ‘just’ because of this?

391
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,127
I can’t even trust you with our work, how can I trust you with other things else?

392
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,767
I’m not going to break up with you.

393
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,315
We’re about to get married, Sam.

394
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:37,430
Don’t touch me.

395
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:41,167
I can’t marry you.

396
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:43,864
I already have a girlfriend.

397
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:46,024
Mon is my girlfriend.

398
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,121
Are you kidding me?

399
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,544
I’ll have to break up with you anyway.

400
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:02,127
Let’s call off our engagement then.

401
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,110
Because I already have a girlfriend.

402
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:21,620
(Clapping)

403
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,740
Let’s hear it for yourself.

404
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,290
(Clapping)

405
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,212
You all have done well. Good job, everyone.

406
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:34,892
Are you really going to break up with me?

407
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:40,435
You seemed a lot happier when you were with that woman.

408
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:42,927
Do you know how hurt I am?

409
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,058
I don’t want to put up with this feeling anymore.

410
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,007
I’m sorry.

411
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,521
I’ll stop seeing her.

412
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,304
You’re my one and only happiness.

413
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,978
I promise I won’t make you feel bad ever again.

414
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:08,835
- Ouch.
- Oh, sorry.

415
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,458
I’m sorry.

416
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:11,350
Are you hurt?

417
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,790
I’m okay.

418
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:13,890
I’m sorry.

419
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,418
Coach, I think I need to take a break.

420
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:18,584
Okay.

421
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:23,490
I’m nervous.

422
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,967
What’s wrong, Pat?

423
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:30,080
Well, I…I can’t do it.

424
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,275
Let’s get yourself together. Take a deep breath.

425
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:33,790
Okay.

426
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,372
I’m serious. Stay focus in what you’re doing. Let your heart guide you.

427
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:39,890
- Got it?
- Use your heart.

428
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,281
Let it lead the way.

429
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:42,812
- Okay?
- Okay.

430
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:43,570
I’m okay.

431
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,430
So, ready?

432
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,144
Yes.

433
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,841
Wan, it’s your turn then.

434
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:49,372
Let’s give it a try.

435
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,550
Okay.

436
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,264
Are you okay, Jessie?

437
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,727
Yes.

438
00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,572
So, your character really loves this man no matter what.

439
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,287
But you’re mad at him.

440
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,435
So, don’t forgive him just yet. You’re still mad at him.

441
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:08,230
Wait for him to approach you first.

442
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:09,601
Okay?

443
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:10,847
Ready?

444
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,795
Pat, are you ready?

445
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:13,030
Yes.

446
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,852
Okay.

447
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:15,704
Let my heart lead the way.

448
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,470
That’s right.

449
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,835
Okay then. 5 4 3 2…

450
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,092
Are you sure you’re going to break up with me?

451
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:34,241
You seemed a lot happier when you were with that woman.

452
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:37,567
I’m sorry.

453
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:40,572
I’ll stop seeing her.

454
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:44,252
You’re my one and only happiness.

455
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:49,281
I promise I won’t make you feel bad ever again.

456
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:22,824
How was it, Coach?

457
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:24,730
It was awesome.

458
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,390
Wan, are you okay?

459
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:28,210
Yes.

460
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,178
I’m sorry.

461
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:30,310
It’s all right.

462
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,715
I let my heart lead the way like Coach said.

463
00:26:34,504 --> 00:26:36,270
All right then, let’s take a break.

464
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,567
Good job, everyone.

465
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:39,898
(Clapping)

466
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:41,247
Well, well, well…

467
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:43,658
Let your heart lead the way.

468
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,190
Just like what Coach said.

469
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:46,270
Okay.

470
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,841
- Amazing, isn’t it?
- Ah

471
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:13,864
We have to talk, Kim.

472
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:22,915
Let’s talk somewhere else.

473
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,790
No, I’m going to do it right here.

474
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,647
What do you want to talk to me?

475
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:35,304
I’m sorry I was rude to you.

476
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,121
You know what Jessie is like a liar and always envy others.

477
00:27:39,715 --> 00:27:41,544
Please don’t say that about her.

478
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,167
Why are you defending her?

479
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:48,870
Is it because you’re working for her now?

480
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,658
Has she already brainwashed you with her money?

481
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:53,784
It’s not about the money.

482
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:56,458
It’s…

483
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:03,464
Then tell me, why do you go work for my enemy?

484
00:28:04,012 --> 00:28:06,332
Or do you hate me that much?

485
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,601
I don’t have to tell you why.

486
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,504
This is my life.

487
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,807
I can do whatever I want.

488
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:22,184
Let’s go our own way from now on.

489
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,624
I’m sorry, Wan. Sorry I have to act like I hate you in front of Jessie.

490
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,310
We have to talk, Kim.

491
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,047
Let’s talk somewhere else.

492
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:38,610
(Car breaking)

493
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:55,860
I’m sorry, Sis.

494
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,430
The organizer said that the groom’s mother still couldn’t settle the dowry.

495
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,595
So, they can’t pay me and my team yet.

496
00:30:05,018 --> 00:30:06,510
And for the other groom and bride,

497
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:12,252
they want us to…to set up everything including the flowers by tonight.

498
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,041
So, let’s say…

499
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:22,607
After this job is done, I’ll settle all the payments with you at once, okay?

500
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:24,538
I’m really sorry, Sis.

501
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:25,521
Yes.

502
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:27,098
Yes.

503
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,755
Drink some water first, Mum.

504
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:38,584
Thank you.

505
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,344
How long will the flower shop owner let you postpone the payment?

506
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:47,270
What else can I do? The client still hasn’t paid me.

507
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:55,590
And I can’t stand seeing the groom and bride welcoming their guests in front of the empty backdrop with only a few bunches of flowers.

508
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,664
I can’t stand that.

509
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:01,830
A wedding is the most important event in a lifetime for them. I have to my best for the client.

510
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:04,470
Yes?

511
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:19,610
Tell our daily staff to start setting up everything. Let’s do our best.

512
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,807
And bring in the flowers. Make sure it’s done by tonight.

513
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:24,801
I’ll use my money to pay for them first.

514
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:26,698
Yeah, okay.

515
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:30,538
Make it as fab as you can. Get it done by tonight.

516
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:33,247
Okay?

517
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:39,361
- (Incoming message)
– [IDF BANK: You have received a transfer of 150,000 baht to your account xxx-x-x5489-x]

518
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,967
Why did you do that? I still have some money.

519
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,212
You have worked so hard. You have to save up too, Kim.

520
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:53,475
Just use it, Mum.

521
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,230
I’d ask you to pay me back when I’m in need of money.

522
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:01,647
But I’m going to charge you a 30% interest rate.

523
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:05,590
Wow, that’s a lot.

524
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:11,521
Thank you, dear.

525
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,338
Once my job is done, I promise I’ll transfer it back to you.

526
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:24,550
Did you go out? I thought you said you’d rest.

527
00:32:24,824 --> 00:32:26,207
Did you go help Wan with her work?

528
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:28,584
No, Mum.

529
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,755
I’m workig for Jessie as her stylist.

530
00:32:33,258 --> 00:32:38,035
Hmm? Is she the one who has a scandal with Wan?

531
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:39,235
Yes.

532
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,898
She also asked me to look after her work schedule.

533
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:45,292
Like her personal manager.

534
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:48,161
But…I’m not feeling good about this.

535
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,527
Then why didn’t you say no?

536
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:56,492
There’s more to this than meet the eyes.

537
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,784
So, I had to agree to do it.

538
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:03,875
Even so, you don’t have to force yourself if you don’t want to.

539
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:07,921
Kim, listen to me.

540
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:14,778
When you have to force yourself to do anything, or do something that makes yourself unhappy…

541
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:18,401
Nothing good ever comes out of it. Remember my words.

542
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,270
I know, Mum.

543
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:24,104
I’ll wait until Wan’s audition is done.

544
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,612
I’m sure things might get better after that.

545
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:31,384
It’s about Wan again.

546
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:36,344
Well, you’re all grown up now. I’m not going to interfere.

547
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,127
You probably have your own reason that you couldn’t tell me.

548
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:44,538
But if you ever need my help, please let me know.

549
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:49,201
Thank you, Mum.

550
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,332
You’ll be out for work tonight, right?

551
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:56,938
Can I go help?

552
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:02,458
I miss it. It’s been so long since I last helped you arranged the flowers.

553
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:04,790
Really? Can you do it though.

554
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:09,190
Look at you. You look like someone who hasn’t slept for days.

555
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,195
Really? Can you do it though.

556
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:16,538
Really? Can you do it though.

557
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:22,950
I also want to know if you still remember what I taught you.

558
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,224
Will you do it as good as I do?

559
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:27,384
Go take a shower first.

560
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:28,961
Then we can leave together.

561
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:44,420
(Turning on a tap + water coming out)
Do you hate me so much that you have to go work for my arch enemy?

562
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,611
(water streaming out)
I don’t have to tell you why.

563
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:49,605
(water streaming out)
It’s my life. I can do whatever I want.

564
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:54,497
(water streaming out)
Let’s go our own way from now on.

565
00:34:54,497 --> 00:35:00,540
(water streaming out)

566
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,660
(door opening)

567
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,388
(door closing)

568
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:33,685
Wan

569
00:35:35,274 --> 00:35:36,062
Kim

570
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:39,880
Kim, you came back to me, right?

571
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:41,902
I’m here to warn you.

572
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:49,514
Please be nice to Jessie. It’s all for your own good.

573
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,417
Even in our dream, you still defend her.

574
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:56,508
Stop focusing on me.

575
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,051
And focus on your future instead.

576
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:02,508
Do your best.

577
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:04,851
Haven’t we talked about this?

578
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:09,765
That my future must have you in there too.

579
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:14,931
You’ve always stayed by my side.

580
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:18,508
You gave me encouragement. And helped me with my career plan.

581
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:20,931
Until I can be where I am today.

582
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:25,708
Why did you leave me to walk alone all of the sudden?

583
00:36:26,245 --> 00:36:29,260
You’re talented. You can do it.

584
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:36,028
No. Since you’ve left me, everything in my life has gone wrong.

585
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,714
I’m not going to let you go anywhere.

586
00:36:42,462 --> 00:36:43,205
(running)
Kim.

587
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:45,057
Kim.

588
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:47,251
Kim.

589
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:49,525
Kim.

590
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:51,891
Kim.

591
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:54,360
Kim.

592
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:56,965
Kim.

593
00:36:58,817 --> 00:36:59,651
Kim.

594
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:03,331
Kim.

595
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,580
Kim!!

596
00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:17,410
This dish is macaroni with mayonnaise…

597
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,300
served with truffle sausage…

598
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,137
and Kurobuta pork…

599
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:24,554
that we have sous-vided for 72 hours. Please enjoy your meal.

600
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:28,097
That’s a special dish at my restaurant. Eat up.

601
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:31,982
Excuse me?

602
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,994
That’s better. Now, eat.

603
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:44,140
Neh, I have to attend the fashion week next week. I don’t want to gain weight.

604
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:46,954
Just a bite will do.

605
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:48,370
(Sigh)

606
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,691
No appetite.

607
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:03,331
Are you still worried about Kim so much that you even dreamt about it?

608
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:04,177
Yeah.

609
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,902
You’re being paranoid.

610
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:10,302
เลย     I used to dream I were Park Seo-Joon’s wife.

611
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,297
But then I woke up and realized I was still single.

612
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,251
It was just a dream after all.

613
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:17,902
It’s not the same.

614
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:20,588
My dream…

615
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:22,885
is so real.

616
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:27,068
Things that I can’t tell Kim in real life,

617
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:29,788
I can tell her in my dream.

618
00:38:30,028 --> 00:38:32,531
And things that we can’t do in real life,

619
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,702
we can also do them in my dream.

620
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,600
What did you do?

621
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,300
Well…

622
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,520
Wait.

623
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,150
Chef, I think our restaurant looks so fabulous right now.

624
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,030
It’s so beautiful but…

625
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:55,502
Don’t you think we are too far apart?

626
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:59,514
Can we remove one table here?

627
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:04,714
- Please take care of it for me. I like it private. Thank you.
- Yes.

628
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:12,965
- Just a second.
- Okay.

629
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,337
Thank you, Chef.

630
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,640
Please give us some time.

631
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,165
Now, tell me what was it that you dreamt about?

632
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:32,268
Well, I dreamt about…

633
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:34,474
us apologizing to each other.

634
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,982
Whenever Kim and I had a quarrel,

635
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:40,074
we would say sorry to each other in my dream.

636
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,760
When we woke up, everything was as good as new.

637
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:44,470
It’s been like this since when we were young.

638
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,380
Huh? You’ve started dreaming of Kim since when you were young?

639
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,297
Yeah, I’ve dreamt of her since when I was very little.

640
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,662
Does Kim know about this?

641
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,948
Why would I tell her?

642
00:39:56,142 --> 00:39:58,257
She would think I’m nuts.

643
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,400
You’re the only one who knows about this.

644
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:05,971
Even my psychiatrist doesn’t know about it.

645
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:10,302
But if you’re this worried,

646
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,091
you should tell it to your psychiatrist.

647
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:18,108
Let’s do this. I’m going to help you.

648
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:20,100
I’ll come up with a plan.

649
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,491
I’ll team up with Mali.

650
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:25,617
And arrange a gathering for our gang.

651
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,108
Then I will observe if Kim really hates you like she said in your dream.

652
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:33,091
What do you think?

653
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:34,440
What do you think?

654
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:36,142
I think it’s a really good idea.

655
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,497
- Li.
- What’s up, Mon?

656
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:45,525
I need your help. It’s about Wan.

657
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:47,520
I’m busy, let’s talk later.

658
00:40:47,537 --> 00:40:50,222
My baby is crying. Talk later then.

659
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:55,948
She’s busy looking after her baby.

660
00:40:56,965 --> 00:40:57,800
Mali.

661
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,091
Hey, Mon just called.

662
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:06,640
- So, did Dokrak ask you to meet her here?
- Yeah.

663
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,897
Where’s she then?

664
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:09,788
There she is.

665
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,291
Let’s go.

666
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,820
Thank you very much.

667
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,400
- Please come by again.
- Thank you.

668
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:39,457
Kim. Mali. I’m so sorry.

669
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:40,680
It’s all right.

670
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,560
I’m sorry I didn’t go out to welcome you.

671
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,851
I’m so busy these days.

672
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:46,268
It’s all right.

673
00:41:47,514 --> 00:41:50,657
Let’s get down to the business, shall we?

674
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,460
- Yes.
- So that you can continue with your work.

675
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,411
That’s great.

676
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,337
I’d like you to work for Wan as her stylist.

677
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,102
You want me to take Kim’s place as her stylist?

678
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,000
That’s right. Dawan is going international.

679
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:09,948
So, I want someone talented as her stylist.

680
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,880
You had just finished your job as a stylist in New York, right?

681
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:18,062
So, I thought you’re the perfect person for this job.

682
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:21,788
But Kim already does an amazing job.

683
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,165
Why don’t you continue working for Dawan?

684
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:28,131
Well, Dawan and I had a serious quarrel.

685
00:42:28,828 --> 00:42:31,731
I don’t think we’d be able to continue working together.

686
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,377
So, I decided to quit.

687
00:42:33,948 --> 00:42:35,000
And one more thing,

688
00:42:35,697 --> 00:42:37,690
I’m now working for Jessie.

689
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,657
Jessie?! Is she the one who…

690
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:47,217
Yes. Please say yes and help my friend.

691
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:50,737
I don’t want you to think of it as returning the favour but…

692
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,760
do you still remember who made you get close to Pam?

693
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:56,577
Do you?

694
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:57,524
(Laughing)

695
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,971
Okay, I got it.

696
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:02,200
Let me check my schedule first.

697
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,228
If I have any gap, I’ll definitely go help Dawan.

698
00:43:06,074 --> 00:43:07,480
Thank you so much.

699
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,034
Are you going to work for Wan?

700
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:10,554
I won’t allow that.

701
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:12,760
One hot americano, please.

702
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:19,948
- Pam.
- Pam.

703
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,657
Hmm, Pam.

704
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:27,580
Your beauty has never dropped since you were still in school.

705
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,940
No, you’re wrong. She’s got even more beautiful.

706
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:37,308
Honey, I have to go to Jah’s wedding next week. Can you find me a dress?

707
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:40,828
Jah? The one who is a patient at your dental clinic, right?

708
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:41,980
You can count on me.

709
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:45,925
Hang on, are you two lovers?

710
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:49,297
Yes, right after we finished school.

711
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:51,160
So adorable.

712
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:58,470
So, Dokrak, what about being a stylist for Dawan?

713
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,131
Do you agree to do it?

714
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,740
Please relay my words to Dawan.

715
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,700
If she wants someone to do something for her,

716
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,880
she should’ve come here and ask for it herself.

717
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:10,062
Don’t just ask anyone to do it for her like this.

718
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,720
If she doesn’t come here herself,

719
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:13,765
I’m not going to let Dokrak work for her.

720
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,342
Okay, fine.

721
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:32,588
Wan would never go ask Pam for a favour.

722
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:35,754
Those two were rivals at school.

723
00:44:36,497 --> 00:44:38,634
Yeah, I thought so too.

724
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:44,520
Hey, what do you think about Pam and Dokrak seeing each other?

725
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:47,902
They look adorable together.

726
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:56,474
So, you’re no longer against people of the same sex dating each other?

727
00:44:56,588 --> 00:44:57,274
Yeah.

728
00:44:57,845 --> 00:45:02,097
After all, two people falling in love with each other is a good thing.

729
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,211
As long as they don’t cause anyone a problem.

730
00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:07,091
Unlike Wan’s father and mine.

731
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,737
Okay, I know how you feel. Let’s not talk about it.

732
00:45:11,034 --> 00:45:15,340
So, about Wan, you better let me take care of it.

733
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:15,880
Okay.

734
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,697
Okay. Let’s go eat.

735
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,788
(phone ringing)

736
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:24,600
It’s Jessie.

737
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:28,771
Hi, Jessie.

738
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:32,771
I’m busy.

739
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,451
Can I go later?

740
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:38,485
Okay.

741
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,120
I have to go now. Jessie asked me to pick her up.

742
00:45:44,314 --> 00:45:47,000
But you still haven’t eaten anything.

743
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,982
See you later then.

744
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,620
- I’m sorry.
- It’s okay.

745
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,400
- See you later.
- It’s all right.

746
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,297
- Go pick her up.  See you.
- See you.

Is everything ready?

784
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,725
Oh, do I look beautiful yet?

785
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:29,102
Wow!

786
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:31,754
So Gatsby!

787
00:47:31,971 --> 00:47:32,965
So beautiful!

788
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,514
Wait.

789
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:36,257
Yes?

790
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,200
- Us two…
- Yeah?

791
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,250
- Are definitely Gatsby.
- And?

792
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,765
What are you?

793
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:42,794
Gatsby, of course.

794
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,590
How?

795
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:46,188
- Well, when I texted you guys…
- Aha?

796
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:48,980
I kind of forgot to say Gatsby as in ‘Guinea Pig’.

797
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,450
The theme today is actually a guinea pig.

798
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,880
Can you see the tail?

799
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:55,971
- Jeez!
- Cute, isn’t it?

800
00:47:56,257 --> 00:47:58,390
You forgot to mention the main part!

801
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,990
- A guinea pig?
- Yeah.

802
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,085
We all thought you meant the Great Gatsby.

803
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:05,740
This costume costs me an arm and a leg.

804
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,130
But it’s fabulous. You look gorgeous in it.

805
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,980
So, the end.

806
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,210
- That’s it?
- Yes, so stop complaining.

807
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,822
I’m going to say hi to the others.

808
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:18,931
Oh, you look so gorgeous today. Nice makeup indeed. I gotta go.

809
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:21,262
What the heck?

810
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:22,531
Kim

811
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,720
When Wan, Pam, and Dokrak arrive…

812
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,660
let me do the talking with Wan about asking Dokrak to be her stylist.

813
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:35,320
You just act innocent like, ‘Oh, I have no idea.’

814
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,180
Just play along, okay?

815
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,085
Okay

816
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:39,811
Let’s take more pictures.

817
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:43,720
Wan, when are you coming?

818
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,416
They are all here.

819
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,160
Where? Left?

820
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,232
Oh my goodness! Dawan, the hope of our generation.

821
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:01,368
You look so gorgeous! Fabulous!

822
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:03,360
So, who else are here?

823
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,200
Well, there’s Mali…and Kimhan.

824
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,120
Hey, where are you going?

825
00:49:11,146 --> 00:49:12,200
Is this your plan?

826
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,693
- Nope. But it’s good, isn’t it?
- (Sigh)

827
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,340
So that we can observe Kim and see whether she really hates you or not.

828
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,253
Such a good opportunity, right?

829
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:27,506
Come on, it’s so hot out here.

830
00:49:27,586 --> 00:49:31,520
Look at the sun. Let’s go inside. It’s boiling!

831
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,906
Chop, chop. You’re a sight for sore eyes today.

832
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:37,040
1 2 3.

833
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
Nice.

834
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:40,650
- More, more.
- 1 2 3.

835
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:47,480
- Wow, you look great.
- Girls, the hope of our generation Dawan is here!

836
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:56,180
(wind blowing + leaves falling)

837
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:03,700
You girls enjoy.

838
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,020
I’ll go prepare the food.

839
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,920
Miss celebrity, you’re late.

840
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,840
Come take a picture with me.

841
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:15,946
Come on.

842
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,180
Oh! I almost put on a red lipstick like you do.

843
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,520
It’s good that I didn’t. Or else you’d definitely lose to my beauty.

844
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

845
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,240
Put on a nice smile.

846
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,060
1 2

847
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,533
1 2 3

848
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,800
Come on, smile a bit.

849
00:50:32,093 --> 00:50:35,610
1 2 3, smile! Smile to the camera, Wan.

850
00:50:52,986 --> 00:51:00,240
Wan, about your headache, you should go see a doctor.

851
00:51:00,453 --> 00:51:03,090
I don’t want you to die.

852
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,066
I want to have a celebrity friend, not a ghost friend.

853
00:51:07,226 --> 00:51:08,440
Wan, are you not well?

854
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,853
Yes, she’s not well.

855
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:18,360
Does Kim look a little concerned about you?

856
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:21,106
Not at all.

857
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:32,733
Well, I think you’re not feeling well because you overwork and there’s no one to help you. Right?

858
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,653
Do you want me and…Kim to help you?

859
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,706
With what?

860
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:45,426
Hmm, Kim and I happen to know a great stylist.

861
00:51:45,453 --> 00:51:51,253
But you must go and ask her yourself.

862
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:52,213
Ask who?

863
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,560
Hello, girls.

864
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:03,920
Pannarai.

865
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:04,906
Dawan.

866
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,786
Hey, why do they have to call each other by their first name?

867
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:12,853
Because they’re not close.

868
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,186
Okay, got it.

869
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,973
This one is a Beurre Blanc sauce.

870
00:52:31,386 --> 00:52:32,693
Enjoy your meal.

871
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,770
Please enjoy your meal.

872
00:52:50,813 --> 00:52:53,160
Kim, try it. It’s so good.

873
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,760
- I’ll have to pass. I’m on a diet.
- Yes, ma’am.

874
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,560
This one is a dessert made from fresh pears, and served with passion fruits granita.

875
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,733
The soup is made from beetroot, tomato consommé, and vanilla syrup.

876
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:21,320
Allow me to pour you the soup.

877
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:27,400
Bon Appetit.

878
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,866
Thank you.

879
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:33,200
This is the last dish on the course, let’s drink to it, everyone.

880
00:53:33,786 --> 00:53:35,840
Cheers!

881
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:40,653
Will there by any other guests coming?

882
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,650
Hmm, it’s just us.

883
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:50,280
I actually sent out an invitation to a hundred of them but they’re the only people available.

884
00:53:50,586 --> 00:53:51,410
It’s pretty cozy.

885
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,413
Yes.

886
00:53:58,266 --> 00:54:00,720
Are you guys up to something?

887
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,480
You can tell me now.

888
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:11,933
Well, the stylist that I mentioned earlier is actually here too. That’s her, Dokrak.

889
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,813
Hi, I’m Dokrak.

890
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:20,240
No, I don’t want anyone else. I only want Kim as my stylist.

891
00:54:21,026 --> 00:54:24,253
Tsk, you’ve never changed.

892
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:26,586
So full of yourself.

893
00:54:26,706 --> 00:54:28,693
Everyone is trying to help you.

894
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:29,986
You!

895
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,493
Calm down, girls.

896
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,880
Wan, I know you’re really picky.

897
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:43,810
That’s why Kim and I have asked Dokrak to be your stylist.

898
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:47,620
But if you still insist to work with no one but Kim, then so be it.

899
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:55,106
There’s an easy way out. Just let Kim come back to work for me again. I trust no one but her.

900
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,450
What if Kim dies, will you ever trust anyone else?

901
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,426
No way, I’d rather die before her.

902
00:55:02,853 --> 00:55:04,960
Wan, please listen to me.

903
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,880
No.

904
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:09,000
You want to win so much that you’re willing to die first?

905
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,160
There’re things you can’t control. Please try to be more flexible.

906
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,173
Otherwise, it’d be so hard for you to live with other people.

907
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:15,520
Hey, you!

908
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,426
Honey, let’s go home.

909
00:55:17,973 --> 00:55:19,666
Are we leaving?

910
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,520
Yes. Don’t waste your time helping someone like her.

911
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:24,930
Goodbye, everyone.

912
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,860
- Hey, Pam!
- Goodbye

913
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,706
Pam, wait! Don’t go yet.

914
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,666
Wan, you shouldn’t have said something like that to her.

915
00:55:36,693 --> 00:55:38,133
You speak harshly.

916
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:39,090
Wan!

917
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:39,940
Who ask for you help?

918
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,900
What? Why are you like this?

919
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,980
- Everyone is willing to help you.
- Jeez! Stop!

920
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,680
Cut it off, both of you.

921
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,893
Wan, you should stop picking a fight with everyone you meet.

922
00:55:48,906 --> 00:55:51,186
You hardly have any friend.

923
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:53,493
It’s been so long since the four of us came together.

924
00:55:53,653 --> 00:55:56,093
Come on. Let’s eat.

925
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,426
Mali.

926
00:55:58,866 --> 00:56:00,253
Hurry up.

927
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:02,440
Sit down.

928
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,866
And calm down too.

929
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,293
I have prepared a special course for you guys.

930
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,506
Calm down, okay?

931
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,740
I heard it.

932
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,060
Okay

933
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,200
Just go back to your seat.

934
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,053
- Kim!
- Kim, are you all right?

935
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,490
Are you all right?

936
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,020
Yeah.

937
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,973
Are you sure?

938
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,600
Kim!

939
00:56:23,893 --> 00:56:26,160
- Kim!
- Kim!

940
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,740
Kim!

941
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:27,370
Kimhan!

942
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,130
Let’s get her to the back of the shop.

943
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:29,720
Okay.

944
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,660
- Okay
- Quickly.

945
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,500
Where to put her?

946
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,000
- Here. / - Over here.

947
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,360
- Easy there.
- Easy there.

948
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,360
- Wait. / - What?

949
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,800
- Where’s the cloth?
- It’s your restaurant.

950
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,840
- Mine? Oh, okay.
- Just a second, Wan.

951
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,820
Damn! Where’s it?

952
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,970
- Go get a bowl over there.
- What bowl?

953
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,480
I’ll get a cloth, you go get the bowl over there.

954
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,980
- Here’s the cloth.
- We need water too.

955
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,140
Hurry up.

956
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,170
Mali, hurry up.

957
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,800
Coming.

958
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,340
Take it.

959
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,266
Oh my God!

960
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,560
Here, take it.

961
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,480
- Took you so long.
-  Ow!

962
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,853
Wring the cloth first.

963
00:57:03,106 --> 00:57:04,000
I’ll put it over here.

964
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,053
Ow!

965
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:08,980
Wipe her face too so that she’d feel better.

966
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:15,946
She probably fainted due to a lack of rest. She also hardly ate anything.

967
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,920
I noticed that too.

968
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:22,740
Since when she went to work for Jessie, she’s been getting thinner and shabbier.

969
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:29,533
Of course, she would look shabbier. Jessie uses her non-stop from dusk till dawn.

970
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,586
She’d definitely die before Wan.

971
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,573
- Wait. Stop.
- What?

972
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:47,220
I have to tell Chef to stop cooking, and also tell the staff to stop serving food. Otherwise, it’d surely be a mess.

973
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,120
Okay.

974
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,820
Come with me.

975
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,810
- Me?
- Yes.

976
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,220
- Let’s go.
- I’ll be right back.

977
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,380
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

978
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,773
Slow down.

979
00:57:55,093 --> 00:57:57,466
Look how it turned out. Your damn plan.

980
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:00,920
Do you know today is actually my Chef’s day-off?

981
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,640
I have to pay her extra. Not to mention the material costs.

982
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,600
I spent over 100 grand on this party.

983
00:58:07,253 --> 00:58:13,013
Jeez, it’s a plan for your bestie so go and ask her to pay you back.

984
00:58:14,066 --> 00:58:19,706
I thought Wan said Kim hates her. Why is Kim helping Wan then?

985
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:23,146
I…I don’t know.

986
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:26,666
Look at me.

987
00:58:27,146 --> 00:58:28,266
What?

988
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:30,933
You look fishy.

989
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,346
Hey, you’re quite clever this time. Is it that obvious?

990
00:58:36,653 --> 00:58:38,840
Even the gecko on the ceiling can see that.

991
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,840
What are you and Kim hiding from me?

992
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,040
You two seem to be joined at the hips these days.

993
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,200
Spill it out.

994
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:51,133
If you don’t tell me, I’m going to tell your husband that you secretly talk to your ex.

995
00:58:51,413 --> 00:58:55,853
Pff…We’re just friends now. Why can’t I talk to her?

996
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,466
I’m going to colour the idea and talk him into believing it.

997
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:03,340
Fine! I’ll tell you.

998
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:04,960
That’s it.

999
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:11,880
Wow, so Kim does all this because she’s blackmailed?

1000
00:59:11,973 --> 00:59:13,440
Exactly.

1001
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,813
Look how much she has sacrificed herself for Wan.

1002
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:23,293
But you must not tell Wan about this. Your lips must be sealed.

1003
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,706
No need.

1004
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:29,613
I already know.

1005
00:59:29,853 --> 00:59:31,000
How much did you hear?

1006
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,280
Everything.

1007
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,170
Hello, Mum. Can you please look after the baby for me?

1008
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,800
Something just came up. It’s about Kim and Wan.

1009
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,066
Okay. Thank you, Mum. I’ll go back as soon as I can.

1010
00:59:51,573 --> 00:59:53,560
- Mon!
- Wan.

1011
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,320
Kim.

1012
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,880
- You’re back.
- Kim already came to. Can you get her something sweet to drink?

1013
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,980
Kim, are you okay? How are you feeling?

1014
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:01,386
Give it to me.

1015
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,960
How are you feeling?

1016
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,760
Give it to me.

1017
01:00:05,306 --> 01:00:06,610
I’m much better now.

1018
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:07,730
Let’s get you up.

1019
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,973
Slowly.

1020
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,706
Ow!

1021
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:12,840
Here

1022
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,653
Careful, Wan.

1023
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,733
Here, drink it.

1024
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,226
- Drink something sweet so that you’d feel better.
- Thank you.

1025
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,733
Thank you.

1026
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:31,026
Kim, why didn’t you tell me about Jessie?

1027
01:00:42,066 --> 01:00:48,386
Wan, now that you know, can you please don’t do anything to her?

1028
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,866
I can endure it.

1029
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:54,933
But I can’t. I can’t watch you sacrifice yourself like that for me.

1030
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,720
It will end soon.

1031
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,893
If you get casted for the Hollywood film, then it’ll all be over.

1032
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:03,800
How can you trust her?

1033
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,653
How do you know she will not send out the clip?

1034
01:01:06,906 --> 01:01:08,933
You know she can’t be trusted.

1035
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,666
That’s why I’m trying to warn you to be nice to her.

1036
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,986
Don’t pick a quarrel with her.

1037
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,800
I do all this because I want to protect you.

1038
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:27,293
Just like when you used to protect me, remember?

1039
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:41,373
Kim, thank you for doing everything for me.

1040
01:01:45,213 --> 01:01:49,413
Aww, Kim. It’s all right.

1041
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,933
Let’s have a group hug.

1042
01:01:53,386 --> 01:01:55,160
We’ll go through this together.

1043
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,060
- Group hug.
- Love you all.

1044
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,300
Love you too.

1045
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,853
I really don’t want to cry.

1046
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:04,640
- Wait.
- What?

1047
01:02:05,573 --> 01:02:07,960
What’s that wet thing on my back?

1048
01:02:08,573 --> 01:02:11,820
Oops, sorry, It’s my breast milk.

1049
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,320
Ewww.

1050
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:13,980
Sorry

1051
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,540
Ewww! Find something to wipe it off!

1052
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,960
Fine, fine. I’ll use my hands then.

1053
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,733
No, that’s dirty.

1054
01:02:20,466 --> 01:02:21,946
Let’s hug.

1055
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,560
Hug, hug.

1056
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:35,586
(door knocking)

1057
01:02:35,746 --> 01:02:36,600
(door opening)

1058
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:42,320
How are you, sweetie?

1059
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:45,840
Much better, Mum.

1060
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:51,400
I have to be at the work site tonight. The crew are waiting there.

1061
01:02:52,173 --> 01:02:53,520
Get some rest, my dear.

1062
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,560
Okay.

1063
01:02:55,186 --> 01:02:58,253
I’ll get going then.

1064
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,266
Take a lot of rest. Get well soon, sweetie.

1065
01:03:02,906 --> 01:03:03,626
I’m leaving.

1066
01:03:03,653 --> 01:03:04,573
Yes.

1067
01:03:06,986 --> 01:03:07,693
(door closing)

1068
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,826
Kim.

1069
01:03:11,306 --> 01:03:12,533
Are you feeling better?

1070
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:14,986
Why don’t you go to the hospital?

1071
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,573
Let the doctor give you saline so that you might feel better.

1072
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,413
I’m feeling better now. Don’t worry, Wan.

1073
01:03:21,773 --> 01:03:23,853
Kim, please quit your job.

1074
01:03:24,186 --> 01:03:26,640
You don’t have to torture yourself for me like that.

1075
01:03:26,946 --> 01:03:29,453
It’s my own matter, I can deal with it.

1076
01:03:29,733 --> 01:03:31,373
It’s our matter, Wan.

1077
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:33,546
I’m in that clip too.

1078
01:03:33,973 --> 01:03:38,213
If that clip is sent out, it would only harm us both.

1079
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:41,706
I just want you to do what I’ve asked.

1080
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,693
It’s because you asked.

1081
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:50,200
I’ll try my best. But I can’t promise how long I’d be able to put up with her.

1082
01:03:51,266 --> 01:03:52,040
Um

1083
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:55,880
I’ll go to bed then.

1084
01:03:56,453 --> 01:03:58,440
I have to pick up Jessie for a shooting.

1085
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,946
Okay, you go rest.

1086
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:05,026
Thank you for doing it for me.

1087
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,120
Goodnight. Sweet dream.

1088
01:04:20,746 --> 01:04:21,920
Sweet dream?

1089
01:05:36,093 --> 01:05:37,293
(Jessie’s laugh)

1090
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,746
Dawan!

1091
01:05:42,653 --> 01:05:43,600
Dawan!

1092
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,420
- (Laughing)
- Dawan!

1093
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:50,266
(Laughing)

1094
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,053
- (Laughing)
- Dawan!

1095
01:05:53,946 --> 01:05:57,533
- (Laughing)
- Dawan!

1096
01:05:57,706 --> 01:05:58,946
Dawan

1097
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,560
(Laughing)

1098
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,160
Dawan…

1099
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,280
Hey, are you okay? You look so tired.

1100
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,413
Or did you have too much fun yesterday?

1101
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,880
Didn’t you go to a reunion party with Dawan and your gang?

1102
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,053
Please keep it for me.

1103
01:06:25,706 --> 01:06:26,893
How did you know?

1104
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:32,853
I heard the hair stylists talking about it. They did the hair for Dawan before coming for my appointment.

1105
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,320
A Gatsby theme? What an idea.

1106
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:44,533
Wan should have used her time more wisely and spent it on acting classes.

1107
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:49,080
Or does she probably think she’s already good at acting?

1108
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:52,093
Are you listening to what I was saying, Kim?

1109
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,013
Yeah.

1110
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,186
Then give me some response.

1111
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:01,306
You often leave me talking to myself. That’s not nice.

1112
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,533
Jessie, I’m not feeling well today.

1113
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,653
After dropping you at the studio, can I go back home to rest?

1114
01:07:13,853 --> 01:07:18,213
I already asked the show producer.

1115
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:22,740
He said he’d message me when the shooting is done.

1116
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,853
I’ll tell the driver to pick you up.

1117
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,773
Incredible.

1118
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:34,932
Now I know why Wan only wants to keep you for herself.

1119
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:41,892
I guess I’m so lucky to have you as my stylist and also as my personal manager.

1120
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,813
All right then, please go back to rest so that you’d get well soon.

1121
01:07:48,746 --> 01:07:50,600
Thank you.

1122
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,386
Oh, but I want to try on the dress that I’ll wear to the event tomorrow.

1123
01:07:55,413 --> 01:08:00,140
Can you pick it up from the shop and take it to my place for me?

1124
01:08:01,253 --> 01:08:02,666
Okay, no problem.

1125
01:08:03,093 --> 01:08:04,040
Thanks a lot.

1126
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,200
Um

1127
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,866
Kim, get all of my stuffs and follow me.

1128
01:08:38,293 --> 01:08:43,520
Hey, be careful! They are all very expensive.

1129
01:08:45,346 --> 01:08:48,466
Why are you so reckless? My things are all over the floor now.

1130
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,186
Hey! Don’t you have hands? Or are you a cripple?

1131
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:04,000
How should I react to her nasty behaviour, Kim?

1132
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:09,880
Are you threatening us? If you’re going to release the clip, then do it. Don’t just talk the talk.

1133
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,240
Are you challenging me?

1134
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,040
Yes.

1135
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,426
Wan, calm down.

1136
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:21,000
Are you so inferior that you have to play dirty to your rival?

1137
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,380
Acting like a mafia in this industry, do you think we’d be afraid of you?

1138
01:09:25,573 --> 01:09:27,066
Wan, that’s enough.

1139
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:28,546
Don’t be afraid of her.

1140
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,906
From now on, I will never let you use Kim as if she’s your toy. I’m going to protect her.

1141
01:09:37,893 --> 01:09:38,840
Let’s go, Kim.

1142
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,440
Wan, don’t.

1143
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,060
My Marvellous Dream Is You.

1144
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:23,093
- [Rising star D.W. licking lips with her personal stylist!]
- #Dawanthelipslicker

1145
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:25,306
Some fans said they are very disappointed.

1146
01:10:25,506 --> 01:10:27,880
They’ve always shipped you with Dew, your former male co-star.

1147
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,850
I was the one who teased her.

1148
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,213
By licking her lips?

1149
01:10:31,973 --> 01:10:32,640
Are you sure it was just a tease?

1150
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,040
Yeah.

1151
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,860
(camera shutter clicking)

1152
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,533
It looks like you two were kissing.

1153
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,320
It’s the only way out for you, Wan.

1154
01:10:40,786 --> 01:10:42,786
Maybe, you’d want to be more careful.

1155
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,040
Lots of people are keeping an eye on Wan.

1156
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:50,960
They might dig up some of her bad secrets and create more scandals.

1157
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:55,400
So, are you and Pat dating each other?

1158
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,360
Can we go out together for real tonight?

1159
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,013
I know you have a lot on your mind right now.

1160
01:11:02,706 --> 01:11:04,520
You can always rely on me.

1161
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:26,260
🎵All I can do is saying ‘I love you’ during the night🎵

1162
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,980
🎵Holding you tight until we’d meet again🎵

1163
01:11:33,106 --> 01:11:39,660
🎵Counting down to the day we’d meet🎵

1164
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:46,760
🎵Missing those time we spent together🎵

1165
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:56,600
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream. The dream that can never…🎵

1166
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,580
🎵…come true.🎵

1167
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,640
🎵I want to cherish all the moments…🎵

1168
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,280
🎵And memorise every second…🎵

1169
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:14,780
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say love you in real life🎵
