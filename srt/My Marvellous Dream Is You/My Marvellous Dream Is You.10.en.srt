1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,770
Our lives have been ruined even until now…

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,320
all because of what you did to us.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,330
If you had been cleared back then, it wouldn’t have been this tiring.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,260
I know how you feel about Wan.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,570
I’m going to resign anyway.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,870
Thank you for always helping me.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,330
If possible, I’d like to take care of her for the rest of my life.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,630
Wan.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,410
How can you marry someone you don’t love?

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,380
Or…do you love him?

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,260
The wine here tastes really good, doesn’t it?

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,010
Oh…you haven’t tried it.

13
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,480
Jeez! What’s wrong with you? What do you want me to do?

14
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,190
How long are you going to be like this? You didn’t even touch your drink. What do you want me to do?

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,750
Why did you ask me to come here? To feed the mosquitoes and look at the trees?

16
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,020
I know you have something on your mind.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,470
Just vent it out on me. Go on.

18
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,000
Kim is getting married.

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,830
Huh?

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,460
With whom?

21
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,650
Marwin.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,920
Marwin? Why would she want to marry him?

23
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,870
Her mother wants her to.

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,510
So, she has to do it.

25
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,490
To make her mother happy.

26
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,650
I don’t want to say this but if you had confessed to Kim a little earlier…

27
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,570
The person Kim would be marrying would have been you, not Marwin.

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,610
It’s probably too late now.

29
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,560
But before Kim would get married,

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,040
I have something to make sure first.

31
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,400
Wan.

32
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,810
Hey…

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,510
(Crying)

34
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,490

My Marvellous Dream Is You

49
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,190
Why do you want to see me?

50
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,740
I’ll get to the point.

51
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,060
Do you really want to marry Kim?

52
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,540
Of course, I do.

53
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,460
But I have something to make sure before that.

54
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,730
Something I’ve just found out yesterday.

55
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,010
Are you going to change your mind?

56
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,380
No, I won’t change my mind that easily. I just want to make sure.

57
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,380
How are you going to take care of her?

58
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,480
Your parents don’t even like her.

59
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,420
Just saying sorry is not enough for me.

60
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,100
I want to know how you’d take action about it.

61
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,240
I know I’ve done wrong to her.

62
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,990
But from now on, I’ll protect her. I will never let her face anything like that again.

63
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,910
If I ever make her cry,

64
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,200
I’ll let her go without holding her back.

65
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,710
Our marriage is my decision alone.

66
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,120
My family has nothing to do with it.

67
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,500
You’ve just got to know her. You two don’t even know each other well enough.

68
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,810
Why do you want to marry her this much?

69
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,320
I’ve fallen in love with her since the first day I met her.

70
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,910
And I’ve fallen deeper and deeper every day since.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,660
Have you ever asked her…

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,890
if she also feels the same way that you do?

73
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,420
Since I’ve known her,

74
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,620
she has never loved anyone in a romantic way before.

75
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,620
Of course, she has.

76
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,870
There’s this person whom she has always loved.

77
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,950
If so, then I should’ve known.

78
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,460
That’s right.

79
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,640
You should’ve known already.

80
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,700
Anyway, why do you want to see me?

81
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,340
It’s about Kim. Why else would I want to see you then?

82
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,510
I just want to make sure that you really love her and want to marry her.

83
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,270
Then tell me honestly, do you want her to marry me or not?

84
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,160
If you are honest with me, then I might be able to comply with your request.

85
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:59,020
Of course, I do. You’re a good man. You also have everything.

86
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,200
And you love Kim.

87
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,520
Is that really what you think?

88
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,320
Mhm.

89
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,440
But there’s something about Kim that you should know.

90
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,510
What is it?

91
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,400
She’s quite afraid to be alone with a guy.

92
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,790
You must be patient and give her time.

93
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,137
Don’t pressure her.

94
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:35,440
She likes to get up early to prepare everything for the one she loves.

95
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,628
- If you don’t want to tire her out…
- [For keeping your promise like you said in our dream.]

96
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,125
…you have to get up earlier than her.

97
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:43,600
Hey.

98
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,382
She is very sensitive and tends to cry easily.

99
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:55,988
So, you must always have a napkin or handkerchief with you.

100
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,314
During that time of the month,

101
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:01,645
she will have a bad cramp in her stomach.

102
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,011
Don’t let her take too many painkillers.

103
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,560
- [Get well soon. So, we can go to school together again.]
- Just get her some hot water bag instead.

104
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:12,960
And when she watches GAP The Series,

105
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,937
You must always laugh with her…
[…make our world pink]

106
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:21,702
even though you’ve watched it for a hundred times already.

107
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,468
You must let her draw as much as she wants to.

108
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,971
Because that’s her happiness.

109
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,228
If you can’t do all of that, or if you make her cry…

110
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,868
I’ll come and take her back.

111
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:47,348
That’s all I have to say. Please excuse me.

112
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:52,971
Wait.

113
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,594
Thank you, for allowing me to marry her.

114
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,120
I know you’re not into this kind of thing.

115
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,040
But as a manner, you should have come and let me hug you.

116
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,554
Come, Wan. Let’s hug.

[8 years ago on the Last Orientation day]

126
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:57,765
Come guys, let’s put our letters in the box.

127
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:08,725
- Huh, where is it?
- Hey, help me find it.

128
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:11,345
Did you find it?

129
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:13,825
- Nothing’s there, Mali.
- Oh, wait.

130
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,015
- I know it. / - Huh?

131
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:17,015
I put it here.

132
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,975
Why on earth did you put it there?

133
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,215
Well, it’s convenient.

134
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:26,055
Come, let’s bury our time capsule.

135
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:26,695
Mhm.

136
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,516
- Wait!     /     - What?

137
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,699
When will we open it?

138
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:35,933
Maybe 10 years after this?

139
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:37,925
- 10 years?     /     - Yeah.

140
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:43,602
- Why 10 years? What’s the reason to wait that long?
- Yeah.

141
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,962
I just think it’s a perfect number.

142
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,607
How is 11 not perfect?

143
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,453
Jeez, just go with 10, okay?

144
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,796
I think 10 is a round number. I like it.

145
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:57,042
Round like your boobs, right?

146
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,145
Why? Are you jealous that my boobs are bigger?

147
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,539
Eww, who’s jealous?

148
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:03,430
That’s enough.

149
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:07,156
Why don’t we open it on the most important day of our life?

150
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:12,002
Let’s open it when anyone is getting married first. Shall we?

151
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:17,247
Hmm…then we should be able to open it in 2 years.

152
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,002
Why?

153
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,322
Mali is probably the first to get married. She’s flirty.

154
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:26,219
Did you just read my mind?

155
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:27,990
I don’t want to study anymore. I want to get married.

156
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,350
Yeah, I can tell.

157
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:37,213
- Hey.     /     - Huh?

158
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:39,099
Mon.

159
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:42,482
Why are you crying? Are you all right?

160
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:43,327
Mon.

161
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:45,727
I’m getting sentimental.

162
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:46,893
- Why?      /     - Huh?

163
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:52,425
This is like that scene in My Sassy Girl.

164
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,870
Jeez, Mon.

165
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,436
Can we do a group hug?

166
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,962
- Come, come.    /    - Aww, let’s hug.

167
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,316
Aww…

168
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,625
Don’t cry.

169
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,773
Wan, I know you’re not into something like this.

170
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,727
But as a manner, you should have come and let me hug you.

171
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,607
Yeah.

172
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:20,847
I’m going to be a famous actress. I can’t just give anyone a hug.

173
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,099
Jeeeeez.

174
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,533
Wan, let’s hug.

175
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:38,002
Yay, let’s hug.

176
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:41,190
Love you guys.

177
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:44,493
Okay, that’s it. Or else Mon will cry even harder.

178
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,487
I’m not crying anymore.

179
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:49,899
I’ll wait to see what you guys wrote to me.

180
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:54,493
I can tell you right now. I said Pam is prettier than you.

181
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:55,659
Oh!

182
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,053
- Mon!     /     - Hey!

183
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:59,305
Did you just push me with your foot?

184
00:14:59,305 --> 00:14:59,967
A hand!

185
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,396
Oh dear.

186
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:03,110
- Get back at her.
- Are you really my friend?
- No!

187
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:05,647
All right, just quit it. Today is a good day. Let’s not fight.

188
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:11,807
I’ll let you two do the burying then. Mon and I have already dug the hole.

189
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:12,687
Yeah.

190
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,562
Go do it. Don’t be lazy.

191
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:17,099
- Go.    /    - Quickly.

192
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:18,962
- Move, move.    /    - Bury it.

193
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,436
Hurry up.

194
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,253
Come on, go and bury it.

195
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,076
Woohoo! Bury it.

196
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,373
See you in 10 years.

197
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,015
Bury it. Bury it.

198
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,045
Yay!

199
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:40,779
Bury it. Woohoo!

200
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,190
Hey!

201
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:49,579
What is it?

202
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,722
I’ll help.

203
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:08,562
Today is the last day we’ll be walking home after school together.

204
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,007
It’s kind of sad somehow.

205
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,367
Yeah, I think so too.

206
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,322
But don’t worry, we’ll be together forever.

207
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,859
Forever?

208
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:28,150
Mhm.

209
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:32,642
Even though you already moved away, I’m still right here.

210
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:35,442
I’ll go see you more often.

211
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:42,047
But when we get into the university, we wouldn’t be able to meet every day.

212
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,447
Sounds so lonely, doesn’t it?

213
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:53,670
I really want to know what you wrote to me in that letter.

214
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:55,396
I’m not going to tell you.

215
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:58,162
You’ll find out on the day you open it.

216
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:03,282
Hey, now I’m dying to find out.

217
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,413
Should I go back and dig it up?

218
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,773
No, don’t do that.

219
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,956
Why not? Why are you stopping me?

220
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:19,739
Well, I’m not sure what you would think about me after you read my letter.

221
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,853
Don’t tell me you…

222
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,996
- What?    /    - You…

223
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:29,053
- Hey.     /     - Huh?

224
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:32,767
Did you also think Pam is prettier than me?

225
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,967
No.

226
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,025
Phew, what a relief.

227
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:51,910
I also wonder what you would think when you find out what I wrote to you.

228
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:58,367
Will we…still be friends like this?

229
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:02,893
(Rain and thunder)

230
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:08,173
(Rain and thunder)

231
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:18,505
(Rain and thunder)

232
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:25,045
To Kimhan / From Dawan.

233
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:31,053
(Rain and thunder)

234
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:47,442
[After opening this letter, I don’t know if we’d be able to look each other in the eyes.]

235
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,322
[Will our relationship stay the same?]

236
00:18:54,413 --> 00:19:01,819
[If you read this letter and feel bad about it, just throw it away. I’d understand.]

237
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:10,276
[No matter what our relationship would be, I’ll always love you.]

238
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:21,019
[I want you to know that you’re the one in my dream. And you’re also the one in my real world.]

239
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,762
[And it will never change.]

240
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,045
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream.🎵

241
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:50,325
🎵The dream that can never come true🎵

242
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:54,645
From Kimhan / -To Dawan.
🎵The dream that can never come true🎵

243
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:55,815
🎵The dream that can never come true🎵

244
00:19:55,815 --> 00:20:02,405
🎵I want to cherish every moment and every second🎵

245
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:11,035
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say I love you in real life🎵

246
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:16,175
🎵Don't wanna keep love in dreams🎵

247
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:22,925
🎵Don't wanna hold feelings in anymore🎵

248
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:29,135
🎵Don't wanna scream "I love you" only in my heart 🎵

249
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:35,925
🎵Will you change if you knew?🎵

250
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:40,355
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream.🎵

251
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:49,145
🎵The dream that can never come true🎵

252
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:55,775
🎵I want to cherish every moment and every second🎵

🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say I love you in real life🎵

254
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,925
(Thunder)
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say I love you in real life🎵

255
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:04,355
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say I love you in real life🎵

256
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:09,365

🎵I want to cherish every moment and every second🎵

259
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,682
Kim is going to become someone else’s girl.
🎵I want to cherish every moment and every second🎵

260
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:22,335
🎵I want to cherish every moment and every second🎵

261
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:31,405
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say I love you in real life🎵

262
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:37,636
Hurry up.

263
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,613
Found it?

264
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:40,790
Hang on.

265
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:43,419
- Jeez.     /     - Hey, careful.

266
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:44,619
- Hurry up!     /     - Jeez!

267
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:46,482
- Can’t you go faster?     /     - Damn it.

268
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:48,996
- You        /  - Hmmm

269
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,305
- Where?
- So deep.
- Yeah.

270
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:52,059
Hey

271
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,190
Hey, found it!

272
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,325
Where? Pick it up. Pick it up.

273
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,482
- Is it this one?
- I think so.

274
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,230
I found it!

275
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:03,225
- Errr.     /     - Huh?

276
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:06,779
I don’t think it’s this one.

277
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:07,705
Why not?

278
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,179
I think it’s probably…

279
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:11,133
(Screaming)

280
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,956
I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry for my friend too.

281
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,830
Please don’t come to me, just go and haunt her. Don’t come to me.

282
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:16,573
I have nothing to do with this.

283
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:17,750
- (Screaming)    /    - Hey.

284
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:19,602
Jeez, you’re lousy. Let me do it.

285
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,230
I’ll do it.

286
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,150
Wait. I think this is it.

287
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:29,202
Mon.

288
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:30,322
Huh?

289
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:35,213
Is this a dog’s bone or a human’s bone?

290
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:36,756
(Howling)

291
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:42,642
- I’d rather think it’s a dog’s bone which died here in a cute way.
- Okay.

292
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:44,585
- Died in a cute way.    /    - Cute way.

293
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:46,539
I’ll just bury it back.

294
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,173
Jeez!

295
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:51,590
Which tree did we bury our capsule?

296
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:52,550
Yeah.

297
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,345
I thought you said this one.

298
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,705
That’s what I thought.

299
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:58,562
But it’s been ten years. Who would remember?

300
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:00,299
- Hey.     /      - What?

301
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,293
I think we have the wrong tree.

302
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,133
So, which one is it?

303
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:06,905
- That one.
- Huh?

304
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:11,362
- You said this one.
- You told me to come this way.

305
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:12,916
- Let’s check it out.
- You led us this way.

306
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:15,613
- No, you did. You said it was this one.
- That one, right?

307
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:18,045
Stop! Shut up! That one, right?

308
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,007
- Yeah.    /    - Let’s go.

309
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,007
- Wait.     /     - What?

310
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:24,539
Are you going to dig it with bare hands?

311
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,693
Oh, damn it.

312
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:27,899
Stay there. I’ll get it.

313
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:29,785
- Hurry up! Your legs are so short.
- Yeah, yeah.

314
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,259
Walk faster.

315
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:34,550
Hey, easy there.

316
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,253
Four of us came here to bury it. How come only you and I have to dig it up?

317
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:44,973
Just stop complaining. Kim has to prepare for her wedding. Wan is also busy.

318
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,899
Anyway, what’s wrong with you? Why do we have to dig it up today and not some other days?

319
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,853
Hey, found it!

320
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,202
Good. Bring it up.

321
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,030
Okay.

322
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:56,722
Hmm

323
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:02,356
- Where’s my letter?
- Here.

324
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:03,670
Wait.

325
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:05,579
Here you go.

326
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:07,465
Mali. Here.

327
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:11,030
Where is it? Oh.

328
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,162
I’m dying to know what you complimented me in the letter.

329
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:20,676
Read it and you’ll be surprised.

330
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:21,567
Why?

331
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,093
Your face will turn red with anger.

332
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,167
Damn you.

333
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:26,905
Just kidding.

334
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,365
Hey, should we read Kim’s and Wan’s letters first?

335
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:34,333
No way, it’s their secret.

336
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:37,247
I’ll hand deliver their letters myself.

337
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:54,882
Here.

338
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,573
I haven’t given it to Kim.

339
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:07,385
I couldn’t find the letter you wrote to her.

340
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,007
Really?

341
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,167
Wan, your acting was superb in the drama series.

342
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,493
But in real life, you suck.

343
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:22,127
You already took it, didn’t you?

344
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,265
I thought you said the answer is in that letter.

345
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,367
Because it’s in there.

346
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:34,036
That’s why I can’t let her read my letter.

347
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:37,865
Why? If she reads it, she might change her mind.

348
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:39,865
That’s enough! Enough!

349
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,362
Mon.

350
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,779
Kim is getting married.

351
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:58,973
Telling me all this, what do you want me to do?

352
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:02,516
Do you hear me? She’s getting married.

353
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:04,025
So, are you going to just sit here and do nothing?

354
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:05,407
It’s too late.

355
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:09,316
No, it’s not. But it will be too late because you won’t do anything about it.

356
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:12,973
Are you going to keep dreaming like this?

357
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,590
This is real life.

358
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:16,939
Are you insane?

359
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,990
This is all I can do to help.

360
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,767
What you will do is up to you.

361
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:42,485
From Kimhan / To Dawan.

362
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:45,087
Have you read my letter?

363
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:46,459
Yes.

364
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:48,459
What do you think?

365
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,087
What do you think after you read it?

Hi, Kim.

379
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,460
Why didn’t I get a letter from the time capsule?

380
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:41,437
Mon might have lost it.

381
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:44,237
How are you?

382
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:46,443
Are you okay?

383
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,408
Yes, I’m good.

384
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,043
What about you?

385
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:53,243
Are you okay?

386
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:55,243
Mhm.

387
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:59,174
Are you…calling just to ask how I am?

388
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,940
Or are you going to ask me to be your bridesmaid?

389
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:09,528
I know you’re not going to be my bridesmaid.

390
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,008
I don’t even know if you will come to my wedding.

391
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,317
So, why do you call?

392
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,648
Oh, now I need a reason to call you?

393
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:27,185
That’s not what I meant. It’s just that we haven’t talked for some time. So, I was just asking.

394
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:28,294
Mhm.

395
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,385
I’ll get to the point then.

396
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:36,443
Have you read my letter?

397
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,374
Yes, yours and the other’s too.

398
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,008
What do you think?

399
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:47,528
About what?

400
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:52,431
After you read my letter, what do you think?

401
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,980
It’s good. Your handwriting is beautiful.

402
00:29:57,723 --> 00:29:59,471
It reminds me of the old days.

403
00:30:00,351 --> 00:30:01,940
We shouldn’t have grown up, right?

404
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:05,711
The more we grow up, the further apart we become.

405
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:13,037
If you already read it and have no comment about it, then it doesn’t matter.

406
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:15,871
Is this all you want to know?

407
00:30:17,277 --> 00:30:19,277
Yeah, that’s all.

408
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:28,934
It’s getting late. I’m off to bed then.

409
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:31,128
Wan.

410
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,288
Yes?

411
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:35,483
Are you all right?

412
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:54,020
I give up.

413
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:19,413
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream🎵

414
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:28,433
🎵The dream that can never come true.🎵

415
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:35,113
🎵I want to cherish every moment and every second🎵

416
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:43,583
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say I love you in real life🎵

417
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:03,163
Kim.

418
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:13,563
I miss you so much.

419
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:16,763
Yes, I…

420
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:21,616
It’s so torturing.

421
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:30,296
But it would be better.

422
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:36,669
If we don’t have to see each other again in our dream.

423
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,136
Kim.

424
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:50,536
Come with me.

425
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:54,056
Get out of our dream right now!

426
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:55,736
Get out!

427
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,543
Kim!

428
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,909
Kim.

429
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:07,096
Don’t go with him.

430
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:08,909
Kim!

431
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:10,349
Kim!

432
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,083
Kim!

433
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:14,336
Kim!

434
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:15,349
KIMMM!

435
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,336
KIMMM!

436
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,549
I must survive,

437
00:33:53,963 --> 00:33:55,549
even without Kim.

Yeah, I’ll go live with my mum.

451
00:35:23,603 --> 00:35:25,363

00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:35,143
Neh, if it’s not Kim, then I won’t let anyone live here.

455
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:39,776
Duh, then forget it, right?

456
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:43,069
Where else do you want me to take a picture?

457
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,416
- In the kitchen.
- Okay.

458
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,549
Thanks a lot.

459
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:59,463
If I can sell it, I’ll give you guys a commission.

460
00:36:00,343 --> 00:36:03,513
And I’ll invest some of the money in Mon’s business too.

461
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:07,573
Huh?! You’re going to invest in my business?

462
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:12,523
You better think about it again. Her shop is going out of business soon.

463
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:16,323
Hey, my shop is doing quite well lately.

464
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:18,943
Fine. Let’s wait and see. It will go out soon, right, baby?

465
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:19,753
What a foul mouth.

466
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,833
I want to keep myself busy.

467
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:26,393
Otherwise, I’d be too frustrated.

468
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:30,163
Hey, why don’t you come and help babysitting my baby?

469
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:31,423
It’s so eay. Nothing much at all.

470
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:36,263
Just make him milk, wipe his butt, read him a story, and put him to be. That’s all.

471
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:41,973
Ah, I was just kidding.

472
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:44,443
You still have your job, don’t worry.

473
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:45,713
Aww, Mummy was just kidding.

474
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:50,203
Actually, it’s a good idea. Do it for the sake of your nephew.

475
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:54,553
Go help her babysitting him. His mother is going to die soon anyway.

476
00:36:54,553 --> 00:36:58,163
Right? Mummy is dying. Mummy is dying soon.

477
00:36:58,703 --> 00:36:59,683
Eww!

478
00:37:00,423 --> 00:37:01,623
- Mali!    /    - What?

479
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:04,213
What did you put in my mouth?

480
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:05,363
My breast milk.

481
00:37:05,713 --> 00:37:06,963
- Really?    /    - Yeah.

482
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:11,153
It’s kind of nice.

483
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,743
Here, wipe it off.

484
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:16,203
Damn you.

485
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:19,033
I really want to find something to do.

486
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,733
So that I have something to focus in life.

487
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,913
If you really want to do it,

488
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,103
you should do what you love and are good at.

489
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:33,533
I’m fine with you starting up a business.

490
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:36,953
But what if you don’t like it?

491
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:38,633
It would stress you out even more.

492
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:40,913
I just don’t want you to be unhappy.

493
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:42,413
She’s right.

494
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:46,873
Why don’t you go back to acting?

495
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:48,423
- You’re pretty.     /     - Yeah.

496
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:51,983
- Being an actress really suits you the most.
- That’s right.

497
00:37:54,363 --> 00:38:00,263
I’m not sure if people still want to see me as an actress.

498
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,003
Jeez, you are so daft.

499
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:07,063
On social media, your fans still miss you and are looking forward to your works.

500
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:10,873
Oh, right. I forgot you’re doing a social detox, so you probably have no idea about that.

501
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:14,303
Why don’t you talk to Toon first?

502
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:17,713
She’s willing to help.

503
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:21,123
Right?

504
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,113
Or you can talk to me, auntie.

505
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:29,003
Aww, he’s drooling.

506
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:32,333
Mummy will wipe it off for you.

507
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:34,843
(Wedding card)

508
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:36,983
I’m glad you’ve become stronger.

509
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,493
Don’t tell me you didn’t read the letter.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

512
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,060
Thank you, Toon.

513
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,710
So…have you talked to the promoters? Are they okay?

514
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,040
Of course. They are so eager to have you in their drama.

515
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,240
Really?

516
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,900
But they can’t give you the main role.

517
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,500
So, I told them I’d talk to you first.

518
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,550
What do you think?

519
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,950
I trust you.

520
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,180
Please help me decide.

521
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,880
Well, in my opinion…

522
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:12,140
A good actress is one that can play any role whether it’s the main role or not.

523
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,020
It all depends on the script and character.

524
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,480
From what I’ve heard, this character might be a villain but it has a lot of depth.

525
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:32,880
If you agree to take this role, it’d be a great comeback and a very interesting one.

526
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,810
I’m actually not that serious about the main role.

527
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,130
I don’t mind playing a supporting role.

528
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,950
I just want to act again.

529
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,400
So, how is Kim? I haven’t seen her for a while.

530
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,540
If you still keep in touch, please send her my best regards.

531
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,750
To me, you’re always the most beautiful person.

532
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,980
You must get well soon.

533
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:41,020
[Kimhan and Marwin’s wedding card]

534
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,740
Have you read my letter?

535
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,590
Yes, yours and the others too.

536
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,160
So…what do you think about it?

537
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,540
Hmm, your handwriting is beautiful.

538
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,150
It reminds me of the old days.

539
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,000
The more we grow up, the further apart we are.

540
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,730
Wan, I give up.

541
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,490
(Camera shutter)

542
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,820
Good. Now, change your posture.

543
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,350
(Camera shutter)

544
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,250
This is great. I’m sure it will be a blast.

545
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,570
Fabulous!

546
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:49,860
(Reminder alarm)

547
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,170
- Reminders
- WEDDING KIM
Noti: Kimhan’s wedding tomorrow

548
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,210
Tomorrow already?

549
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:47,210
- From Kimhan
- To Dawan

550
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,170
(LINE incoming message)
[Mali: See you at the wedding at 6am sharp. Don’t be late.]

551
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,850
[Samon: Can you wake me up at 3? Just in case.]

552
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:04,010
[Mali: Wan, will you go to the wedding?]

553
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,090
[Samon: She has a shooting.]

554
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,770
[Samon: Can’t postpone it.]

555
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,890
[Mali: But this is Kim’s wedding.]

556
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,770
[Mali: Are you really not going?]

557
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,350
(Phone buzzing)

558
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,350
(Phone buzzing)

559
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,710
(Phone buzzing)

560
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,670
Yes, Marwin?

561
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,290
[Marwin: Kim, do you want to eat anything? I’ll have someone bring you the food.]

562
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,170
No, I’m okay.

563
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,150
[Marwin: I’m so nervous. I can’t wait to see my bride.]

564
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,380
Yes.

565
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,140
Jess, are you done?

566
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,190
- Yes.
- Please come this way if you’re done.

567
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,990
- Okay.
- Let’s go change first.

568
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,260
This way, please.

569
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,510
See you there, Wan.

570
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,050
Wan, are you okay?

571
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:16,950
Mhm.

572
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,360
Should I pretend to be sick?

573
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:22,580
Huh?

574
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,500
Why would you do that?

575
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,050
So that they’d cancel the shooting, and you can go to Kim’s wedding.

576
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,520
Should I?

577
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,660
I’m not going.

578
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,650
Pat, are you done?

579
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,250
- If so, please go over there and get ready.
- Yes, I’m going.

580
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,830
Toon, please tell Dawan to follow when she’s done.

581
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,250
Okay.

582
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:53,180
Wan, let’s go.

583
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,310
A little touch up here.

584
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,480
Excuse me? Can you all please leave first?

585
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,960
I want to be alone.

586
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,070
You guys go first, I’ll take care of the rest.

587
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,350
I’ll be right after.

588
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:20,950
You too.

589
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:23,730
Okay.

590
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,690
- Are you going to catch the bouquet again?
- Yes.

591
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,950
- So confident.
- You’re already married.

592
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,380
I’m not going to catch it anyway.

593
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,220
Oh, is it done?

594
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,890
Not yet. The bride asked all of us to leave first.

595
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,050
- Huh?
- I’m dumbfounded.

596
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,560
- So…it’s not one yet.
- No.

597
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,350
- It’s okay.     /     - That’s all right.

598
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,550
- We’ll go check on her.
- Yeah.

599
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,100
Okay.

600
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,200
- What’s wrong with her?
- No idea.

601
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,570
Let’s go check on her.

602
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,330
Jeez, what’s wrong with her?

603
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:01,720
Just knock.

604
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,420
(Door knocking)

605
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,260
Kim.

606
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,870
(Door knocking)

607
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,360
Kim, open the door.

608
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,680
- Are you asleep?
- (Door knocking)

609
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,590
- Kim.     /     - Kim.
- (Door knocking)

610
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,070
- Is she in?
- (Door knocking)

611
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,960
Kim.

612
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,590
- Kim, do you hear me?
- (Door knocking)

613
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,430
- Kim.
- (Door knocking)

614
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:15,980
- Kim.
- (Door knocking)

615
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,520
- Kim.
- (Door knocking)

616
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,540
- Hey.    /    - What?

617
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,350
Come here.

618
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,560
- Come here.    /    - Okay.

619
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,040
Jeez, what is it? What do you want?

620
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,460
- Come here.    /    - Why?

621
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,070
Listen.

622
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,140
I have a feeling.

623
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,020
Something bad is going to happen.

624
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,460
Do you remember those letters we dug up?

625
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,750
Of course, and I already read that letter you wrote to me.

626
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,200
It’s full of nothing but bad words. Damn you.

627
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,030
You also cursed me to get pregnant before I’d get married.

628
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,480
And it was true. I did get pregnant before I got married.

629
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:52,800
Bloody hell!

630
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,610
Such a holy mouth you have there.

631
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,560
- Hey.    /    - What?

632
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,330
Can we talk about that later?

633
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,210
Well…

634
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,870
I already read the letter that Kim wrote to Wan.

635
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,310
So? What’s so strange? You’re nosy anyway.

636
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,910
Damn you, Mali. Can you please shut up and listen?

637
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:09,840
Okay, fine. Spit it out.

638
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,480
I found out that…

639
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,880
- K…Kim.     /     - What?

640
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:23,720
She…she likes Wan, but not in the same way that she likes both of us. Do you get it?

641
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,960
- Not in a…    /    - Wait. Stop.

642
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,210
Can you make it short and clear?

643
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,060
- Kim.    /    - Aha.

644
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,990
She loves Wan in a romantic way.

645
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,290
- What?    /    - Yeah.

646
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,740
So, what I’ve always thought is right.

647
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,070
What?! You knew about this?

648
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,580
Jeez, Mon. We’ve been friends for how many years already?

649
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,180
But I’m afraid to let Wan know…that Kim thinks of her more than just a friend.

650
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,050
Yeah, me too.

651
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,900
Wan came to talk to me.

652
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,220
She thought what she’s feeling is the result of her depression.

653
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,480
Or because of her dream.

654
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,290
- Yes, her dream. Got it.
- Yeah.

655
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:09,540
That’s their biggest secret. They’ve always been in love with each other.

656
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,940
But knowing all that now, would it be too late for them?

657
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,820
Kim is going to get married in a few minutes.

658
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,060
- Hey.    /    - Huh?

659
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,230
What if she’s not married yet.

660
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,420
Does that mean it’s still not too late?

661
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,590
Yai, please don’t leave me.

662
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,130
Yai!

663
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,070
- Let go off me, Kaew.    /    - Yai!

664
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:28,660
Enough!

665
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,200
Yai!

666
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,050
Let’s go, Malai.

667
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,330
Yai!

668
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,070
(Screaming)

669
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:37,580
(Screaming)

670
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,880
Cut! That was brilliant.

671
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,610
(Clapping)

672
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,740
- Well done, Wan.
- (Clapping)

673
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,590
All right then.

674
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,340
Please go check on Wan.

675
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,880
I think this is her last queue.

676
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,440
- Oh, really?
- Yes, last one for today.

677
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,150
She has to come for another scene tomorrow. See you then.

678
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,290
Okay, thank you.

679
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:52,170
- Thanks a lot.    /    - Thank you.

680
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,210
- Thank you both of you.
- Thank you.

681
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,750
Wan, I’m so happy you’re back.

682
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,380
Without you, it felt so lonely.

683
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,590
I had no one to compare with. It wasn’t challenging at all.

684
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:06,490
Why don’t you just compete with yourself?

685
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,540
Jess, let’s go change.

686
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,510
18, okay? Let’s go.

687
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,100
Pat, please follow when you’re done.

688
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,320
- I’ll be right there.
- Okay, let’s go.

689
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,760
Wan.

690
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:19,820
I have two more scenes left. After this, should we go find something to eat?

691
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,000
Okay.

692
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,300
I’ll wait for you then.

693
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,820
Okay, see you.

694
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,460
You’ll go eat with him after this?

695
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:32,820
Yeah.

696
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,450
Let me know where you want to go after that. I’m free anyway. I’ll go with you.

697
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,230
I know you want today to end as quickly as possible.

698
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,530
(Phone buzzing)

- You have a lot of missed calls. Want to take it?

(Phone buzzing)

705
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,580
I’ll go wait inside.

706
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,240
(Phone buzzing)

707
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,000
Wan, where on earth are you? Come to the wedding right now.

708
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,850
I’m not going.

709
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,510
What?

710
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:15,110
Listen. Kim is not coming out of her room. The ceremony will begin in half an hour.

711
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,460
That’s not my problem. She will come out when it’s time.

712
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,810
Listen. The day I went to give you Kim’s letter, I actually read it before I gave it to you.

713
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:25,990
So?

714
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,900
Don’t tell me you didn’t read it.

715
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,380
Will it make any difference if I did?

716
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:37,180
By the way, I already threw it away.

717
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:37,850
What?

718
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,140
She threw Kim’s letter away.

719
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,110
Damn you! You’re so stupid!

720
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,060
Wan, listen carefully.

721
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:54,290
Kim loves you. She has always been waiting for you to return her feeling.

722
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,470
I shouldn’t have told you this.

723
00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:01,080
But since I’m nosy, I also took a picture of that letter.

724
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,600
I’ll send you the picture. Make sure you read it.

725
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,030
Then you can decide what you’d do with your life in the next 30 minutes. It’s all up to you.

726
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,180
Bye.

732
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,060
- Excuse me?
- (Knocking on a car window)

733
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,330
- Excuse me, Miss?
- (Knocking on a car window)

734
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,100
It’s almost time now. I’m so excited.

735
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,960
Aren’t you going to attend the ceremony?

736
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,160
No, I’m busy.

737
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,400
Come and help us.

738
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,960
Oh!

739
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,480
Kim.

740
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:57,500
Kim.

741
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,730
Kim! Where are you going?

742
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,970
Does it hurt?

743
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,300
No, it’s nothing.

744
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,130
Are you sure?

745
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,120
Mum, a lot of your old customers have tried to contact me lately.

746
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,060
When you get better, you won’t have time to rest at all.

747
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:19,890
Mum.
