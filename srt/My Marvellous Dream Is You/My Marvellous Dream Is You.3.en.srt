Wan.

16
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,170
Haven’t we talked about this, that you would try not to provoke her?

17
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,040
Kim, can you fix this for me? Someone has torn it.

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,900
have to on a stage in 5 minutes.

19

Come, I’ll fix it.

Kim, can you help me take off my shoes?

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,300
I’ve tried.

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,950
But to see her using you like a slave like that…

23
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,510
I can’t stand it.

24
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,680
Have you ever thought what would happen after this?

25
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,770
Kim, look at me.

26
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,220
I don’t care.

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,760

36

Whatever will be will be.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,230
Just having you by my side is enough.

38
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,200
Hey, it’s an OST from the drama that you like.

39
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,120
But one person will always hold your hand.

40
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,870
Please rest assured and walk together.

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,540
From now on, let me have you by my side.

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,170
Please know that I will never leave you.

43
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,120
Whenever you’re feeling blue,

44
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,390
I’ll turn your whole world into…

45
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,870
a pink world for you.

46
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,090
I’m done for today. Let’s order something to eat.

47
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,670
Okay.

48
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,600
Wan.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Wan.

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,620
What is it, Kim?

51
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,400
Why is it such a mess here?

52
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,290
Well, this is what it looks like without you.

53
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,130
Drink some water first.

54
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,520
I know you can do it. Thanks a lot.

55
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,480
Huh? Thanks a lot?

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,490
She knows I can do it? Hey! Aren’t you going to help me?!

57
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,480
Come back here, quick!

58
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,980
- I’m tired.
- Wan!

59
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,880
🎵See you in my dream tonight🎵

60
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,660
🎵I saw you in my dream again🎵

61
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,270
🎵And It felt so real🎵

62
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,200
🎵Do you know how much you make me feel?🎵

63
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,800
🎵To fall in love with you just in my dream.🎵

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,720
🎵Only 8 hours a night is not enough.🎵

65
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,690
🎵To fall in love with you just in my dream🎵

66
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,060
🎵Only 8 hours a night is not enough.🎵

67
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,640
(Wind blowing)

68
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,390
So nice.

69
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,750
I haven’t dreamt something like this for a long time.

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,640
I’m happy that you didn’t hate me.

71
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,480
My acting was superb, wasn’t it?

72
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,730
It made you really believe I hated you.

73
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,320
If I were to become an actress, you wouldn’t have a chance to shine.

74
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,490
A good actress must be able to do the love scene too.

75
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,970
Are you…

76
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,980
a good kisser?

77
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,900
Are you?

78
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:14,750
Hmmm, I’m not sure. Maybe I need to be reminded again.

79
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,640
Haven’t you done that with Pat already?

80
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,720
I know you don’t like it.

81
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,660
But that was just an acting.

82
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,360
But with you, it’s real. I can do more than just kissing to you.

83
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,340
Kim, can you give me a carbon tablet?

84
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,260
Wan! Why aren’t you wearing a shirt?

85
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,190
Why? What’s so strange?

86
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,380
Are you still shy?

87
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,980
You’ve seen me naked quite often.

88
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,950
Stop it.

89
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,610
You’re blushing a lot. Are you shy?

90
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,100
Wan, stop it. Or else I’ll take back my robe.

91
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,570
Oh, I wouldn’t mind at all. 	Here,

92
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,640
take it.

93
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,920
No! Keep it.

94
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,580
You’re chicken out.

95
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,410
Why do you look so happy today?

96
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,730
I had a good dream last night.

97
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,600
I dreamt that…

98
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,670
Dreamt what?

99
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,610
(Doorbell ringing)

100
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,870
Jeez, only our friends could ring the bell so rude like this.

101
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,050
I’ll get the door first.

102
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,650
(Doorbell riinging)

103
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,690
Wan, what’s wrong with you?

104
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,970
Why didn’t you answer your phone? We couldn’t get a hold of you.

105
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,330
And Kim too.

106
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,920
What’s the matter?

107
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,180
Wait, when did you come back to stay with her?

108
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,940
I’m the one who took her here.

109
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,610
(Sigh) I knew it.

110
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,280
Your clip is all over the internet right now.

111
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,410
What? Jessie already released it?

Rising star D.W. caught licking lips with her personal stylist.

116
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,320
Is Dawan secretly dating her personal crew?

122
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,930
Some fans said they are disappointed. They used to ship you with Dew, your former male co-star.

123
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,930
It’s like a betrayal to them.

124
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,730
This one said, ‘Then what she did in the drama was just…’

125
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,380
Let me see.

126
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,060
Bullshit.

127
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,810
Dring some water first.

128
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,380
Calm down, Wan.

129
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,980
Hey, there are some nice comments too.

130
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,600
Oh, this one is such a sexual harrassment.

131
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,060
What is it? Just tell me.

132
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,980
It said, ‘Wow, lips licking? Want to see her lick something else too.’

133
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,780
What’s so good about woman with woman? A man for a woman is better. Come try it with me. You’ll love it.

134
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,870
Calm down, Wan.

135
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,710
Stop.

136
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,470
Wan, you’ve read enough.

137
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,210
Let’s not read those comments anymore.

138
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,990
They’re just toxic.

139
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,660
You guys try and capture all those bad comments.

140
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,120
I’m going to sue them all.

141
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,790
Calm down, Wan.

142
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,650
Calm down.

143
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,660
Wan

144
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,490
I know you have the right to protect your own reputation and sue them.

145
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,340
But I think you should just focus on your work…

146
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,600
rather than wasting your time reading those comments and upset yourself.

147
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,810
No. Who do they think they are?

148
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,990
How can they say something like that about me and Kim?

149
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,214
Those keyboard warriors need to learn a lesson.

150
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,048
So that they won’t do this to anyone else.

151
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,728
But you’re an actress.

152
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:30,660
The spotlight is always shining on you no matter what you do.

153
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,385
People are always ready to throw out their comments about you.

154
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,888
You just have to be careful not to do anything that would create a scandal.

155
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:45,465
Then, what should we do now?

156
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,088
It will surely affect her work.

157
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:56,254
I have no idea too. I’m so stressed that my breasts get so engorged.

158
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:01,420
I told you I can come alone.

159
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,682
If you came alone, she would have gone slapping those who posted bad comments about her.

Are you with Wan? She didn’t pick up my call.

166
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,791
Yes, she’s with me.

167
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,037
Good. Can you both come see me?

168
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:38,848
Yes.

I’m so excited. Can you help me rehearse the script again?

172
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:06,768
Okay.

173
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:13,214
Carbon tablets…help spark the freshness in you.

174
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:14,962
Fresh.

175
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:16,760
Fresh.

176
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,105
Yeah, fresh.

177
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:19,122
Fence?

178
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,922
No, not fence. FRESH!

179
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,260
Fresh.

180
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,631
Yeah.

181
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,317
- Okay
- got it

182
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:30,037
I’m ready. I’m so confident now.

183
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:34,540
Toon, what’s the name of the brand?

184
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:39,080
Piramyst.

185
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,174
Piramish.

186
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,180
Piramyst

187
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,477
Piramyster.

188
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:44,837
Myst.

189
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:46,740
- That’s right, my boy. Now, go.
- Piramyst.

190
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,385
Awesome.

191
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,920
I’m ready.

192
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,494
Okay, please get ready.

193
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:58,330
Carbon tablets…help spark the freshness in you…

194
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,597
With Piramyst.

195
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,077
Cut!

196
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,602
I think it was too obvious.

197
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,345
Can we do it again?

198
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:28,700
Have you girls even tried to disguise yourselves?

199
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,077
I’m sorry.

200
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:50,517
Can’t you see? I’m a rising star and she’s my stylist.

201
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,460
You also told me…

202
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,830
to always dress nicely when I have to go out.

203
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,500
Enough.

204
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:59,785
You’re right. Well done.

205
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,597
But that’s not the point.

206
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,414
Let’s talk about why I’ve asked you both to meet me.

207
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:08,071
It’s because I want to ask you…

208
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,825
why did you two have to lick each other’s lips?

209
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:20,580
It wasn’t Kim’s fault. I was the one who teased her.

210
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,900
By licking her lips?

211
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,197
It doesn’t make sense at all.

212
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,597
Only lovers would do that.

213
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,260
But we’re not lovers

214
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:36,665
Umm…

215
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:40,860
Anyway, let’s get back to the point.

216
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:45,831
I want to know who released this clip.

217
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,288
This person must really want to ruin her reputation.

218
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,391
It’s Jessie.

219
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:08,002
I had to work for Jessie because she was blackmailing me with this clip.

220
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:17,602
I know she would do this.

221
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,797
If I have to go down, I’m going to take her down with me too.

222
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:26,174
I know you hate her. But it’s not worth the risk.

223
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,808
And look.

224
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:28,837
Your work.

225
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,368
They are all cancelled. And more are going to turn us down.

226
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:36,480
You can call the press. I’m going to do a press con.

227
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,551
I’ll tell everyone what Jessie is like. I’ll tell them what she did to me.

228
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,671
She deserves to be exposed.

229
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:46,200
I know you want to get back at her. I’d do that too.

230
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:49,740
But you must think about your career as an actress too.

231
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,711
If you declare a war with her like that…

232
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:56,540
it’s you who’d lose in the end.

233
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,300
I think you should lay low for the time being.

234
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:02,631
Let me take care of everything.

235
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:06,025
Please help her, Toon.

236
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:09,740
It’s my job to do that.

237
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:15,591
But from now on,

238
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:18,597
you two must be more careful. And always think twice before doing anything, okay?

239
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:25,282
If there’s anything, please tell me right the way.

240
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:27,934
Got it?

241
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:30,745
Yes.

242
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:36,128
Please look after her for me.

Wan, I’m here.

253
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,722
Kim, I’m scared.

254
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,122
Don’t be scared.

255
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:24,225
I’ll always be with you, both in your dream and when you wake up.

256
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,020
Thank you, Kim, for keeping your promise.

257
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:45,745
Do you know you were crying in your sleep last night?

258
00:25:57,528 --> 00:26:02,294
No way. Me? Crying?

259
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:12,305
Yeah, it was the first time I saw you cry too.

260
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:15,665
I’m worried about you.

261
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:20,671
I saw you crying in your sleep so I came in to stay with you.

262
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:32,280
Oh, I dreamt I was rehearsing the script for my drama. Might get a bit too carried away.

263
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:42,957
Anyway, I won’t be home today. I have to go out with Mum.

264
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,425
Then I’ll head to the acting class after that.

265
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:53,574
Wan, if there’s anything…

266
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,082
You can tell me, okay?

267
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:15,745
I keep having bad dreams ever since.

268
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:21,814
I know they are just dreams.

269
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:30,580
But I don’t know why those bad feelings still stay with me even after I wake up.

270
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:36,488
Bad dreams can happen to anyone, Wan.

271
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:40,888
Do you sleep well at night?

272
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:46,945
Well…yes.

273
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:52,191
Do you still take pills that I’ve prescribed?

274
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:53,894
Yes.

275
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:55,574
Um

276
00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:59,105
Do you still drink?

277
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,614
Not that often.

278
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:13,825
The medicine I’ve prescribed you will take some time to show its effect.

279
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:17,699
Alcoholic drinks are like that too.

280
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:24,100
When combined together, they can create a terrible effect on your health.

281
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:26,077
Do you understand?

282
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:28,545
Yes.

283
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:39,037
In your case, I believe it’s mainly because of your stress, worries, and fear.

284
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:44,477
Or probably because of your depression.

285
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,288
I don’t want to have bad dreams anymore.

286
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,774
What should I do?

287
00:28:57,974 --> 00:28:58,911
Wan

288
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:02,740
It’s so easy, Wan.

289
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:09,608
Here, try squeezing my hand really hard.

290
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:14,591
Do it with all the strength you have.

291
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,888
Harder. Do it as hard as you can.

292
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:29,162
Then relax.

293
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:34,408
And let it go.

294
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:37,951
How do you feel?

295
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,637
Calm?

296
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:43,745
Yes.

297
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,791
That’s the solution.

298
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:47,951
It’s that easy.

299
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,380
Just let everything go.

300
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:57,894
Anything that you think might hurt you, don’t do it.

301
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:02,397
Another thing that I’d suggest…

302
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:09,894
is that you should find some time to go out go shopping, watching movies, listening to music – anything at all.

303
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:12,088
Or go to a beauty salon.

304
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:17,140
Our body will produce Serotonin and Endorphins…

305
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:21,837
which would help stabilize your mood and make your body relax.

306
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:26,442
You’ll surely have a sweet dream this time.

307
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:29,562
Trust me.

308
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,631
I’ll find some time to do as you suggested.

309
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:36,397
Good.

310
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,597
Don’t forget to find some time to come visit me too.

311
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,585
You hardly stop by after you’ve become an actress.

312
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:47,391
Just in case if there’s any serious problem, then I’d be able to help before it’ll get worse.

313
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,957
Can you do that?

314
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:50,157
Yes.

315
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,277
Isn’t your Mum coming with you today?

316
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,437
She’s waiting outside.

317
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:02,774
Don’t forget to do as I suggested.

318
00:31:30,465 --> 00:31:31,334
Wan.

319
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,602
How was it? What did she say?

320
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:40,088
I feel much better now that I had let it out.

321
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,637
So…I’ll drop you off at the sport club.

322
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,882
And I’ll head to my acting class after that.

323
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:00,785
Okay.

324
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:24,957
Mum, are you okay?

325
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:28,762
Oh, I’m all right.

326
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:38,271
Wan, don’t worry about the scandal.

327
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:46,168
Back then when your dad left, those Hi-so people were gossiping about it so much that I didn’t dare to get out of home.

328
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,562
But then I survived.

329
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:53,368
You’re my daughter.

330
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:56,488
You will surely get through it.

331
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:05,974
Don’t worry, Mum. I’m smart, beautiful, and so strong too.

332
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:10,385
That’s my girl.

333
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:18,808
What are you going to do?

334
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,740
I can only wait to hear from them. Let them decide first.

335
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,254
Now, we just have to focus on this workshop.

336
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:28,202
I’m sorry I’m late, Coach.

337
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,060
Wan, why are you so late?

338
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:33,825
I’m sorry, Toon. I went to get something done.

339
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:40,317
We know you’re probably having a hard time these days.

340
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:43,894
So, you might have to spend a lot of time clearing up those problems.

341
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:47,151
What happened, Wan?

342
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:49,791
Haven’t you checked out the social media lately?

343
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:53,700
I’m having a social media detox for one month.

344
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:56,100
So, I hardly know what’s trending right now.

345
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:57,722
What happened?

346
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:02,522
Maybe, you should do it too, Wan.

347
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:06,751
Pat used to get a lot of bad comments about his acting.

348
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,854
Yes, you’re right.

349
00:34:11,654 --> 00:34:16,397
I haven’t got any bad comments after I started my detox.

350
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,014
Maybe you have but you just don’t know about it.

351
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,248
Not knowing is good.

352
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:27,768
I can spend my time on something else like surfing.

353
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,745
I really like it.

354
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:34,545
Oh, you can come join me if you have free time.

355
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:38,214
It’s very calm and relaxing.

356
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:41,014
Wanna try? Wait.

357
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:43,837
Pat.

358
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:44,960
Yes, Coach?

359
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,357
- Come and help me prepare the scripts and…
- Just a second.

360
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:49,460
Just a second.

361
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:52,690
Can I please have your contact detail?

362
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,437
Okay.

363
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:57,162
Thank you.

364
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,837
Aren’t you going to ask me too?

365
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,637
Neh, if you come, it won’t be relaxing then.

366
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:14,751
- Take off your shoes too, Pat.
- Okay, Coach.

367
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:22,842
Okay then, I have to go meet the client. I’ll come pick you up later.

368
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:27,505
Are you okay?

369
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:40,785
If you decide to accept his invitation, you’d better be more careful this time.

370
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:46,511
People are keeping an eye on you these days.

371
00:35:46,888 --> 00:35:49,311
They might dig up some of your bad secrets and create more scandals.

372
00:35:51,242 --> 00:35:54,911
I’m going to sue the one who released that clip.

373
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,122
Good luck with that.

374
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:04,111
It’s not that hard. We all know who it is.

375
00:36:04,785 --> 00:36:05,711
Who is it?

376
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:11,482
You’re really good at acting. Maybe you don’t even need to do this workshop.

377
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,985
See you in the court.

378
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:15,802
I know it’s you.

379
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,682
Why did you say that?

380
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,231
I know you’re stressed out right now.

381
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:26,465
But that doesn’t mean you can accuse me without any evidence.

382
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,328
Girls.

383
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:31,871
- Yes, Coach?
- I just got a call from the producer in the US.

384
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:35,240
I’m going to record a VDO clip during the workshop today. He wants to see the progress.

385
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:36,431
Sure.

386
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,174
Okay.

387
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:40,648
Coach.

388
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:43,962
Can I go home early today?

389
00:36:44,831 --> 00:36:45,814
What’s the matter?

390
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,848
I’m not ready to be in the same class with…

391
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,299
Jessie?

392
00:36:58,305 --> 00:37:00,534
Wan, I know how you feel.

393
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:04,111
But if you want to walk this path, you must learn to act like a professional.

394
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:12,560
Just today then. Can I go home after you finish recording us?

395
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:29,021
Toon.

396
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:32,632
I thought you already left with Wan.

397
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:34,563
Huh?

398
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:38,769
She’s like this again.

399
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:40,761
Never told me where she’s going

400
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:50,461
How was the workshop today?

401
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:54,163
Did she behave badly in class?

402
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:05,946
She hasn’t been quite nice lately.

403
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:09,112
I’m really sorry

404
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:12,209
It’s all right

405
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:14,243
I know how she feels

406
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,049
She might be so stressed right now

407
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:18,312
So, it’s quite hard to have the situation under control.

408
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:23,101
Please take care

409
00:39:42,106 --> 00:39:44,015
Will it affect the project with the US?

410
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:48,118
Definitely, if she is still behaving like this.

411
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,329
From what I have observed in class,

412
00:39:52,026 --> 00:39:54,701
Wan is talented. She has a strong passion.

413
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:59,741
She is eager to learn and wants to be successful in acting. She looks very determined

414
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:01,455
But her biggest flaw...

415
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:04,438
is that she’s too hot-tempered.

416
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,495
She also doesn’t know how to deal with her emotions

417
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:10,232
Usually, she’s not this bad

418
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,712
It’s because of the scandal about that clip.

419
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:15,203
I really don’t know what to do

420
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:22,506
When there’s an unexpected scene in a movie script,

421
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:28,792
the writer would usually come up with a bigger, funnier, or more interesting scene…

422
00:40:28,975 --> 00:40:30,689
so that people will somehow forget about that mistake.

423
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:33,341
This idea also applies to the entertainment industry..

424
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:36,529
Bigger or more interesting scandals.

425
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,832
can cover up the old ones.

426
00:40:44,781 --> 00:40:47,306
Are you okay, Toon?

427
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:52,186
You’re right.

428
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:54,918
(Clapping)
Thanks a lot.

429
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:56,861
Please excuse me.

430
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:24,601
(Running)

431
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,041
Wan

432
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:32,301
Here

433
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:33,401
(Throwing a water bottle)

434
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:37,785
What is it, Toon?

435
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:50,015
But…that’s lying, Toon

436
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,335
It’s the only way out for you

437
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,952
If you agree, I can call the press right now.

438
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:01,169
But it’s up to you anyway

439
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:04,678
(Opening the bottle)

440
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,043
(Closing the bottle)

441
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:18,666
I don’t want to do that…

442
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:22,826
having to put on an act all the time.

443
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,226
It’s very tiring

444
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:30,003
I know, I don’t want to do it either.

445
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:33,043
But it’s the best way out for you right now

446
00:42:36,883 --> 00:42:38,449
As your personal manager,

447
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:40,392
I have to take good care of my artist

448
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,449
I have to protect her as best as I can

449
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:47,329
If you fall, then my career will go down with you

450
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:53,501
As someone like a sister to you,

451
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:57,935
I love you like my own sister.

452
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:00,952
I don’t want to see anyone talking bad about you.

453
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,706
I know you’re worried about me

454
00:43:16,598 --> 00:43:18,689
You have looked after me since when I wasn’t famous.

455
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:23,638
You even quit your full-time job to take care of me.

456
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:31,386
But…why don’t we find the person who released the clip and make them responsible for what they did?

457
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,552
Because we have to get over it as fast as we can.

458
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,312
(Sigh)

459
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:39,946
Think about this.

460
00:43:40,895 --> 00:43:43,889
Now, everyone is trying to dig out more dirt.

461
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:46,975
They want to dig out any secrets you have.

462
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:49,535
If you let them keep digging,

463
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:52,232
they might eventually find out about your dad and Kim’s dad.

464
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:55,238
What would you do then? Wouldn’t it be such a mess?

465
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:06,266
I do this to protect you and also Kim.

466
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:11,158
Can you trust me this time?

467
00:44:12,335 --> 00:44:13,638
If it doesn’t work out the way we want,

468
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:16,083
I will quit being your personal manager.

469
00:44:21,135 --> 00:44:22,049
(Sigh)

470
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:29,681
(Reporters asking questions)
Can you give us an interview?

471
00:44:35,855 --> 00:44:39,363
Miss Dawan, how is your project with Hollywood going right now?

472
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:41,946
The result will come out by next month.

473
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:45,649
The US team have already flown in to cast for the actors and actresses here.

474
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:50,575
Are you excited to find out whether you or Jessie would get this role?

475
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,831
Not really, it’d be me anyway.

476
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:53,961
Hmm

477
00:44:53,961 --> 00:45:00,506
What about the clip that’s been a scandal lately? Will it affect the casting?

478
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,881
You used to have a girlfriend, I mean, boyfriend.

479
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:06,449
Are you changing teams and go for women now?

480
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:07,261
Yeah, that clip…

481
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:10,331
Excuse me? Let’s focus on her work, shall we?

482
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:12,761
Her career is taking off right now. Let’s not focus on her personal life.

483
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:15,701
Please tell us, Miss Dawan.

484
00:45:15,701 --> 00:45:17,581
Please calm down, everyone.

485
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:19,581
I’ll answer everything.

486
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:28,118
About my love life, if I’m going to love anyone,

487
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,111
it doesn’t matter what gender that person is.

488
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:32,003
It’s alraedy 2024

489
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:37,238
What about the relationship with your personal stylist? Are you two together?

490
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:41,421
- That’s right.
- It was pretty obvious in the clip.
- You two were kissing.

491
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:46,751
- Yeah.
- Licking lips.
- So close.

492
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:49,771
But from what I saw in the clip, you were…

493
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:52,331
(Reporters keep asking questions)

494
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:53,535
Hello, everyone.

495
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:09,441
-  Oh, no.
- Wowww!

496
00:46:09,441 --> 00:46:11,941
That’s a huge bunch of flowers!

497
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:14,083
Wowww!

498
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,991
It’s for Wan.

499
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:16,831
Awww.

500
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,031
(Indistinct chatter)

501
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:18,721
EXCUSE ME

502
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:20,541
Please join us.

503
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:24,441
So, how come? Please tell us.

504
00:46:24,441 --> 00:46:26,335
I’ve brought her flowers today.

505
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:30,781
Awwww! So, what’s going on?

506
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,911
- With my best regards.
- Thank you, Pat.

507
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:33,561
Awww.

508
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,301
You’re blushing, Miss Dawan.

509
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:38,791
- So, how come? We have no idea.
- You two..
- That’s right. Please tell us.

510
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:40,461
Is there something going on between you two?

511
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:43,391
- I’m only here to congratulate her. I’ll get going now.
- Since when?

512
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:45,111
Oh, not so fast. Please stay first.

513
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:46,941
Please tell us more about it.

514
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:49,041
- What’s going on between you two?
- Do you really like her?

515
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:51,231
(Reporters asking questions)
How come?

516
00:46:51,231 --> 00:46:55,961
- We have no idea.
- There must be something going on.

517
00:46:55,961 --> 00:46:57,291
- Everyone.
- Yes?

518
00:46:57,291 --> 00:47:00,655
Please wish me luck and cheer for me to succeed in pursuing her.

519
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:02,961
Oh!!!

520
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:07,541
Are you serious?

521
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:08,918
Please.

522
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:15,361
It’s normal, isn’t it?

523
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:18,026
- But it’s unacceptable.
- Yeah.

524
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:20,346
I’m sorry. It’s the traffic.

525
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:27,718
Is there something wrong?

526
00:47:31,478 --> 00:47:32,963
Haven’t you seen the news?

527
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:35,935
What news?

528
00:47:40,323 --> 00:47:44,381
A newly shipped couple – WanPat.

529
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,518
Don’t you know about it, Kim?

530
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:54,198
I do. She told me last night.

531
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:56,346
But she said it was because…

532
00:47:57,832 --> 00:48:00,061
Toon wanted to cover up the old scandal.

533
00:48:00,518 --> 00:48:01,718
Huh?

534
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:06,141
Then Wan’d probably feel so frustrated.

535
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:10,461
Wow! Look at the comments. There are tons of them

536
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:13,661
Most say they want this couple to be real.

537
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:16,575
- Look, they have lots of photos together.
- Yeah.

538
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:18,561
- They even created a page online.
- Aha.

539
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:21,386
- So serious.
- Wow!

540
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:28,152
- But then…it’s Dawan we’re talking about.
- Yeah

541
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:30,151
She can’t date boys for long.

542
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,575
I’ve never seen her dating anyone long enough.

543
00:48:32,598 --> 00:48:35,991
- They won’t be able to stand her.
- Yeah.

544
00:48:35,991 --> 00:48:38,081
She doesn’t like anyone touching her.

545
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,198
- Is she keeping her virginity for someone?
- Right?

546
00:48:40,198 --> 00:48:43,161
Look at me, I’ve lost my virginity long ago.

547
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,209
Right?

548
00:48:44,895 --> 00:48:45,992
Yeah.

549
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:47,991
Well, anyway.

550
00:48:48,243 --> 00:48:50,735
- So…
- Hey, what are you doing?

551
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:53,791
I read an article online.

552
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:56,301
It said drinking wine can help increase your breast milk.

553
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:58,472
Like, a lot of milk.

554
00:48:58,495 --> 00:48:59,531
Nonsense.

555
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:03,481
You can’t drink it. Drink the banana blossom juice instead.

556
00:49:03,481 --> 00:49:07,391
Jeez, I drink so much banana blossom juice that my hubby is turning into a banana blossom.

557
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:09,466
Him or his…?

558
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:10,381
Him.

559
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:11,181
Okay, that’s it.

560
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,011
No more 18+ stuff.

561
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:13,158
Okay.

562
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:14,666
Got it.

563
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:19,775
Kim.

564
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:21,551
Yes?

565
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:24,026
Are you good?

566
00:49:26,003 --> 00:49:26,861
Of course.

567
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:29,775
Just like what I’ve always been.

568
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:33,409
Actually, it’s good that things turn out like this.

569
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:37,478
Now, Wan can focus more on her work.

570
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,621
So, have you ordered anything? I’m starving.

571
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:47,001
Now that you mention it. I have a new menu to recommend.

572
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:48,392
I’ll bring it out for you.

573
00:49:48,598 --> 00:49:50,278
Just wait. I’ll be right back.

574
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:51,523
Hurry up.

575
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:18,906
(Incoming call)

576
00:50:20,426 --> 00:50:21,969
(Incoming call)

577
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:24,141
Hello, Toon.

578
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:27,786
I’m afraid you have to stop working for Wan for a while.

579
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:32,861
Can I still stay with Wan at her place?

580
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:36,321
Yes, but you must be very careful.

581
00:50:37,546 --> 00:50:39,441
I’m sorry I have to do this.

582
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,401
But I don’t want to mess it up again. Do you get what I mean?

583
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:45,626
Yes, I do.

584
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:47,832
It’s not a big deal at all.

585
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:51,752
Oh, one more thing.

586
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:56,241
Can you take her to apologize to Pam?

587
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:01,215
So that she’d agree and let Dokrak to work for Kim.

588
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:04,232
No problem.

589
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:47,798
(Flicking a lighter)

590
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:03,089
Do you also smoke?

591
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:12,415
Can’t believe I’d get to see you dressed up like this.

592
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:17,101
Well, it’s out of working hours.

593
00:52:18,152 --> 00:52:20,552
I don’t have to put on a role of a coach or an actress.

594
00:52:20,998 --> 00:52:22,415
So, I just want to be myself.

595
00:52:27,158 --> 00:52:29,318
Why are you here? Did you forget something?

596
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:32,552
I’m here to thank you

597
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:34,551
For what?

598
00:52:36,026 --> 00:52:37,181
Have you seen the news?

599
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:40,266
Here.

600
00:52:41,581 --> 00:52:43,878
The scandal about the lips-licking clip has died down.

601
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,918
Now, people are more interested in shipping the Wan-Pat couple.

602
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:49,215
Our Pat?

603
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:51,211
Yeah.

604
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,558
Remember that day when we were talking?

605
00:52:56,095 --> 00:53:01,478
You told me if there was a bigger or more interesting scandal,

606
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:05,341
people would stop paying attention to the old scandal.

607
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:12,301
I owe you a big thanks for giving me an inspiration on this idea.

608
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:15,512
Without you, we would’ve been so doomed.

609
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,158
I’m thinking I might get your name tattooed on my chest.

610
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:24,392
With a tagline saying, ‘My life savior’.

611
00:53:24,723 --> 00:53:27,706
You’re bluffing.

612
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:31,158
Usually, people would get a tattoo of their father’s, mother’s, or lover’s name.

613
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,352
If that’s all you’re going to tell me, you could’ve called.

614
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,729
I actually want to see you.

615
00:53:42,438 --> 00:53:45,135
Here, I bought you medicine.

616
00:53:47,775 --> 00:53:52,849
I saw…a bruise on your neck the other day.

617
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,501
Use this medicine so that you’d get better soon.

618
00:53:59,158 --> 00:54:00,072
Thank you.

619
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:11,946
- Yes, babe?
- Hello, where are you?

620
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:14,746
I’m going out with my friend.

621
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,531
A friend? A guy or a girl?

622
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,923
I only have girl friends.

623
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:24,150
Don’t lie, bitch. You’re going on a date, aren’t you?

624
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,025
What do you want then? Do you want to talk to my friend?

625
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:33,317
Hello, it’s Toon, Minnie’s friend.

626
00:54:34,346 --> 00:54:37,089
We’re going to hang out somewhere this evening.

627
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:39,134
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of her.

628
00:54:42,952 --> 00:54:43,706
He just hung up.

629
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,095
Your boyfriend?

630
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,009
Yeah.

631
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:01,752
He’s a jealous guy.

632
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:03,558
Very jealous.

633
00:55:10,118 --> 00:55:13,272
Well…since I’ve already lied for you.

634
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:16,026
Can we go out for real tonight?

635
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:21,866
Sure, my new pal.

636
00:55:34,466 --> 00:55:36,215
Wow.

637
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:38,512
Have you come here often?

638
00:55:39,746 --> 00:55:42,283
Yeah. Always stop by when I’m free.

639
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:44,146
It’s a nice place here.

640
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:47,501
People who come here are also nice.

641
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:50,352
They don’t care whether we’re famous or not.

642
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:52,226
It’s a good safe zone.

643
00:55:53,712 --> 00:55:55,403
Come, I’ll introduce you to a friend.

644
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:01,483
Come here.

645
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:03,751
Ouch! Man!

646
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,221
- Come with me.
- Man! Ouch!

647
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:07,266
Stop it! Don’t do this!

648
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:12,192
Hey, can’t you just talk nicely? You’re hurting her.

649
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:17,426
So, it’s you, huh? The one who took her phone to speak to me earlier.

650
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:18,851
It’s none of your business, bitch.

651
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:19,201
Man.

652
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:20,531
Let’s go home. Now!

653
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:22,066
Stop it. Leave her out of this.

654
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:24,523
Did you hear that?

655
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:28,158
So, stop being nosy and leave us alone.

656
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:28,771
Let’s go!

657
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:29,975
Let me go!

658
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:35,381
Oh, I can’t leave you two alone now. You’re hurting her!

659
00:56:35,415 --> 00:56:37,712
Yeah, what an a**hole!

660
00:56:37,712 --> 00:56:40,921
Take a picture of him.

661
00:56:41,601 --> 00:56:43,758
What the f**k?! Are you asking for it?!

662
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:47,191
What do you want?!

663
00:56:47,198 --> 00:56:47,631
Son of a bitch!

664
00:56:47,631 --> 00:56:48,558
Enough!

665
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:50,821
Just go back.

666
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:53,952
Okay.

667
00:56:57,106 --> 00:56:58,775
And take all your things out of my place.

668
00:57:00,249 --> 00:57:01,575
Or else, I’d call the police.

669
00:57:04,461 --> 00:57:09,346
Or do you want me to tell the press and post this on social media?

670
00:57:09,803 --> 00:57:11,426
That you’re beating me.

671
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,763
Fine! You want to break up? Then let’s break up!

672
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:19,723
A girl like you is so easy to find.

673
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:21,175
Then leave!

674
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:23,521
Don’t forget to pack all your things and get out of my friend’s place.

675
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:25,746
Yeah.

676
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:32,866
You did the right thing.

677
00:57:34,398 --> 00:57:38,181
If he can do this to you now, he’ll surely do it again.

678
00:57:39,518 --> 00:57:40,855
And it will get worse.

679
00:57:43,883 --> 00:57:45,906
It might not be just a minor assault next time.

680
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:51,026
I thought he would get better.

681
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:53,106
But then…

682
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:06,455
Aren’t you an acting coach?

683
00:58:07,491 --> 00:58:10,958
There are many characters that couldn’t change their behaviours.

684
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,643
You already gave him a chance. Don’t forget to give it to yourself too.

685
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:29,678
Love is never easy, Coach. But if you have to trade it with your pain, then it’s not a good one.

686
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:54,695
Thank you so much.

687
00:59:01,758 --> 00:59:08,043
I’m sorry you have to witness all this on our first time hanging out together.

688
00:59:08,626 --> 00:59:11,666
Hey, don’t worry.

689
00:59:12,718 --> 00:59:17,483
It’s actually good. We get to know each other really quick this way.

690
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:25,335
Quit thinking about it.

691
00:59:28,934 --> 00:59:30,831
Didn’t you say you’re a local here?

692
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:35,106
I’m your guest. Please give me a tour.

693
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:10,843
Hey, you’re so wasted, Coah.

694
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:15,232
I don’t want to go home.

695
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,043
I don’t want to see him.

696
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:24,181
Then don’t. Stay here with me. You’ll be safe.

697
01:00:31,186 --> 01:00:33,586
I used to date a girl when I was in high school.

698
01:00:34,861 --> 01:00:38,683
So, it’s you who wouldn’t be safe to stay here with me.

699
01:00:41,243 --> 01:00:42,706
I’ve always dated girls.

700
01:00:43,381 --> 01:00:44,701
I’m immune to it.

701
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:49,118
Okay, let’s go then.

702
01:01:23,678 --> 01:01:25,598
Here we are.

703
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:31,335
Is this Pannarai’s clinic?

704
01:01:32,558 --> 01:01:33,689
No.

705
01:01:34,855 --> 01:01:36,432
Pam is on duty here.

706
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:39,963
Okay. Let’s go then.

707
01:01:40,181 --> 01:01:40,981
Wait.

708
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:48,501
Remember what I’ve told you? We’re here to ask for their help.

709
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:54,695
So, don’t get upset and pick a quarrel with Pam. You have to be very patient, okay?

710
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:59,201
Why are you asking me to do a lot of things? I’ll just go home then.

711
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:00,546
Wait.

712
01:02:04,866 --> 01:02:06,763
You go ahead and talk to her first.

713
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:08,558
What if she upsets me again?

714
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:11,678
Then count to 10 before you’d talk back to her.

715
01:02:12,398 --> 01:02:16,683
If it still doesn’t work, then count to 1,000.

716
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:20,112
Won’t we finished talking tomorrow then?

717
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:25,461
That’s right. That’s why I’m telling you to be patient.

718
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:29,838
It’s easy for you to say. You’re not me.

719
01:02:34,672 --> 01:02:35,723
Fine.

720
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,363
What are you doing?

721
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:50,443
In an acting class, this is how you get rid of old emotions and prepare yourself for taking in new ones.

722
01:02:52,281 --> 01:02:55,026
That’s it. Let’s go now.

723
01:02:58,221 --> 01:02:58,741
1

724
01:02:58,741 --> 01:02:59,301
2

725
01:02:59,301 --> 01:02:59,821
3

726
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:00,558
4

727
01:03:00,763 --> 01:03:01,351
5

728
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:01,741
6

729
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:02,295
7

730
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:02,841
8

731
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:03,506
9

732
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:04,283
10

733
01:03:04,946 --> 01:03:05,561
11

734
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:06,161
12

735
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,438
13

736
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:14,661
Babe, Dawan and Kim are here.

737
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:34,855
Wait, Kim. I’ll do as you say but you must tell me something first.

738
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:38,081
Between Pam and I, who’s prettier?

739
01:03:38,306 --> 01:03:39,281
Who’s richer?

740
01:03:39,575 --> 01:03:40,615
And who’s better?

741
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,335
Wan, you’re embarrassing me.

742
01:03:46,649 --> 01:03:48,843
If you don’t answer me, then I won’t do it.

743
01:03:53,031 --> 01:03:57,278
You’re prettier, richer, and better.

744
01:04:01,426 --> 01:04:02,581
Are you happy now?

745
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:19,518
Hi.

746
01:04:19,758 --> 01:04:20,546
Hi.

747
01:04:31,975 --> 01:04:32,809
I’m sorry.

748
01:04:36,398 --> 01:04:38,912
Was that a cough an apology? I couldn’t get it.

749
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:42,672
Is something clogging your ears?

750
01:04:44,295 --> 01:04:45,801
Wan, start counting.

751
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:47,449
1

752
01:04:48,569 --> 01:04:49,723
2

753
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:50,786
3

754
01:04:51,175 --> 01:04:52,226
4

755
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,232
5

756
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:54,318
6

757
01:04:54,592 --> 01:04:55,301
7

758
01:04:55,586 --> 01:04:56,386
8

759
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:57,561
9

760
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,398
10

761
01:05:00,352 --> 01:05:02,921
Calm down. Don’t be upset.

762
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:04,672
Okay.

763
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:15,152
Fine. I’m going to say it one more time. Listen very carefully.

764
01:05:16,535 --> 01:05:21,152
I’m sorry for being rude to you that day at Mon’s restaurant.

765
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:24,055
I’m here to apologize.

766
01:05:25,049 --> 01:05:29,221
And I want Dokrak to be my stylist while Kim is on her break.

767
01:05:29,586 --> 01:05:30,558
Do you agree?

768
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:33,918
No.

769
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:38,283
Hey, I already apologized.

770
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:41,815
She’s usually very busy.

771
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:45,632
If she also has to work for you, she wouldn’t have time for me.

772
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:49,141
Which means I’d have less time to spend with my girl.

773
01:05:49,883 --> 01:05:51,495
But I still love you the same.

774
01:05:56,283 --> 01:06:02,021
Babe, don’t forget that I have a job today because of Kim.

775
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:09,323
That’s right. Kim is the first one who saw her talent and gave her a job as a stylist.

776
01:06:09,712 --> 01:06:15,861
Otherwise, she would’ve been stuck here as an assistant to the dentist.

777
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,278
That’d be so boring.

778
01:06:18,501 --> 01:06:21,369
I see. It’s too bad for Kim then.

779
01:06:22,123 --> 01:06:24,398
If she doesn’t have to be stuck with a pompous actress,

780
01:06:24,592 --> 01:06:27,072
she would have been a world-class stylist by now.

781
01:06:37,015 --> 01:06:39,998
They’re a good match indeed.

782
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:41,083
Yeah.

783
01:06:55,575 --> 01:06:56,443
Pam.

784
01:06:57,929 --> 01:06:59,186
Please help Wan.

785
01:07:03,141 --> 01:07:05,815
Come on, babe. Please help them..

786
01:07:08,043 --> 01:07:09,849
Fine. I only agree because of Kim.

787
01:07:13,392 --> 01:07:14,272
Thank you.

788
01:07:20,927 --> 01:07:21,714
1

789
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:23,034
2

790
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:24,607
3

791
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:26,727
4

792
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:42,247
Wan, I already sent Dokrak your work schedule.

793
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:46,261
If you need to have your dress fixed, you can always tell me.

794
01:07:46,474 --> 01:07:47,927
I’ll talk to Dokrak for you.

795
01:07:51,607 --> 01:07:56,581
Are you still mad at me because I asked you to apologize to Pam?

796
01:07:59,394 --> 01:08:02,781
Wan, can you hear me?

797
01:08:07,194 --> 01:08:08,074
Wan.

798
01:08:08,314 --> 01:08:09,247
Wan!

799
01:08:10,807 --> 01:08:14,967
I’m sorry, what did you say? I was chatting with Pat.

800
01:08:17,518 --> 01:08:21,449
Is he really hitting on you?

801
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:24,786
He keeps asking me to go surfing with him at Khao Takiab.

802
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,598
That’s right, Kim. Let’s go together.

803
01:08:29,929 --> 01:08:32,123
We haven’t gone to the beach for quite some time.

804
01:08:35,106 --> 01:08:37,095
He invited you not me.

805
01:08:38,089 --> 01:08:41,038
But if I have to go, I want to go with you only.

806
01:08:44,546 --> 01:08:46,398
I have 2 free days.

807
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,329
Let’s go together, just the two of us.

808
01:08:49,106 --> 01:08:50,321
I’ll book the hotel now.

809
01:08:50,821 --> 01:08:52,855
But Toon told us to…

810
01:08:52,855 --> 01:08:54,851
Don’t tell her. We would go secretly.

811
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,712
Done! I’ve booked a hotel.

812
01:09:11,921 --> 01:09:18,561
Guest
Tack - Phongsakorn Sukeing

813
01:09:35,681 --> 01:09:38,721
My Marvellous Dream Is You.

814
01:09:39,072 --> 01:09:43,781
You do everything for Wan because you want her to be happy. But look at yourself.

815
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:47,163
What do you get from doing all this?

816
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:50,021
You can’t even walk straight. Are you drunk?

817
01:09:50,546 --> 01:09:52,958
Do you own this place?

818
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:54,683
Yes.

819
01:09:55,072 --> 01:09:59,141
I guess this friend of yours must mean a lot to you.

820
01:09:59,735 --> 01:10:01,301
Yes, she does.

821
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:04,261
You’re so rude. Haven’t your parents taught you anything?

822
01:10:04,261 --> 01:10:05,952
- Why did you talk back to me like that?!
- Ouch!

823
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:06,592
Mum!

824
01:10:06,843 --> 01:10:08,401
It still doesn’t fit.

825
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:10,401
Is it too exposed on the breast?

826
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:13,483
If you’re going to have it fixed that much, why don’t you just wear something else?

827
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:16,855
I only need a second with you.

828
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:19,561
What do you want to talk to me?

829
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:38,881
🎵All I can do is saying ‘I love you’ during the night🎵

830
01:10:39,518 --> 01:10:45,521
🎵Holding you tight until we’d meet again🎵

831
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:52,321
🎵Counting down to the day we’d meet🎵

832
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:59,441
🎵Missing those time we spent together🎵

833
01:11:00,249 --> 01:11:09,201
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream. The dream that can never…🎵

834
01:11:09,551 --> 01:11:12,421
🎵…come true.🎵

835
01:11:12,421 --> 01:11:15,426
🎵I want to cherish all the moments…🎵

836
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:18,801
🎵And memorise every second…🎵

837
01:11:19,061 --> 01:11:27,401
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say love you in real life🎵
