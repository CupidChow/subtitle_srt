1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,980
Kim is getting married.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,350
With whom?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,700
Marwin.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,830
You already took it, didn’t you?

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,590
I thought you said all the answers are in there.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,120
It’s too late now.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,880
No. But it will be because you are sitting here and doing nothing.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,870
Excuse me, can you all please leave first?

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,360
Kim, do you hear me? Kim!

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,020
Kim won’t leave her room.

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,850
That’s not my problem.

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,150
Kim loves you.

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,910
She’s always been waiting for you to return her love.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,280
Hey, are you all right?

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,540
- Are you okay?
- Are you hurt?

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,060
-  Butt hurts.     /     - Are you okay?

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,980

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,070
The groom is here.

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,180
Hello.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,630
Hello.

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,510
Hello.

36
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,030
The place looks so beautiful. You have done a wonderful job today.

37
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,630
All the guests are talking about it.

38
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,700
My mother also loves it so much.

39
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,410
Thank you.

40
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,270
This is probably my last wedding.

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,990
Thank you so much for keeping your promise.

42
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,190
Thank you for keeping your words.

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,820
Now, I can rest assured to leave Kim in your care.

44
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,630
Please don’t worry.

45
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,190
I will never leave her.

46
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,750
I will make her the happiest woman.

47
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,190
So that you will be happy too.

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
Oh, don’t worry about me.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,160
The ceremony is going to start soon. I’m so nervous.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,730
Where’s your father? Is he still on the way?

51
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,130
I’m sorry but his father is busy today.

52
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,770
He has a meeting so he won’t be joining us.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,900
Oh, I’ll also have to leave soon.

54
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,020
I have to go help your father welcome his guests.

55
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,060
Umm…aren’t you going to stay for the wedding?

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,160
I’m so sorry. I’m afraid I can’t.

57
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,900
Please excuse us first. I’ll introduce my mother to the guests over there.

58
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,290
See you at the wedding.

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,390
What was that?

60
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,630
I think Kim will surely have a tough time…

61
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,610
being a daughter-in-law of an elite family like that.

62
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,450
Just like Pongpol, when he married into my family.

63
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,080
My mother pressured him a lot.

64
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,520
So much that he had to moved out.

65
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,880
Now that she knows he’s gay,

66
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,700
she hates him even more. She said she doesn’t want to see his face ever again in her life.

67
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,900
Did I make a wrong decision by asking Kim to do this?

68
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,040
Do you think Kim will be able to go along well with Marwin’s family?

69
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,870
I’m worried about our daughter.

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,030
I don’t know.

71
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,730
Miss Ae, is the bride ready? The guests would like to take a picture with the wedding couple.

72
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,080
Should I go get her? Or do you want to go yourself?

73
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,990
Please go tell her for me.

74
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,740
Okay.

75
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,230
Miss. Excuse me, Miss. Are you all right?

76
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,950
Miss. Please come out and talk to us.

77
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,210
Why didn’t she come out?

78
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,870
Almost everyone drives recklessly like this.

79
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,910
Miss Dawan.

80
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,190
Is everyone all right?

81
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,570
- It hurts everywhere.
- I’m all right. Just a minor injury.

82
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,990
I’m really sorry.

83
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,670
My arm hurts.

84
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,750
Please let me pay for your loss. Please take it.

85
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,260
Okay, thank you.

86
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,710
- I’m in a hurry. I’m really sorry.
- Okay

87
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,060
I’m sorry.

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,570
Oh, you’re bleeding!

89
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,690
I’m okay.

90
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,020
To Dawan

91
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,750
When you finally read this letter, it will probably be years after this.

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,420
I’ve pondered hard whether I should tell you about it.

93
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,610
But then like I said, it’ll probably be years after this until you get to read it.

94
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,940
We might have laughed about it together by then.

95
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,340
Of all the friends that I have, I love you the most.

96
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,740
You’re my number one. I place you above all in my heart.

97
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,700
No one can ever replace you.

98
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,450
I love you so much that I even dream about you. Do you think I’m weird?

99
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,240
I actually met you before we would become friends.

100
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,240
I also dreamt of you.

101
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,270
Since when I was little, I’ve always dreamt of this special friend.

102
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,850
In that dream, the world is only ours.

103
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,350
I’ve never thought that person actually exists.

104
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,430
When I woke up, I couldn’t remember who she was.

105
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,860
Until we finally met in real life.

106
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,020
That special friend in my dream is you.

107
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,530
We did a lot of things together in my dream.

108
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,230
I don’t know how to tell you, but it was such a good dream.

109
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,370
I didn’t want to wake up from it.

110
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,140
You have been in every moment of my life.

111
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,300
I have no place for someone else in my heart. There’s only you in there.

112
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,840
To me, you’re a friend, an older and younger sister, and sometimes a badass too.

113
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,410
I like everything about you.

114
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:11,970
I think I’m falling in love with you, even though
I’m against this kind of thing because of what our fathers did to us.

115
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,780
But you’re an exemption.

116
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,690
I love you because you are you. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a guy or a girl.

117
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,080
But I don’t know if my feeling will still be the same when you finally get to read this letter.

118
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,720
If you or I already have someone else by then…

119
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,200
let’s read this letter and get embarrassed while also laughing about it together.

120
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,840
But in this moment while I’m writing to you,

121
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,100
I really do feel like that about you. And the feelings are so strong.

122
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,740
If these feelings still remain in the future, and you also feel the same way…

123
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,220
Please let me know.

124
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,620
- Mon, can you get a hold of her?
- No.

125
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,840
Jeez, what to do now? It’s almost time.

126
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,320
- I don’t know too. She’s not picking up.
- Call her again. Quickly.

127
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,440
What’s wrong with Kim?

128
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,810
Did she pick up?

129
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,540
- Did she pick up?
- No!

130
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,150
What to do now?

131
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,860
Wan is not picking up.

132
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,980
Please wait!

133
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,410
Miss Ae has asked me to get the bride. Many guests are waiting to take a picture with the wedding couple.

134
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,100
Hold on.

135
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,650
We’re her best friends. Let us handle it.

136
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,300
- Please hurry up.
- Okay, don’t worry.

137
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,950
Go talk to her.

138
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,950
Kim! Can you come out and talk to me?

139
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,530
Kim!

140
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,160

141
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,140

Jeez! Wan.

149
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,040
Keep calling her.

150
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,280
- Hey!
- Where on earth is she?

151
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,360
- Oh!
- Hey!

152
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,150
Hey!

153
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,640
Wan, are you okay?

154
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,560
Are you real? You’re not a ghost, aren’t you?

155
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:42,920
Jeez.

156
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,750
Why are you bleeding?

157
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,680
It doesn’t matter.

158
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,480
Is Kim still in there?

159
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,390
Yes.

160
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,080
Go and talk to her.

161
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,570
Kim.

162
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,100
- Kim.     /     - (Door knocking)

163
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,810
It’s me, Wan.

165

00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,900
Let me talk to her alone.

177
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,930
- Okay.     /    - Okay.

178
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,700
Kim.

179
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,070
Kim.

180
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,990
Please hear me out first.

181
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,420
You don’t have to say anything.

182
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,350
Does it hurt?

183
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,390
Are you hurt anywhere else?

184
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,030
I’m sorry, Kim.

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,980
Sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.

186
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,980
I should have told you long ago.

187
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,140
I…

188
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,880
I…

189
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,360
I’m so bloody stupid.

190
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,870
I’m sorry, Kim.

191
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:32,310
I’m sorry I lied to you about the letter. I told you I read it, but actually I didn’t.

192
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,190
But now I have read it, Kim.

193
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,940
Now I know how you feel.

194
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,890
And I want to let you know that all this time…

195
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,580
I’ve never thought about you as just a friend.

196
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,370
Wan…

197
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,340
You’re someone special to me.

198
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,170
You have always been.

199
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,570
I don’t know if you’ll believe me for telling you this.

200
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,230
But…

201
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,650
I also dreamt about you.

202
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
Really?

203
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,160
Did you really dream about me?

204
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,580
How is that possible?

205
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,340
We’re not in our dreams right now, are we?

206
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,960
I don’t know how it happened.

207
00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:01,470
I started dreaming about you even when I didn’t know who you were or what you looked like.

208
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,220
But when you moved in next door,

209
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,470
that person in my dream has always been you.

210
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,000
I never told you this because…

211
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,840
Because I was afraid you’d think I’m crazy.

212
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,630
I came here…

213
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,940
I came here because…

214
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,280
I can’t stand seeing you marrying someone else.

215
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,470
I wish it were just a dream.

216
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,210
I wish you didn’t have to get married.

217
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,960
I wish you didn’t have to do it.

218
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,580
But I know…

219
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,640
that if you’ve already made up your mind,

220
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,390
no one can make you change it.

221
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,330
I’m so mad at myself.

222
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,550
I’m so f***ing mad at myself for having read your letter just now.

223
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,200
10 years ago, you only had me.

224
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,800
But a few minutes from now, someone else will take my place in your heart.

225
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,420
You really know me well.

226
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:56,110
It’s true that if I’ve made up my mind, nothing can ever change it.

227
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,880
But there’s one thing you don’t know.

228
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,240
You’re always an exemption.

229
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,800
You’re the only one that I want.

230
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,150
And I’ve always wanted you.

231
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,070
I want to stay by your side.

232
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,460
I’m so sorry, Kim.

233
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,640
I’m sorry.

234
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,810
I’m sorry for everything.

235
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,960
It took me so long.

236
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,480
I’m such a coward.

237
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,160
I’m sorry.

238
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,280
Wan.

239
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,900
Can you do me a favour?

240
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,370
Just say it.

241
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:22,050
Just say it and I’ll do everything for you. I can do anything for you.

242
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,430
I want to get out of here.

243
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,160
Kim…let’s go.

244
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,730
Thank you so much.

245
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,490
Will she be able to calm Kim down?

246
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,150
I think so.

247
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,420
What about the letter? You’ve never told me about it.

248
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,500
Jeez! It’s a secret.

249
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,950
- Hey! Wait!    /    - Wait!

250
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,550
- What’s going on?
- What’s going on?

251
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,370
- What’s going on?
- Where are you going?

252
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,150
Don’t tell me you two are running away together.

253
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,740
- Damn it.    /    - Damn it.

254
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,600
- Wan, you’re not a nobody. Your mother has her place among high society. And you’re an actress.
- That’s right.

255
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,390
Most of the guests at your wedding are either celebrities or people from elite families.

256
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,360
She’s right.

257
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,980
- Kim, you’re smart. You’ve always been rational.
- Yeah.

258
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,870
Are you sure you’re not just doing this by impulse?

259
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,280
Are you ready to take the consequences?

260
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,280
Yeah, think about it.

261
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,780
Think, Wan.

262
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,390
But if you stay, you’ll have to suffer from this marriage for the rest of your life.

263
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,250
And you’ll have to see her heartbroken.

264
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,080
Then one day, she might end up getting marry to a celebrity.

265
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,030
Are you ready to take the consequence if you choose to do that?

266
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,690
- Hang on.    /    - Huh?

267
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,510
- Are you sure about this?
-Yeah.

268
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,560
Okay then. Listen to me.

269
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,850
If you and Kim don’t run away now, Kim will have to marry Marwin.

270
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,880
She will have sex with him, and have a baby with him.

271
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,740
What do you say now?

272
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,940
I’ll run away with her.

273
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,220
Okay. Kim, will you go or stay?

274
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,230
This is my last chance to be with her.

275
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,470
We’ll worry about the consequences later.

276
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,000
Are you sure?

277
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,210
Mhm.

278
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,230
Wan, give me your hands.

279
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,260
Your fame and your career will disappear in a flash.

280
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,530
People on social media will also talk bad about you.

281
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,910
Your depression might come back.

282
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,890
Are you okay with that?

283
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,980
It’s better than letting her marry someone else.

284
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,500
Mhm.

285
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,010
What if something bad happens,

286
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,830
you’re not going to blame her or say something like, ‘I shouldn’t have done that. are you?

287
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,220
Are you sure about this?

288
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,960
Mhm.

289
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,930
Okay.

290
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,430
We have done our job. We’ve told you all the pros and cons before you’d do it.

291
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,940
All right then. Now, you two run away and don’t turn back.

292
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,820
But promise me one thing. You must never break up. Got it?

293
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,440
I don’t want our gang to disband.

294
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,100
Now, go.

295
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,230
Go!

296
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,340
Kim.

297
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,340
Kim!

298
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,110
Kim!

299
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,130
Kim!

300
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,530
Kim!

301
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,360
Where are you going, Kim?

302
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,690
- Where are you going?
- Mum, I’m sorry!

303
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,480
Wan!

304
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,190
Kim!

305
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,260
Wan!

306
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,410
- Wan!     /     - Wan!

307
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,940
- Kim! Wan! Run as far as you can!
- Run, guys! And, don’t come back!

308
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,110
Does it hurt?

309
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,410
No, it’s nothing.

310
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,240
Are you sure?

311
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:31,290
My Marvellous Dream is You
MingErTeamSub

312
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:38,383
My Marvellous Dream Is You

313
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:51,243
Kim.

314
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:56,323
I have some spare clothes in my car.

315
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:59,703
I put them inside, in case you want to change out of that dress.

316
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:01,243
Mhm.

317
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:14,073
I’ve also asked the staff at the resort to prepare BBQ and marshmallows for us.

318
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,773
Or…do you want to go out to eat?

319
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:22,813
No, I’m okay.

320
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,353
Okay.

321
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:44,413
Do you think we…

322
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:47,263
did the right thing?

323
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:03,933
That question has been stuck in my head for a while.

324
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:07,693
But I think I have an answer now.

325
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:14,653
I chose you.

326
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:19,523
If you hadn’t come for me today,

327
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:25,743
I would have to suffer with someone I don’t love for the rest of my life.

328
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,633
Many people are now in trouble because of us.

329
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:42,843
A lot more problems will probably follow.

330
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,213
Will you be able to take it?

331
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:56,833
Of course.

332
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:02,523
As long as you’re here with me,

333
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,023
I’m not afraid of anything.

334
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,033
That’s right.

335
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:14,683
When you weren’t by my side,

336
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:17,763
I really had a hard time in life.

337
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:25,323
But now that you’re here with me,

338
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,483
there’s nothing that I’m afraid of.

339
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,373
So…

340
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:46,443
from now on, no matter what will happen,

341
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:49,983
we’ll go through it together.

342
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:10,943
By the way, what should we do now?

343
00:26:13,743 --> 00:26:23,813
Well, should we grill these BBQ and marshmallows?

344
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:27,383
I’m hungry now.

345
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:29,403
Okay.

346
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:31,343
Okay.

347
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:40,993
Hmm, what should we pick?

348
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:44,633
Maybe marshmallows?

349
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:02,463
This reminds me of when we were young.

350
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:05,403
Mhm.

351
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:16,423
Does it hurt?

352
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:20,693
No, it’s nothing.

353
00:27:30,193 --> 00:27:31,603
Are you sure?

354
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:26,173
Well, I…I’ll go change first.

355
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:30,333
It feels so weird to grill a marshmallows in this dress.

356
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,333
You’re right.

357
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:34,003
Mhm.

358
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:35,423
I’ll grill them for you.

359
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:37,033
- Mhm.    /    - Mhm.

360
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,363
Let me help.

361
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:25,873
We’re lovers now.

362
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:33,223
I love you, Wan.

363
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:34,753
Morning, Kim.

364
00:33:36,523 --> 00:33:37,863
Morning.

365
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:58,163
Why does time pass so fast when I’m with you?

366
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:04,013
Do we have to go back and face the truth now?

367
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,053
I don’t want to turn on my phone.

368
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,073
I don’t want to know anything.

369
00:34:16,673 --> 00:34:18,243
We can’t escape it.

370
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:23,403
Let’s go back, and be responsible for what we have done.

371
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,433
Your mother must feel so bad about this.

372
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:31,633
If I’m not honest with her,

373
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:36,943
she wouldn’t have known and still wanted me to marry the person I don’t love.

374
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:40,443
I’ll show your mum and prove it to her…

375
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,883
that I can also make you happy, maybe even better than what Marwin did.

376
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:50,973
I’ve never compared you with him, Wan.

377
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,283
You’ve always been the one for me.

378
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,943
Let’s go home to our mothers.

379
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:27,373
Mum.

380
00:35:30,383 --> 00:35:31,443
You’re back?

381
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:34,983
I came to check on Ae.

382
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,733
So, we had talked about what happened a little.

383
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,653
It’s good that you two are back.

384
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,523
She wants to talk to you.

385
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,383
Both of you.

386
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:54,983
I’m sorry, Mum.

387
00:35:56,043 --> 00:35:59,163
No, it was all my fault.

388
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:02,073
I’m sorry for taking her away.

389
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,763
No, I was the one who told her to do it.

390
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:08,823
No, it was me.

391
00:36:08,823 --> 00:36:11,033
If I hadn’t agreed, she wouldn’t have…

392
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:14,853
Please stop trying to take the blame for the other.

393
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:20,743
If I could turn back the time,

394
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,123
I would’ve still done the same thing.

395
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:35,943
I really love her, Mum.

396
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,633
What I want to know…

397
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:45,743
is what you plan to do next.

398
00:36:47,283 --> 00:36:51,613
People already know by now that you two are together.

399
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:56,083
I’ll show everyone and let them know

400
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,023
that I love her.

401
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,723
If that’s how you really feel,

402
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:05,183
then I’m okay with it.

403
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,543
But you’re an actress.

404
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:09,543
It doesn’t matter at all.

405
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:11,673
I chose her.

406
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,073
I also love her, Mum.

407
00:37:26,263 --> 00:37:30,803
If you both had been honest to each other from the beginning,

408
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:34,663
this wouldn’t have had happened.

409
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:42,623
Kim, the reason I want you to get married…

410
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:46,523
is because I’m worried about you

411
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,003
I want you to have someone to look after you.

412
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:54,203
All I want is for you…

413
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:58,753
to be happy with the person you love, and also loves you.

414
00:38:01,773 --> 00:38:03,223
That’s all I want.

415
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:08,083
(Crying)
I worry about you.

416
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:15,843
(Crying)
I don’t want you to live alone for the rest of your life.

417
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,023
(Crying)

418
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:24,093
We came back…

419
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:28,773
because we want to be responsible for what we did.

420
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:37,683
I’m glad that you came back and want to take responsibility for what you did.

421
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:39,853
You both know it better than anyone,

422
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:44,473
how what your fathers did had affected all of us.

423
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:48,913
What you and Kim are doing right now…

424
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:52,283
is not much different from what they did.

425
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:55,153
The consequences of your decision…

426
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:58,993
is now affecting a lot of people in our lives.

427
00:39:00,113 --> 00:39:01,943
Especially for Marwin and his family.

428
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:12,523
Wan and I will go apologize to him.

429
00:39:49,773 --> 00:39:52,613
Mr. Marwin has a meeting outside. He won’t come in until afternoon.

430
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,623
It’s all right. We can wait.

431
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:11,633
- Excuse me?    /    - Hello.

432
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:17,583
- We’re here to see Mr. Marwin.
- I’m sorry, he will not come in today.

433
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,883
Let’s go, Kim. We can come again tomorrow.

434
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:46,343
Mum, many of your old clients have tried to contact me lately.

435
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,313
You surely won’t have time to rest when you get better.

436
00:40:50,683 --> 00:40:51,423
Mum!

437
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:13,383
My Marvellous Dream is You

438
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:20,488
My Marvellous Dream Is You

439
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:05,688
Please.

440
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,038
You don’t have to do this, Wan.

441
00:42:13,518 --> 00:42:15,428
I want to take care of you.

442
00:42:18,188 --> 00:42:24,208
Hey, smile a little. You keep worrying about Marwin.

443
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:27,622
- Let’s go inside.
- Mhm.

444
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:35,782
I’ll pick you up tomorrow.

445
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:40,742
Marwin has been avoiding us for the whole week.

446
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:43,279
Kim.

447
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,125
Even if he’ll keep avoiding us for months,

448
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,365
I’m not going to give up.

449
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,668
We must go apologize to him in person.

450
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,118
Mhm.

451
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:06,822
By the way, how’s your mum doing?

452
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,296
I forgot to ask because we were so busy about Marwin.

453
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,102
She’s better now.

454
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:18,559
It must be because of you.

455
00:43:19,713 --> 00:43:20,628
Because of me?

456
00:43:21,462 --> 00:43:26,582
Yeah, because you take really good care of me.

457
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:33,690
Then I’ll wait here and make sure you get inside safely.

458
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:35,736
Go on.

459
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:47,976
Kim.

460
00:43:53,313 --> 00:43:54,433
I love you.

461
00:43:57,062 --> 00:43:58,022
I know.

462
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:02,113
Now, go in.

463
00:44:03,096 --> 00:44:03,782
Mhm.

464
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:11,062
Ahem! Did you forget something?

465
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:16,730
I don’t think so.

466
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:20,045
Hmm, really?

467
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,365
Did you forget something?

468
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,165
That’s enough, Wan.

469
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,353
Go home now. Drive safely.

470
00:44:56,548 --> 00:44:59,336
- Do I have to go already?
- Mhm.

471
00:45:03,142 --> 00:45:03,988
Fine.

472
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:15,268
- Bye bye! I’m going then.
- Mhm.

473
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,176
I’m really going.

474
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:27,039
Okay.

475
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:30,033
Goodnight.

476
00:45:30,776 --> 00:45:31,805
Goodnight.

477
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:32,959
Bye bye.

478
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,102
Mum.

479
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:13,370
Give me a hug.

480
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:16,662
How was your day? Tired?

481
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,250
Just a little.

482
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:22,010
Marwin still doesn’t want to see us.

483
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,862
But I’m not giving up.

484
00:46:25,988 --> 00:46:28,125
Some day, you’ll get to talk and clear it up with him.

485
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:34,250
Just like how we finally cleared it up with your father.

486
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:40,399
You can’t cut him off forever. He’s your father.

487
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:46,365
Now, do you understand why he did that?

488
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:59,508
Sometimes, love can blind us and make us do the wrong things to other people.

489
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:03,770
But what’s done is done.

490
00:47:04,342 --> 00:47:07,645
Just forget it and let’s start anew.

491
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:11,382
Life is about moving on.

492
00:47:18,148 --> 00:47:20,925
- You can do it.
- You too.

493
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:28,125
Anyway, how’s your clothing brand project going?

494
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,913
I haven’t started it, Mum.

495
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:33,610
I want to clear it up with Marwin first.

496
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:40,753
Don’t wait for too long.

497
00:47:41,496 --> 00:47:45,828
If you dream of doing anything, do it while you still can.

498
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:47,633
Yes.

499
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:52,353
I wish you…

500
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:56,639
success in everything that you do. Okay?

501
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:00,353
Okay.

502
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,245
Please stay with me to witness my success.

503
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:06,010
Mhm.

504
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:09,805
What are you doing?

505
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,410
I have nothing to do so I’m trying to design a new collection for wedding dresses.

506
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,285
When I’m better, can you help me make these dresses?

507
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,570
- Of course.    /    - Mhm.

508
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:25,328
I’m not only going to help make them.

509
00:48:25,328 --> 00:48:30,388
- I’ll also help you look after your business.
- Hmm!

510
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:36,308
Are you recruiting? I know someone who’s perfect for this job.

511
00:48:36,353 --> 00:48:37,496
Can she do it for free?

512
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,530
Hmm, okay.

513
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:43,850
Here, what do you think?

514
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:45,782
It’s so beautiful.

515
00:48:47,153 --> 00:48:48,388
Beautiful like the person who designed it.

516
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,468
Awww.

517
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:36,548
Mum.

518
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,690
I brought you food.

519
00:49:40,765 --> 00:49:42,193
I’ll put it on the table.

520
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:50,056
Mum, many of your old clients have tried to contact me lately.

521
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:52,902
They want you to organize their weddings.

522
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,948
You surely won’t have time to rest when you get better.

523
00:49:55,948 --> 00:50:02,788
So, you have to wake up and eat. So that you can take your pills and get better soon.

524
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:05,873
Mum.

525
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:11,988
Mum.

526
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:20,433
Mum!

527
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,228
(Crying)
Mum!

528
00:50:27,405 --> 00:50:28,768
(Crying)

529
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:30,308
(Crying)
Mum!

530
00:50:31,919 --> 00:50:34,982
(Crying)
Mum!

531
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,296
(Crying)

532
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,199
She loved this room so much.

533
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:11,050
It was where she did the job she loved.

534
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,902
You’re now home, Ae.

535
00:51:19,873 --> 00:51:21,713
You’re now home with us.

536
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:45,588
(Crying)

537
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:48,422
(Crying)

538
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:55,508
(Crying)
Kim.

539
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,462
(Crying)
She told me before she passed away…

540
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,388
(Crying)
that she would be happy if you’re happy.

541
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:16,228
(Crying)
If you keep crying like this,

542
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:20,696
(Crying)
how could she be happy?

543
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:24,948
(Crying)

544
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:34,685
Let’s sit down.

545
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:38,765
(Crying)

546
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,068
Kim.

547
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:01,142
From now on, if you want anything,

548
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:03,519
you can always tell me.

549
00:53:04,879 --> 00:53:09,130
I want to make it up to you, for all those years that I hadn’t cared for you.

550
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:16,285
From now on, please let me take care of you.

551
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,319
Wan told me you want to start an online store for your own clothing brand.

552
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:27,473
Is there anything we can help you?

553
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:32,468
You can always let us know if you need anything.

554
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:37,645
Your dad is an expert in creating websites. And I’m quite good at marketing.

555
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:46,936
But if you don’t want us to interfere, then you can tell us honestly. We’d understand.

556
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:55,108
How about this? I’ll help invest in your business.

557
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,176
But you don’t have to give me my share yet.

558
00:53:59,828 --> 00:54:03,919
Wait until your business is going well enough, then you can pay me back.

559
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,108
Hang on. Okay.

560
00:54:15,108 --> 00:54:16,216
1 2 3!

561
00:54:16,422 --> 00:54:19,370
Okay, that’s it.

562
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:23,450
It’s been a while since I had done something to sweat it out like this.

563
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,262
- Oh, really? Are you okay then?
- Of course.

564
00:54:26,285 --> 00:54:26,948
Are you sure?

565
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:28,833
- I’ve had a lot worse than this.
- Oh, wow.

566
00:54:30,158 --> 00:54:35,553
- All right, labourers, let’s freshen up a bit with these fresh fruit juice and some snacks.
- Thank you.

567
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:38,388
- We’re labourers now.
- (Chuckling)

568
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,248
- Oh!
- How is it?

569
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:43,473
- Feels so much better.
- So fresh.

570
00:54:43,588 --> 00:54:46,268
- Go get a physical check-up sometimes.
- By the way, where are the girls?

571
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:49,108
There they are.

572
00:54:49,462 --> 00:54:50,848
- Ah
- Speaking of the devil.

573
00:54:50,848 --> 00:54:56,068
- Come, let’s help them.
- Let me help.

574
00:54:56,068 --> 00:55:00,098
- Wan and Kim, have some drinks first.
- Thank you, Mum.

575
00:55:00,098 --> 00:55:03,508
- I made it myself. Freshly squeezed.
- Thank you.
- Wan.

576
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:07,565
- How could you carry them? They’re so heavy.
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

577
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:11,530
- I can’t do the labour work so I’m taking care of the food.
- So yummy.

578
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:12,445
Is it good?

579
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:16,810
- There are lots of stuff.
- Yeah.

580
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,256
Let me see.

581
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:24,513
Oh, let’s put it here.

582
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:28,982
Put the scissors away first.

583
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:36,628
Everyone, thank you so much for coming to help.

584
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:40,948
From now on, this place will be DREAM head office.

585
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:45,085
So that I can stay close to Mum too.

586
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:51,016
Ae must surely be proud to have a daughter like you.

587
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:55,828
Put it over there, Wan.

588
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,462
Kim, why did you choose to name your brand ‘DREAM’?

589
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,188
It’s a strange thing indeed.

590
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:08,159
But it did happened.

591
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:13,908
Wan and I have dreamt about each other since when we were young.

592
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:23,668
Also, DREAM is a brand extending from what my mum had intended to do.

593
00:56:24,262 --> 00:56:25,702
I want to make it a success.

594
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:35,576
Hey.

595
00:56:36,353 --> 00:56:38,079
Why don’t you show it to her?

596
00:56:38,102 --> 00:56:40,559
- Right now?
- Yes, come on.

597
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:43,085
- I don’t know if she’ll like it.
- Just show it to her.

598
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,279
- Okay    /    - Okay

599
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:47,736
Kim.

600
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:49,610
Are you ready?

601
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:53,416
I have something to show you.

602
00:56:54,548 --> 00:57:02,970
From now on, your DREAM brand will no longer be just a dream. I made this for you.

603
00:57:04,742 --> 00:57:07,622
- Here.
- Wow!
- Do you like it?

604
00:57:08,148 --> 00:57:12,330
- I developed it from the old logo of Ae’s brand.
- Yes.

605
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:18,399
I made it look trendier and I also used meaningful colours.

606
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,398
Blue represents your mother.

607
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:23,248
She’s now a star but still alive in us.

608
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:26,102
Pink was your favourite colour when you were young.

609
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,656
And yellow represents the summer light. (*Kimhan means summer in Thai)

610
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,245
It represents our hope.

611
00:57:32,902 --> 00:57:34,490
- Do you like it?
- Wow.

612
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:38,262
Let me know if you want to adjust anything.

613
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,056
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

614
00:57:42,913 --> 00:57:44,048
It’s beautiful.

615
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:49,039
Guys, please come and help. We need your comments.

616
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:55,553
Let me know if you feel I should adjust anything. Feel free to give me your idea.

617
00:57:56,342 --> 00:57:57,839
- Do you like it?	    /    - Mhm.

618
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,136
- Wow.
- Do you really like it?

619
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,473
Yes, I love it, Dad.

620
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:08,376
Thank you, Dad.

621
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:40,768
My Marvellous Dream is You
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @DreamGLIDF

622
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:46,182
I wasn’t kidding when I said I wanted to make out with you.

623
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:50,348
- Hey, the live got cut off.
- Why?

624
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:52,913
Kim, don’t look so serious.

625
00:58:52,913 --> 00:58:56,968
You have our words. Mon and I will buy clothes from your store every day.

626
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:59,798
Why does our page have only weird comments?

627
00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:00,799
Hmm? Let me see.

628
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:03,302
It’s definitely Marwin’s doing.

629
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:08,090
Loving me only makes your life getting worse.

630
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,308
He told us to come at 9am but this is almost 3pm already.

631
00:59:11,308 --> 00:59:13,208
I don’t think he’d be here today.

632
00:59:13,473 --> 00:59:14,799
Are you okay, Wan?

633
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:16,559
What should we do, Kim?

634
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,288
We’ve done everything that we could and should do. Whatever will be will be.
