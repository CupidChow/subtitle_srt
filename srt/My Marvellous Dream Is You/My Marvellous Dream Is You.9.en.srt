1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,440
Welcome back, Wan.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,600
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,890
Wan, can you go to Hua Hin with me?

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,080
Marwin asked me to go on a trip with him.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,480
We first met here accidentally. Today, we’re finally here together.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,210
Wan.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,310
This is Kimhan, the woman I’ve told you about.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,020
Why are you looking at me like that?

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,540
Kim, please don’t get married.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,280
If you don’t, then I won’t either.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,010
We’ll be together till death do us apart.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,800
Mum, Miss Ae has cancer.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,128
Remember we used to talk about how we wanted to go on a road trip together?

14
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:39,386

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,140
My Marvellous Dream Is You

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,690
After that day, we had struggled a lot.

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,120
Our careers were ruined.

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,670
The company didn’t like it that we moved in together.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,730
So, we thought it might be time to start something new, even though it might be risky.

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,780
We talked a lot about what we would do.

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,130
And here we are.

35
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,260
We started from zero.

36
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:54,170
But it was not so bad. After we got married, we tried to expand our business.

37
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,510
Fortunately, we found this place.

38
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,840
Fortunately?

39
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,720
I know you and your mum are still mad at me.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,100
But I want you to know that I’m sorry too.

41
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,620
I did many terrible things to both of you.

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,980
You’re still as mean as before.

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,790
Do you want to hear about Mum and I after you left us….

44
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,750
to fend for ourselves?

45
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,540
Do you know how our lives have been ruined even until now?

46
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,160
It’s all because of you two.

47
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,340
People kept talking behind Miss Mon’s back,
so much that she got stressed out and became alcoholic.

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,430
She even went for a rehab.

49
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,650
Wan also has depression.

50
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,890
They are like this because of you!

51
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,100
I will never forgive both of you.

52
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,510
Kim.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,230
Kim.

54
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,510
Kim.

55
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,080
Wan.

56
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,920
Wan.

57
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,550
Sweetie.

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,480
(Crying)

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,840
(Crying)

60
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,210
(Crying)

61
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,070
(Crying)

62
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,900
(Crying)

63
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,600
I’m such a horrible person.

64
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,990
So horrible.

65
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,980
Can I ask you something?

66
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,980
Why did you choose to leave a letter…

67
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,160
and ran away?

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,650
Well, I admit I was afraid.

69
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,850
I was afraid of many truths. All I wanted back then…

70
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,050
was just to be together with him.

71
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,260
But then I couldn’t go back after I left.

72
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,320
It’s not that I didn’t want to.

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,430
But I didn’t know how to face you and our daughter again.

74
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,140
I’m so sorry, Katekamon. I really am.

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,930
Ae.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,300
Mon.

77
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,540
You can scold us or even curse at us.

78
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,190
We are willing to help you with anything.

79
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,800
Tim

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,670
You and Pongpol falling in love with each other is not wrong at all.

81
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,040
But the way you dealt with it has left a scar on each of our hearts.

82
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,240
Forgiving you…

83
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,720
doesn’t mean we would forget.

84
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,230
After this,

85
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,040
please don’t cause any trouble to anyone no matter what you’d do.

86
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,140
Thank you for forgiving us. But, Ae…

87
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,450
What about the kids?

88
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,360
Will they forgive us too?

89
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,990
Well…

90
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,690
It’s up to them.

91
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,970
Let’s go.

92
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,120
Kim.

93
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,660
Where’s your mum?

94
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,510
Is she working?

95
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,460
No

96
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,240
She just had a chemotherapy.

97
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,520
She asked me to take care of her work for her.

98
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:36,180
I have to hire a personal nurse to look after her, just in case anything happens.

99
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,150
My mum sends her best regards too.

100
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,730
Since that day that we bumped into our dads,

101
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,040
my dad has been trying to clear everything up with us.

102
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,490
He’s been trying to contact us.

103
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,890
He also tries to find a way to cure Miss Ae’s cancer.

104
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
Really?

105
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,440
Mhm.

106
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,820
I know it’s hard to get over it.

107
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,590
The thing that happened to our families.

108
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,470
But since it already happened, letting it be and trying to live with it like what your mum said…

109
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,070
should be the best way for all of us.

110
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,490
I don’t know.

111
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,490
I just want to protect my mum’s feelings.

112
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,110
An encouragement is the most important thing that I can give her right now.

113
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,020
When I see her getting hurt, it really breaks my heart.

114
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,620
I want to share those pains with her.

115
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,190
I know how you feel.

116
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,360
Thank you so much.

117
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,820
Mhm.

118
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,540
It’s such an honour to welcome you here.

119
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,410
Welcome to Luxury Bar.

120
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,750
Next time, prepare a red carpet for us.

121
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,180
I came because I’m afraid it might be closed down soon.

122
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,650
Hey, watch your mouth.

123
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,970
But that’s all right. Since you’re here, please give it a good review.

124
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,500
By the way, what’s wrong with her?

125
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,860
She’ll tell you soon.

126
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,830
Wait, tell me about what?

127
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,810
About many things.

128
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,770
Wait, many things? What are they?

129
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,560
Just wait. She’ll tell you soon.

130
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,590
- Really?       /     - Yeah.

131
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,060
- Okay, I’ll call Mali to hurry up then.
- Okay.

132
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,720
- So, we can hear it together.
- Okay.

133
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,300
‘Kay.

134
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,430
Wait.

135
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,670
What?

136
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,760
Does that mean ‘yes’?

137
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,530
Yes.

138
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,910
Wait! Are you sure?

139
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,380
Yes, I’m sure!

140
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,300
Many things?

141
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,390
What?! You broke up with Marwin?

142
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,970
Your mum has cancer?

143
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,810
And both of your dads got married?!

144
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,620
Jeez, why do both of your lives seem so complicated?

145
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,550
And you two are coming out here like this.

146
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,730
- Are your parents all right?
- Yeah.

147
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,620
The adults are clearing it up. Let’s not talk about my dad anymore.

148
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:16,960
Wait.

149
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,660
When I called you that night in Hua Hin,

150
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,790
you were sleeping with Wan not Marwin?

151
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,080
Mhm. What’s so strange?

152
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,750
We often sleep together.

153
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,080
Mhm.

154
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,840
I know. But what I find strange is that…

155
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,250
I called you both, but no one picked up at all.

156
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,930
What were you guys doing? Why didn’t you answer the phone?

157
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,930
Huh?

158
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,180
Umm, we were sleeping, of course. It was bedtime.

159
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,290
If you’re going to be like this, just call me nosy.

160
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,770
But I’m used to it though, because it’s true that I’m nosy.

161
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,070
- Oh my goodness!
- What?

162
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,240
Look there! Pam and Dokrak came to my bar!

163
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,320
It’s really them. How come?

164
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,910
Who invited them?

165
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,240
Not me. I have no idea.

166
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,680
Me neither.

167
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,820
It was me.

168
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,230
So that your place won’t be closed down.

169
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,170
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello there.

170
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,040
This place looks nice but it’s a bit too far.

171
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,350
Ah, yeah it really is.

172
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,210
Thank you for coming.

173
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,010
I was planning to go visit you and Pam at the shop.

174
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,590
I want to ask Dokrak about work.

175
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,900
If it has something to do with that pompous actress, then forget it.

176
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,630
Honey.

177
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,960
It’s not that.

178
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,860
I want to come up with my own clothing brand.

179
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,490
And I also want to help my mum run her wedding business.

180
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,010
She is very sick right now.

181
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:21,790
I’m thinking about renting the wedding dresses for those who want to take pre-wedding photos.

182
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,050
I’m sorry to ask but what happened to your mum?

183
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,460
Cancer.

184
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:49,290
Please don’t give up. I’m sure Pam knows a lot of friends who can help. Your mum will be okay soon.

185
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,010
I already sent you the contact info of a doctor who’s an expert in cancer.

186
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,860
He’s the best in this field. I’ll call and give him some briefing beforehand.

187
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,020
You can consult with him about your mother’s sickness and her treatment.

188
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,920
Thank you so much.

189
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,520
About the wedding dresses, I have a lot of friends.

190
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,960
I’ll tell them to spread the news.

191
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,100
Don’t worry.

192
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,430
And about your clothing brand, you can always call me 24/7.

193
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,640
I’d be so glad to help.

194
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:32,010
But if you’re going to come up with your own brand while also working at the gallery…

195
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,300
and taking care of your mother,

196
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,350
will you be okay though?

197
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,770
I’ll quit working at the gallery.

198
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,560
Does your boyfriend who owns the gallery…

199
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,010
It’s Marwin, right?

200
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,570
Does he know about this?

201
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,040
No, I don’t want to bother him.

202
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,710
About Marwin and I, I’m afraid it’d be impossible now.

203
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,250
Do you have an issue with him? Or with his family?

204
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,600
I’ve upset his parents.

205
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, that’s not a big deal at all. If you really like each other, I’m sure you’ll get through it.

206
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,440
Honey, this is really important.

207
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,310
If they decide to be together, Kim must go meet his family.

208
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,240
And he must do the same too.

209
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,180
Love is not just about two people.

210
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:57,570
So, did Marwin agree to let you go because of this?

211
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,220
I haven’t talked to him yet.

212
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,210
I’ll wait until this thing about my mum is settled first, then I’ll tell him.

213
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,230
You have to hurry up though. If you have no feelings for him,

214
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,710
then don’t leave it unclear like this…like you and Wan.

215
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,190
What about me and Wan?

216
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,850
Kim.

217
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,810
So, you two know how I feel about Wan?

218
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:03,300
My Marvellous Dream is You

219
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:10,521
My Marvellous Dream Is You

220
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:20,951
Please excuse me for prying into your personal life.

221
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:26,251
But if you had been cleared back then, it wouldn’t have been this tiring.

222
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:35,231
I’ve always known how you feel about Wan…since we were in high school.

223
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:41,451
So, now that all of you are here.

224
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:47,751
I’m going to do a lucky draw and choose the lucky on who’d be my girlfriend this year.

225
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:50,901
Let me see.

226
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,261
- Don’t touch.      /      - Hey!

227
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:57,071
Now, close your eyes. We’re going to jumble these gifts and then you can pick one.

228
00:19:58,201 --> 00:19:59,531
- Put them over here.
- Wait.

229
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:00,401
Just a second.

230
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:02,011
Put them over here.

231
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,311
- Okay, done.
- Okay.

232
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:04,241
It’s done.

233
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,481
Now, pick one.

234
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:06,431
All right then.

235
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:08,531
The lucky draw is about to start.

236
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:13,291
I’m going to go out with the first one that got picked.

237
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,831
Let’s do it.

238
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:17,781
Left, left! A little left. A bit more.

239
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:18,911
Girls.

240
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:22,261
Miss Charuoy wants to see all of you.

241
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:25,051
She said it’s something urgent.

242
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:25,851
Huh?

243
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:26,971
Jeez.

244
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:28,021
- Mali.     /    - What?

245
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:30,121
- What did you guys do?
- Yeah.

246
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,101
I don’t know. I didn’t do anything.

247
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:35,001
- Such a waste of time.
- We’d better hurry. Or else she’d get upset.

248
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:35,921
- Let’s go.     /     - Okay.

249
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:40,551
Thank you.

250
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:42,651
Thank you.

251
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,691
What is she doing?

252
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:06,751
Hmm, I wonder too.

253
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:44,181
Kim.

254
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:55,271
Happy Valentine’s Day.

255
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:57,471
Take it. I got a lot of them.

256
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,971
Okay, thank you.

257
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:25,251
Pam.

258
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,941
Why did she dump all of Dawan’s gifts in the bin?

259
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:49,391
There are two possible answers to why you did that.

260
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,031
One, you hated that Dawan was more popular.

261
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:56,581
Or two, you loved Dawan so much that you didn’t want her to receive a Valentine’s gift from anyone.

262
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:01,061
But time has proved it all, hasn’t it?

263
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,901
The reason that they are still together up until now…

264
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:08,981
is clearly not because of hatred.

265
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:14,891
So, you two know how I feel about Wan?

266
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:20,841
We’re girls, so it’s not hard to tell.

267
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:31,731
Honestly, you two are best friends. You studied together and even worked together. Do you guys really have no idea?

268
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,331
Or are you afraid you might lose each other as a friend?

269
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:45,671
You are struggling like this because you can’t be honest with your heart.

270
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,681
Confused and cannot start anew. All because you’re afraid.

271
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,411
Babe…

272
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,901
Trust me. I can help you with your mum.

273
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:59,351
But when it comes to your feeling, you have to stop being unclear.

274
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:15,121
Poor her.

275
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:19,001
You shouldn’t have said that to her. It was harsh.

276
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:24,871
I had to. Someone has to be clear. And that person should be Kim not Dawan.

277
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:26,291
Now, I’m upset.

278
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:30,991
Let’s not think about it, honey. It’s ruining the mood here.

279
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:34,921
It’s not often that we’d get to go out on a date like this.

280
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,931
I have a cure for being moody.

281
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:40,831
Hmm, Dokrak.

282
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,061
Someone might see us.

283
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:44,931
Hmm

284
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:48,681
Lovers kissing each other. No one is going to complain.

285
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:56,981
(Door opening)

286
00:24:59,311 --> 00:24:59,971
(Sigh)

287
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,381
Hey.

288
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,251
Get a room.

289
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,621
This is a public area.

290
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:06,921
I’m sorry.

291
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:10,491
Dokrak, you should tell your girlfriend to be more careful.

292
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:16,631
I’m just being clear and straightforward. Isn’t that better than someone who’s hesitant and unclear?

293
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:20,061
Be careful though. You might lose her forever.

294
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,621
Whom are you talking about?

295
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,551
Sorry, I’m busy kissing my girlfriend.

296
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:46,451
Hello, yes?

297
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,641
Nappy, the green package.

298
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:53,201
No, the pink one is sanitary napkins.

299
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:56,851
I said ‘green’. Can you hear me? What?

300
00:25:57,851 --> 00:25:59,221
Jeez! Just a second.

301
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,571
Hey, I’ll be right back.

302
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:02,791
It’s green.

303
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:05,071
Please take care of the customers for me.

304
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:06,491
Make yourself comfortable.

305
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:15,501
Wan, what’s with that face? Did you see a ghost?

306
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,141
Pam and Dokrak were kissing.

307
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:21,481
That’s great!

308
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:22,891
It’s good.

309
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:25,301
What a perfect timing.

310
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:28,771
Hey.

311
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,201
Kim is still available.

312
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:34,401
Listen.

313
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:39,231
She’s single. And you’re single.

314
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:42,351
Go and tell her how you feel right now.

315
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:47,041
Don’t wait until she’s cleared up this issue about her dad. You won’t get to tell her then.

316
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:52,641
Do you want me to confess while she’s stressed over her mother’s issue?

317
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,851
Maybe this isn’t a good time.

318
00:26:56,521 --> 00:27:00,751
Damn you! Are you going to wait another 10 years to tell her how you feel?

319
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,421
Jeez, calm down.

320
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:07,651
I already have a plan. It’s going to be cool.

321
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:11,841
How? Are you going to fly to the north pole and tell her there?

322
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:14,571
Cool as in nice, not the weather.

323
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,141
I know. I was just kidding.

324
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,241
Here I come. Sorry, guys.

325
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:41,161
Can you believe it? My hubby is so dumb. But what to do? I already fell in love with him.

326
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:41,981
Jeez!

327
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:43,981
He really couldn’t get what I said.

328
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:44,911
So dumb.

329
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:47,831
Oh, stop complaining.

330
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:51,261
By the way, what are you guys talking about?

331
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:56,501
- Nothing. I just told her to confess…
- Mon.

332
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:57,331
Huh?

333
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:58,171
Shut up.

334
00:27:58,451 --> 00:27:59,351
Confess what?

335
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:02,391
Huh?

336
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:08,221
Kim, what did you talk to Pam and Dokrak about?

337
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,121
About work and my mum.

338
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:24,661
Guys, you seem to have a lot on your mind these days. Should we do something exciting?

339
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:34,661
Honestly, it’s more exciting to see whether this place will be closed down like your restaurant and your dress rental shop.

340
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:36,431
- Mali.     /     - What?

341
00:28:36,911 --> 00:28:37,911
Damn you.

342
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,371
What? It’s the truth.

343
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:44,171
I mean I want to open our time capsule.

344
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:49,191
Hmm, okay. That’s quite exciting for me.

345
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:53,161
I want to know what you three wrote about me.

346
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:55,881
I cursed you a lot.

347
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:57,731
I know that.

348
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:04,441
So, on what occasion should we open it?

349
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:09,031
We agreed that we’d open it only on a special occasion.

350
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,831
But look at each of us now.

351
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:19,651
Well, opening it might bring something good to our life.

352
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:21,681
Am I right, Wan?

353
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:22,421
Huh?

354
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,651
Right, Kim?

355
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:29,751
Yeah, I think so too.

356
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:35,531
I also want to know what Wan wrote about me.

357
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:41,051
- Okay, let’s do that then.
- Okay.

358
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,821
How about next Saturday?

359
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:46,851
Let’s meet under the tree at the back of our school next Saturday.

360
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:48,001
Deal?

361
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,201
Okay.

362
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:50,341
Come. Cheers!

363
00:29:50,341 --> 00:29:51,331
Okay.

364
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:53,211
- Pick it up.    /    - Come.

365
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:54,931
Hurry up.

366
00:29:57,301 --> 00:29:58,021
(Glasses clinking)

367
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:04,251
I’ll be back. I’ll go talk to Pam and Dokrak first.

368
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:05,231
Okay.

369
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:15,151
Girls, the dance floor is ready. Let’s get up. Up, up!

370
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:17,461
I haven’t done this for ages.

371
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,831
Mali. Wan. Kim. Let’s go dance.

372
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,581
- Get up. Don’t be daft.
- You go first.

373
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:22,531
Come on.

374
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,521
Can’t you go faster?

375
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:25,571
Hurry up and follow us.

376
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,221
Go to the centre.

377
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:28,671
At the centre?

378
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:30,001
Yes, right here.

379
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:31,831
Okay, let’s go.

380
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,181
- Okay.     /     - Who’s first?

381
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:34,521
- You.    /    - I’m dancing.

382
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:36,121
- Is this how you dance?
- Yeah.

383
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,361
Come on.

384
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,081
Dance, dance.

385
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:48,851
Just do it.

386
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:49,551
Come on.

387
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,001
- Kim.    /    - Come on.

388
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:53,441
- You’ve been quite stressed lately.
- Yeah.

389
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,931
- Just let it out on this dance floor.
- Yeah.

390
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:56,081
- Let it go.    /    - Just dance.

391
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:56,981
Come on.

392
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:58,431
Hey, can you play ‘Mon Rong Hai’?

393
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:00,971
- Okay?     /     - Okay.

394
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:40,961
(Romantic song)

395
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,801
I’ll go back soon. Please wait. I’ll go play with you.

396
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:55,881
See you.

397
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:02,771
Guys, I’m leaving. My hubby needs me.

398
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:04,871
Oh, wait. I’m leaving too.

399
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:06,571
Honey, shall we go home?

400
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:12,491
I’m leaving, Kim.

401
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,231
Please be honest to your heart.

402
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:20,741
Finally. Drive safely.

403
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:21,881
I’m not driving.

404
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,351
See you later. Bye.

405
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:26,311
Hey, I’m leaving.

406
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:27,201
Mhm.

407
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:28,281
Hang in there.

408
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:30,451
You too.

409
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:31,451
Mhm.

410
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,301
Mon, I’m going.

411
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:36,171
- Okay
- Bye! Go home safely.

412
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:51,141
- Clean it up. Make sure it’s spotless.
- Okay.

413
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:52,611
Got it? Make sure it’s all done.

414
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,561
- Okay. Get to work.
- Yes.

415
00:34:57,201 --> 00:35:00,211
Guys, the place is closed. Go home now.

416
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:01,501
Mhm.

417
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:03,871
But look at you. I don’t think you’ll make it home.

418
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:07,091
Just crash here tonight then.

419
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:08,141
Okay?

420
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,091
Do you hear me?

421
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:10,931
Okay.

422
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:11,981
Let’s go then.

423
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:13,781
Get up.

424
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:16,961
Take her too.

425
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:18,181
Let’s go.

426
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:19,891
Ow!

427
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:21,891
Come.

428
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:24,231
This way.

429
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,091
Did I do anything embarrassing last night?

My Marvellous Dream Is You

432
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:14,899
Watch your steps.

433
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,679
Put her on the bed.

434
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:20,809
Jeez, why are you walking like this? Are you dumb, Wan?

435
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:22,689
Ugh!

436
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,309
Ugh!

437
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:29,969
Ugh!

438
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,519
- Are you okay?
- Mhm.

439
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:34,269
Okay.

440
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:35,849
- Huh?!
- You, come here.

441
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,639
- What is it?
- Look.

442
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,989
- Aha.
- Look at the view.

443
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,739
- Beautiful, isn’t it?
- Yeah.

444
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:50,149
And look here. You can use all these things.

445
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:51,919
- Aha.
- Okay?
- Okay.

446
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,659
I repeat. You can use them all.

447
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,289
- Okay?
- Yeah, I heard that.

448
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,609
Can you walk?

449
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:07,129
Tell her to go shower. She stinks.

450
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:11,549
- It’s hot.
- Are you hot?

451
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,559
Yes.

452
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,159
Mon, where’s the toilet?

453
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:15,789
Mon.

454
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,459
It’s hot.

455
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:23,169
- So hot.
- Kim.

456
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:28,879
Kim.

457
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:32,519
- I want to take a bath.
- Okay.

458
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:36,759
- You have to get up first.
- Umm

459
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:49,589
- Where?
- This way.

460
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,079
Be careful.

461
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:15,399
The tub is full now. Go get ready so you can take a bath.

462
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,009
Mhm. Thank you.

463
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,959
Beautiful, isn’t it?

464
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:38,179
Mhm.

465
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,819
Are you thinking about your family?

466
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,529
I feel sorry for Mum.

467
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:06,859
She’s sick and still has to cope with this problem about our dads.

468
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:09,899
She’s so strong.

469
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:33,519
So are you.

470
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,929
If this happened when you were a kid,

471
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:39,389
you would have bawled your eyes out.

472
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:46,119
But today,

473
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,309
you’re not going to cry, right?

474
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,079
I want to do something more for Mum.

475
00:39:57,009 --> 00:39:59,029
You’re doing all you can.

476
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,749
I truly believe…

477
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,459
that everything will be all right one day.

478
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,699
Thank you.

479
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,009
Thank you for staying by my side.

480
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:14,949
You also did the same. You always stayed by my side…

481
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,129
no matter how bad the situation was.

482
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,149
Because you’re someone special to me.

483
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:25,459
I can be anything for you.

484
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:29,629
As long as it can make you stop feeling sad…

485
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,629
and help relieve your stress.

486
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,979
I’ll get you the towel and the robe.

487
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,359
Mhm.

488
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:58,429
I was going to bring you the robe.

489
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:01,709
Go and change into it first.

490
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:15,679
Why don’t you take a bath with me?

491
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:19,459
Huh!

492
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,459
Let me help.

493
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:13,789
You take it off too.

494
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,519
Kim!

495
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:34,339
Kim!

496
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,499
Marwin is calling.

497
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:39,789
I didn’t answer because I don’t want to pry.

498
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:41,469
Here, answer it.

499
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:43,469
Just take it!

500
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:47,869
Why are you guys like this?

501
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:49,499
Who’s going to shower?

502
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:52,639
Huh?!

503
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:55,589
It’s Kim. She’s going to shower.

504
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,239
- Shower?
- Mhm.
- Yeah.

505
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,749
Let me know once you two are done then.

506
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:02,069
- Mhm.    /     - Mhm.

507
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,899
Hey, the tub is full.

508
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:12,569
Have you ever watched the GL series?

509
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:15,469
There’s often a scene where the girls are in the tub.

510
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:16,859
Aha.

511
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:20,049
Should we try it too? Let’s do it together.

512
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,319
- No.     /     - No.

513
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,379
Fine. I’ll do it alone then.

514
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:27,999
Are you sure?

515
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,479
- Mhm.     /     - Mhm.

516
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,269
Help!

517
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:39,859
Huh?!

518
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:41,399
Wan!

519
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:43,269
Mon! What happened?

520
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:44,789
- Ouch!     /     - Mon!

521
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:43,419
Oh!

522
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:46,709
Mon.

523
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,849
Mon.

524
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:56,449
Eh?

525
00:45:57,749 --> 00:45:59,319
Why are you sleeping here?

526
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,579
It was so cold last night.

527
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:06,109
I didn’t want to crawl in bed and wake you up.

528
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:08,579
So, I slept over here to get some sunlight.

529
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,389
Go and sleep on the bed then.

530
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:16,639
- Okay then.
- Yeah.

531
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:02,359
Did I do anything embarrassing last night?

532
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,809
Not really. You just got naked and danced on the terrace.

533
00:47:09,669 --> 00:47:10,289
What?!

534
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:12,619
Kidding.

535
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:15,879
You were just…

536
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,759
drunk, and then you cried.

537
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:26,449
Hey, are you still worried about your family issue?

538
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:30,469
Mhm.

539
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,229
I’m probably stressed, and a bit confused.

540
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,569
I don’t know what I should do next.

541
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:48,929
(Phone ringing)

542
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
(Phone ringing)

543
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:53,269
(Phone ringing)

544
00:47:54,529 --> 00:47:55,839
(Phone ringing)

545
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:57,949

00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:00,259

00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,459

549
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:08,989
(Phone ringing)

550
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:09,709
(Phone ringing)

551
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:15,669
(LINE message)

552
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:20,949
(LINE chat)
Marwin: I’m sorry. Are you free today?

553
00:48:20,949 --> 00:48:24,349
Marwin: I want to talk to you.

554
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:35,609
Let’s go back to your place and get changed.

555
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:38,079
After that…

556
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:42,349
can you take me to the gallery?

557
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:46,739
Why do you want to go there?

558
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,319
I’ll pay for your resignation.

559
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,579
Here is your severance pay.

560
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:06,229
Don’t worry, Kim.

561
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:08,529
I’ll help support you.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

564
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:00,987
Come in.

565
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:09,007
Oh, hello Kim.

566
00:50:40,477 --> 00:50:41,887
Are you really going to quit?

567
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,377
If it’s because of my parents, I’m so sorry.

568
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:54,697
I already talked to them. It’s true that my parents were rude to you. But you don’t have to quit your job because of that.

569
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:58,567
I can separate work from my personal business.

570
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:05,967
But…I’m going to resign anyway.

571
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,497
What will you do after this then?

572
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:20,837
I’ll go help my mum with her work and start my own clothing brand.

573
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:23,997
I want to spend time with her as much as I can.

574
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:29,727
She has cancer.

575
00:51:40,507 --> 00:51:43,797
Is there anything I can do to help?

576
00:51:47,477 --> 00:51:48,877
Thank you so much.

577
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:54,587
My friends have already done all they can to help.

578
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:04,287
Then about your resignation, I’m afraid I’d have to refuse.

579
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:23,677
I’ll lay you off instead. Here is your severance pay.

580
00:52:29,587 --> 00:52:31,077
Oh…I can’t take it.

581
00:52:32,257 --> 00:52:34,097
It’s our company’s regulation.

582
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:38,407
I’m giving you this because I’m your employer. Please take it.

583
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:49,037
Thank you.

584
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:54,187
Thank you for everything, for always helping me.

585
00:53:14,487 --> 00:53:17,267
Mum, I brought you something to eat.

586
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:22,537
I’ll put it on the desk.

587
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:52,127
Kim!

588
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:53,497
Kim!

589
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:02,077
Mum!

590
00:54:03,857 --> 00:54:04,927
She’s burning up.

591
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:06,087
Mum.

592
00:54:09,987 --> 00:54:10,547
(Crying)

593
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,057
Kim.

594
00:54:23,737 --> 00:54:24,977
How is she?

595
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:26,877
Is she okay?

596
00:54:29,977 --> 00:54:33,577
The doctor said her body reacts negatively to the chemotheraphy.

597
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:36,927
That causes complications.

598
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:44,077
Cancer is now spreading to her lungs.

599
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:52,687
Kim, you must not lose hope.

600
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:54,597
She’s in good hands now.

601
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:56,837
She will be all right.

602
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:03,977
Don’t worry about the expenses.

603
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,297
I’ll help you take care of that.

604
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:08,607
(Crying)

605
00:55:11,347 --> 00:55:16,977
So will I. I’ll never leave you and Ae.

606
00:55:20,637 --> 00:55:21,837
Thank you.

607
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,587
(Crying)

608
00:55:25,237 --> 00:55:26,077
(Crying)

609
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:31,647
Are you here to see the patient?

610
00:56:32,227 --> 00:56:32,867
Yes.

611
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:35,567
She has been moved to a special room in the VIP zone.

612
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:38,077
Why is she moved there?

613
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:43,717
It’s per Mr. Marwin’s request.
The patient is now under the care of the professor doctor.

614
00:56:50,087 --> 00:56:51,037
Please don’t worry.

615
00:56:52,707 --> 00:56:57,887
Thank you so much. Why are you helping us?

616
00:56:59,687 --> 00:57:05,377
I want to. Think of it as an apology for what my parents did to Kim.

617
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:09,367
What did they do?

618
00:57:11,217 --> 00:57:12,557
Didn’t she tell you?

619
00:57:14,537 --> 00:57:17,387
She hardly tells me anything.

620
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:27,997
She probably doesn’t want you to worry about her. She always cares how other people feel.

621
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:30,547
That is why I love her.

622
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:38,217
You must love her a lot. That’s why you’re doing all this for us.

623
00:57:39,947 --> 00:57:41,687
She’s the woman I love the most.

624
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:45,147
She never wants anything from me.

625
00:57:45,877 --> 00:57:47,057
She’s very honest.

626
00:57:50,577 --> 00:57:54,647
I even think about marrying her. I want to build a family with her.

627
00:57:56,027 --> 00:58:00,247
You might think I’m taking things too fast, but that’s how I really feel.

628
00:58:02,407 --> 00:58:06,347
If there’s a chance, I wish I could take her hand in mine.

629
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:13,227
Marwin.

630
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:15,307
Kim.

631
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,067
How are you, Mum?

632
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:30,067
How do you know my mum is having a treatment here?

633
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:36,047
He called me and asked which hospital I’m staying at.

634
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:39,957
So, he moved me to this room instead.

635
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:42,507
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you first.

636
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:49,367
The professor doctor that I know is a cancer specialist. He agrees to take her in as his patient.

637
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:51,177
So, I moved her here.

638
00:58:58,547 --> 00:59:01,787
Wan, can you go and wait outside first.

639
00:59:02,697 --> 00:59:05,137
I have something to talk to Marwin and Kim.

640
00:59:06,567 --> 00:59:08,027
Why can’t she stay?

641
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:12,417
It’s okay, Kim. I’ll wait outside.

642
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:36,867
Kim, in my life, you’re the one I love the most.

643
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:41,257
I also worry about you the most.

644
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:55,947
When I’m gone, I want you to live your life happily.

645
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:03,847
Don’t say that, Mum. You’ll be all right.

646
01:00:04,277 --> 01:00:05,457
You have to stay with me.

647
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:15,427
I already talked to Marwin.

648
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:23,937
He made me feel so assured. I no longer have those worries in my mind.

649
01:00:26,607 --> 01:00:31,127
So, there’s one last thing I want to ask from you.

650
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:04,567
(Incoming message)

651
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:09,857
Kimhan: Wan, you can go home first. I’ll call you later.

Dawan: Can anyone get a hold of Kim?

653
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:13,977
Samon: I called but she didn’t pick up. She also didn’t read my LINE message.

654
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:17,977
Mali: She’s probably busy taking care of her mother. Let’s not bother her.

655
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:23,617
Dawan: But it’s been many days already. I’m worried about her and her mother.

656
01:02:23,617 --> 01:02:25,217
Mali: Why don’t you go see her at the hospital then?

657
01:02:25,217 --> 01:02:27,057
Samon: Yeah.

658
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:30,017
Dawan: I went with her the other day and bumped into Marwin.

659
01:02:30,017 --> 01:02:33,297
And Kim told me to go back first.

660
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:39,097
Dawan: Then she just disappeared. What does this mean?

661
01:02:39,097 --> 01:02:43,257
Samon: It means you have to go talk to her.

662
01:02:43,257 --> 01:02:46,457
Samon: Don’t just sit there and wait.

663
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:49,497
Mali: You’re so good at waiting.

664
01:02:49,497 --> 01:02:52,457
Mali: I gotta go. My hubby and baby are calling. Let me know if you want me to go with you.

665
01:02:52,457 --> 01:02:55,257
Samon: Likewise. I’m not that free anymore.

666
01:02:55,257 --> 01:02:59,017
Samon: I have to look after my bar. It’s getting so busy these days.

667
01:02:59,017 --> 01:03:02,337
Dawan: Okay. I’ll let you know when I’m going.

668
01:03:02,337 --> 01:03:05,977
Samon: Don’t wait too long.

669
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:42,627
Wan.

670
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:44,727
Kim.

671
01:03:49,097 --> 01:03:51,177
I’ll go see your mother first then.

672
01:03:51,467 --> 01:03:52,067
Okay.

673
01:04:15,137 --> 01:04:18,727
Kim, are you all right?

674
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:26,517
Last time we met, you told me to go back first.

675
01:04:27,737 --> 01:04:31,797
I tried to call you after that for so many times. But you never picked up.

676
01:04:33,517 --> 01:04:37,447
I even went to your place. But you weren’t home.

677
01:04:38,777 --> 01:04:44,927
How’s your mother doing? I was about to go visit her.

678
01:04:45,357 --> 01:04:50,067
But then I bumped into you and…that Marvel guy first.

679
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,307
Kim…

680
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,727
Why are you here with him?

681
01:05:04,057 --> 01:05:05,667
I have something important to tell you.

682
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:12,847
Is it about Marwin?

683
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,977
Mum wants me to marry Marwin.

684
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:32,407
She wants someone to take care of me for the rest of my life. That’s her biggest worry.

685
01:05:34,717 --> 01:05:41,297
She feels so sorry that I have to take care of all the debts and expenses for her treatment.

686
01:05:43,867 --> 01:05:46,077
That I have to get stuck here and don’t get to live the life I want.

687
01:05:47,747 --> 01:05:49,237
But that’s not the point.

688
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:53,167
What I want is to make her happy.

689
01:05:55,237 --> 01:05:57,407
How can you marry someone you don’t love?

690
01:05:59,677 --> 01:06:00,287
Or…

691
01:06:02,617 --> 01:06:03,417
Do you love him?

692
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:11,637
What about our relationship? What about us?

693
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:14,657
What is it that we have between us?

694
01:06:17,737 --> 01:06:19,067
What are we?

695
01:06:25,907 --> 01:06:28,527
Well, we’re…friends.

696
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:37,907
But that’s not what my mum wants. She wants someone more than just a friend to take care of me.

697
01:06:38,947 --> 01:06:40,507
I can take care of you.

698
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:49,107
Forget it.

699
01:06:50,587 --> 01:06:53,317
What I’m saying might not make sense to you.

700
01:06:56,087 --> 01:06:58,427
But can you please let me do it for my mum?

701
01:07:03,347 --> 01:07:04,347
Just for once.

702
01:07:12,137 --> 01:07:13,187
I’m sorry, Wan.

703
01:08:01,737 --> 01:08:04,457
My Marvellous Dream Is You

704
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:11,897
Why do you want to see me?

705
01:08:11,927 --> 01:08:12,997
I’ll get to the point.

706
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:15,537
If you make her unhappy,

707
01:08:16,587 --> 01:08:18,237
I’ll take her back.

708
01:08:18,257 --> 01:08:19,137
Go

709
01:08:20,427 --> 01:08:25,317
I can’t wait to find out what you wrote to me in that letter.

710
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:26,257
I’m not going to tell you.

711
01:08:27,177 --> 01:08:29,147
You’ll find out when you open it.

712
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,817
This is all I can do to help.

713
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:33,577
Now, it’s up to you to decide.

714
01:08:33,857 --> 01:08:35,617
Have you read my letter?

715
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:37,047
Yes.

716
01:08:37,777 --> 01:08:39,547
Yours and the others’ too.

717
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:42,467
What do you think?

718
01:10:05,257 --> 01:10:11,257
