1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,150
On this Valentine, I’ll say yes to the first one who gives me gifts or flowers.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,130
That day when I saw you and Miss Ae kissing…

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,060
Was that the reason you decided to move away?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,630
Please be my girlfriend.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,710
Wan once told me how you feel, but…

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,310
Please rest, Kim.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,160
I saw him sitting by your bedside every night.

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,530
He was so glued to you no man could even get close.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,720
Marwin said he likes me.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,550
And I like him too.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,030
Why is the lift so slow?

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,580
- Do you think she’d kill herself?
- Damn it, don’t say that! Why is it so slow?

27
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,690
What were you doing before you came here?

28
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,280
Curling my hair.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
- Before going to bed?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,190
Jeez!

31
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,940
Wan, Wan, Wan.

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,880
I’d better call her.

33
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,410
(Lift opening)

34
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,900
Let’s go.

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,700
- Wan!
- Wan!
- Wan!

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,310
- Open the door, Wan!
- Wan! Wan!

37
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,540
- Hey.
- What?

38
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,590
There’s a doorbell. Should we press it?

39
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,750
Get out of my way then.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,690
(Doorbell ringing)
Wan! Open the door, Wan!

41
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,170
Wan!

42
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,930
Open the damn door, Wan!

43
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,780
- Hey!
- Hurry and open the door!

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,950
- Wan!
- Are you okay?
- Why did you do that?

45
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,850
Jeez. Wan!

46
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,860
Wan.

47
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,680
Wan.

48
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,270
Wan.

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,140
Are you okay? Why did you send that message?

50
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,880
‘Cause I’m a celebrity.

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,070
What?

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,180
I was going to type, ‘Don’t want to be alone anymore. Let’s go out.’

53
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,070
But my phone went dead before I could finish typing.

54
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,150
Jeez, Wan. You scared the hell out of me.

55
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,440
Damn you. Look at her.

56
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,370
Why would you want to go out right now? Don’t you have an audition tomorrow?

57
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,590
Shouldn’t you go to bed early?

58
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,300
Yeah.

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,110
Let’s go out first. I can sleep later. Something’s stressing me out.

60
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,700
What is it?

61
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,550
Kim likes Marwin.

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,800
I see…

63
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,090
They’d soon become lovers.

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,760
I can’t let that happen.

65
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,420
Kim just came back this afternoon to get all her things and moved out.

66
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,040
Wait.

67
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,240
Are you jealous?

68
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,580
Yes.

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,260
Why? What is she to you?

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,300
well, she’s my best friend.

71
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,890
I won’t let that Marvel guy take her away from me.

72
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:39,840
Stop right there. You and Kim are not lovers.

73
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,450
This means she’s single.

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,310
So, she can go out with anyone.

75
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,430
Marwin is pursuing Kim in an appropriate way. He is not stealing her from anyone.

76
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,200
When you were dating, Kim didn’t say anything or even try to stop you.

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,500
So, you have to stop being selfish.

78
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,500
You should let her be.

79
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,990
Instead of bothering her, why don’t you use that time to focus on your audition or your work?

80
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,170
Stop messing with her life.

81
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,280
- Do you get it?
- Stop!

82
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,510
I called you here to support me. Why are you guys taking Marwin’s side?

83
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,450
I’ll go out alone then.

84
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,230
You want to go out that much?

85
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,490
I’ll go with you then.

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,610
Wait, Mon.

87
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,740
Look at our outfits.

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,320
Mine is quite okay. But you’re in your pjs.

89
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,890
Not a problem.

90
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,070
It’s what I do for my new business.

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,680
Hang on.

92
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Hey, can you send me and my friend some beautiful designer pieces?

93
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,130
Yes, thank you.

94
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,840
That’s right.

95
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,870
It’s done.

96
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,670
Fine, then.

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,950
Good.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
(Phone buzzing)

99
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,100
Hi, Toon.

100
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,760
I’m at your friend’s hangout place.

101
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,370
I got bored so I wanted to go out somewhere.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,310
Jeez, I know that. I won’t stay long. Bye.

103
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,460
1 2 3!

104
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,610
- Please go ahed.
- Let me see.

105
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,970
Guys.

106
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,580
Let’s go inside.

107
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,020
Hey, how did you come to know about this place?

108
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,740
Toon’s friend owns it.

109
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,870
Why didn’t you come to my place too? I also have a bar there.

110
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,580
You should have come and give it a review.

111
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,650
Why? It will close down soon anyway.

112
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,060
Hey, damn you!

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,020
But I agree with her.

114
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,090
How many businesses have you been trying to do?

115
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,370
Well, I’m a businesswoman. I have a lot to learn.

116
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,760
Investment involves risks. Understood?

117
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,490
That’s enough. Let’s go inside.

118
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,130
Let’s make Kim know I can be happy without her.

119
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,990
Get your phone ready. Let’s send the pictures to our group chat.

120
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
ruin my fun

121
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,200
Hey, take it easy. You have an audition tomorrow.

122
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,670
Jeez, you too, Mon. That’s enough.

123
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,330
- Slow down.
- Enough.

124
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:42,540
Can’t you just have a sip? You’ve downed 3 glasses already.

125
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,840
Well, we have to hurry and get back home.

126
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,410
Kim only said she likes Marwin and you’ve taken it this bad.

127
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,080
What if she got married and had kids, wouldn’t that make you insane then?

128
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,290
But now that I think about it.

129
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,140
If Kim actually gets married, we can open our time capsule then. Right?

130
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,140
What time capsule?

131
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:15,860
Jeez! Do you mess up in doing business so often that you forget about everything when we were still in high school?

132
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,720
- What a foul mouth!
- So what?

133
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,010
I’ll slap your mouth.

134
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,580
We were so into that drama series, My Sassy Girl, remember?

135
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,750
The one where a female protagonist looks exactly like me.

136
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,070
At the end, both protagonists each wrote a letter and put them in the time capsule and buried it.

137
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,070
On the farewell orientation day, we decided to write letters to everyone in our gang.

138
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,020
Then we buried the capsule under the big tree behind our school.

139
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:44,000
Ahhh…and we agreed that if we ever received the best news from anyone in our gang,

140
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,400
we’d open the time capsule. Right?

141
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:56,250
But when Mali got married and had her baby, we didn’t open it because it was more like a shock rather than good news to us.

142
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,810
Oh, just shut up.

143
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:05,410
But honestly, I really want to know what Wan wrote about us.

144
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,420
Can you tell us a bit first?

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,250
Who would remember it?

146
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,660
I think we shouldn’t open it. Just leave it like that.

147
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,870
Why? Did you write a love letter for me or Mali?

148
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,730
Eww, I already have a husband and a child. I also don’t like you that way.

149
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,030
- Nobody likes you that way.
- Neither do I.

150
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,870
Excuse me, are you Miss Dawan?

151
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,840
Yes.

152
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,430
I’m your fan. Can I take a selfie with you?

153
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,230
Sure.

154
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,080
Please take it for me.

155
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,700
Thank you

156
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,960
1 2 3.

157
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,330
1 2 3.

158
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,790
You’re even prettier in person. Thank you.

159
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,450
So pretty. Thank you.

160
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,610
You’re welcome.

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,510
Hey, your fan is prettier than you.

162
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,400
Yeah. I really can’t beat her.

163
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,370
Nonsense.

164
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,770
What can’t you beat her? Your face?

165
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,840
My boobs.

166
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,660
Okay.

167
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,320
Hey, be right back. I’m going to the loo.

168
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,920
A new lot is here.

169
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,900
Hurry up and send me a cheque. There are lots of nice tits in here.

170
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,800
What the f**k?!

171
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,830
Hey, aren’t you an actress?

172
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,640
Why did you take my phone? Give it back!

173
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,010
Secretly taking pictures of girls’ boobs like this is clearly a sexual harassment.

174
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,140
Really?

175
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,490
Don’t accuse me like that. I haven’t done anything.

176
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,020
I saw you did it with my own eyes.

177
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,350
Really?

178
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,120
Here, take a look.

179
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,990
Let me see.

180
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,400
That’s enough. Give me back my phone.

181
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,570
- Hey, I said give it back!
- Stop right there!

182
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,450
I said give it back!

183
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,280
- No.
- It’s my phone. Give it back!

184
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,750
She took my phone. How can I f**king calm down?!

185
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,700
Give it back!

186
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
What happened?

187
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,330
Oh, you’re here. This man secretly took a photo of your boobs.

188
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,340
Really?

189
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,440
Yes, have a look.

190
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,380
Oh my gosh!

191
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,740
Why did you do that?

192
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,530
Hey, don’t you know it’s against the law? I can sue you!

193
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,820
Really? And what you did isn’t wrong?

194
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,320
So what?

195
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,270
Jeez! Where the hell is she?

196
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,090
Yeah.

197
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,530
What should we do?

198
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:25,340
Are you craving for fame? Do you want to be an empowered woman who comes out to protect the others?

199
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,980
I said give me back my phone. Give it back!

200
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,750
Ouch!

201
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,670
Ouch!

202
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,820
Get off me! That hurts!

203
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,800
Hey!

204
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,420
Arghhhh…Wan!

205
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,760
- Get off me!
- Excuse me!
- Get off me!

206
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,180
Wan! Let him go!

207
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,200
- You want me to let him go?
- Yes!

208
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,230
Fine.

209
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,270
(Screaming)

210
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,170
Why the f**k did you do that?! Don’t you think you’d get away with this because you’re an actress. See you in the court!

211
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,640
Calm down!

212
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,300
Wan!

213
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,370
Girls, he’s yours now. Go and finish him.

214
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,510
Wan!

215
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,760
Mali! Samon! Take her home first. I’ll be right behind.

216
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,040
Go!

217
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,770
Stop taking pictures!

218
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,020
Stop!

219
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,740
Go

220
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,430
We’ve arrived.

221
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,160
Turn on the light first.

222
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,470
Yes, just a minute ago.

223
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,900
Yes, how’s it there?

224
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,190
Take her to the sofa first.

225
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,260
Here, sit.

226
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,460
So? Do you still want me to send the pictures to our group chat?

227
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,480
No need.

228
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,210
Seriously, you should’ve stayed out of it.

229
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,010
Now, you’re ruined.

230
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,100
Probably much worse than that girl you defended.

231
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,370
I already talked to Toon.

232
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,080
She would go check the CCTV cameras.

233
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,940
That man is definitely guilty.

234
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,000
He already apologized to that girl.

235
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,270
Right now, we have a bigger problem than that.

236
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,740
There’s this clip where you were grabbing him by his hair.

237
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,420
And also the one where you threw your heels at him.

238
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:24,920
What?

239
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,470
They are all over the internet now.

240

Do want to see it?

248
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,830
Jeez! Don’t let her see it.

249
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,990
She already heard everything.

250
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,760
I don’t care.

251
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,440
I didn’t do anything wrong.

252
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,790
Good. You’d better stay out of social media for a while then.

253
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,700
Go shower and get to bed. You have an audition tomorrow.

254
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,900

255
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,490
Get up.

256
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,520
Let’s go. Get up.

257
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,600
Jeez!

258
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,660
Careful there.

259
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,060
Look at her.

260
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,840
- Mali.
- What?

261
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,840
Go home and take care of your family.

262
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,330
I’ll stay with her tonight so that I can wake her up tomorrow.

263
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,050
- I’ll leave her to you then. Call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

264
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,650
(Throwing up)

265
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,960
- I’ll get check on her.
- ‘Kay.

(Throwing up)

269
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,630
Just a quarrel with Kim. Why does she make such a big fuss about it?

270
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,200
This is her place.

271
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,590
She can let anyone do anything in here. Please feel free.

272
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,680
Are you packing all your things…

273
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,400
because you’d move in with Marwin?

274
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,040
You can’t go.

275
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,040
Marwin said he likes me.

276
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,790
And I like him too.

By the way, didn’t you say Marwin wanted to see me?

Can you go check over there if the structure is strong enough?

289
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:56,172
How’s it going, Mum? Is everything okay?

290
00:18:56,172 --> 00:19:01,362
Mhm, I just need to finish arranging these flowers and we can go home after that.

291
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:06,002
What about…pictures of the wedding couple and the name tags?

292
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,852
They said they’d give them to me tomorrow.

293

Do you have anything on your mind?

00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,082
How do you know?

Well, I’m your mother.

It’s about work.

297
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:29,402
If you have any problem, I think you should let Marwin know.

298
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:33,792
By the way, I thought you said he wanted to see me.

299
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:35,412
When should I meet him?

300
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,832
He’s busy right now.

301
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:40,282
I’ll let you know later, okay?

302
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:49,122
So, how’s the relationship between you and him?

303
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:54,662
Are you two…just a boss and an employee? Or…more than that?

304
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:55,972
Tell me about it.

305
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,582
Do you really want me to have a boyfriend?

306
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,012
Of course.

307
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:16,592
If you are sure that he’s a good guy, then I want to meet him one day.

00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:53,672
Umm…

356
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,492
Aren’t you going to accept the flowers?

357
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:58,552
Well…yes.

358
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:09,522
These paintings are your happiness. So, I want to include them on a wonderful day like this.

359
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:13,522
Kim’s mum, would you like to join us in this frame?

360
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:15,262
Okay.

361
00:27:16,272 --> 00:27:18,252
- Please.
- Toey, please take a picture for us.

362
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:23,662
(Camera shutter)

363
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:27,962
(Camera shutter)

364
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:29,962
(Camera shutter)

365
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,292
(Camera shutter)

366
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:32,272
(Camera shutter)

367
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:44,762
Thank you so much. It came out perfectly well.

368
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:47,252
Without your help, I’d surely be in trouble.

369
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:51,372
And you did all this just for asking her out.

370
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:57,332
Anyway, thank you for respecting my daughter.

371
00:27:58,562 --> 00:27:59,932
My pleasure indeed.

372
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:06,612
(Phone ringing)

373
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:10,542
- (Phone ringing)
- Please excuse me. I have to take this call.

374
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:13,192
(Phone ringing)

375
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,392
(Phone ringing)

376
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:19,752
(Phone ringing)

377
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:21,972
Yes, Mon?

378
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:23,972
Wan’s gone.

379
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:25,102
What did you say?

380
00:28:31,112 --> 00:28:32,472
I’ll go help looking for her.

381
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:34,832
What happened?

382
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,782
Mum, Wan disappeared.

383
00:29:01,592 --> 00:29:03,872
(Phone ringing)

384
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:06,312
Kim, have you found her?

385
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:08,312
She’s not at the audition yet.

386
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:12,422
Not yet, Toon. I’m looking for her around our school right now.

387
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:15,102
Keep me posted then.

388
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:16,322
Okay.

389
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:31,892
Are you sure she’d be here?

390
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:33,052
Yes, I’m sure.

391
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:34,742
This is the last place.

392
00:29:34,742 --> 00:29:36,582
If we still can’t find her here…

393
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:37,682
I think…

394
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:40,472
she’s probably at the tree behind our school.

395
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:42,042
I’ll go find her there.

396
00:29:58,572 --> 00:29:59,242
Oh.

397
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:03,192
Wan!

398
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:04,302
Wan!

399
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:09,422
Wan!

400
00:30:13,132 --> 00:30:13,842
Wan!

401
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:15,272
Wan!

402
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:16,162
Wan!

403
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:19,632
Why are you here?

404
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,502
Why are you here?

405
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:26,662
I just want to reminisce about our past, about the time capsule that we buried.

406
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:28,422
Is this a time for that?

407
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:30,622
You have an audition today, remember?

408
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:32,202
Oh, that’s right.

409
00:30:34,352 --> 00:30:35,662
Is it 11am already?

410
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:36,852
Get up. Let’s go.

411
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:38,232
Forget it, Kim.

412
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,902
Stop sulking. Hurry up!

413
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:45,462
Give me the car keys.

414
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:47,662
It’s okay. I can drive.

415
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:49,432
Give me the keys, I’ll drive you there.

416
00:30:51,612 --> 00:30:52,272
Here.

417
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:53,192
Let’s go.

418
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:01,072
Let me borrow your phone.

419
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:08,482
Mum, I found her. I’ll take her to the audition. You can go back first.

420
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:24,102
Wan.

421
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:28,682
About last night, did you really have to do that?

422
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:33,922
You don’t need to know about it. I’m not that important to you.

423
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:40,012
When I’m not around, please try to protect yourself and love yourself more.

424
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:43,632
You’re famous right now. A big opportunity is coming your way.

425
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,662
Don’t waste your time and get stuck with me.

426
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:49,852
Sure, I’ll forget everything about you soon.

427
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:55,632
I’ll only focus on work. I’ll go to Hollywood and will never come back ever again.

428
00:31:59,172 --> 00:31:59,952
Wan.

429
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:02,632
Today is your day.

430
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:05,982
Please do your best.

431
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:10,412
Just wait and see.

432
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,872
(Phone ringing)

433
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:18,102
(Phone ringing)

434
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:21,542
Miss Wan.

435
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:23,882
What is it, Joom?

436
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:26,062
Miss Mon fell down in the bathroom.

437
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:28,172
What? Mum fell down?

438
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:30,652
How is she now?

439
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:33,142
She is still unconscious.

440
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:36,152
What should I do? I really don’t know what to do.

441
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,242
Call the ambulance now, Joom.

442
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:39,342
I’ll be right there.

443
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,382
Drop me at my house.

444
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:46,672
Let me take care of her.

445
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:47,282
No.

446
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:56,932
But don’t tell her yet. With her mum like this, she probably feels so horrible right now.

447
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,122
I don’t want it to trigger her symptoms.

450
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:50,846
(Sigh)

451
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:52,646
(Crying)

452
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:54,376
(Crying)
I’m sorry, Wan.

453
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:59,766
(Crying)
I’m so sorry. I’m sorry!

454
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:04,676
(Crying)

455
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,976
(Crying)
I’m sorry.

456
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,346
(Crying)
Wan.

457
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:17,806
(Sigh)

458
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:27,936
Mum.

459
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:31,476
How is Wan?

460
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:33,786
I never knew she’s an alcoholic.

461
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:35,496
I never knew too.

462
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:39,726
She should be safe now.

463
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:41,656
(Sigh)

464
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:47,436
Excuse me? Which room is the patient who’s an actress’s mother in?

465
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,706
A mother of an actress.

466
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,446
- Mon. Mon.
- What?

467
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:54,016
Oh, hello, Kim’s mum.

468
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,816
Where’s Wan?

469
00:34:56,076 --> 00:34:57,296
She’s with her mum.

470
00:34:57,756 --> 00:34:59,296
How’s her mum?

471
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:00,756
She’s safe now.

472
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:02,686
It was probably because she’s an alcoholic.

473
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,756
- Alcoholic?!
- Lower your voice.

474
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:05,846
Oh, sorry.

475
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:10,436
How long has she been like this?

476
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:14,176
I just know about it too.

477
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:15,486
Oh, you didn’t know it before?

478
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:17,956
(Phone ringing)

479
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:21,006
(Phone ringing)
Jeez, who’s calling now? Bother!

480
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:22,486
(Phone ringing)
Mali!

481
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:23,926
Hello?

482
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:27,916
Jeez! Your baby is wailing so loud.

483
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:29,156
What?

484
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:34,326
Yes, we found her. Her mum is an alcoholic!

485
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:34,946
(Sound effect)

486
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:37,586
(Sound effect)
Excuse me, this is a hospital. Please refrain from using loud voice.

487
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:38,786
Oh, okay.

488
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:41,856
The nurse said I can’t be loud in here. It’s a hospital, b***h. Bye.

489
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:44,646
I’m sorry.

490
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:46,616
Calm down.

491
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,866
Oh, I can sit over there.

492
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,126
- We have to wait?
- Mhm.

493
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:03,516
Yes, Toon?

494
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:06,366
We’re waiting in the lobby.

495
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:07,686
Kim.

496
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:12,976
How is Wan’s mum? Is she okay?

497
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:14,926
She’s safe now.

498
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,596
(Sigh)

499
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:23,976
Toon, do they agree to postpone the audition date for Wan?

500
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:25,816
Jessie got the role.

501
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:27,766
But don’t tell Wan yet.

502
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:31,286
With her mum like this, she probably feels so horrible right now.

503
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:33,966
I don’t want it to trigger her symptoms.

504
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:39,696
What symptoms?

505
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:42,046
She has depression.

506
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:48,746
(Sigh)

507
00:36:56,716 --> 00:37:00,566
Drink something sweet first. It might make you feel better.

508
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:03,426
Or do you want something savoury?

509
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,846
A main course? Or an appetizer?

510
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:10,206
But I can’t get it done for you because this is not my restaurant.

511
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:16,566
Umm…Hey, you have to stay strong.

512
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:21,876
(Sigh) Why do so many people have depression?

513
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:22,816
Mon.

514
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:28,076
Damn you, Mon. Why didn’t you think before you speak?

515
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,986
You…know already?

516
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:42,766
Don’t worry.

517
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:46,106
Mali used to be like you too.

518
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:49,896
It was after she delivered her baby.

519
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:51,746
She finally got over it.

520
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:55,446
If there’s anything,

521
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:58,046
you can always count on us.

522
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,676
You can talk to us about anything.

523
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:04,466
We’re always here for you.

524
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:07,226
Don’t be so dramatic.

525
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:09,486
I don’t like it.

526
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:12,596
Do I look that pitiful?

527
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:18,746
If you really pity me that much,

528
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:21,246
go and get me something to eat.

529
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:24,486
Sure. What do you want to eat?

530
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,786
Mont Nomsod (milk café).

531
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:32,006
Your wish is my command. Be right back.

532
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:34,636
Oh, hang on.

533
00:38:36,086 --> 00:38:36,696
Pick one.

534
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:38,186
All of them.

535
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:39,106
All of them?

536
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,586
Okay, I’ll be right back.

537
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:08,906
Don’t look at me like that.

538
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:11,646
I’m not weak.

539
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:16,456
When you’re with me…

540
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:20,836
you don’t have to try to be strong.

541
00:39:22,836 --> 00:39:24,486
I’m not strong too.

542
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:28,356
I used to want to be like that.

543
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:32,696
I wanted to prove myself…

544
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:34,866
that I could do it.

545
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,256
So that you would be proud of me.

546
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:39,446
But now…

547
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:45,716
I don’t think I want to do that anymore.

548
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:51,176
You’re no longer in my life.

549
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:02,306
But you don’t have to pity me.

550
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:07,116
Don’t come back to me…

551
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:10,026
just because you found out I have depression.

552
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:15,866
If you do that,

553
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:19,986
it’d only make me feel worse about myself.

554
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:31,106
(Phone ringing)

555
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:33,196
(Phone ringing)

556
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:36,836
Yes, Marwin?

557
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,696
You don’t have to come. I can go back with Mum.

558
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:45,086
Okay.

559
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:58,346
Are you two together now?

560
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:03,966
Mhm.

561
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:15,146
🎵It’s been kept inside for so long. You never know about it🎵
I’m not going to congratulate you.

562
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:16,556
Because that’s now how I feel.

563
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:21,526
🎵We’re just friends. Don’t get carried away.🎵
But I wish you good luck…

564
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:27,576
🎵But I can barely take it every time when you’re near.🎵
for the choice you’ve made.

565
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:28,466
Thank you…

566
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:35,926
🎵I can only keep it in my imagination🎵
…for today.

567
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:42,966
🎵I don’t want to keep it inside any longer🎵

568
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:48,956
🎵I don’t want to keep shouting ‘I love you’ in my mind🎵

569
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:55,166
🎵Will you change if I tell you how I feel?🎵

570
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:09,146
You looked so happy in our dream.

571
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:12,686
How do I look in real life?

572
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:14,686
Don’t I also look happy like this?

(Sad music)

576
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:03,452
Wan.

577
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:05,612
Why is it such a mess here?

578
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:09,532
Well, this is what it’s like without you.

579
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:10,392
Bye.

580
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:14,662
Hey, are you really going to let me do it alone? Come back and help me first!

581
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:15,952
Hey!

582
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:18,752
Oops! Sorry.

583
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:19,902
- Come here.
- Kim

584
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:20,592

00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:33,532
(Sad music)

587
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:44,022
(Sad music)
I’m here. Don’t be afraid.

588
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:50,852
I’ll be with you both in your dream and when you’re awake.

589
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:57,222
(Sad music)

590
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:50,042

591
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:52,052
(Phone buzzing)

592
00:45:52,762 --> 00:45:57,122
(Phone buzzing)
When I’m not around, please try to protect yourself and love yourself more.

593
00:45:57,732 --> 00:45:59,432
(Phone buzzing)
Don’t waste your time and get stuck with me.

594
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:02,132
(Phone buzzing)
Yes, Marwin?

595
00:46:03,172 --> 00:46:05,482
(Phone buzzing)
You don’t have to come. I’ll go back with Mum.

596
00:46:06,712 --> 00:46:07,512
(Phone buzzing)

597
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:08,712
(Phone buzzing)
Are you two together now?

598
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:11,502
I’m not going to congratulate you.

599
00:46:11,892 --> 00:46:13,542
Because that’s now how I feel.

600
00:46:14,002 --> 00:46:16,162
But I wish you good luck…

601
00:46:16,412 --> 00:46:18,302
(Phone buzzing)
for the choice you’ve made.

602

00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:44,802
You look so happy in our dream.

605
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:50,272
How do I look in real life?

606
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:52,252
Don’t I look this happy too?

607
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:55,362
Don’t you know?

608
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:57,762
No.

609
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:05,312
I just know…

610
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:07,872
that I have no one.

611
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:26,562
Kim.

612
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:28,752
Don’t be sad.

613
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:31,032
I’m right here.

614
00:47:36,582 --> 00:47:40,542
You know you can’t be in your dream forever, right?

615
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:44,362
In reality,

616
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,442
you have to try and love yourself more.

617
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:57,282
I gave all my love to everyone.

618
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,882
I don’t know how to love myself.

619
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:08,922
Promise me you’ll go see a doctor.

620
00:48:49,322 --> 00:48:50,112
Wan.

621
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,392
Wan, do you see the man in black in front of my room?

622
00:49:06,592 --> 00:49:08,692
He has severe depression.

623
00:49:08,972 --> 00:49:10,452
He’s going under treatment.

624
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:14,852
I’m going to help you cure it before you become like that man.

625
00:49:14,982 --> 00:49:16,072
Do you want to cure it?

626
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:17,452
Yes.

627
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:21,022
Then you will definitely get through it.

628
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:22,402
Because you have hope.

629
00:49:25,302 --> 00:49:26,482
How are you feeling these days?

630
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,312
Can you sleep well?

631
00:49:29,462 --> 00:49:32,782
Hmm, not that good.

632
00:49:34,132 --> 00:49:36,452
What about eating? Do you still have an appetite?

633
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:41,922
And your daily routine?

634
00:49:47,172 --> 00:49:49,962
Tell me how I can help.

635
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,312
I want to consult with you.

636
00:49:53,942 --> 00:49:56,612
How should I deal with trolls on social media.

637
00:49:57,032 --> 00:50:01,352
They don’t even know me, but they keep posting offensive comments about me.

638
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:05,642
I retaliated back by replying to some of the comments, but they still don’t stop.

639
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:07,672
Why would you that?

640
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:10,802
- To conquer?
- Yes.

641
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:12,872
Don’t you want to be an actress anymore?

642
00:50:14,832 --> 00:50:19,222
I heard that if a famous celebrity gets his or her fame tainted,

643
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:21,152
it would also affect their career.

644
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:23,642
You’ll lose a lot of opportunities.

645
00:50:24,072 --> 00:50:25,152
I don’t care.

646
00:50:26,212 --> 00:50:27,552
I didn’t do anything wrong.

647
00:50:28,182 --> 00:50:29,802
Why do I have to stay quiet…

648
00:50:30,432 --> 00:50:31,772
without fighting them back?

649
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:37,182
Should I just let them talk rubbish about me, even though I didn’t do anything wrong?

650
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:42,022
But you can’t stop them from doing what they’re doing.

651
00:50:42,262 --> 00:50:43,042
I can.

652
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:47,082
I’ll reply to all of their comments until they stop it.

653
00:50:47,742 --> 00:50:49,552
You’re wasting your time, Wan.

654
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:55,802
Striking back with offensive comments would only create more anger and hatred to yourself.

655
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:59,092
Isn’t stopping the only way to end it?

656
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:01,132
Are you doing this…

657
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:04,622
because you hate those who don’t love you,

658
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,982
and want them to change their minds?

659
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:10,782
Just ignore them, my dear.

660
00:51:12,672 --> 00:51:14,552
And get on with your life.

661
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:15,522
Isn’t that better?

662
00:51:17,652 --> 00:51:19,292
How can I ignore them?

663
00:51:20,212 --> 00:51:22,072
They are everywhere on every social media.

664
00:51:24,362 --> 00:51:25,712
You can choose.

665
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,602
You can choose what you want to see.

666
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:32,302
Those that you don’t like, just close them off.

667
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:37,342
It’s a good opportunity which allows you to ponder on what you really want.

668
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,172
It’s called a social detox which anyone can do it.

669
00:51:53,302 --> 00:51:54,792
Close your eyes slowly.

670
00:51:56,602 --> 00:52:00,142
Put both of your hands on your stomach.

671
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:08,742
Take a deep breath, in and out.

672
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:12,442
Make yourself comfortable.

673
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:16,972
Let it go.

674
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:20,932
Put everything down.

675
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:32,432
Open your mind and let your imagination take you to where you want to be.

676
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:35,382
Somewhere that makes you happy.

677
00:52:36,442 --> 00:52:37,972
Somewhere beautiful.

678
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:42,702
Or anywhere that your imagination will take you.

679
00:52:43,162 --> 00:52:44,822
Or somewhere important…

680
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:49,122
where you have wonderful memories about it.

681
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,352
Somewhere you want to go back to…

682
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:56,462
to search for something.

683
00:52:57,452 --> 00:52:59,662
- Bury it! Bury it!
- You might find an answer...

684
00:52:59,662 --> 00:53:00,512
Bury it! Bury it!

685
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:04,082
- ...when you go back there.
- Let’s do a group hug.

686
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:08,382
You’ll feel more relaxed.

687
00:53:11,442 --> 00:53:12,952
You’ll be happy…

688
00:53:14,022 --> 00:53:16,002
from this moment onwards.

00:54:30,422 --> 00:54:32,422
(LINE Chat)
I want to leave this group.

715
00:54:32,422 --> 00:54:35,342
Samon: (Read 2): What? Why?

716
00:54:35,342 --> 00:54:38,062
Mali: Sent a sticker.

717
00:54:38,062 --> 00:54:41,462
Samon: (Read 2) I called but she cut me off.

718
00:54:41,462 --> 00:54:44,462
Mali: Is she stressing out about something?

719
00:54:44,462 --> 00:54:46,382
Mali: The audition?

720
00:54:46,382 --> 00:54:48,422
Mali: Or her mum?

721
00:54:48,422 --> 00:54:51,182
Kim: She cut me off too.

722
00:54:51,182 --> 00:54:53,022
Samon: (Read 2) I’m worried.

723
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:55,662
Samon: (Read 2) I have a hunch something’s wrong.

724
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:58,142
Mali: Should we go see her at her place?

725
00:54:58,142 --> 00:55:00,422
Mali: I can ask my mum to look after the baby.

726
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,822
Samon: (Read 2) K. I’ll pick you up from home.

727
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:04,942
Mali: Okay. Must be serious this time.

728
00:55:04,942 --> 00:55:07,382
Mali: And Kim is not with her.

729
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:08,652
Kim: Sent a sticker.

730
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:14,222
Jeez! Mon, Mon! (Commotion)

731
00:55:14,222 --> 00:55:15,562
Shut up, Mali!

732
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:18,702
(Praying)

733
00:55:18,702 --> 00:55:24,442
(Commotion)

734
00:55:24,442 --> 00:55:26,322
Hey, I still want to be alive.

735
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:34,022
(Commotion)

736
00:55:41,032 --> 00:55:42,772
- Hello.
- Hello.

737
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,582
I’m sorry we’re here without noticing you beforehand.

738
00:55:45,282 --> 00:55:47,362
Has Wan come back here?

739
00:55:47,362 --> 00:55:49,262
We can’t find her at her flat.

740
00:55:51,332 --> 00:55:53,622
She hasn’t visited here for weeks.

741
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:56,562
What? Hasn’t come home for weeks?

742
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:59,272
Or does she stay with her mum at the hospital?

743
00:55:59,502 --> 00:56:01,552
I don’t think so. Visitors are not allowed there.

744
00:56:01,642 --> 00:56:02,392
Huh?!

745
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:04,852
Hey, where do you think she is?

746
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:07,262
- No idea.
- Can’t get a hold of her. She’s not coming flat either.

747
00:56:07,262 --> 00:56:09,582
Quickly, we should tell Kim about this.

748
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:11,902
- What the heck?
- Jeez.

749
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:16,122
If you hear from Wan, please let us know.

750
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:18,162
How’s her mum right now?

751
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:20,162
She’s still at the hospital.

752
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:22,112
Okay. Please let us know if there’s any update.

753
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,332
- Yes.
- Thank you.

756
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,972
(Phone ringing)

757
00:56:36,582 --> 00:56:42,002
Kim, we came to her house but couldn’t find her.

758
00:56:42,142 --> 00:56:44,342
The maid said she’s not home. She also doesn’t know where she is.

759
00:56:44,842 --> 00:56:47,102
Wait. So, where is she?

760
00:56:47,262 --> 00:56:52,212
No idea too. We’re going to the police station to report a mission person.

761
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:58,342
(Phone screen showing Dawan’s picture)

762
00:56:58,342 --> 00:57:00,772
[Calling Dawan]

763
00:57:00,772 --> 00:57:05,222
(Voice message)
[Sorry, the number you have dialed cannot be connected.]

My Marvellous Dream Is You

765
00:57:44,622 --> 00:57:47,622
Wan, Marwin asked me to go on a trip with him.

766
00:57:47,652 --> 00:57:49,592
We first met here by accident.

767
00:57:49,672 --> 00:57:51,092
Today, we’re finally here together.

768
00:57:51,922 --> 00:57:52,982
Let me teach you.

769
00:57:53,362 --> 00:57:54,212
Do it like this.

770
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:57,972
This is Kimhan, the woman I’ve told you about.

771
00:57:58,212 --> 00:58:00,422
What do your parents do for a living?

772
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:02,032
What’s happening?

773
00:58:02,222 --> 00:58:03,342
I’m sorry, Marwin.

774
00:58:03,492 --> 00:58:05,832
- Where are you taking me?
- I don’t know.

775
00:58:06,132 --> 00:58:08,402
Why are you looking at me like that?

776
00:58:09,532 --> 00:58:13,452
Why did you come to see me today?

777
00:58:14,092 --> 00:58:15,662
When I was acting in the drama,

778
00:58:16,152 --> 00:58:17,942
I still couldn’t do it well.

779
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:21,482
Because I’ve never actually kissed anyone for real.

780
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,322
You’ve never kissed anyone before?
