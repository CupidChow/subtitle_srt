1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,840
This is the first surprise for you, Kim.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,790
Do they agree to postpone the audition date for Wan?

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,680
Jessie got the role.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,750
Don’t tell her though. With her mum being like this, it might trigger her symptoms.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,730
What symptoms?

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,600
She has depression.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,270
Let it take you to wherever you want to be.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,780
You’ll be happy from this moment onwards.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,690
She hasn’t come here for weeks.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,420
What? She hasn’t come home for weeks?!

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,020
Sorry, the number you’ve dialed cannot be connected at this time.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:49,140
2 months later

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,780
Ghandruk, kaski, Central Nepal

14
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,340
You have received a new message : Mali.

15
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,840
How are you?

16
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,450
Are you still alive?

17
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,840
What country are you in now?

18
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,470
Can you buy me some souvenirs?

19
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,380
You have received a new message: Samon.

20
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,590
Wan.

21
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,070
I miss you sooooo much!

22
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,070
When are you coming back? I have a lot to catch up with you.

23
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,740
You have received a new message: Kimhan.

24
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,400
Wan, how are you?

25
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,440
How’s your social detox going?

26
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,760
Please let me know when you’re back.

27
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,500
You have received a new message: Mum.

28
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,010
Wan, are you in Thailand?

29
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,560
Can you come and pick me up?

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,990
Hi, Mum.

31
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,140
I’m back.

32
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,520
I’ll pick you up at the hospital.

33
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,710
See you.

34
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,620
Kimhan.

35
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,740
Wan.

36
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,740
Mum.

37
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,370
I miss you the most in the world.

38
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,820
Hey, you look prettier, don’t you?

39
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,710
Of course. So do you, Mum.

40
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,290
We’re both pretty then.

41
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,760
Come, let’s go home.

42
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,390
Okay.

43
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,910
Miss Dawan, can you please take a selfie with me?

44
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,740
Sure.

45
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,960
I’m your fan. I’ve watched all your works.

46
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,510
When are you going to have a new drama?

47
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,460
Hmm, I don’t know too.

48
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,740
Please excuse me.

49
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,980

My Marvellous Dream Is You

64
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,030
I wonder how she is. We haven’t seen her for 2 months.

65
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,870
She's back.

66
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,440
- I’m nervous.
- Yeah.

67
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,550
So nervous. We haven’t seen her for 2 months.

68
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,740
Guys.

69
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
I miss you sooooo much!

70
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,850
You look fabulous.

71
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,110
- I miss you so much! You disappeared for 2 whole months!
- Yeah.

72
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,290
Come and sit down.

73
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,690
- When you’re not around, I have no one to bicker with.
- Ignore her. She’s talking too much.

74
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,830
It’s you who are talking too much!

75
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,810
I was on a vacation. I bought a lot of stuff for you guys.

76
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,750
Let me see. Which one is mine? This one?

77
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,810
Wow, lots of them.

78
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,970
Wow! You went all the way to Nepal?

79
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,970
This chocolate is from New Zealand.

80
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,310
Wait, how many countries did you visit?

81
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,060
Well, just a few.

82
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,600
Wow.

83
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,540
- Next time, please let us know too. We were so worried about you.
- Yeah.

84
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,540
The auntie doctor told me to cut myself off from social media, so I didn’t tell anyone.

85
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,640
I just went to wherever I wanted to.

86
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,330
Then next time, let us know first…

87
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,160
in case I might want you to buy me a placenta cream.

88
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,590
When you’re not around, Kim almost couldn’t work.

89
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,040
She kept looking for you every day and everywhere.

90
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,200
She even took care of your mother for you.

91
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,620
Yeah. If I were Marwin, I would have been so jealous.

92
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,840
She spent all her time looking for you.

93
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,260
- Hardly had time for her boyfriend.
- Yeah. You’d better keep that in mind.

94
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,950
Girls, let’s eat.

95
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,580
- Yes!
- Yes, Ma’am! I’ll go then.
- Hurry up and follow us.

96
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,020
We’re coming!

97
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,140
Welcome home.

98
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,350
Thank you.

99
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,470
- Try this menu. It’s really good.
- It’s so tasty.

100
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,690
Did you make it yourself?

101
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,380
Yes.

102
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,970
Please eat a lot. You just got out of the hospital.

103
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,740
Okay.

104
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,370
Kim, I have come to realize a lot of things in the past 2 months.

105
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,300
Especially about you.

106
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,050
I was so selfish back then, for wanting to keep you by my side only.

107
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,210
I was too possessive over your life.

108
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,270
If you’re happy, I should be happy for you too.

109
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,240
You’ve always supported me in everything that I do.

110
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,480
From now on, if you need anything, you can always let me know.

111
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,480
I want to do something for you too.

112
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,840
Okay. I’m glad you feel better now.

113
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,830
Oh, that’s right. If you’re free this weekend,

114
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,810
- can you go to Hua Hin with me?
- Of course.

115
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,520
Marwin asked me to go on a trip with him.

116
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,480
But I don’t want to go with him alone.

117
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,760
Why not?

118
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,640
Isn’t he your boyfriend now?

119
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,460
Why don’t you want to be alone with him?

120
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,570
When you had a boyfriend, you always took me with you too.

121
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,370
Please come with me.

122
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,060
Please. Can you come with me?

123
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,880
Let me think about it.

124
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,020
Kim, why would you want her to go with you?

125
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,690
She just got back from her trip.

126
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:48,080
Also, Marwin might be upset if he sees her tagging along.

127
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,170
You should just go with him alone. You’re a grown up now.

128
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,300
That’s right. He might want to spend time with you alone.

129
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,270
If you need anything, you can always call us.

130
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,420
Yeah. I think you should do that.

131
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,740
If there’s anything…

132
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,660
- Mali and I are always here for you.
- Yeah.

133
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,670
Jeez! You go first then.

134
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,370
No, you first. What do you want to say?

135
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,880
- Hey!        /     - What?

136
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,790
It’s Kim. I’m worried about her.

137
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,160
She’s never spent a night with any guy alone before.

138
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,680
If there’s anything, she’d definitely call for our help.

139
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:48,360
She might want to know if she should leave the light on…or turn it off on her first time.

140
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,400
(Squealing with glee)

141
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,260
She’ll just call.

142
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,420
You, perv!

143
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,840
I really want to call a cop to give you a disciplinary action for your perversion.

144
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,130
If that’s the case, then I guess I’m not the only one.

145
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,290
You’d need it too.

146
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,090
I’m already married with one kid.

147
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,140
But you, you’ve probably dated all the guys in this country.

148
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,350
I think you can open a boys’ school soon.

149
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,090
Damn you, Mali!

150
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,860
What?

151
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,560
- That’s a great idea! I really like that!
- Jeez, I thought you’d curse me.

152
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,880
But seriously, it’s good that Wan didn’t say yes.

153
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,670
Tagging along and third-wheeling your best friend’s date?

154
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,020
- It’s not going to turn out good.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,980
Also, Marwin is so handsome. He’s rich, handsome, and well-educated.

156
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,030
Kim just won a jackpot indeed.

157
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,300
(Squeaking)

158
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,200
We first met here by accident.

159
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,560
Today, we’re finally here together.

160
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,940
Do you want to try it?

161
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,100
Like this.

162
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,410
What do your parents do for a living?

166
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:49,272

[Group Call: No Kim V.2 (ad hoc)]

169
00:15:57,282 --> 00:16:00,472
Are you creating a new group just to gossip about Kim?

170
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:04,402
No, not gossip. It’s because I’m worried about her.

171
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:07,822
This is the first time she’d spend a night with a guy.

172
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:13,902
Do you think I should send her a clip about how to do it for the first time?

173
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:18,772
Or maybe a clip about how to make your first kiss memorable?

174
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:22,432
How do you know? This might not be her first kiss.

175
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:25,002
Are you saying she has kissed a guy before?

176
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:31,732
She might have kissed a dog…or a cat. Something like that.

177
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,402
She might not let him kiss her.

178
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:35,742
Wait.

179
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,992
Mali, what are you doing?

180
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:42,812
Are you…

181
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:44,492
Nothing. I’m not doing anything.

182
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,522
So, are you saying…

183
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:55,132
you don’t usually let your boyfriend kiss you?

184
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:56,622
No.

185
00:16:57,362 --> 00:17:01,952
I never let anyone I dated kiss me.

186
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:08,992
Really? Except one person maybe? The one you didn’t date but got to kiss you.

187
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:10,122
Who?

188
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:14,542
I mean Pat, her co-star.

189
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,392
That’s not a kiss. It’s the work of a camera.

190
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:27,122
Anyway, if I have to go on a trip with my boyfriend and sleep in the same room with him…

191
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:31,362
but all we do is holding each other’s hands without getting intimated, then I’d rather stay home.

192
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:38,212
What if Kim sleeps with Marwin and she likes it?

193
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:40,602
She might want to have a long-term relationship with him.

194
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:43,312
And they might be like me, having a baby before getting married.

195
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:49,592
By the way, didn’t she ask you to go with her?

196
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:51,622
Have you made up your mind?

197
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:56,632
I’m telling you, do not go. Stay out of this.

198
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:59,202
This is Kim’s first love.

199
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:01,692
I know. I’m not going.

200
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:04,572
Good. Don’t go. That’s it.

201
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:09,822
Are you sure you’re not going to regret it?

202
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:10,742
Mhm.

203
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:16,302
Guys, I gotta go. Someone is getting naughty and needs to be handled.

204
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,812
We first met here accidentally.

205
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:18,842
Now, we’re finally here together.

206
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:39,682
Watch your head.

207
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:49,202
Can I call Mum and tell her I’ve arrived?

208
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,272
I’ll be right over.

209
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:53,232
Okay

210
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,662
Do you want to try it?

211
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:24,522
Neh, I don’t know how.

212
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:26,122
It’s easy.

213
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,092
Let me teach you.

214
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,052
Here, try it.

215
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:39,602
This side is for flying up and down. This side is for the direction.

216
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:42,102
This side.

217
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:43,292
That’s right.

218
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,102
Yeah.

219
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:50,342
Like this.

220
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:03,202
See? It’s not that hard.

221
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:12,332
Wow.

222
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:15,612
You’re quite good.

223
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:20,412
Let’s go.

224
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:25,082
Wowww!

225
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:26,592
That’s right.

226
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,742
Easy there.

227
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,322
It’s quite hard.

228
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:42,562
I’ve never seen this side of yours.

229
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:44,742
It’s adorable.

230
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:52,832
You better do it. I’m scared.

231
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:57,022
Do I make you feel disgusted?

232
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:00,852
It’s not like that.

233
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:04,122
I just feel…weird.

234
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,532
Oh, that’s right. You never had a boyfriend before.

235
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:13,992
Then, shall we take it step by step?

236
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:24,812
Maybe this much for a start.

237
00:22:26,182 --> 00:22:26,752
Ouch!

238
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:28,482
Hey!

239
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:36,152
Sorry! I was going to put on my glasses, but they slipped out of my hands and went too far.

240
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:37,662
Wan.

241
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:45,382
What are you two doing over there? The sea stinks.

242
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:49,112
I’m on a vacation with Kim. What are you doing here?

243
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:50,092
I’m also…

244
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:51,802
on a vacation.

245
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:54,932
Kim invited me. Got it?

246
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:02,222
Thanks.

247
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:08,612
(Phong ringing)

248
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:11,972
I’ll be right back, Kim.

249
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:16,932
Yes, Mum?

250
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:22,272
Thank you for saving me, Wan.

251
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:24,852
You look uncomfortable.

252
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:26,252
Mhm.

253
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:28,872
I’ve been feeling like this since when I was in a car with him.

254
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:36,102
Why did you come all of a sudden? You seemed like you didn’t want to yesterday.

255
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:37,652
What changed your mind?

256
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:40,672
I’m not here to third wheeling you and your boyfriend.

257
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,722
I just want to ask you something.

258
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:45,872
What is it?

259
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:46,962
Well…

260
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:49,192
Kim.

261
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:55,302
My parents are also here with their friends.

262
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:58,592
When they know I’m here with you, they asked if you could go and meet them.

263
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:04,002
Umm…I’m still not ready to meet your parents.

264
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:08,722
It’s all right, Kim. I have to introduce you to them one day anyway.

265
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,312
It’s just a bit earlier than expected.

266
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:13,512
Tsk, this is like twisting her arm.

267
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:15,992
Wan.

268
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,652
I’m really sorry. I’ve just found out too.

269
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:23,612
Can you	go and meet them?

270
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:27,922
Well…

271
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,752
Just go, Kim. Show them some manners.

272
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:38,412
Okay.

273
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,202
I’ll go with you.

274
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:55,422
- Hello.    /    - Hello.

275
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:57,332
- Oh, Marwin.     /     - Hello.

276
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,802
This is Kimhan, the woman I’ve told you about.

277
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:02,302
Kimhan.

278
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:05,422
And that’s Dawan, Kim’s friend.

279
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:06,452
Please have a seat.

280
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:15,642
Thank you

281
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:25,732
Are you Mon’s daughter?

282
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:27,192
Yes.

283
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:32,072
How is she doing? I haven’t seen her at the sport club for a while.

284
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:35,462
How could you? She’s in rehab because she’s alcoholic.

285
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,632
I’m thinking of visiting her some time soon.

286
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:40,992
Oh dear, how can I miss this news?

287
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:43,952
Please send her my best regards.

288
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:48,132
No need. You’d be gossiping about her after this anyway.

289
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:54,722
Oh, the food has arrived, let’s eat then

290
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:56,182
Okay.

291
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:00,562
- It looks really delicious.
- So much meat..

292
00:26:02,282 --> 00:26:04,602
- Wow, the fish is big.
- I really like it.

293
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,552
- Do you really like it, don't you?
- Yes

294
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:07,462
Seabass.

295
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:11,482
This is your favorite.

296
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,892
We’re having a feast today.

297
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:15,942
Come, let’s eat.

298
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:17,792
Okay, please go ahead.

299
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,222
Make yourself comfortable.

300
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:22,662
- Make yourself comfortable
- Thank you

301
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:24,172
- Here , Kim
- Thank you

302
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,282
Are you two close?

303
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,562
How did you know him?

304
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:35,672
We met here accidentally.

305
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:42,012
I was painting and Marwin came to ask me about the painting techniques.

306
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:47,062
You both have the same interest, so you enjoy talking to each other.

307
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:49,972
How long have you known each other?

308
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:54,112
We’ve been seeing each other for 3 months, Dad.

309
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:54,932
Mhm.

310
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:55,752
(Phone buzzing)
Mhm.

311
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:56,692
(Phone buzzing)

312
00:26:57,932 --> 00:26:58,412
(Phone buzzing)

313
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:02,552
It’s a call from the gallery. Probably something urgent. Please excuse me.

314
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:03,222
Okay.

315
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,862
- Make yourself comfortable, Kim.
- Okay.

316
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:09,892
Fish is your favourite, isn’t it?

317
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,102
Thank you for remembering.

318
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:22,552
So, what do your parents do for a living?

319
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:27,042
My father is a programmer. My mother is a wedding planner.

320
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:35,472
If your mother has to go out to work, does that mean your father isn’t capable of taking care of your family?

321
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:39,582
My parents separated.

322
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:56,772
So…do you plan to get married or start a family with Marwin?

323
00:27:56,932 --> 00:28:01,652
We haven’t been together that long so I haven’t thought about that yet.

324
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:03,172
I see.

325
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:08,902
Do you believe that children raised up in two-parent families…

326
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:11,342
tend to grow up to become a better person?

327
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,602
Not necessarily.

328
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:17,152
My mum raised me up alone.  And I still grew up well.

329
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:21,062
Children these days tend to think like this.

330
00:28:21,352 --> 00:28:24,342
Growing up doesn’t mean you’d be respectable.

331
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:30,242
Personally, I believe in perfection.

332
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:36,162
A family should comprise of a father, a mother, and a child.

333
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:40,972
If both parents have to go out to work, or if they are separated;

334
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:43,662
then who would take good care of the child?

335
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:50,252
That’s right. A husband should be the leader of the family.

336
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:56,932
A wife should take good care of her child and husband. And always give him support.

337
00:28:58,762 --> 00:29:02,272
Because he’s the breadwinner of the family.

338
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:07,702
I heard you’re working for Marwin at his gallery.

339
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:12,512
If you marry him in the future, you must quit your job and stay home.

340
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,052
You must let Marwin be the leader.

341
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:23,662
Wow, are we in the ancient time or what?

342
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:25,772
I’m speechless.

343
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:28,172
Can’t believe there are still people who think like this.

344
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:33,382
Actually, it’s not unusual at all. But you’re probably against the idea…

345
00:29:33,692 --> 00:29:36,942
because you also grew up in a single-parent family.

346
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:38,572
So, it might be hard for you to agree.

347
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,592
I’m not against it.

348
00:29:47,942 --> 00:29:57,632
I’m just trying to find out if having to keep asking your husband for money every time you need it is really happiness.

349
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:05,172
What if one day your husband dies? What would you do then?

350
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:10,062
Are you going to rely on his money for the rest of your life?

351
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,322
Why can’t you earn it yourself?

352
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:16,222
Don’t you think so?

353
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:21,392
We’re now in a world where we have freedom to choose.

354
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:25,332
The society is supporting the liberty and equality for women.

355
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:29,152
But all you do is devaluing us women.

356
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:35,602
I’d rather not be sitting here with you.

357
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:37,072
It’s unpleasant.

358
00:30:39,352 --> 00:30:40,232
Let’s go, Kim.

359
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:45,872
Poor you. You both grew up in single-parent families.

360
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:49,442
Your father is gay and ran away with her father.

361
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:51,982
So, your mother didn’t have time to look after her kid.

362
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:54,702
That’s why you have such a terrible manner.

363
00:30:55,762 --> 00:31:01,632
Heed my words, if you don’t improve yourself, no one would want to marry you.

364
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,362
That’s all right. I can marry my friend. It’d be fun.

365
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,612
Hey, kid. Please have some manners.

366
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:08,952
Who’s your kid? I only have one mother.

367
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:10,892
I guess no one in this world is as good as you lot.

368
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:12,472
Let’s go, Kim.

369
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:23,522
What’s going on here?

370
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:24,782
(Sigh)

371
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:28,562
I’m sorry, Marwin.

372
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:29,982
Kim.

373
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:31,222
Kim.

374
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:33,162
Marwin, come back here.

375
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:05,122
Wait, where are you going to take me?

376
00:32:05,212 --> 00:32:07,252
I don’t know. Let’s get out of there first.

377
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:09,812
But I still haven’t packed up my things.

378
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:12,692
Forget it. We can go buy new ones.

379
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,362
But where are we going?

380
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:17,702
No idea. But I don’t want to go back home yet.

381
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:22,032
Since we’re here, let’s have a vacation together. What do you say?

382
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:23,302
Yeah, okay.

383
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:26,382
If you’re with me, I can be anywhere.

384
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:27,832
Okay, hop in then.

385
00:32:34,382 --> 00:32:36,452
Why are you looking at me like that?

386
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:37,272
Is it true?

387
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:38,042
Is what true?

388
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:41,012
Kim! Wake up!

389
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:41,812
Let’s go out!

390
00:32:56,872 --> 00:33:03,832

391
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:11,581
My Marvellous Dream Is You

392
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:20,151
Yes. Thank you so much.

393
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:22,411
I already got the keys.

394
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:25,041
Yes, thank you.

395
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:52,641
Lucky for us that this house belongs to the producer I used to work with.

396
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:55,731
She even lets us stay for free.

397
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:57,981
What a luck indeed.

398
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:35,821
Why are you looking at me like that?

399
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:37,861
Is it true?

400
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,701
Is what true?

401
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:43,241
Earlier when you said…

402
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,781
that if no one wants to marry you,

403
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,461
you’d marry me.

404
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:52,561
Were you serious?

405
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:55,131
Hmm

406
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:23,111
Where has that fierce woman gone?

407
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:28,241
I was just teasing. Have you gone mute all of a sudden?

408
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:35,111
But even if it’s not true, I’m still happy.

409
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:39,031
Because no matter what…

410
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,571
you’ll always be there to protect me.

411
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:45,431
Umm

412
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:46,591
Hmm

413
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,431
Actually,

414
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:52,641
I’m sure you can survive without me.

415
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,911
It’s because of you.

416
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:04,551
You give me the courage to stand up for myself.

417
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,041
Without you,

418
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:09,941
I would have sat there and gone mute too.

419
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:13,761
In this world,

420
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:17,951
there are only a few things that can tick me off.

421
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:20,191
I don’t care at all…

422
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:22,101
if anyone would talk bad about me.

423
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:25,521
But when I heard that woman talk to you like that,

424
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,771
it made me so angry.

425
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:30,921
(Sigh)

426
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,901
Okay, that’s enough.

427
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:36,331
Let’s not talk about other people’s stuff.

428
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:37,351
Come.

429
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:39,441
Let’s go to our room.

430
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,611
Um, our room?

431
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,081
Mhm.

432
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:53,341
It’s late. Let’s go to sleep.

433
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:57,001
- Ah…to sleep.
- Mhm.

434
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:00,811
Let’s go.

435
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:15,981
Let me carry it.

436
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:17,461
Mhm.

437
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:23,801
It’s quite narrow, isn’t it?

438
00:38:38,341 --> 00:38:39,101
Is it okay?

439
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:42,981
Yeah.

440
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:46,041
They only have this style for sale.

441
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:50,781
Mmm, it’s nice.

442
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:56,701
A pyjamas that won’t let you sleep.

443
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:18,951
So…shall we?

444
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:20,781
Let’s sleep.

445
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:32,171
Mhm

446
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:34,751
Cold, isn’t it?

447
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:37,111
Umm

448
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:40,021
Probably because of the air con.

449
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:43,011
Ummm

450
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:46,561
- Let’s tug in.
- Yeah

451
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:47,221
Okay

452
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:08,751
(Coughing)

453
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:10,531
(Coughing)

454
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,841
- Water?
- Hmm.

455
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:15,131
No.

456
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:17,281
Just faking it.

457
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:19,601
Ah.

458
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:23,921
- Hmm.      /     - Huh?

459
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:27,401
- Huh?     /     - Hmm.

460
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,281
Wan.

461
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:39,881
You said you came to see me today…

462
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:41,371
because you have something to tell me.

463
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:44,211
What is it?

464
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:47,371
Ahh…

465
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,171
Kim.

466
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:54,561
Don’t get married.

467
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:56,561
Hm?

468
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:03,701
Why did you bring this up?

469
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:09,281
If you don’t get married,

470
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,301
then we can live together forever.

471
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:31,131
What if…you get married? Whom will I live with?

472
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:36,781
I won’t get married.

473
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,811
Then neither will I.

474
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:49,821
We’ll be together unitl death do us apart.

475
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:57,151
Is that a promise?

476
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:05,621
Yes, it’s a promise.

477
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,661
Promise me you won’t get married too.

478
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:18,971
Mhm..

479
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:24,351
Do you have anything else to tell me?

480
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,081
Hmm…

481
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:32,671
Huh?

482
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:38,691
Wan.

483
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:44,381
(Snoring)

484
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:48,621
Wan.

485
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:51,381
Wan.

486
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:54,571
(Snoring)

487
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,351
Thank you.

488
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,851
For coming to see me.

489
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:20,511
Miss gorgeous Dawan.

490
00:43:32,621 --> 00:43:34,281
(Snoring)

491
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:36,521
(Snoring)

492
00:43:38,531 --> 00:43:39,371
(Snoring)

493
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:41,841
(Snoring)

494
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:20,631
Oh!

495
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:22,471
Kim.

496
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:24,621
Kim.

497
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:26,911
Kim! Wake up!

498
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:28,791
Wake up, Kim!

499
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,581
Kim.

500
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:31,311
- Kim.     /     - Hmm.

501
00:44:31,311 --> 00:44:33,001
Hurry, let’s get up.

502
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:35,551
Let’s go out.

503
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:37,141
Get up.

504
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,041
- Kim.     /     - Hmm.

505
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,961
We haven’t gone out together for quite a while.

506
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:46,301
Going out with me, aren’t you afraid there’d be a scandal?

507
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:49,771
Pfft, no one is interested in me these days.

508
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:51,941
That’s good for me though.

509
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:53,811
Really good.

510
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:57,051
So, let’s go out.

511
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:59,181
Come on. Get up.

512
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:00,371
Hurry.

513
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:02,261
- Come on.     /    - Umm

514
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:03,171
Get up.

515
00:45:04,311 --> 00:45:06,211
Go shower.

516
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:10,781
Let’s shower.

517
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:28,741
🎵Can I keep sleeping like this?🎵

518
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:31,951
🎵I want to keep you by my side like this🎵

519
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:36,211
🎵I don’t want to wake up at all🎵

520
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:39,161
🎵Let me keep looking at you for a little longer🎵

521
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:42,341
🎵I want to stay close to you a little longer🎵

522
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:46,421
🎵I don’t want to see you only in my dreams🎵

523
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:51,791
🎵When you’re not around, everything seems dull🎵

524
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:56,991
🎵All I can do is counting the days until I see you again🎵

525
00:45:56,991 --> 00:46:01,421
🎵See you in my dream tonight🎵

526
00:46:01,981 --> 00:46:06,171
🎵I saw you in my dream again 🎵

527
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:12,351
🎵And it felt so real. Do you know how much you make me feel?🎵

528
00:46:12,351 --> 00:46:19,131
🎵Loving each other in a dream for only 8 hours a night is never enough🎵

529
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:23,561
- Woohoo!     /     - Woohoo!

530
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:27,091
- Let’s go over there.
- Okay.

531
00:46:27,341 --> 00:46:28,761
I'll go with you.

532
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:30,961
Woohoo!

533
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:35,141
I’ll go down first.

534
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:39,611
- Give me the camera. I’ll take a photo for you.
- Okayy.

535
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:46,131
1 2…

536
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:50,871
Get me down there too.

537
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:54,171
- Careful.
- Okay.

538
00:46:58,161 --> 00:47:00,281
- Let’s take a photo together.
- Mhm.

539
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:15,591
It’s good to be alone together like this.

540
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,591
I’ll try to go out with you more often.

541
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:20,981
So that you won’t have to go alone again.

542
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:24,621
Are you worried I’d be lonely?

543
00:47:25,371 --> 00:47:29,381
No…I just don’t want you to bump into someone like Marwin.

544
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:30,801
I’m jealous.

545
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:33,931
That’s good.

546
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:36,201
Huh?

547
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:38,821
What did you say?

548
00:47:39,391 --> 00:47:40,911
Nothing.

549
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,181
But I heard it.

550
00:47:43,431 --> 00:47:44,311
I didn’t say anything.

551
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:46,561
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

552
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:47,181
Wan!

553
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:49,201
Kim

554
00:47:50,331 --> 00:47:51,031
Wan

555
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:52,561
Get back here!

556
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:53,681
No.

557
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,371
Take this!

558
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:09,811
Take this!

559
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,851
When I was shooting a drama,

560
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:35,081
I still couldn’t do well during some scenes.

561
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:38,611
That’s because…I’ve never actually kissed anyone for real.

562
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:40,491
You’ve never kissed anyone before?

My Marvellous Dream Is You

565
00:49:30,252 --> 00:49:31,382
What are you thinking?

566
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:37,372
I’m thinking about when I was shooting a drama.

567
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:42,912
I still couldn’t do well during the kiss scene.

568
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:46,982
Because I’ve never kissed anyone for real.

569
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:53,922
Really? You’ve never kissed anyone before?

570
00:49:56,432 --> 00:50:00,082
No…not in real life.

571
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:04,092
What about you?

572
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:10,752
Can’t say I haven’t.

573
00:50:14,462 --> 00:50:17,262
With whom? Was it Marwin?

574
00:50:19,972 --> 00:50:20,792
No.

575
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:24,162
Then…who?

576
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:30,922
Someone in my dream.

577
00:50:36,482 --> 00:50:40,272
Wan…do you want to try it with me?

578
00:50:43,152 --> 00:50:43,982
Can I…

579
00:50:45,932 --> 00:50:48,022
do that?

580
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,372
Isn’t that what friends are for?

581
00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:03,032
Well, then…

582
00:51:04,902 --> 00:51:06,082
That’s easy for me.

583
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:22,282
Kim.

584
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:24,222
Kim.

585
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:26,652
Kim.

586
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:29,312
What is it?

587
00:56:29,532 --> 00:56:35,972
Did you already put all those lights and candles away?

588
00:56:36,612 --> 00:56:40,142
Huh? Do we have those things in our room?

589
00:56:40,572 --> 00:56:41,722
Are you awake?

590
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:51,042
Why am I naked?

591
00:56:52,372 --> 00:56:54,522
Last night, didn’t we…

592
00:56:54,522 --> 00:57:00,792
You’re naked because you were so drunk that you puked on the beach last night.

593
00:57:00,812 --> 00:57:03,872
I had to carry you back and clean you up.

594
00:57:04,382 --> 00:57:07,222
Took me forever to do that.

595
00:57:10,842 --> 00:57:13,522
Jeez, was that just a dream?

596
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:16,902
Making out on the beach…

597
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:18,762
And the heavenly bed scene.

598
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,632
Were all those just a dream?

599
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:23,552
Damn it.

600
00:57:24,562 --> 00:57:27,082
Wan.

601
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:31,002
You’re having it so badly.

602
00:57:31,972 --> 00:57:32,772
Wan.

603
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:37,672
Get up. Go shower and get dressed. I’m hungry.

604
00:57:40,522 --> 00:57:43,922
By the way…what did you dream of last night?

605
00:57:44,742 --> 00:57:46,952
Well…nothing much.

606
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:53,642
It was just a really good dream. So good I want it to come true.

607
00:57:53,892 --> 00:57:55,032
That’s all.

608
00:57:59,972 --> 00:58:02,172
Get up, Wan.

609
00:58:02,972 --> 00:58:05,462
Get up and go shower.

610
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:07,182
I’m hungry. Get up.

611
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:09,452
- Kim.      /     - Jeez.

612
00:58:09,882 --> 00:58:12,172
I’m so hungry. Go shower and get dressed.

613
00:58:12,712 --> 00:58:13,182
Come on.

614
00:58:13,182 --> 00:58:13,782
Up!

615
00:58:15,932 --> 00:58:17,612
I hear you.

616
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:18,552
I’m hungry.

617
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:24,252
Get up.

618
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,612
Go shower.

619
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:28,622

Who is it?

It’s just Mum.

638
00:59:40,642 --> 00:59:41,332
Kim.

639
00:59:42,802 --> 00:59:46,112
About Marwin, what are you going to do next? You already agreed to be his girlfriend.

640
00:59:47,742 --> 00:59:49,182
So? We can break up.

641
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:54,032
Do you know why I said yes to him back then?

642
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:57,592
Because I want you to focus on your work.

643
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:02,382
Also, you seemed to be better off with Pat.

644
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:06,042
So I thought leaving you would be best for you.

645
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:10,292
You did it for me again. Why didn’t you just tell me honestly?

646
01:00:13,462 --> 01:00:14,712
One more thing.

647
01:00:15,152 --> 01:00:15,702
Yeah?

648
01:00:16,902 --> 01:00:20,572
My mum has cancer.

649
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:29,162
So, I just want to make her happy. She’s always wanted me to have someone to take care of me.

650
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,392
That’s why I had to agree to be Marwin’s girlfriend.

651
01:00:37,422 --> 01:00:42,012
Can I tell my mum that Miss Ae has cancer?

652
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:45,532
Yeah.

653
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:06,282
Mum.

654
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:08,452
Wan, you’re back.

655
01:01:09,572 --> 01:01:10,912
Miss Ae has cancer.

656
01:01:15,762 --> 01:01:17,472
Do you want to go visit her?

657
01:01:50,282 --> 01:01:52,142
Mum, you have a visitor.

658
01:02:15,662 --> 01:02:17,412
Wan told me everything, Ae.

659
01:02:19,982 --> 01:02:22,182
How’s the treatment going?

660
01:02:23,992 --> 01:02:28,052
I know a lot of good doctors. Do you want me to recommend them to you?

661
01:02:28,652 --> 01:02:32,792
Thank you. But I’m already under the care of another doctor.

662
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:36,102
We’re working on a treatment plan.

663
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:41,552
Are you fully recovered now?

664
01:02:44,902 --> 01:02:47,782
Well…sort of.

665
01:02:49,872 --> 01:02:56,612
Strange, isn’t it? We didn’t get to see each other until we became sick.

666
01:02:57,212 --> 01:03:00,862
Well, it’s better late than never.

667
01:03:01,302 --> 01:03:05,472
I’m sure you’ll recover soon. Mum and I will come visit you more often.

668
01:03:05,922 --> 01:03:07,812
So that we can keep in touch.

669
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:17,982
Thank you, Miss Mon, for still thinking of Mum.

670
01:03:23,722 --> 01:03:27,432
Ae, do you remember what we once talked about?

671
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:32,842
That one day, we’d take our girls on a road trip together.

672
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,302
Do you still remember it?

673
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:39,302
I never forget.

674
01:03:40,672 --> 01:03:44,252
Do you want to do that? I’ll take care of you.

675
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:51,772
Are you all right? If not, I’ll go with you too.

676
01:04:26,182 --> 01:04:27,562
So funny.

677
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:33,502
You looked so clumsy back then.

678
01:04:33,722 --> 01:04:34,662
Wow.

679
01:04:51,562 --> 01:04:53,472
Do you like it? There are lots of trees here.

680
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,152
Mhm.

681
01:04:55,802 --> 01:04:57,012
- Ae.     /     - Hm?

682
01:04:57,072 --> 01:04:58,512
Do you want to go to Chiangmai?

683
01:04:58,912 --> 01:05:00,532
Hmm, interesting.

684
01:05:00,892 --> 01:05:03,632
Maybe after I finish my chemotherapy next time.

685
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:06,342
Okay.

686
01:05:06,342 --> 01:05:08,202
(Phone ringing)

687
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:10,562
- Just a second. My staff is calling.
- (Phone ringing)

688
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:12,482
Hello.

689
01:05:12,792 --> 01:05:13,552
Yes, Ann.

690
01:05:15,072 --> 01:05:16,632
I’m on my way back.

691
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:18,412
Okay.

692
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:20,062
I’ll see you then.

693
01:05:21,262 --> 01:05:23,002
I have a meeting at 6 this evening.

694
01:05:24,412 --> 01:05:26,852
Wan, can you please drop me off?

695
01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:28,592
Sure.

696
01:05:29,102 --> 01:05:30,782
Do you still have to work?

697
01:05:31,412 --> 01:05:32,812
Of course.

698
01:05:33,122 --> 01:05:37,832
I have to pay back the loan. My staff also need their jobs.

699
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:42,522
You should worry about yourself first.

700
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:51,132
Let’s go eat something delicious.

701
01:06:01,032 --> 01:06:03,062
What do you want to drink?

702
01:06:03,862 --> 01:06:05,162
I’ll go and order for you.

703
01:06:05,442 --> 01:06:06,512
Same for you, Mum?

704
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:08,832
What about the others?

705
01:06:08,942 --> 01:06:11,682
Hmm…I’ll have hot tea then.

706
01:06:14,122 --> 01:06:15,802
Okay, let me take care of that.

707
01:06:22,252 --> 01:06:23,542
Can I place an order, please?

708
01:06:24,152 --> 01:06:25,622
What else do you want to eat, Mum?

709
01:06:55,672 --> 01:06:56,482
Dad.

710
01:06:58,942 --> 01:06:59,552
Wan.

711
01:07:37,772 --> 01:07:40,852
My Marvellous Dream Is You

712
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:45,502
If you had been cleared since the beginning, then it wouldn’t have had to be this tiring.

713
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:52,902
I know how you feel about Wan.

714
01:07:57,612 --> 01:07:59,382
You’re still as mean as before.

01:08:00,492 --> 01:08:06,012
Do you want to hear about Mum and I after you left us to fend for ourselves?

716
01:08:10,162 --> 01:08:11,412
I’d like you to resign.

717
01:08:12,512 --> 01:08:13,632
Here is your severance pay.

718
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:17,432
Wan, can you go and wait outside, dear?

719
01:08:17,882 --> 01:08:20,672
I have something to talk to Kim and Marwin.
