1
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,331
I’ve often dreamt of someone since when I was young.

2
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:19,308
And that someone I’ve always dreamt of

3
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:36,505
is…

4
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:43,400
the owner of a bright and beautiful smile.

5
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,431
My adorable petite friend.

6
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:49,540
The woman who makes me happy.

7
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:18,685
So happy that I wouldn’t want to wake up…

8
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:23,550
and face the truth in life.

9
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,285
Wan.

10
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,760
Wan.

11
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,382
Wan!

12
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:37,988
Here’s your coffee.

13
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:43,588
Are you all right?

14
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:47,005
Were you so stressed that you had to sleep over at the office last night?

15
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,170
Toon, can I talk to you about the script?

16
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,194
Okay.

17
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,657
Everyone, 5 more minutes. Please stand by for broadcasting.

18
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,131
Make it quick, guys.

19
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:00,868
Let’s go change.

20
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:10,148
Kim, can you help her get dressed?

21
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,697
Did you guys have a quarrel again?

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,508
Both of you better clear it up.

23
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:41,954
Otherwise, it’d be difficult to work together since you two are close friends.

24
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,171
Wan, no matter what, do not get cranky on-air today.

25
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:58,285
It’s a live broadcasting. We can’t edit it.

26
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:00,811
It depends on the guest too.

27
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,754
I’d be happy to play nice if she could keep her sneering comments about me to herself.

28
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:06,700
You better not pick a quarrel with her.

29
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,628
Are you saying I’m the one who started it?

45
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,811
How was it? Is it all right?

46
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,868
Hey, Jessie! The makeup room is over there.

47
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,731
Go get changed and get your makeup done.

48
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:13,645
Oh! Hello there, Kimhan.

49
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:15,097
Hi, Dawan.

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,685
What’s going on? Why do you girls look so serious?

51
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:33,965
Did you tell her already, Kim?

52
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:46,640
You must be so frustrated then?

53
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:52,240
Well then, I better go get dressed.

54
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:53,691
See you at the interview.

55
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:02,605
Wait.

56
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,500
What did she mean by that?

57
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,800
Let’s go get ready, Wan.

58
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,422
Wan.

59
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Kim, why are you like this? You know I don’t like her.

60
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,217
But you still help her.

61
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:24,220
This time too.  Why does she know something about you that I don’t?

62
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:25,460
What’s going on?

63
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,560
Tell me right now.

64
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:33,154
I’ll tell you after the interview.

65
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
I don’t want you to lose focus.

66
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,268
You have to tell me now. I can concentrate.

67
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,834
Later, Wan.

68
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:49,142
This interview will play an important role on your dream.

69
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,291
If you can’t maintain your image nicely.

70
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:53,440
you can lose this job to Jessie.

71
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,782
If you don’t tell me now, I’m not going to attend this interview.

72
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:01,794
I’ll ruin the entire show.

73
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:11,060
Wan.

74
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:16,571
Today is the last day that I’ll work for

75
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
I’ll be working for Jessie from now

76
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,565
Miss Dawan, it’s time!

77
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,868
Are you sure you’d do this?

78
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:02,845
Yeah.

79
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,100
It’s already hard enough working with her these days.

80
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:10,502
And now you as her close friend would go work for her arch enemy?

81
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,977
Surely, they’d soon be on crime news instead of entertainment news.

82
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,302
What if she gets cranky during the broadcasting?

83
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,497
As long as she stays focus, it’ll be fine.

84
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:29,805
Should we find a backup plan? Just in case if something happens.

85
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:38,240
Please sit here, Jessie.

86
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,959
All right then. Is everyone ready?

87
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:45,257
MC, are you ready?

88
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,102
Okay then. Toon, let’s go.

89
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:49,748
Let’s go to the control room.

90
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,914
5 4 3 2…

91
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:59,020
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Idol Entertainment.

92
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,860
(Applause)

93
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,108
I’m now with the two gorgeous ladies who are also the most popular actresses right now.

94
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,370
They are on every news and social media.

95
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,948
Please welcome, Wan Dawan and Jessie Keerati!

96
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,370
Hello.

97
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,474
Hello both of you. Welcome to the show.

98
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:22,530
I heard you both are during the audition for the Hollywood right now.

99
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,250
Congratulations!

100
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,091
- Thank you.
-	 Let’s hear it for them.

101
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:29,531
So, first thing first, let me ask you this --

102
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:32,940
How do you feel for being chosen as the two final candidates?

103
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,060
I’m incredibly happy.

104
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,240
Finally, what I’ve been doing so well since when I was young

105
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,977
is now going to be recognized on an international level.

106
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,228
Please excuse me for asking you this.

107
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:52,422
But people are saying that you’re using your mother’s connection since she’s also an actress.

108
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,188
I feel so bad to hear that.

109
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:03,450
I don’t think I’d be able to come this far…

110
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,068
without my own skills and efforts.

111
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:07,870
Let’s hear it for her!

112
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,251
(Applause)

113
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:11,920
Well answered indeed.

114
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,965
Now, it’s your turn, Dawan.

115
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,540
People are saying that you got the latest role because…

116
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,731
you family is rich.

117
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:24,480
That you don’t need skills to play this role.

118
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:30,240
And you are popular because it’s all a fluke.

119
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,491
I can’t choose the family I was born into.

120
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,268
Am I right?

121
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:40,966
That’s right.

122
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:47,405
So, I couldn’t deny what you were saying isn’t true. Yes, my family is really rich.

123
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,291
Oh, fabulous!

124
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:53,988
Rich and beautiful.

125
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:01,740
Now that you two are facing the final test for the audition where only one of you will be the winner,

126
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,040
but I saw Dawan’s post on IG saying that…

127
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,860
if you don’t win, you’d quit. Do you really mean it?

128
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:21,570
Of course.

129
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,537
This audition will be a solid proof it’s not just a fluke that I’ve become famous.

130
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,942
Fabulous!

131
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,971
Well then, what about you, Jessie?

132
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,342
How do feel when you have to compete with your friend?

133
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:46,230
In my opinion, the one who wins this role is more like a representation of our nation.

134
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:51,645
So, in the end if Wan is the winner…

135
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,897
I’d also feel happy for her.

136
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,285
And I’m sure Wan also thinks the same, right?

137
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:08,640
Why are you so different on and off the camera?

138
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:10,377
You know what?

139
00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:17,140
You should be more honest to yourself.  Don’t be such a two-faced b…

140
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:24,045
Cut to the advert right now!

141
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:27,154
Did you see the interview?

142
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:31,108
She’d definitely be in the doghouse from now on.

143
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,280
Why did you steal Kim from me?

144
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:34,251
I didn’t.

145
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:36,200
I just gave her a nice offer.

146
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,330
She decided to come on her own.

147
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,377
What offer?

148
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,600
None of your business. But you should know this…

149
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:44,830
Without her as your stylist, you’re just a low-profile actress.

150
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:45,965
With a horrible taste.

151
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:48,057
And you’ll finally be forgotten.

152
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:51,977
Pathetic!

153
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,085
Ouch! You, bitch!

154
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,765
Bitch!

155
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:05,965
Ouch!

156
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,977
Stop!

157
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,580
Jessie! Jessie!

158
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,530
- Ouch!
- Are you all right?

159
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,531
What the heck?!

160
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:17,051
Stop it, both of you!

161
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,388
Jessie, calm down. I’m so sorry.

162
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,090
Why did you apologize to her?

163
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,370
Stop!

164
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,760
Shut up, Wan.

165
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,274
Please don’t do this, okay? Both of your reputations would get ruined.

166
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,600
Didn’t you see what she did to me, Toon?

167
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,582
Are you going to take her side because she’s your actress?

168
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:35,897
What’s going on?

169
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,771
Kim, look what your friend did to me.

170
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,770
So filthy.

171
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,740
Shut up.

172
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,470
Wan, that’s enough.

173
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,102
No.

174
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,828
She stole you from me.

175
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,405
I resigned myself.

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,460
You have no rights to do anything like this.

177
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,780
Oh, so you like working with a two-faced bitch like her?

178
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,405
What did you say?

179
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:56,708
Enough!

180
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,100
Let’s go!

181
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:07,978
Kim.

182
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,338
You should think about it again.

183
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:13,633
Are you really going to move out of Wan’s place?

184
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,915
Li.

185
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:15,803
Yes?

186
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:16,733
Li.

187
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:20,853
About your breast pump.
I’ve already boil-wash it, what should I do next?

188
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,470
Jeez, just give it to me.

189
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:23,270
Here.

190
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:26,093
Look, I’m all soaked.

191
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:29,543
- I know you rushed here to see Kim.
- Yeah.

192
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:31,178
But why didn’t you get changed first?

193
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,235
Well, your shirt, it’s…

194
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,223
- The milk is…
- Let’s clean it up.

195
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:36,383
It’s all over you!

196
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:39,647
Jeez, do you really think I would have time to get changed?

197
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:43,483
I was pumping milk when I got a call from Kim and I rushed out right the way.

198
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,601
What happens between her and Wan is the most important matter right now.

199
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,493
Huh?

200
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:47,967
You heard me.

201
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,913
(sad music)

202
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,790
Please look after her for me, Mali and Mon.

203
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,733
I’m going to stay with my mother.  I don’t think I’d ever come back here again.

204
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,773
What’s the matter this time?

205
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,384
Did you guys have a serious

206
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,233
Is it so bad that you have to move out from her place?

207
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:11,601
And also go work with her arch enemy.

208
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,881
She was so rude to me.

209
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:18,973
I couldn’t take it anymore.

210
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,606
That’s it?

211
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:24,753
It was much more serious when both of you still hated each other back then.

212
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:25,841
You know, when your father…

213
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:30,593
(sad music)

214
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,498
We understand how you feel.

215
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,784
But we also want you to think about our friendship too.

216
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,378
It’s been 13 years, Kim.

217
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:51,373
Are you really going to leave her just like this?

218
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,378
I’ve moved out to live with her since our graduation.

219
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:01,903
I’ve been taking care of her for 5 years now.

220
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,710
I’ve hardly have a life of my own.

221
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:06,664
I’m tired.

222
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:10,870
Is there something you’re not telling us?

223
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,624
I want her to focus on her dream.

224
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,047
So that she could finally have her dream come true.

225
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:24,801
And not wasting her time fighting with me.

226
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,310
Please take care of her for me.

227
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:27,093
(door opening)

228
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:31,475
If you want to leave me that badly, then leave…and don’t ever come back.

229
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:33,803
- (glass shattering)
- (screaming)

230
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,813
Oh my goodness.

231
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,433
- It’s all gone.
- Wan.

232
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,103
What to do now?

233
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,133
- Wan, stop.
- Stop!

234
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,533
- Stay back.
- We’ll take care of it.

235
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:44,458
Just stay back.

236
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,853
Why are you still here?

237
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:47,441
Just go.

238
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:48,973
You have all your things packed, haven’t you?

239
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:49,853
Why did you say that?

240
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:52,303
- Jeez, what a foul mouth.
- Please calm down, Kim.

241
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:55,521
Wan is so drunk. Look at her. She’s not in her right mind right now.

242
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:57,784
Wan, apologize to her right now.

243
00:17:58,013 --> 00:17:59,803
Wan! Tell her you’re sorry!

244
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:01,183
- Kim, wait!
- Kim!

245
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:02,858
Kim, please calm down.

246
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:03,623
- Kim!
- (door opening)

247
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,018
- Kim!
- (door closing)

248
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:08,138
Damn it!

249
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,693
Wan!

250
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,395
Our 13-year friendship, it’s all gone!

251
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,432
(Breast pumping sound)

252
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:19,281
Li, can you just shut it off for a minute?

253
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:22,755
It’s so loud. So annoying.

254
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,293
Hey!

255
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,498
Slow down, will you?

256
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,413
- What?
- Go get me another bottle.

257
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,910
Fine, finish this one first.

258
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:44,618
Wan, you should’ve asked her to stay. Why did you tell her to leave?

259
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:46,904
She doesn’t want to stay

260
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,083
Why would I stop her?

261
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:49,753
(sad music)

262
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,873
But what you said to her was too harsh.

263
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:58,401
She told me that you often talk badly to her.

264
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,384
Well, that’s good for her then. I don’t want to force her to stay.

265
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:16,138
Maybe, staying apart will make things better than before.

266
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:20,673
(sad music)

267
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:39,553
[10 years ago]

268
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:40,767
Wan, my girl.

269
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:47,475
How do I look, sweetie?

270
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:52,253
Wow, you look like a movie star, Dad.

271
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,550
My girl is also pretty like a movie star.

272
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:58,721
Well said.

273
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,693
Like father, like daughter indeed.

274
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:04,703
Why are you dressing up so nicely today?

275
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,783
Tim is moving in next door. He’s going to be our neighbour.

276
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,613
So, you have to groom yourself for this occasion?

277
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:10,801
(car horn honking)

278
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,670
Easy there.

279
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:17,818
Tim.

280
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:19,647
- Tim.
- Hey.

281
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,903
How are you?

282
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:24,713
- Are you tired, driving all the way here?
- Just a bit. I’m sleepy though.

283
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:25,407
Was it far?

284
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:29,463
I’m your neighbour now.

285
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:30,413
Um

286
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,533
Tim, this is my daughter.

287
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:36,573
Oh, she’s already this big?

288
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:38,493
- Yeah, she’s grown up now.
- Very pretty too.

289
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:39,944
Oh.

290
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:41,793
- Ae?
- Hello.

291
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:42,584
Hello.

292
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:43,327
Wan.

293
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:44,390
Hello.

294
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,873
So, do you need a hand?

295
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:49,830
- It’s okay, I can handle it.
- No worry, let me help.

296
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,453
Two heads are better than one.

297
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:52,813
Okay then.

298
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:53,273
Easy there.

299
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,367
Please let me help.

300
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,601
Oh, it’s all right.

301
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:58,103
Why don’t you go help Kim instead?

302
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:04,755
(pencil case falling)

303
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,903
You dropped this.

304
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:19,973
I’m Dawan. What’s your name?

305
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:20,603
You

306
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:30,127
Wan.

307
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:32,133
Yes, Dad?

308
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,561
Can I give this cake to our neighbour?

309
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:37,658
But that’s her share, honey.

310
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:41,338
Well, she shouldn’t eat it if she wants to be an actress. It’d make her fat.

311
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,973
Mum, have Dad and Tim…

312
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,853
been this close for long?

313
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,007
Why do you ask?

314
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:01,453
It’s nothing.

315
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,641
Why are you wearing our clients’ clothes?

316
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:10,127
The client’s suit has just been adjusted so I’ve asked Mr. Pongpol to be a model for a fitting.

317
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,195
- Aren’t we like twins?
- Yeah.

318
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:15,373
Can you please take a picture for us?

319
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:16,207
(camera shutter clicking)

320
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:20,283

(a letter falling)

323
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:28,973
I’m sorry.

324
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:29,652
(sad music)

325
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:30,583
From now on…

326
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:34,800
I want to live the life the way I’ve always wanted to.

327
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:38,595
All the money…

328
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:40,573
(weeping)

329
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:41,624
and every piece of property,

330
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,463
are my last gift to you.

331
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:46,138
(Wan picking up the letter)

332
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:51,773
Please set me free and respect my choice.

333
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:57,681

[a message written by Pongpol]

338
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:42,767
You have to stay strong for your mother.

339
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:47,593
(crying)

340
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:51,715
(crying)

341
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:38,790
She’d be so mad whenever I mention about her father.

342
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:42,401
Um

343
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:47,407
What happened to both your and her family is very terrible.

344
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:51,441
Kim hates it to her guts.

345
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,287
No matter what, you have to find a way to bring her back.

346
00:24:56,687 --> 00:25:00,927
I really don’t trust that Jessie girl.

347
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:02,915
Kim is clever.

348
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,235
She can survive there.

349
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:07,098
(sad music)

350
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:12,378
She’ll probably be better off than when she was working with me.

351
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:14,378
That might be true.

352
00:25:16,143 --> 00:25:23,087
But like what Jessie said, without her, you might not be able to make your dream come true.

353
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:29,818
Don’t forget that Kim has played a big part to make you become so famous today.

354
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,230
Both in your work and personal life.

355
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:35,064
So, don’t ever let her go.

356
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,435

- Take it easy.

🎵Counting down to the day we’d meet🎵

360
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:19,265
🎵Missing those time we spent together🎵

361
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:29,185
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream. The dream that can never…🎵

362
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:32,225
🎵…come true.🎵
She always talks badly to me.

363
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:35,182
🎵I want to cherish all the moments…🎵
I can’t take it anymore.

364
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:38,725
🎵And memorise every second…🎵

365
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:46,435
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to love you in real life🎵
Since our graduation, I’ve moved out to live with her and taken care of her for 5 years now.

366
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:49,970
I’ve hardly had a life of my own. I’m tired.

367
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:20,025
I really don’t want you to leave.

368
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,182
Why are you so cruel to me?

369
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,290
Trust me, Wan.

370
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:30,942
This is the best for both of us.

371
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,702
How so?

372
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:41,387
I don’t think I’d be able to survive it a life without you.

373
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:45,125
Why did you leave me?

374
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:48,225
(crying)

375
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:53,490
I have my own reason.

376
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:58,085
Can you tell me?

377
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,273
You’ll know when the time comes.

378
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:05,685
(crying)

379
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,336
But for now, I really want you to knowâ€¦

380
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,965
that you’ll always have my best wishes.

381
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:12,305
(crying)

382
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:17,065
(crying)

383
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,862
Dawan.

384
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:24,985
(water dripping)

385
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:52,519
Huh, Jessie?

386
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,650
And Kim!

387
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:09,505
Hi, Mum. Please look after the baby for me. I have something urgent to take care of. Yes. Okay. Thank you, Mum.

388
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,885
It’s mission time for Natasha Romanoff.

389
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,553
Hmm, we’re here quite early.

390
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:32,439
Let’s find something to eat then.

391
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:43,273
Oh! It’s good that I’ve watched a lot of detective movies.

392
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,587
I’ll take my kid to play with you next time.

393
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,673
I’ve been thinking…

394
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:54,587
Apart from being my stylist,

395
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:57,890
I also want you to be my personal manager

396
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,759
What do you think? Can you do it?

397
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:03,833
I’d double the salary for you.

398
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,165
I don’t have any problem with that…

399
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,905
as long as you keep your promise.

400
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:10,953
Ahh, about the clip?

401
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,713
What clip?

402
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:23,285
Can you give me something that helps increase my breast milk? I’m still breast feeding my baby.

403
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:24,679
- Just a moment, please.
- Thank you.

404
00:30:25,696 --> 00:30:31,785
So, are you and Wan more than just friends?

405
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:33,559
We’re close friends.

406
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:35,505
Close friends?

407
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,182
Hmm.

408
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:43,905
By the way, I was watching this clip…

409
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,119
over and over again this morning

410
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:49,422
You both don’t look like close friends in this clip.

411
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:57,010
You were eating ice-cream and it got on your face so she licked it off for you.

412
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:59,615
Is that what friends usually do?

413
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:01,193
She was just teasing me.

414
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,793
Teasing?

415
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:06,393
Imagine if this clip is posted on social media.

416
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:10,782
That’d be horrible, isn’t it? Wan has just become famous after that one series she’d starred in.

417
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,399
Too bad she’d be out of favour so soon.

418
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:18,705
I know the society these days is more open to the girls love idea.

419
00:31:18,705 --> 00:31:25,033
But imagine a rising female star involving in this kind of scandal – it’s the end for her.

420
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,735
All the presenter, event, and modelling works…

421
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:32,599
that she has done with her male co-star will be cancelled.

422
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:34,633
Just by thinking about it makes me feel so desperate for her.

423
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,250
I already agreed to work for you.

424
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,633
So, you must not send this clip to anyone.

425
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:44,725
Does she know how much you’ve sacrificed yourself for her?

426
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:47,582
I’m so glad I can take you away from her.

427
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,776
And even make her go nuts.

428
00:31:50,553 --> 00:31:51,250
(smashing the table)

429
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:54,633
I knew it! Kim is doing this to protect Wan.

430
00:31:57,285 --> 00:32:00,462
I’m begging you. Please delete the clip.

431
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:02,976
And I’ll do anything you want me to do.

432
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:04,782
I’m going to keep it for a while.

433
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:09,490
Just in case if she’s rude to me again in the future.

434
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:13,650
This clip will be all over the internet.

435
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:15,045
Check, please.

436
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,496
Is it done?

437
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:21,239
Let’s get to work.

438
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,627
Damn it! No battery! Why now?!

439
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,215
No matter what, I have to clear this up with Kim today…

440
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:42,725
since my mum is taking care of my kid anyway.

441
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,947
Can I have the bill, please?

442
00:32:47,662 --> 00:32:48,610
Thank you.

443
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,159
- Can I scan to pay?
- Yes.

444
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:56,985
- Jeez, my battery is out. Umm, can I borrow your charger, please?
- Of course.

445
00:32:57,867 --> 00:32:58,655
Jeez.

446
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,713
Jessie, I need to go to the toilet first.

447
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,507
- I’ll see you upstairs then.
- Okay.

448
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:17,102
Hey! Excuse me, who are you?

449
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:18,210
It’s me.

450
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:19,913
Mali!

451
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:30,793
Why are you here? Is there anything wrong?

452
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:36,290
Yes, why do you have to sacrifice so much for Wan?

453
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:39,513
What are you talking about?

454
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:44,473
I overheard your conversation with Jessie.

455
00:33:44,496 --> 00:33:46,393
You were eavesdropping us?

456
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:47,639
Yes.

457
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:51,250
Now tell me, why did you do that?

458
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:55,479
If you keep giving in just because she’s holding an upper hand,

459
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:57,547
she would only get worse.

460
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,913
It’s because she’s holding an upper hand…

461
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,165
that leaves me with no choice.

462
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,342
But I think if you tell Wan about the truth,

463
00:34:08,073 --> 00:34:09,025
she’d be able to help you.

464
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,130
No, you cannot do that

465
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,656
If Wan knows, she’d probably go strangle Jessie.

466
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:14,632
Jessie would then send out the clip.

467
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:15,913
Fine!

468
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:22,325
Then, should I steal Jessi’s phone and delete the clip?

469
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:26,793
I want to do that too.

470
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:31,719
But do you really think Jessie only keeps it on her phone?

471
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:34,050
You’re right.

472
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,919
I really want to see Wan succeeded in her career.

473
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:46,667
Starring in a Hollywood movie...

474
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,342
has always been her dream all along.

475
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:54,176
If what I’m doing now can help make her dream come true,

476
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,187
then I’m more than willing to do it.

477
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:02,610
I don’t want Wan to lose to Jessie and quit being an actress.

478
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,193
If that happens, Wan would be so disappointed.

479
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:19,822
How long do you think you have to keep doing this?

480
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:25,707
Well…until Wan gets her role in this Hollywood movie.

481
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:30,199
Jeez, Kim!

482
00:35:30,347 --> 00:35:32,165
Have you ever done anything for yourself?

483
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:33,890
It’s always for Wan. Seriously.

484
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:37,982
Don’t worry about me, Mali.

485
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,599
Look at it in a good way.

486
00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:44,507
Having me staying close to her arch enemy is actually a good thing.

487
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:47,799
If Jessie plans to play dirty on Wan,

488
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:50,267
I’d be the first one to know.

489
00:35:50,793 --> 00:35:53,045
And I can help watch over her back too.

490
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:56,355
(Sigh)

491
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:59,490
This is the best for both of us.

492
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,239
Fine, if that’s what you want.

493
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:06,679
Thank you, Mali.

494
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:09,399
You’re welcome.

495
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:15,113
But I think you better go home now.

496
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:17,707
What? Are you telling me to bugger off?

497
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:20,427
Your baby is probably hungry right now.

498
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,902
Neh, it’s fine. My mum is taking care of the baby for me.

499
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:30,130
- But…your milk is spilling out.
- Oh!

500
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:31,536
Oh my goodness.

501
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,902
Has it been like this for long?

502
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:37,467
- Yeah.
- Why didn’t you tell me earlier? Did anyone see it?

503
00:36:40,153 --> 00:36:41,742
Now, it got stuck. Jeez!

504
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:54,515
Miss Wan.

505
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,015
Where’s Mum?

506
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:57,829
She’s inside.

507
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:38,755
Wan.

508
00:37:39,463 --> 00:37:40,240
Mum.

509
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,069
Aren’t you lonely eating alone like this?

510
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:16,766
It’s lonely

511
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:19,372
but I can deal with it.

512
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:23,783
We all must learn to live alone.

513
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,320
Because in the end…

514
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,652
nobody can stay with us forever.

515
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,223
You’re amazing, Mum.

516
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,800
I wish I could be like you one day.

517
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,715
Aren’t you busy today? How come you can visit me?

518
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:51,235
I’m lonely.

519
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,223
I can hardly sleep when I’m alone.

520
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,612
I have to keep taking pills.

521
00:38:58,526 --> 00:39:00,355
Can I come stay with you for a while?

522
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:02,480
I’m...

523
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,680
Do you want to go see the auntie doctor?

524
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:07,269
I’ve been doing better for quite some time.

525
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:09,897
I don’t want to go back and keep seeing the doctor again.

526
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:19,029
I’ve become so strong these days…

527
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:20,857
all because of the auntie doctor.

528
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,366
And I truly believe you will get better soon.

529
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:30,663
Have you eaten?

530
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:33,829
Do you want me to order anything for you?

531
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:39,235
Eating yummy food can help make you feel better.

532
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:03,355
The job is already done for quite a while.

533
00:41:03,355 --> 00:41:04,766
But you still haven’t settled the payment.

534
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:08,606
I won’t be able to pay my daily labours then.

535
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:10,915
They also have a family to feed.

536
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,585
Can you please hurry up?

537
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:14,229
Yes.

538
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:25,177
Kim!

539
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:27,657
Awww.

540
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:30,012
When did you arrive?

541
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:32,880
Since last night.

542
00:41:33,246 --> 00:41:34,545
But I didn’t see you back then.

543
00:41:34,545 --> 00:41:39,440
I was finishing up late so I decided to stay over at the hotel.

544
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:42,560
Do you need my help?

545
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:44,515
No, it’s all right.

546
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:49,863
Just a confirmation on the setting up date at the hotel.

547
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:53,285
And some flowers to buy, that’s all.

548
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:55,488
How long are you going to stay this time?

549
00:41:55,605 --> 00:41:57,886
I saw a big luggage upstairs.

550
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,909
- Huh
- Hmm.

551
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:02,595
You and Wan fought again, didn’t you?

552
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:05,212
Hmm.

553
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,069
I’m not working for Wan anymore, Mum.

554
00:42:14,503 --> 00:42:15,223
There, there.

555
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:19,985
Haven’t I told you that

556
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:22,812
it’s normal to come across this kind of quarrel when you’re working with your friend?

557
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:27,269
Why don’t you just take some time to calm down and clear it up?

558
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:30,012
I’ll think about it later.

559
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:32,640
I really want to rest right now.

560
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:36,526
How’s your work?

561
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:39,909
You look stressed.

562
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,835
Small wedding studios are popping up like mushrooms these days, so they are doing a lot of fierce promotions.

563
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:52,960
Our studio is affected by that too.

564
00:42:55,335 --> 00:42:58,012
Don’t worry, everything will be all right

565
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:03,989
Maybe, it’s better that you and Wan stay apart sometimes.

566
00:43:04,046 --> 00:43:08,126
So that you’ll have time to look after yourself and get yourself a lover.

567
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,629
Oh, I’m not worried about that.

568
00:43:13,497 --> 00:43:16,400
Better hurry up. Nothing stays forever.

569
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:21,657
I also want you to have someone to look after you..

570
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:24,615
So that you can take over this studio for me.

571
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,263
Why are you saying that?

572
00:43:29,932 --> 00:43:33,155
All my life, I’ve always arranged weddings for my clients.

573
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:36,055
Now, I want to arrange one for my own daughter too.

574
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:40,983
So, don’t take too long or else I’d die first.

575
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:45,200
Come on, Mum.

576
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:49,006
You know I don’t need a lover.

577
00:43:49,715 --> 00:43:51,097
I can just stay with you like this.

578
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:53,200
It makes me so happy.

579
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:55,909
Awwww.

580
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:56,560
Okay then.

581
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:05,497
Mum, is Aunt Mon going to sell her house?

582
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,863
Well, nobody lives there.

583
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:14,485
Wan stays at her flat.

584
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,103
And Mon is living at her mother’s place.

585
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:22,515
They probably don’t want to be surrounded by the atmosphere which reminds them of the past.

586
00:44:30,572 --> 00:44:31,840
If I had a choice,

587
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,120
I would have done the same.

588
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:53,109
Yes, Jessie?

589
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:56,995
Kim, can you pick me up at my place at 9 tomorrow morning?

590
00:44:56,995 --> 00:45:01,737
Don’t forget to grab me an iced Americano with no sugar and a freshly baked croissant.

591
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:06,526
Oh, and on the way here, also stop by to get my bag at the spa shop near Siam.

592
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,412
But that’s completely an opposite direction to your place.

593
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,926
Can I get your bag after work?

594
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,395
Then you should get up earlier.

595
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:16,777
You know what will happen to Wan if you don’t do it, right?

596
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,486
I gotta go. Need to get a laser done.

597
00:46:23,452 --> 00:46:24,869
Just like what Mum said.

598
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:30,595
Being back at the old place only reminds you of the past.

599
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:19,135
My Marvellous Dream Is You.

600
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:21,806
Please behave here, okay?

601
00:47:21,932 --> 00:47:23,372
Hi, Dawan.

602
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,565
Don’t tell me you’re also here to take an acting class?

603
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:29,075
It’s an acting academy, do you think I’m here for a scuba diving?

604
00:47:29,085 --> 00:47:31,829
Kim, can you help me take off my shoes?

605
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:34,915
If you’re ready, let’s get started.

606
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,805
What do you think about when you say the number out loud?

607
00:47:38,805 --> 00:47:41,257
I just think about the number.

608
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,015
Toon, I ordered this for you.

609
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:44,663
How do you know I like Latte?

610
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:49,017
What is it that you want to talk to me?

611
00:47:49,543 --> 00:47:52,023
Just tell me, what did you dream of?

612
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,446
Dokrak, I want you to be Wan’s stylist.

613
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,665
Dawan is here!

614
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:01,200
Kim!

615
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:11,124
