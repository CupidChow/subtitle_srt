1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,980
Are you on your way? Please drive safely.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,920
[Hurry up, Wan. The ocean is very beautiful.]
Kim, I can’t go now.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,190
Excuse me, did you get hurt?

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,630
Do you like to paint?

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,260
If you’re free, please stop by at my gallery.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,240
Yes, Wan?

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,520
Can you come back now? Dokrak couldn’t understand what I really want.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,800
I’m going to find a job.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,560
Who will you work for?

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,880
Mr. Marwin, someone needs to see you.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,110
Who is it?

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,260
She told me to not hire you, Kimhan.

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,140
My Marvellous Dream Is You

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,870
I wonder why she can decide what you’d do with your life.

28
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,080
What is she to you?

29
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,770
Someone important to her much enough to do that.

30
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,480
Are you her girlfriend?

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,830
Well, she’s…

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,530
a friend.

33
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,340
A friend?

34
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,630
Close friend.

35
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,230
Close friend?

36
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,160
Very close.

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,440
I see.

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,530
We know each other well.

39
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,870
We’ve been through a lot together.

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,490
If you really know me, then you wouldn’t have done this.

41
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,490
I’m really sorry, Marwin.

42
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,270
My friend has been rude to you.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,830
It’s okay, I understand.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,670
Can you excuse us for a while?

45
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,470
Please take your time.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,380
Didn’t we talk about this? You seemed to be very understanding last night.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,000
Why are you doing this?

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,850
I almost got your point.

49
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,290
But after I had slept on it, I just realized I actually didn’t get it.

50
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,690
Wan.

51
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,700
When you were working for Jessie,

52
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,980
I was always worried whether she’d take good care of you.

53
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,650
After we finished school, you’ve never worked with anyone but me.

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,280
What if he overworks you here?

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,320
Will you be happy?

56
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,770
That’s why I don’t want you to work for someone else.

57
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,350
But that’s what you thought.

58
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,780
Well, that’s because…

59
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,790
Because I’m worried about you.

60
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,610
Well, thank you.

61
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,590
But don’t you want me to experience something new in life?

62
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,050
I don’t know whether working here would be good or not.

63
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,330
But at least I get to decide it for myself.

64
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,950
I totally agree with her.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,820
Rather than stopping her, you should support your friend instead.

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,980
Art is something that she loves.

67
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,030
And you should know better than anyone…

68
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,790
how happy she is when she gets to paint.

69
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,540
Wait, you’ve seen her painted before?

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,780
The new friend I met at the beach that I told you about is him.

71
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,540
Were you the one who took her out drinking?

72
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,890
Did you try to get close to her because she was alone?

73
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,180
Did you take any advantage on her?

74
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,660
Wan.

75
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,050
Enough, Wan. You’re insulting both me and Marwin.

76
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,110
He took you out drinking, so much that you got a hangover.

77
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,460
It’s as if he was trying to make you drunk.

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,390
Is this the kind of person I could trust you to be working with?

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,940
Okay, fine.

80
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,720
I’m not going to work here.

81
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,400
Really?

82
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,570
I’m really sorry, Marwin.

83
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,570
Please excuse me.

84
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,750
Kim. Kim! Let’s go get something to eat.

85
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,500
Or should we go to Mon’s restaurant? We can ask her chef to prepare the food for us.

86
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,790
Let’s ask Mali too.

87
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,750
If you want to eat anything, go anywhere, or do anything just do it.

88
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,540
But do it alone. I’m not going with you.

89
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,420
I’m not going back to your place either.

90
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,020
(Car braking/stopping)

91
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,730
Oh, Kim.

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,780
Let me help.

93
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,480
I just got off  work, so I stopped by for groceries.

94
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,350
I didn’t know you’d come home today so I didn’t get anything for you.

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,670
Do you want to eat anything? I’ll order it for you.

96
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,570
It’s all right, Mum.

97
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,320
Can I stay here tonight?

98
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,500
Of course.

99
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,170
Let me help put them away.

100
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,170
Why did you buy a lot of vegetables?

101
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,770
I’ve been working hard lately so I need to take good care of myself.

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,290
How’s your work?

103
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,850
I’m jobless right now.

104
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,130
I’m looking for a job.

105
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,700
So, I’m quite free.

106
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,570
If you want to go anywhere, please let me know.

107
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,620
I want to tag along.

108
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,160
At your age, you should’ve been clinging to your lover not your mother.

109
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,880
I know you’re not in a hurry but I am.

110
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,850
All of my friends already have grandchildren.

111
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,600
But you don’t need to have babies for me.

112
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,780
I just want you to get married, okay?

113
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,660
Not again, Mum. Why do you keep bringing this up so often lately?

114
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,580
Well, you’re almost 30 now. And you’re so pretty too.

115
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,870
Mum, are you all right?

116
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,170
I’m okay. I’ll just get some rest.

117
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,410
I didn’t do dishes, didn’t take out trash, and didn’t make my bed.

118
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,700
If you still don’t come home, it’ll be a disaster soon.

119
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,200
Aaaah!

120
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,620
[I’m not going back. I’m staying with my mum.]

121
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,110
Aaaah!

122
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,480
I’m not going back there either. I’m staying with my mum.

123
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,820
Close the car door for me.

124
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,670
Why can’t I open it?

125
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,550
Umm, you have to pull.

126
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,170
Miss Wan.

127
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,770
Why are you so surprised? Do I look like a ghost?

128
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,810
I’m sorry. Miss Mon didn’t tell me you’d be here.

129
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,180
How could she? I didn’t tell her.

130
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,580
Where’s she, by the way?

131
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,910
She’s resting in her room.

132
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,940
Another hangover again.

133
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,660
Yes.

134
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,050
Just get on with your work.

135
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,610
Can I give this slice of cake to our neighbour?

136
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,810
But that’s your daughter’s share.

137
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:26,580
I’m sorry. From now on, I’m going to live my life the way I want to.

138
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,800
Please give me freedom and let me be my own self.

139
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,110
My mother wanted me to go study abroad. But I decided to date your father instead.

140
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,250
Then I got pregnant so we had to get married.

141
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,170
(Glass shattering)

142
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,390
Mum!

143
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,580
Mum!

144
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,710
Mum!

145
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,240
Help! Is anyone there? Help!

146
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,100
Help!

147
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,920
Mum!

148
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,850
Anyone! Please help!

149
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,770
Mum.

150
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,790
Mum.

151
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,480
Mum.

152
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,050
M’lady!

153
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,540
Mum.

154
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,550
Mum.

155
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,310
Mum.

156
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,970
(Coughing)

157
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,800
Mum.

158
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,220
Mum.

159
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,220
Mum.

160
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,680
Drink some hot tea first.

161
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,880
Wan.

162
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,130
I’m sorry.

163
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,120
When Dad left us, you also drank a lot.

164
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,360
So much that I thought I might also lose you too.

165
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,210
But you had therapy and already got better.

166
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,530
What makes you start drinking again?

167
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,440
It’s my fault.

168
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,930
I couldn’t stop myself.

169
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,650
Remember when I told you that

170
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,010
that we must try to be happy on our own.

171
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,340
But I can’t, Wan. I’ve tried but I failed.

172
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,610
It’s all right, Mum.

173
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,900
You were able to quit drinking once.

174
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,730
Let’s try it again and go through it together.

175
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,470
Just like when I’m sad, you’d call the auntie doctor for me.

176
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,510
You’d always console me and tell me we’d go through it together.

177
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,540
We both are tough girls.

178
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,480
I promise I’ll take good care of myself.

179
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,380

My Marvellous Dream Is You

183
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:43,666
(Door knocking)

184
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,986
Mum, I’m going in.

185
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,806
(Door opening)

186
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,056
(Door closing)

187
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,236
Mum.

188
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:00,666
Mum, I bring you food.

189
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:02,496
You didn’t go down to eat.

190
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,436
(Throwing up)

191
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:57,306
You can hurry up a bit though. Nothing is certain.

192
00:18:57,526 --> 00:19:02,616
I want you to have someone who can look after you.

193
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,206
I’ve arranged a lot of weddings for many people.

194
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:09,066
Now, I want to arrange a wonderful one for my daughter too.

195
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:14,106
Don’t wait until I’m dead.

196
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:18,026
Kim...

197
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,756
Why are you taking a lot of pills?

198
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,016
What’s wrong with you?

199
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,406
Are you hiding something?

200
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:45,396
I…

201
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:48,666
I have a stage-2 cancer.

202
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:08,246
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

203
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:22,526
I don’t want you to worry about me.

204
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,836
I won’t let you leave me like this.

205
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,146
You have to stay with me.

206
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:49,446
Right now…

207
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:52,276
I’m…

208
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:54,756
going under treatment.

209
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:03,196
The doctor said I’m lucky to notice it at an early stage.

210
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:06,246
My dear.

211
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,236
Don’t you worry about me, sweetie.

212
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,546
You must not give up.

213
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:24,796
I’m going to stay with you.

214
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:26,986
I’m going to fight it with you.

215
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,436
So, don’t leave me, Mum.

216
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:56,956
[Dawan]

217
00:23:56,956 --> 00:24:00,106
- [Dawan] / - No, I shouldn’t bother her with this.

218
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,896
Then how could I pay the daily staff?

219
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:15,116
They are already living from hand to mouth.

220
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:20,536
I want you to have someone who can look after you.

221
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,476
You can hurry up a bit though. Nothing is certain.

222
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:36,086
Hello, Toon. I’m here. I’m going in.

223
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:37,046
See you.

224
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:39,926
Damn!

225
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:42,876
(Phone ringing)

226
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:43,836
- [Kimhan]
- (Phone ringing)

227
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:44,606
Kim.

228
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:47,926
Hey, Kim.

229
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:50,446
Are you coming back to our place tonight?

230
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:52,206
I have something to talk to you.

231
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:54,476
I can’t right now.

232
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:56,266
I have to stay with Mum.

233
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,966
I called because I have something to tell you.

234
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:04,226
Why do you sound so serious?

235
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:06,776
I got a job.

236
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:09,036
What job?

237
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:11,066
At Marwin’s gallery.

238
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:13,186
He agreed to hire me.

239
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:17,946
You seemed so humiliated yesterday when I was behaving like that.

240
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,896
Why do you still want to work with him?

241
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,516
I need money.

242
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,156
So I have to work.

243
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:34,916
Hey…you can always tell me if it’s about money.

244
00:25:35,106 --> 00:25:36,996
How much do you need? Just name the amount.

245
00:25:37,256 --> 00:25:38,236
No, Wan.

246
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:41,306
I should try to take care of it myself.

247
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:43,916
I just want you to support me and give me encouragement.

248
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:46,516
Can you do that?

249
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:52,526
But why do you have to work with that Marvel guy?

250
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:55,486
His name is Marwin.

251
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:56,446
Whatever.

252
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:57,986
Kim.

253
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,226
I don’t like him.

254
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:04,066
He can’t be trusted.

255
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:07,126
This is my first day at work.

256
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:08,446
I have to go.

257
00:26:19,756 --> 00:26:20,466
Wan.

258
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:22,636
They will start in an hour.

259
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:23,516
Go get your makeup done.

260
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:34,416
This is your work space.

261
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:47,016
These are the lookbooks of young designers
whose work will be displayed in this exhibition.

262
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:52,786
Hmm…

263
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:58,026
So, you want to collaborate art and fashion under the equality concept?

264
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,216
That’s right.

265
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,906
Since you’re now our creative director,

266
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:08,086
I’ll let you decide whose works you want to display in the exhibition.

267
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:12,316
I also want you to help come up with the name of this exhibition.

268
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:13,796
Sure.

269
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:19,046
I hope you’ll be happy here.

270
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:23,456
Oh.

271
00:27:24,296 --> 00:27:27,586
And if you ever want to have your work displayed here,

272
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:29,496
You can always let me know.

273
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,196
Win.

274
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:45,856
Yes?

275
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:50,686
What if…I want to submit my designs for this exhibition too?

276
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:53,786
And if someone happens to be interested in buying my work,

277
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,186
will I also get paid for my share?

278
00:27:58,686 --> 00:27:59,816
Of course, you will.

279
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:05,946
Then, I’ll also submit my designs for this event.

280
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:09,036
Please do.

281
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:12,486
Thank you.

282
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:18,386
Thank you for never turning down my request.

283
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:22,766
Even though my friend was so rude to you.

284
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,366
Oh, it doesn’t matter at all.

285
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:26,836
Actually, your friend is quite funny.

286
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,776
So…

287
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,166
It’s a pleasure to be working with you.

288
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:35,116
My pleasure too.

289
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:40,156
Please make yourself at home.

290
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:16,926
No, I must not bother her like this.

291
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:24,266
- [Marwin]
- (Phone ringing)

292
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:25,426
Hello, Marwin.

293
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:28,796
Can you…

294
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:33,976
give me another chance to apply for a job there?

295
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:47,146
Why do you put in so much chilli?

296
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,126
Isn’t it spicy?

297
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:52,046
I can hardly taste anything these days. Probably because of the chemotherapy.

298
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,606
(Phone buzzing)

299
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:57,296
(Phone buzzing)

300
00:29:58,126 --> 00:29:58,876
Hello?

301
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:03,786
(Hello, Miss Ae. About the hotel of the wedding couple today.)

302
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:07,096
(What time can the crew go in?)

303
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:11,866
Oh, well…I’m going to go there and take care of it.

304
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:15,886
(The crew are now waiting for confirmation.)

305
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:19,706
Okay, I’ll be right there in half an hour.

306
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:21,306
Yes.

307
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:29,336
You should rest a bit, Mum.

308
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,296
Oh, I can’t do that.

309
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:38,396
What about the crew? And the daily staff? I have to look after them.

310
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:45,316
How about this? I promise I’ll take good care of myself.

311
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:46,406
Okay?

312
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:51,036
Now, eat up so you can go to work.

313
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:51,686
Okay.

314
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:59,636
Wan! Where are you going?

315
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:00,966
I need to take care of something.

316
00:31:02,046 --> 00:31:07,146
She looks much happier working here than when she was working with you.

Thank you so much, Pat.

- I’ll let you know as soon as I know the broadcasting date.
- Sure.

337
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,326
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

338
00:33:17,326 --> 00:33:18,576
It was so good.

339
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:21,696
Oh, Wan. Wait a minute. Please let us take some photos.

340
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:23,426
It’d only take a minute.

341
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:26,106
- No problem.
- Thank you, Toon.

342
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:26,956
Are you ready?

343
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:29,016
Okay, that’s it.

344
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:31,706
Both of you were so adorable during the interview today.

345
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:36,566
If they become a real couple, please let us be the first to have an interview with them.

346
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:37,756
Absolutely. You got it.

Wan, please wait a second.

349

- Okay

350
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:51,776
Wan! Where are you going?

351
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,076
I need to take care of something.

352
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:55,016
We have to go for a fitting after this.

353
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:57,586
Dokrak already has the dress fixed.

354
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:59,026
I’m leaving then. I’m in a rush.

Hey.

00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:02,176

00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:04,306
Over there.

359
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:05,546
See you then.

360
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,076
Wan!

361
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:14,436
Wan!

362
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,106
Wan!

363
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:19,776
Wan!

364
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,186
Wan!

365
00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:22,656
Wan!

366
00:34:23,596 --> 00:34:24,296
Wait up.

367
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:30,466
I want to show you my support.

368
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:34,326
I hope one day your name will be on the Hollywood’s Hall of Fame.

369
00:34:36,246 --> 00:34:37,186
Beautiful, isn’t it?

370
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:39,906
Umm, yeah.

371
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:43,166
Wan.

372
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,056
I have something to tell you.

373
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:50,866
I want you to know that…

374
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:52,506
Yes?

375
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:53,806
I…

376
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:05,896
Wan!

377
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,426
- Let’s talk later, Pat.
- Wan!

378
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:09,786
Your forgot the gift!

379
00:35:48,976 --> 00:35:50,646
So, tell me.

380
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,826
You’re unbelievable.

381
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,036
You can start being bossy the moment you walked in here.

382
00:35:56,506 --> 00:35:58,306
I don’t see anything wrong with her.

383
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:00,416
She just sits there drawing, thinking about the painting’s name.

384
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:02,776
- Just sitting there smiling.
- Aha.

385
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:04,356
Smiling?

386
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:05,936
Yeah, smiling.

387
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:11,526
She looks much happier working here than when she was working with you.

388
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:13,996
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

389
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:16,726
We’ve been here since morning. It’s so boring.

390
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:18,686
Why did you want us to come? There’s nothing here?

391
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:20,036
I don’t see her doing anything but drawing.

392
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:23,036
I had to ask my mum to look after my baby for me. Let’s go.

393
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:23,786
Let’s go.

394
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:24,546
stand up

395
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,746
No.

396
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:30,596
I’m free today. I’ll wait until she gets off work.

397
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:32,686
- What?!
- Jeez!

398
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:42,756
Hi, Kim.

399
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:49,056
Wan, I’m not a child.

400
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:52,136
I don’t need a parent to come and pick me up.

401
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:54,066
Let’s go.

402
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:55,556
No.

403
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:58,146
I’ll be your bodyguard, Kim.

404
00:36:58,486 --> 00:36:59,906
If any day that I’m busy,

405
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:02,456
I’ll ask Mon and Mali to watch over you instead.

406
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:10,046
Wait, watch over her? Do I have to take her to the toilet too?

407
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:12,446
Next, I might have to wipe her butt after she’s done with her business.

408
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:16,076
Wait, Kim is not your baby.

409
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:17,836
You don’t have to go that far.

410
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:21,016
Well, look at what Wan wants us to do. Kim is pretty much like our baby then.

411
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:22,336
- Look.
- Yeah.

412
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:23,776
That’s enough.

413
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:26,586
You guys should go now.

414
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:28,786
Okay.

415
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:30,816
Please, Wan.

416
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:33,386
Please go back.

417
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,136
I can’t work when you all are around like this.

418
00:37:45,216 --> 00:37:46,506
Why did you do this?

419
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,116
Haven’t we talked about it already?

420
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:52,566
What if Marwin saw you guys here?

421
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:56,126
He might say that I bring an outsider to my work place.

422
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,296
Also, if I can’t get my work done in time,

423
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:01,206
I might be fired.

424
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,966
Do you want that to happen?

425
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:06,236
Firing you on your first day?

426
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:07,586
Wouldn’t that be too unkind?

427
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:09,596
What are you all doing here?

428
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:14,066
- Hello, Kim’s friends.
- Hello.       \      - Hello.

429
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,606
Hello, Dawan.

430
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:19,706
I’m so sorry, Marwin.

431
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:21,666
My friends are just passing by.

432
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:22,926
So, they came to say hi.

433
00:38:23,056 --> 00:38:24,246
Oh, yes.

434
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,496
- Please make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

435
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,126
Here, it’s for you.

436
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:29,646
Thank you.

437
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,236
Would you like something to drink too?

438
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,186
Oh, that’d be nice. What do you want?

439
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,396
-  Americano, please.
- Oh, no need.

440
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:38,916
They’re leaving anyway.

441
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:40,146
I’m not.

442
00:38:41,396 --> 00:38:42,346
You should go, Wan.

443
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:44,626
Hey

444
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:47,036
Mr. Marvel.

445
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:53,246
I mean Marwin.

446
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:55,326
Can I have a word with you?

447
00:38:56,006 --> 00:38:56,696
Wan.

448
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:58,846
You stay here.

449
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:17,706
(Phone ringing)

450
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:19,066
(Phone ringing)

451
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,386
Jeez, Wan! What is it now? I’m getting annoyed.

452
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:26,016
I’m telling you,

453
00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:29,556
if my baby’s growth and development is slow, it’s all because of you!

454
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:31,396
Stop separating a mother from her baby!

455
00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:36,876
Do you know I had to switch from selling an Omakase to a buffet one? It’s all because of you!

456
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:42,106
Stop dragging me around. If my restaurant is closed down, I’ll blame it all on you!

457
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:46,596
Chef! We’re out of fried rice! Hurry up, a lot of customers are waiting!

458
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,476
I heard you! Be right there!

459
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:50,096
I have to go.

460
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:51,436
Jeez!

461
00:39:56,046 --> 00:39:59,226
(Phone ringing)

462
00:39:59,486 --> 00:40:01,086
(Phone ringing)

463
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:03,596
Wan...

464
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:07,046
Wan, what did you talk about with Marwin?

465
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:10,486
I think he wants something from you.

466
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:14,476
I work for him, and in return he’ll pay me.

467
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:18,606
He wants my work, and I get paid for doing it. Isn’t that how it should be?

468
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,326
But I don’t trust him.

469
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:24,256
He seems suspicious.

470
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,476
Don’t be so pessimistic.

471
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,096
From what I’ve been talking to him,

472
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:32,896
he seems really nice. Nothing suspicious at all.

473
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:35,596
You’ve only got to know him.

474
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,486
Why are you trying to defend him now?

475
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,656
What did he do to you?

476
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,986
Why are you so against him?

477
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:47,356
What if that Marvel guy…

478
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:48,986
thinks of you more than just a friend?

479
00:40:52,046 --> 00:40:53,676
He has the right to think all he wants.

480
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:57,106
If anyone will be interested in me, I can’t stop them.

481
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:01,196
But I said, ‘What if’.

482
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:03,196
He surely wouldn’t think of you like that.

483
00:41:05,956 --> 00:41:10,706
Oh, about my award event tomorrow, will you come?

484
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:12,326
I’ll have Toon picked you up.

485
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:14,366
Did you forget something?

486
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:17,016
I already have a full-time job.

487
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:21,816
Also, Dokrak is now your personal stylist.

488
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,686
What should I be if I go there with you?

489
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:28,226
You can go there as my close companion.

490
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,386
You don’t have to go there as my stylist.

491
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:33,386
Toon said we shouldn’t be seen together, remember?

492
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,006
Don’t come here again, Wan.

493
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:37,996
No matter what, I will not change my mind.

494
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:40,346
I’m going to work with Marwin.

495
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:45,076
When you said you were in need of money,

496
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:46,686
was that just an excuse?

497
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:50,216
You actually want to spend time with that Marvel guy, don’t you?

498
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:53,046
Wan

499
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:55,906
if that’s all you can think of, then so be it.

500
00:41:57,136 --> 00:41:58,836
Let’s just stay on our own way from now on.

501
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:03,366
Please stop bothering me and messing up with my life.

502
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:08,226
Why has everything changed so fast?

503
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,036
Anything can change, Wan.

504
00:42:15,376 --> 00:42:16,966
Nothing in life is certain.

505
00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:36,036
Marwin.

506
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:38,446
What did you and Dawan talk about?

507
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:39,716
Do you like him?

508
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:41,876
You don’t have to worry.

509
00:42:42,466 --> 00:42:44,026
I’ll take very good care of her.

My Marvellous Dream Is You

512
00:43:47,654 --> 00:43:48,514
Kim.

513
00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:55,104
Your friends are so sweet.

514
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,374
They even came all the way here to support you.

515
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:04,204
I’m so sorry my friends came here and made a fuss at your gallery.

516
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:06,364
I already gave them an earful.

517
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:09,744
I promise it won’t happen again.

518
00:44:10,824 --> 00:44:12,174
It’s all right, Kim.

519
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:15,634
Please excuse me then. I have a business to attend to.

520
00:44:22,654 --> 00:44:23,224
Umm…

521
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:25,134
Marwin.

522
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:30,554
What did you and Dawan talk about?

523
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:43,654
What do you want to talk to me about?

524
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:52,064
Are you hiring Kim as a part-time or a full-time staff?

525
00:44:52,684 --> 00:44:54,214
Does she get enough days off?

526
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:55,524
What welfares do you provide for your employees?

527
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:56,904
Do you have an insurance for her?

528
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:58,554
Answer me.

529
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:00,624
You’re much more inquisitive than Kim herself.

530
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:04,184
So what? Just answer me.

531
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,594
She’s a full-time employee.

532
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:10,804
I also provide her all the welfares as stated by the law.

533
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:14,714
Actually, I plan to support her in everything she needs.

534
00:45:15,064 --> 00:45:16,874
So, you don’t have to worry.

535
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,114
I’ll take very good care of her.

536
00:45:19,214 --> 00:45:19,924
You…

537
00:45:20,924 --> 00:45:25,184
If I hear Kim complain even once, I’m going to inform the DLPW and sue you.

538
00:45:26,174 --> 00:45:28,904
I can assure you that would never happen.

539
00:45:30,454 --> 00:45:32,644
I also care about her as much as you do.

540
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:37,104
Are you trying to compete with me?

541
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:41,204
You just get to know her. How can you care for her more than I do?

542
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:44,294
It doesn’t matter how long I’ve known her.

543
00:45:45,094 --> 00:45:47,714
What matters is who can make her happier.

544
00:45:48,764 --> 00:45:50,374
That’s the most important thing.

545
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:51,644
What do you mean?

546
00:45:54,214 --> 00:45:55,384
I like Kim.

547
00:45:58,534 --> 00:46:00,084
Kim will never fall for a guy like you.

548
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:01,384
You better forget it.

549
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:05,924
And don’t you dare think of her more than just an employee.

550
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:09,204
I’d rather ask her about this myself.

551
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:12,684
Thank you for your concern about your friend.

552
00:46:14,264 --> 00:46:15,454
Is there anything else?

553
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:20,794
No?

554
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:23,114
Then please excuse me.

555
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:34,144
She was just worried about you.

556
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:38,174
So, I had to learn about some rules if I wanted to stay close to you.

557
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,134
She probably annoys you.

558
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:46,284
But that’s what she’s like.

559
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,754
Please don’t take it serious.

560
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:50,924
Oh, I’m not annoyed at all.

561
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:53,784
Actually, what she’s asked from me…

562
00:46:53,804 --> 00:46:57,104
is basically what I intend to do for you as your employer anyway.

563
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,454
But there’s one thing I might not be able to do as she’s asked.

564
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:05,144
What is it?

565
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:08,464
She asked me not to fall for you.

566
00:47:10,644 --> 00:47:12,454
I’ll try my best…

567
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,924
but I’m afraid it’d be quite hard to do so.

568
00:47:15,654 --> 00:47:18,514
Did you just tell me not to take her words seriously?

569
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:22,264
Then, I’ll listen to you as do as you said.

570
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:26,794
I’ll take it that you allow me to pursue you.

571
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:43,914
Let’s stay on our own way from now on.

572
00:47:44,304 --> 00:47:46,904
Please stop bothering me and messing up with my life.

573
00:48:00,014 --> 00:48:01,014
Kim!

574
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:03,584
Kim!

575
00:48:16,544 --> 00:48:17,254
Kim!

576
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:21,294
Why are you drawing someone else?

577
00:48:23,274 --> 00:48:24,354
It’s not someone else.

578
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:26,354
It’s Marwin.

579
00:48:36,254 --> 00:48:37,484
Do you like him?

580
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:39,994
No.

581
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,094
Then why are you drawing him?

582
00:48:46,364 --> 00:48:48,814
I don’t like him. But I don’t hate him either.

583
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:51,574
He’s a good guy.

584
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,294
Can you stop complimenting him?!

585
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:12,194
You’ve changed a lot since Marwin came into your life. Do you know that?

586
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:17,324
It’s as if you’re starting to like him.

587
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,024
You really want me to like him that much, huh?

588
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:22,014
It’s because you do! You like him, don’t you?

589
00:49:22,014 --> 00:49:24,654
You like him, right? Just say it!

590
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:26,844
Say that you like him! Say it!

591
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:27,894
Kim!

592
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:28,704
Ouch!

593
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:36,994
Kim.

594
00:49:40,374 --> 00:49:41,204
Kim.

595
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,254
You can’t like him!

596
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:48,934
If I had to live without you, then I’d rather not live at all!

597
00:49:50,514 --> 00:49:56,834
I can’t live without you!

598
00:49:56,834 --> 00:49:59,604
- You can’t like him, Kim!
- I can’t live without you!

599
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:00,244
Kim!

600
00:50:25,214 --> 00:50:31,724
🎵All I can do is saying ‘I love you’ during the night🎵

601
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:38,254
🎵Holding you tight until we’d meet again🎵

602
00:50:38,554 --> 00:50:45,244

603
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:52,044

My Marvellous Dream Is You

605
00:50:55,644 --> 00:50:57,914
I’m going to confess to Kim.

606
00:50:58,254 --> 00:51:02,484
[Do you want to be my girlfriend?]
What took you so long? Why now, all of the sudden?

607
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:06,124
I want to know what it’s like…

608
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:10,984
when you are being intimate with your lover.

609
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,684
Wan, what are you doing?

610
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:17,474
Mum, I want to ask you something.

611
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:19,614
That’s a long time ago.

612
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:22,504
Why are you asking me now?

613
00:51:22,944 --> 00:51:26,574
Thank you, Mum, for lying for me.

614
00:51:28,604 --> 00:51:29,784
Be my girlfriend, Wan.

615
00:51:30,014 --> 00:51:35,734
I have to thank Coach and Toon for introducing me to Wan.

616
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:55,164
🎵All I can do is saying ‘I love you’ during the night🎵

617

620
00:52:16,654 --> 00:52:25,804
🎵For tonight you’re my good dream. The dream that can never…🎵

621
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:28,794
🎵…come true.🎵

622
00:52:28,794 --> 00:52:32,124
🎵I want to cherish all the moments…🎵

623
00:52:32,124 --> 00:52:35,444
🎵And memorise every second…🎵

624
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:44,484
🎵I wonder what it’d be like to say love you in real life🎵
