1
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,680
Down with unethical companies

2
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,400
Down with unethical companies

3
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Kaisheng Technology is a digital drug

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Kaisheng Technology is a digital drug

5
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,280
Down with unethical companies

6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,840
Down with unethical companies

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Kaisheng Technology is a digital drug

8
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,920
Kaisheng Technology is a digital drug

9
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,840
Down with unethical companies

10
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,560
Down with unethical companies

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,079
Down with unethical companies

12
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,120
Friend

13
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,959
I am the chairman of Kaisheng Technology

14
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,439
Zhou Mingrui

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
What do you want

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,760
Of course, to denounce companies like yours

17
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,640
Unethical company

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,599
Friend

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,959
Where is this coming from

20
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,560
Do you know what your company makes

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,599
Are you really unaware

22
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,400
You poison young people's minds

23
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,280
You make them addicted

24
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,840
How is this different from a digital drug

25
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,920
Digital drug

26
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,200
Digital drug

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Digital drug

28
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,599
Hey, friend

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,639
Have we met before

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,120
Do you remember now

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,199
Zhang Jie

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't waste words on him

33
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:21,759
Mr. Pan

34
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,319
Call the police

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,280
Hey, call for backup

36
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:26,879
Go

37
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,400
What are you doing

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
What are you doing

39
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,800
Stop

40
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,759
Don't hit him

41
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,240
Stop, don't hit him

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,080
Don't hit him

43
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,120
Hello, boss

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,199
Did the fight start

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,560
It's started

46
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:50,840
Make a scene

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
Make it bigger

48
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,000
If it's not big, it won't make the news

49
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,960
Make it bigger

50
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,800
Even better if there's some blood

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,759
Make it a city-wide scandal

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Everyone should know about it

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Got it

54
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,879
Don't use violence

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,759
Call the police now

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,560
Stop

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,080
Old Pan

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you okay

59
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,280
I'm fine

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,680
Old Pan

61
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,199
Old Pan, are you okay

62
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,120
Old Pan

63
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,080
Old Pan

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,919
Old Pan is bleeding

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,319
Old Pan

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,039
Old Pan

67
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:43,960
Old Pan

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,000
Old Pan

69
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,000
Old Pan

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,159
Old Pan

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,400
Old Pan

72
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,080
Old Pan

73
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,280
Wake up, come on, wake up

74
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,120
Call an ambulance, call now

75
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,599
Call an ambulance

76
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,879
Hurry, call an ambulance

77
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,719
Call an ambulance, ambulance

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
How are the reporters arranged

79
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,039
They're all here

80
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,240
Mm

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,919
Tomorrow

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,520
Whether in print or online

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,960
Spread everywhere that Kaisheng's games
are digital drugs

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,639
Fill the news with stories of harming minors

85
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,280
Hire some famous financial commentators

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,560
Let them talk down Kaisheng

87
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,279
Understood

88
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:22,920
Are you okay

89
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,240
Zhou Mingrui

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,759
You want to fight me

91
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,759
You can't win

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,279
These media really dare to make things up

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,319
What do they mean by Kaisheng's games

94
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,399
Just because there's violent content

95
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,240
That's why the banquet fight happened

96
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,279
And this

97
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:54,879
Look

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,639
They say Kaisheng is

99
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,360
Digital heroin

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,399
Enough, Jiaming

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,720
I know we need a long-term plan

102
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,680
I won't act rashly

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,399
Don't worry

104
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,600
I thought you'd rush in again this time

105
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,399
I won't

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,759
This time

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,959
He clearly used our IPO

108
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,279
To stir up trouble on purpose

109
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,959
Who else hates us this much

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,439
Besides Li Changtian, who else

111
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,079
We just don't have proof

112
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,879
Yeah

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,319
But they even brought in Zhang Jie

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,360
Li Changtian's move is really nasty

115
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,639
But that Zhang Jie

116
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,000
He'll be in prison for years this time

117
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,199
How's Old Pan's injury

118
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,879
Oh, it's fine

119
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,399
He's awake now

120
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,839
Just a minor wound

121
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,879
Mingrui

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,560
What do we do now

123
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,360
We'll follow your lead

124
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,959
What about Li Changtian

125
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,360
He just wants to see us panic

126
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
He's in such a hurry

127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,439
Just to use this media storm

128
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,199
To pave the way for his new game

129
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,439
He had someone make a new game

130
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,240
It's pretty much like ours

131
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,879
He's plotting to steal our market

132
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,160
What a shame

133
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,759
He still doesn't get us

134
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
Zuma Land is popular

135
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
Not because of marketing tricks

136
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,839
It's the unity of every player

137
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,759
And their loyalty

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,240
That's why Zuma Land is still a hit today

139
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,240
You're right

140
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,720
But we still need to handle things properly

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,920
Or we'll be on the defensive

142
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm heading back to Korea

143
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,800
I'll wait for your good news

144
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,439
Seeing you like this

145
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,639
You've got a plan

146
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,920
Just wait and see

147
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,560
Zhou Mingrui hasn't reacted at all.

148
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:13,959
Yeah.

149
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,639
Except the company released a statement,

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,920
saying they'll work with authorities
to punish the culprit,

151
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
they haven't responded to anything else we've done.

152
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,279
And

153
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,560
they haven't clarified anything in the papers.

154
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,800
They're just letting themselves be smeared.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,000
That's not right.

156
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,600
Even though we've spread the news,

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
it hasn't affected Kaisheng's stock price.

158
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,639
Their stock is still steadily rising.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,240
Looks like they're trying

160
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,519
to play dead and wait it out.

161
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,720
Get someone to stir things up more.

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Just make them

163
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,319
go from playing dead to actually dead.

164
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,079
Hey, guys,

165
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,439
check out this announcement.

166
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,720
Event notice.

167
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,879
Thank you all for sticking with us.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
Our real-time online users

169
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,720
have surpassed 800,000.

170
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,600
Zuma Land

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,079
will launch a Grand Battle across all servers.

172
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,959
Lots of rewards in this event.

173
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,319
Plus the grand prize, the Dragon-Slaying Saber.

174
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
waiting for all brave warriors.

175
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,759
Thanks for supporting Zuma Land.

176
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,920
Thank you, everyone.

177
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,920
The event is about to begin.

178
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,879
Alright.

179
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,759
It's starting soon.

180
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,800
Do you think rushing this event will work?

181
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,439
If we don't rush it,

182
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,360
how do we bait them?

183
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm just worried.

184
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Old Pan isn't here right now.

185
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,879
What if there's a technical problem?

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
What are you afraid of?

187
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,639
Our main goal this time

188
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,519
is to get all players involved.

189
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,879
Give out benefits to the players.

190
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,399
That's what you say,

191
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,840
but I still feel

192
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,879
day after day,

193
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,639
those reporters are driving me crazy.

194
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,120
So, how's it going?

195
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,720
Any reaction from the reporters?

196
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,799
What else could they do?

197
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,879
It's all part of the plan.

198
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,799
Reporters keep asking tough, sensitive questions.

199
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,799
They say we're rushing the event

200
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,840
just to boost the stock price.

201
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,759
Don't get mad, don't get mad.

202
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,600
Sit down, sit down.

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,399
Li Changtian,

204
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,600
he really does have skills.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,440
Old Zhang.

206
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,360
Hey.

207
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,639
Stick to the plan.

208
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,840
OK, OK.

209
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:21,799
Bro,

210
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,960
I'm just a technician at Kaisheng.

211
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,879
Even if you beat me to death, it won't help.

212
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,399
I can't get the core data.

213
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,720
You punk,

214
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,679
your debt with us has grown to two million.

215
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,679
Either pay up,

216
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
or give me what I want.

217
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,559
Otherwise,

218
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,679
your hands or feet

219
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,039
might show up at your parents' doorstep.

220
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
I really can't get it.

221
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,639
Bro, even if you kill me, it won't work.

222
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,960
I really can't do anything.

223
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,559
Kaisheng is running a new event lately.

224
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,639
Can you get involved in it?

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,039
The maintenance team needs a lot of people now.

226
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,960
I should be able to join in.

227
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,279
Good.

228
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,799
I'll give you a task when the time comes.

229
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,879
If you finish it,

230
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,679
your debt will be wiped clean.

231
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,120
Don't try any tricks on me.
