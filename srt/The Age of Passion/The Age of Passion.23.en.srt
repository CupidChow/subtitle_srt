1
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,879
This time's server-wide siege battle

2
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,560
We have to make it look professional

3
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,359
And we can't be stingy with rewards

4
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,200
We need to be generous

5
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,799
We're the real deal

6
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,120
Players will get tons of loot this time

7
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,359
and have a blast

8
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,239
Jiayi

9
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,920
How many guilds are joining?

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,280
Almost every guild on the server signed up

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,760
We might need more servers

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,159
Jiaming

13
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,920
Did you hear that?

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,319
Rent or buy, whatever it takes

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,599
I'm leaving this to you

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Any problem?

17
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,280
No problem

18
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,959
The wind keeps blowing

19
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,239
Hard to say goodbye

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,280
In my heart

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
As for you, Sister Feng

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,439
Your part is a bit trickier

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,000
All the cities below

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,599
And the internet cafes in each area

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,719
Hang banners where needed

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,240
Put up posters where needed

27
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,520
Don't skimp on materials or prizes

28
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,520
Once tomorrow comes

29
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,199
Release all the detailed schedules

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,960
Any issues?

31
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,400
All good

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,439
Okay? How about you?

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,120
No problem, good

34
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,000
No problem

35
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,159
Alright, okay?

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Come on

37
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,680
Let's go

38
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,120
Okay

39
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,039
Meeting adjourned

40
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,560
Come on

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,159
Three, two, one

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,199
No problem

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,199
Charge!

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,120
Go for it

45
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,960
How are things going?

46
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,879
That programmer

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
is handling the event maintenance

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,879
It's all set

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
What about our game?

50
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,319
That's ready too

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,639
Our team is already spreading the word

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,759
Once Kaisun slips up

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,800
We make a big move

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
They'll be in trouble

55
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,759
Pull the rug out from under them

56
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,240
Alright

57
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,719
This Zuma Land siege battle

58
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,639
Our Meteor Garden guild from 996 Internet Cafe

59
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,039
is joining too

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
Great

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,680
And also

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,879
I've contacted all the internet cafe owners in town

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,599
We'll hold an event then

64
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,120
Let's give them a real competition

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,560
This time, the commander

66
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,560
will be our MC Nongmin

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,319
After these two months

68
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,680
Everyone's seen his skills

69
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,639
Raise your hand if you want to join

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,280
Count me in

71
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,599
Alright, those who join

72
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,879
will all be led by MC Nongmin

73
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,039
Any prizes will be split evenly

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,439
Okay

75
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,879
First, I thank Sister Feng

76
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
And thank you all, brothers

77
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,840
for trusting me to lead this event

78
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,039
First, everyone must follow orders and stay united

79
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,800
Second

80
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,120
If you're not in the guild, join soon

81
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,919
Third, pay special attention

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
Guild allies

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,039
Don't attack any of them

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,120
Are you confident?

85
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,879
Yes

86
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,400
Yes, let's go!

87
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,399
Zhou Mingrui

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,160
You're asking for trouble yourself

89
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,279
Go investigate

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
where Kaisun's servers are rented

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,360
Got it

92
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,000
How are our people doing?

93
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,839
They're ready

94
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,319
And the software is set

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
Just waiting for their event to start

96
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,160
Drop a big bomb

97
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,120
Alright, go

98
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,680
Wake up, everyone

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,639
Stop sleeping

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,160
The event announcement is out, check it

101
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:46,920
What announcement?

102
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,120
Zuma Land's event announcement is out

103
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,079
It's on the computer

104
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,279
Wake up, wake up

105
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,439
Check the announcement

106
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,120
Siege battle

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,519
From March 7, 2004, midnight

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,920
to March 8, midnight

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
Zuma Land will launch

110
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,000
a server-wide siege battle

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,600
Participants only need a guild or clan

112
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,160
to join the event

113
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,920
From the start of the event

114
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,680
All clans will be unclaimed for a limited time

115
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,560
for twenty-four hours

116
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,319
At the end of the event

117
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,720
Guilds occupying Sabak in each area

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,839
will be crowned champions of their region

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
Other participants

120
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,759
will be ranked by

121
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,800
how long they held Sabak during the event

122
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,839
and ranked accordingly

123
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,360
The event rewards are generous

124
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
Besides rare titles

125
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,079
there are grand prizes

126
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,759
Dragon-Slaying Saber

127
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,360
awaits all brave warriors

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,199
Even with the titles

129
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,639
fighting for twenty-four hours straight

130
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,120
Even a god couldn't handle that

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,199
I think the strong guilds

132
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,079
will make their move at the end

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Early on, it'll be mostly small guilds

134
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,439
After all, besides the champion

135
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
the other prizes are great too

136
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,399
Do you want the Dragon-Slaying Saber?

137
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Yes

138
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,600
With the saber in hand

139
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
I've got it, brothers

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,519
Let's do it

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Alright, good

142
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,560
Xiaolong, come in

143
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,199
Coming, sis

144
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,399
Today I announce

145
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,720
Anyone in our guild

146
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,079
who joins us tomorrow night

147
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,279
will get free internet from me

148
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,360
plus free instant noodles and drinks

149
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,160
and an extra sausage

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright

151
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,360
The server is sorted out.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,959
It's done.

153
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,879
Nice.

154
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,879
You have no idea.

155
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,600
How hard it is to open up
the whole downstream market.

156
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm exhausted.

157
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,079
I'll get back to work.

158
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,040
Okay.

159
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,639
Hello?

160
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,000
Ms. Zhao.

161
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,920
How's the investigation going?

162
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,560
We've found one.

163
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
A key member of their game
development team.

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
I've had someone get the source code.

165
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,199
After comparison,

166
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,240
it's almost identical to our Zuma Land.

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,319
But...

168
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,920
This kind of infringement lawsuit
is pretty tricky.

169
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,959
Because Li Changtian registered
a shell company.

170
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,399
Layer upon layer.

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,680
The original copyright holder

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,839
authorized Li Changtian's domestic company

173
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,920
through an offshore shell company
he set up.

174
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't handle this kind of
cross-border lawsuit.

175
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,720
But there is one way.

176
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,639
It only treats the symptoms,
not the root.

177
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,199
What way?

178
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,360
The upstream copyright infringement
evidence is clear.

179
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,639
Although Li Changtian is in China,

180
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,199
he's just an agent on the surface.

181
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,040
But we can use this

182
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,240
to get his game

183
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,319
into the review process.

184
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,399
It can't go online.

185
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,680
Sue for infringement during review.

186
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,800
Drag him down.

187
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,720
Alright, let's do it.

188
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,360
Now it's up to you.

189
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,279
See you tomorrow.

190
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,079
Jiaming.

191
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,240
Is everything set?

192
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,399
All set.

193
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,240
Don't worry.

194
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,759
Firewall is working fine.

195
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,840

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
Now we just wait for them
