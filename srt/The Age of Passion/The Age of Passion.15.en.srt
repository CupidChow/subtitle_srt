1
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,879
How is it?

2
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,200
Is the gameplay good?

3
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,959
The technical director asks.

4
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,480
How do you like the game?

5
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,840
It's great.

6
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,959
Our Young Lady is willing to buy your game.

7
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,159
As long as you guarantee completion.

8
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
We're willing to pay a $50,000 deposit.

9
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,719
Peter.

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,560
He said—

11
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,719
Young Lady.

12
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Friday.

13
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,480
Wants to discuss other business with me.

14
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:54,959
Friday.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,439
Wait, that's not right.

16
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,840
Today is already Friday.

17
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,879
He just said a whole bunch.

18
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,200
Why did you only translate this much?

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,439
Our language is so rich and profound.

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
Their language is full of nonsense.

21
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,639
Go ahead.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,039
Go, go, go!

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,479
Okay.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:13,960
Thank you.

25
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,159
You know what?

26
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,599
This game is actually pretty fun.

27
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:22,759
Rui.

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
I noticed the games from these big companies

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,080
are much more polished than Pan's.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Yeah, they're good.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,560
But the pity is—

32
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,439
We can't bring it back home.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Who says we can't?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,120
We can sign with their company

35
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,800
for a China region distribution deal.

36
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,719
Then we can bring the game back.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,919
Maybe we can even make money from it.

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,560
And save our third brother.

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,120
Pleasure working together.

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,319
But—

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
Their game—

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,639
Aren't they signing the contract?

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,319
Because we're friends.

44
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,240
I signed on their behalf.

45
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,919
Alright.

46
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,680
This is for you.

47
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,680
Thanks.

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,199
Go, go, go!

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,840
Got it.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,719
Go!

51
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,879
Come on!

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,479
Which button?

53
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,840
Not good, let's go, hurry!

54
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,000
What's wrong?

55
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,240
Weren't you meeting with the Young Lady?

56
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,199
I just heard the Koreans say

57
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,560
they want to sabotage our game.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
They know we're not experts.

59
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,279
They claim the game has issues on purpose.

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,439
Just to mess with our game.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
They even spoke English in front of me.

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,560
Thought I couldn't understand.

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,839
I speak Chinese, English, Korean, and Japanese!

64
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,879
Wait, hold on.

65
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,639
This Young Lady—

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,319
She doesn't seem short on money.

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,680
Yeah.

68
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,680
That's a bit much.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,160
That's just your opinion.

70
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,199
Her tech guy said

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,120
this game—

72
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,639
isn't just worth tens of thousands HKD.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,319
It's worth one million US dollars!

74
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,519
How much?

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,800
US dollars.

76
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,839
Why are you still standing there?

77
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,680
Let's grab our stuff.

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,319
Run!

79
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,160
Go, go, go!

80
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:00,759
Hurry, let's go!

81
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,240
Still haven't found the game developer you need?

82
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,000
Young Lady hasn't yet.

83
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,639
Although Zuma Land's framework is mostly done,

84
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,160
there are still many flaws in the game.

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,600
I need real technical talent.

86
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,680
To upgrade it.

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,839
Do you understand?

88
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,519
Understood.

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
I'll find someone as soon as possible.

90
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,759
If we could recruit that Pan from China,

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
that would be perfect.

92
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,560
I can sense

93
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,160
his design ideas are very advanced.

94
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,319
And his skills are top-notch.

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,279
Bad news, Young Lady!

96
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,120
What happened?

97
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
Those three Chinese guys ran off with their game discs.

98
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,000
What?

99
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,839
After signing, I gave Peter Zhang the check.

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe—

101
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,920
They took the money and ran.

102
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,720
Young Lady.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll bring them back right now.

104
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,240
Remind them—

105
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,360
this place—

106
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,319
is the capital.

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,800
Yes.

108
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,639
Peter.

109
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
I think something's off here.

110
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,079
Boss—

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
The Zhao family is a conglomerate.

112
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,639
Do you know what a conglomerate is?

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,160
They're all ruthless.

114
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,040
You want to get locked in an oil drum?

115
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,639
Your brother, you know—

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
Why go out for info now?

117
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,759
This is Korea.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
He doesn't understand a word of Korean.

119
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,879
No one should notice now.

120
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,639
I'm going out to buy some food.

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,279
Stay here, don't go out.

122
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,959
Wait for me.

123
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,160
Wait for me.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,519
Hey, Jiaming.

125
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:01,839
Rui.

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,800
I found some Chinese in Korea.

127
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,720
I've got everything figured out.

128
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
Rumors are spreading now.

129
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,399
They say we took the game company's deposit

130
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,680
and stole the game before running off.

131
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,439
What deposit? That's nonsense!

132
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,560
We ran because—

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,279
they said the game is worth one million dollars.

134
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,279
Is Peter Zhang still here?

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
We've been tricked.

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Where do you think you're going?

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,920
I never planned to run.

138
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,120
You think I'm stupid?

139
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,160
Or are you the stupid one?

140
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,519
Do I still have a chance to explain?

141
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,600
You used to.

142
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,800
Not anymore.

143
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,160
Stop!

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,519
Jiayi.

145
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,000
You came back just for him.

146
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,000
Not bad.

147
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,680
Jiayi.

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,399
How did you two meet?

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,199
I met her back when I was in school with Meihui.

150
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,800
When I first came to Korea, I didn't know anyone.

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,439
Thanks to Sister Meihui's care.

152
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
Yeah, I learned Chinese from Jiayi too.

153
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,720
So we're on the same side.

154
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,080
Miss Zhao,

155
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,559
there's something

156
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,919
I need to be honest with you about.

157
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,000
The person who ran off with the deposit

158
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,080
was Peter Zhang.

159
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,759
He tricked us,

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,200
saying you wanted to take over our game.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's why we took the game and left.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,960
About this matter,

163
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,919
I trust Jiayi.

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,480
Between you and me,

165
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,519
there have been some misunderstandings.

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,919
I'll make sure to catch that rat Peter Zhang.

167
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,759
Thank you, thank you.

168
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,919
As for this game,

169
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,440
my third brother made it.

170
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,559
I can't give you the full code yet,

171
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,039
but right now

172
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,480
I need to get my brother out of his lawsuit.

173
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,159
Only then will he have time

174
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,080
to focus on making the game.

175
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,919
Mr. Zhou,

176
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,879
you're still my guest.

177
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,039
And with Jiayi's connection,

178
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
regarding this game,

179
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,200
I have patience.

180
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,960
Thank you for understanding.

181
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,480
I can offer you fifty thousand dollars more.

182
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,360
But there are conditions.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,960
After Mr. Pan Bowen settles his issues,

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,759
I need him to work for me in Korea for five years.

185
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,519
How about it? Think it over.

186
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,200
No need to think.

187
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,320
If you want to work with Mr. Pan Bowen,

188
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,759
you can sign a contract with him directly.

189
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
But we

190
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,960
can't make any decisions for him.

191
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,279
Including this kind of binding contract.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,600
I hope you understand.

193
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,200
Sister Meihui,

194
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,759
Alright.

195
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,440
I'll pay the fifty thousand deposit unconditionally.

196
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,240
Investment always comes with risks.

197
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,000
I accept that.

198
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,080
Miss Zhao,

199
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,720
besides this game we're making,

200
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,480
I'd also like to discuss

201
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,279
the game your company is currently developing,

202
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,879
the agency rights for Zuma Land.

203
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,039
Mr. Zhou is also interested in Zuma Land.

204
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,519
Yes, that's right.

205
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,720
I believe

206
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,159
Zuma Land

207
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,639
will be a groundbreaking game in the future.

208
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,600
To be honest,

209
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,320
I want to be the agent for Zuma Land.

210
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,799
How much are you willing to pay for the rights?

211
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,200
Because I really believe in this game,

212
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,039
I think it's worth

213
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,279
five hundred thousand dollars.

214
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,919
You're quite straightforward.

215
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,679
For Jiayi's sake,

216
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,480
I'll only ask you for

217
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:22,720
three hundred thousand.

218
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,240
If Mr. Zhou can give me three hundred thousand dollars,

219
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,960
the China rights for Zuma Land are yours.

220
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,360
Our company might even take shares with part of the fee.

221
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,120
Wait, don't rush.

222
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,600
All of this comes with conditions.

223
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,960
Mr. Pan Bowen,

224
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,879
I hope he can join

225
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,080
our game development team soon.

226
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,240
Of course, I won't sign a five-year contract.

227
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,879
But he must at least come to Korea

228
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,080
and work for me for a while.

229
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,720
If we work well together,

230
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,639
I'll consider signing a contract with him.

231
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,200
That's easy, that's easy.

232
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,399
We'll talk to Old Pan about it later.

233
00:11:59,519 --> 00:11:59,799
Right.

234
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:00,840
But

235
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,919
I need some time to raise the money.

236
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,440
Zuma Land is really popular.

237
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,159
I can give you at most one week.

238
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:10,759
How long?

239
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,600
One week.

240
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,519
No extension after that.

241
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,360
Next week I'll be on a business trip to Yucheng.

242
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,679
Because besides you,

243
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,159
other companies have also scheduled meetings about this deal.

244
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,159
Understood.

245
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,639
Jiaming,

246
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,600
buy the tickets.
