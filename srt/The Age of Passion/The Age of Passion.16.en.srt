00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,120
Godfather

2
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:24,680
They're here.

3
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,400
President Zhao

4
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,840
Welcome, welcome!

5
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,640
Please, have a seat.

6
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,120
President Li

7
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,719
I've heard so much about you.
It's an honor to meet.

8
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,280
Not at all.

9
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,159
President Zhao

10
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,159
Your visit to Rain City

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,239
is truly my honor.

12
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,879
As for me,

13
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,959
I am absolutely sincere

14
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,319
about sitting down with you

15
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,599
and having a real conversation.

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,480
About the Zuma Land distribution rights.

17
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,000
However,

18
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,200
the price you offered before

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,439
is a bit off from market trends.

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,239
Is that so?

21
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,640
President Li thinks my price
is off the market trend.

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,040
Then let me ask you,

23
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,159
what do you consider a trend?

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,479
Selling discs?

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,919
No, that's not it.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,599
What I mean is,

27
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,639
look,

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,560
developing the game and its extras,

29
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,520
plus future promotion,

30
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,360
all cost a significant amount.

31
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,319
You know China is huge,

32
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,560
and the market is risky.

33
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,080
If no one is interested,

34
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,000
then I, Li Changtian,

35
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,439
would end up with nothing.

36
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,000
My father told me,

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,039
in business,

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,639
there are gains and losses.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,840
If someone tells you

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,879
there's no risk

41
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,080
and you can make money,

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,319
and wants you to invest,

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,639
he's lying to you.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,080
President Li

45
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,719
You just said

46
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,240
China is huge.

47
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,479
That's right.

48
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,520
Your father was absolutely right.

49
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,479
So that means

50
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,719
we still have things to discuss.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,919
We do.

52
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,080
But

53
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,919
it has to be on my terms.

54
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,759
President Zhao

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,560
How about this?

56
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,120
Since you're rarely in China,

57
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,840
why not stay here

58
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,439
and enjoy a few more days?

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Give me some time

60
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,240
to think it over.

61
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,439
Then President Li can start thinking now.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,919
Thank you for the hospitality.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,960
Wait,

64
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,400
the food isn't all here yet.

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
I'm on a diet.

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,080
Uncle

67
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,319
President Zhao

68
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,520
If you can't decide,

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,479
I might just

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,680
look for another game company's product.

71
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,319
Business is about mutual agreement.

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,479
If that's the case,

73
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,319
we'll work together if fate allows.

74
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,680
Godfather

75
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,039
Her attitude suddenly got tough.

76
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,479
Did someone

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,120
offer a higher price than us?

78
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,720
Things have changed a bit.

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,160
Someone is competing with us
for Zuma Land's rights.

80
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,480
Who is it?

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,439
It's someone who used to

82
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,240
sell cartridges for us in Raonan District.

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,000
He was supposed to go to Korea

84
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,680
to sell a half-finished game.

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,279
But he took a liking to Zuma Land

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,920
and wants to bring it back to sell.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,360
Isn't he just a dog I raised?

88
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,600
Now he dares to compete with me.

89
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,240
Does he really think
Li Changtian is soft?

90
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,319
Godfather

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,040
So what do we do next?

92
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,120
A bratty girl,

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,959
a lowlife street vendor,

94
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,920
the two of them dare to team up

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,399
and show off to me.

96
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,879
Looks like they have a death wish.

97
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,360
The one at the door earlier
was her trusted aide, right?

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,040
Yes.

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,319
He's Chinese.

100
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,240
His name is Jiang Long.

101
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,519
Find a time

102
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,439
and set up a meeting with him.

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,240
This time, you guys—

104
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,079
Was it thrilling or not?

105
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm really jealous of you.

106
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,199
I wish I could've gone too.

107
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,800
It was as exciting as it gets.

108
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,839
It was as intense as possible.

109
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,120
Come on.

110
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,399
I made this for you myself.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,480
First,

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,879
to celebrate your triumphant return.

113
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,319
Second,

114
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,839
to celebrate our 996 Internet Café

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,079
finally settling the lawsuit.

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,839
That's a must.

117
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,959
Now we can achieve greatness again.

118
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:47,879
Cheers!

119
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,199
Come on, cheers!

120
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,399
Come on.

121
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,319
Cheers!

122
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,120
I also want to thank everyone

123
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,560
for helping me with all your effort.

124
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,199
If it weren't for Old Pan's game,

125
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,279
we wouldn't have earned this money.

126
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,399
Without this income, we'd have no cash.

127
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,680
Without this money,

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
we couldn't have fixed the 996 issue.

129
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,720
So, Old Pan,

130
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,120
here's to you.

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,279
Hey, hey—

132
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,519
You two haven't met for just half a month,

133
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it necessary to act so dramatic?

134
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,639
Let's sit down

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,399
and drink together.

136
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:15,839
To Old Pan!

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,720
To Old Pan!

138
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,720
I have an announcement for everyone.

139
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,879
Our 996 Internet Café—

140
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,040
I've had workers renovate it.

141
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,040
Except we don't have much money for new computers.

142
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,399
But I promise, inside,

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
it's exactly like before the incident.

144
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:34,759
No problem.

145
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,399
This trip to Korea was fruitful.

146
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,800
I tried out a game there.

147
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,639
Let me tell you—

148
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,680
After we both played it,

149
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,680
I truly think

150
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,079
if we get the rights to this game,

151
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,560
Which game?

152
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,399
Zuma Land.

153
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,079
Zuma Land.

154
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,639
If we can get

155
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
the rights to Zuma Land,

156
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,439
everyone here

157
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,600
can make a fortune.

158
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,959
Is this Land expensive or not?

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,879
Three hundred thousand.

160
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,000
Three hundred thousand.

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,560
US dollars.

162
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,560
US dollars.

163
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,879
Our café just had trouble.

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,600
That's way too expensive.

165
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,000
No way, no way.

166
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:11,839
That's impossible.

167
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,519
It's way too expensive.

168
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,439
If others dare to ask this much,

169
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,040
it means their product is the real deal.

170
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,399
Tell me how this game works.

171
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,560
Let me see if I can make it.

172
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,959
So, it's an online game.

173
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,360
We used to play mostly offline games.

174
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,920
It has classes, like mage—

175
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,199
warrior—

176
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,040
and you fight monsters, level up.

177
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,319
Of course, you can also PvP.

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,439
Right?

179
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,160
Zhou Mingrui, I admit—

180
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,839
this game you mentioned

181
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,600
does sound pretty awesome to me.

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,279
But the problem is—

183
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,959
Even if it has Shuke Beta,

184
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,360
even if it has Black Cat Captain,

185
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,920
it's still not worth that much.

186
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,959
Yeah, it sounds interesting.

187
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,879
But we really can't afford it.

188
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,879
It's not about affording it.

189
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,680
I'm saying we can find a way.

190
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,079
To win, we need the right info.

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,560
We have to get the first slice.

192
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,199
If we grab it before others,

193
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,360
we're the winners.

194
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,839
This game is just too expensive.

195
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,199
It's expensive now.

196
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,279
It's expensive now.

197
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,800
Listen to me.

198
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,720
What are you doing?

199
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,800
Stop arguing.

200
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,920
How about we drink?

201
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,720
I have something important to say.

202
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,240
Three hundred thousand dollars.

203
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,680
If you can't raise it in seven days,

204
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,360
the chance goes to someone else.

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,360
Zhou Mingrui.

206
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,040
Can you change your impulsive ways?

207
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,519
Where do we get three hundred thousand?

208
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,240
He's always been like this.

209
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,160
Come on, come on, let's drink!

210
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,079
Sister Feng,

211
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,959
your cooking skills are impressive.

212
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,600
I noticed

213
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,080
this seafood is delicious.

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,919
Mr. Jiang is here.

215
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Nice to meet you.

216
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,240
Please, have a seat.

217
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,720
No need to be so formal, Mr. Li.

218
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,759
Sit, sit, sit.

219
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,519
Pour the wine.

220
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,360
Mr. Jiang,

221
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
this wine today—

222
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,360
I specially brought it from your hometown,

223
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,720
Shanxi,

224
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,879
flown in by air.

225
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,879
Try it.

226
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,279
Here, a toast to you.

227
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,840
Come on.

228
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,120
A toast to you.

229
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,519
How's the wine?

230
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,559
Authentic.

231
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,480
You didn't invite me just for a drink, did you, Mr. Li?

232
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,279
Just making friends with you.

233
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,360
Mr. Jiang,

234
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,440
how do you like today's dishes?

235
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,320
Do you like them?

236
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,279
They're good.

237
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,879
Feels like there's a dish missing.

238
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,159
Why not serve it already?
