1
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,760
Pleasure working with you.

2
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:27,959
Pleasure working with you.

3
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing.

4
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,159
This place

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,959
was borrowed from Jiayi's father.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we are confident

7
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,159
that one day

8
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,879
we'll have a company of our own.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
I believe in you.

10
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,840
The contract is just the beginning.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,719
But you all know about the game.

12
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,759
Zuma Land isn't fully developed yet.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
It still needs time.

14
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,199
You also need to localize the game.

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
And set up servers, among other things.

16
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,000
A whole series of preparations.

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,840
President Zhao,

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,199
about the game's launch,

19
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,439
we'll start moving forward soon.

20
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,919
As for localization,

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,879
Mr. Pan Bowen will personally handle it.

22
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,639
Of course,

23
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,080
there may be

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,159
some adjustments to details.

25
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,800
It's all specified in the contract.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,680
I saw that.

27
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,919
I hope Mr. Pan Bowen

28
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,439
can join our game team soon.

29
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,319
To provide guidance.

30
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,840
The luggage is packed.

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,199
Ready to leave anytime.

32
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,319
Mr. Jiang,

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you know why I smoke cigars?

34
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,400
Because cigars don't go to the lungs.

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,599
But when you do things,

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
you have to put your heart in.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800
Mr. Jiang,

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
I've treated you well, haven't I?

39
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,280
It's been a long time.

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,039
You haven't made any progress.

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680
Honestly, in my heart,

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,639
I'm not feeling great.

43
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,560
President Li,

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
To put it nicely,

45
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm Ms. Zhao's administrator.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,919
But actually,

47
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,560
I'm just a bodyguard.

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,400
As for the development department,

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,919
I can't

50
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,240
get involved there.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,759
Isn't that your problem?

52
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,080
What does that have to do with me?

53
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,639
How about this:

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,560
I'll give you one more week.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
When the time comes,

56
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,240
if you can't deliver what I want,

57
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,879
President Li is very resourceful.

58
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,959
That's business.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,560
You always need a backup plan.

60
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,639
So,

61
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,079
within a week,

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,920
you'd better give me what I want.

63
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,319
Otherwise,

64
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,439
Ms. Zhao

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,959
will get a surprise.

66
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,439
How's that?

67
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,800
Not bad, right?

68
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,680
Jiayi,

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,600
thank your father for me

70
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,240
for providing this place.

71
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,240
No need to be so polite.

72
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,160
Her dad is your dad too.

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm not some kept man.

74
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,240
Mingrui,

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,680
about Jiang Long,

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,399
how do you plan to handle it?

77
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,279
Aren't you telling Ms. Zhao?

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,079
This matter

79
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,759
is hard to explain.

80
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,120
A photo doesn't prove much.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,639
And if Li Changtian

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,279
gets the original game files,

83
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,800
and launches it after returning home,

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,079
all our plans

85
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,319
will be wasted.

86
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,120
Looks like

87
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,040
we need a way to make him show himself.

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,759
Jiaming,

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,399
what if we try

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,399
shooting fish in a barrel?

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
How about it?

92
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,519
Let's do it.

93
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,759
Mr. Jiang,

94
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,079
The R&D server room needs repairs.

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,959
Ms. Zhao asked me to find you

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
and have you keep an eye on it.

97
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:23,800
Don't worry.

98
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,279
Leave it to me.

99
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,959
No issues, right?

100
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:46,839
Everything's normal.

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,040
Good.

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,800
Jiang Long, you traitor!

103
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,199
Such a traitor.

104
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:53,839
Ms. Zhao,

105
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't alert him yet.

106
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,839
Let him deliver the goods first.

107
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
But what if they check the authenticity

108
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,720
and we get exposed?

109
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
You underestimate our tech team.

110
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,879
The surface code is real game code.

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,439
But in the underlying program,

112
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,199
they'll find a surprise.

113
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,879
What's going on?

114
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
Why did all the servers crash?

115
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,720
President Lin,

116
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,960
I don't know.

117
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,840
I pay you,

118
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,120
and now you tell me you don't know?

119
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,679
Make him disappear.

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Zhao Meihui

121
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,200
Zhou Mingrui
