1
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,959
Three

2
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,920
Two

3
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,239
One

4
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,760
Start

5
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,640
Guys, it's starting now.

6
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,079
Everyone, right now—

7
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,280
Gather up, assemble now!

8
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,959
Assemble!

9
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,400
Games don't last a lifetime, guys.

10
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,200
But Zuma Land lasts a lifetime.

11
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,040
Guys, are you all ready?

12
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,439
Whether you're in the channel

13
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,040
or at the internet café—

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Just follow my command now.

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,079
Everyone, gather up!

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,359
Move forward and gather.

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,879
Rui Ge

18
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,000
Our real-time online player count

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,120
has already passed one million.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,680
And it's still rising steadily.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,239
Mages, get ready.

22
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,760
Equip all your Inferno Caskets.

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,359
Push forward with tactics now.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Push forward with tactics.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,400
Priests, make sure to cast Magic Shield.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,719
Be sure to cast Magic Shield.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,240
Mages, move up.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Fire with every step.

29
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,599
Keep pushing forward.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,919
Push through to the center.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,159
Good.

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,919
Push!

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,159
Yes, just like that.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,800
Keep moving forward.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Push forward, don't fall back!

36
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,080
Guys, don't push back.

37
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't push back.

38
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,039
Nice, nice!

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Nice!

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,319
Keep attacking forward.

41
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,520
Keep attacking forward.

42
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,599
Hurry up, move faster!

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,719
Not many left, guys.

44
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,240
Awesome.

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,639
At this rate, I estimate

46
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,599
before the event ends tomorrow,

47
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,879
the peak online count

48
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,639
will hit at least two million.

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,159
We've already set

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,039
the national record for real-time online players.

51
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,039
Not just national—

52
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,400
this record

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,560
has broken the world record.

54
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
I'm telling you,

55
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,039
the stock market will be buzzing tomorrow.

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,199
Those Wall Street folks—

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,439
they've got the sharpest noses.

58
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,759
Of course, they're pros at numbers.

59
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,159
Rui Ge

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Meihui giving you the game rights

61
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,000
was honestly her smartest move.

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,599
It's not just me.

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,000
It's all of us.

64
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,080
Rui Ge's smile—real or fake?

65
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,919
Amin

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,439
Is the evidence ready?

67
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,240
Don't worry.

68
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,599
It's all been submitted.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
Then let's let Li Changtian

70
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,400
have his last good night's sleep.

71
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,520
I bet he won't sleep well tonight.

72
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,680
Are you telling me those servers are fake?

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
The servers are real.

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,719
But Kaisheng Games rented them for nothing.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
Where are your people?

76
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,960
Why haven't they acted yet?

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,080
We've already inserted what you gave us.

78
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,680
You're full of crap.

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
If it was inserted,

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,599
the game would've crashed by now.

81
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,280
Godfather

82
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
Is it possible you got scammed?

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,159
Impossible.

84
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,199
I hired an international expert for this code.

85
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,720
I checked it myself.

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,360
No way there's a mistake.

87
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,360
Zhou Mingrui

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,279
Zhou Mingrui screwed me over.

89
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,040
Zhou Mingrui

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,839
Is Li Changtian here?

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,759
What do you want?

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,240
Li Changtian

93
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,720
Someone reported you.

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,360
Suspected of running a criminal gang,

95
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,480
maliciously stirring up public opinion,

96
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,480
and several other charges.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,920
Come with us, please.

98
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,240
This is a summons.

99
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,959
What evidence do you have?

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
Is there any evidence?

101
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,519
Come to the station, it'll all be clear.

102
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,439
Take him away.

103
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,439
Wait a second.

104
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,959
Let me tell you—

105
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,759
If my lawyer isn't present,

106
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,560
I won't say a word.

107
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,839
Contact the lawyer.

108
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,399
I'm the one who reported him.

109
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,720
You.

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,800
What are you doing?

111
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,920
You little brat!

112
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,839
Just you wait.

113
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,160
Li Changtian

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Li Changtian

115
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,759
Just say yes or no.

116
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,959
I really didn't expect it back then.

117
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,120
Impressive or not?

118
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,600
Two million

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,199
Finance has sent everyone a red envelope.

120
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,319
Did you all get yours?

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,879
Got it.

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,839
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

123
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,639
What I, Zhou Mingrui, love most is
everyone making money together.

124
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,120
If you're happy, I'm happy too.

125
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,800
Our Kaisheng Games

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
with everyone's hard work,

127
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,079
has created a legend.

128
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,600
Don't forget,

129
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,639
Kaisheng Games' titles

130
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,800
were the first in the world

131
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,879
to break one million concurrent players.

132
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,959
We're going to set new records.

133
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,920
We're going to make new legends.

134
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,759
Tonight, more surprises await you.

135
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,879
Brothers,

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,439
the final battle is here.

137
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,959
Whether you're a hero or a coward,

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
there's just one last push.

139
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,199
Now, all classes

140
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,079
go to your assigned positions.

141
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,319
Everyone,

142
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,720
are you ready?

143
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,079
Ready!

144
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
All classes, follow my lead.

145
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,160
Three, two, one.

146
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,040
Push down the Resurrection Point.

147
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Everyone, move forward! Quick!

148
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,279
Everyone at the Resurrection Point,

149
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,759
Mages, lay down fire first.

150
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,319
Warriors, get in close.

151
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,639
Priests, cast Magic Shield.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,199
Take the Resurrection Point!

153
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,639
Nice! Don't be afraid.

154
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,519
One million eight hundred thousand.

155
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,720
One million nine hundred thousand.

156
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,800
Two million two hundred ten thousand.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,399
Oh my god.

158
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,519
Two million two hundred twenty thousand.

159
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,279
Nice, mages!

160
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,519
What are you waiting for?

161
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,720
This is the final moment.

162
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,519
Keep casting your spells!

163
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
All warriors,

164
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,079
I want you to fall charging forward.

165
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,399
Everyone, attack!

166
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,399
Keep fighting, don't stop!

167
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,720
Priests, cast Magic Shield.

168
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,800
Hurry, hurry! Speed up!

169
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,839
Pick up the pace!

170
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
Quick, mages move up!

171
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,000
Mages, advance!

172
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,079
Bury them again.

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,199
Bury them, bury them!

174
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,519
Attack them!

175
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,160
All warriors now,

176
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,839
Quick, seize the Imperial Palace!

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,680
Mages, protect our warriors.

178
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,120
Keep casting ice on the stairs.

179
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,600
Head toward the Imperial Palace.

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,959
How many points left in the Palace?

181
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,199
How many are left in the Palace?

182
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:24,959
Report!

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Only two enemies left in the Palace!

184
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
Three, two, one.

185
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,839
Clear them all out.

186
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,000
Wipe them out.

187
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,320
Clear! Clear!

188
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,000
Got it!

189
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,080
We are the champions!

190
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
Champions! Champions! Champions!

191
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,759
Every single one counts!

192
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,879
Tonight, it's my treat!

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,759
Alright!

194
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,120

Great job, everyone. Well done.

197
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,399
Two hundred.

198
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,759
Two million two hundred seventy thousand.

199
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,919
Two million two hundred seventy thousand.

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,960
Old Pan.

201
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,679
Old Pan.

202
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you know what this means?

203
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,679
What does it mean?

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
It means we've succeeded.

205
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,000
It means Zuma Land has succeeded.

206
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,519
Do you realize

207
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,639
we can make one hundred million?

208
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,279
Raise it!

209
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,120
Next up,

210
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,240

211
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,399
Declaration on Healthy Gaming and Minor Protection

212
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,480
is being signed.

213
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,320
For the entire gaming industry,

214
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,679
it sets standards and social responsibility.

215
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,759
Protecting minors,

216
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,279
creating a healthy online environment,

217
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,559
and preventing minors from addiction

218
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,159
is our duty as online companies.

219
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,039
Build a healthy gaming environment,

220
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,240
and prevent minors from gaming addiction.

221
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,360
I believe

222
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,399
what we're doing

223
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,720
will help the healthy growth of the gaming industry

224
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,960
and play a key role.
