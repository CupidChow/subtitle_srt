1
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,799
So Qiang Ge is from our hometown too.

2
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,719
Yeah.

3
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,879
The first time I saw Qiang Ge, two words came to mind—

4
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,760
Familiar.

5
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,680
Really familiar.

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,799
I could tell you came straight out of Yucheng.

7
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,959
Qiang Ge must love the seafood from our place.

8
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,280
I remember Qiang Ge eating a huge oyster back then.

9
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,319
A giant oyster, you know.

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,959
I was drooling on the side.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,920
Yeah, couldn't afford it, man.

12
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,359
But now there's a restaurant that's really good.

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,239
Lao Pan Seafood Company.

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,079
Not Lao Pan.

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,959
Guang Hui Sui Yue.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,799
Right, Guang Hui Sui Yue.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
It's super tasty, Qiang Ge.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Spare me, Qiang Ge.

19
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,200
Spare me.

20
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,799
Qiang Ge.

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Qiang Ge.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,319
No.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,439
Why is it you guys?

24
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,879
Why are you tying me up?

25
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,759
I already found you a buyer.

26
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,759
Stop pretending.

27
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,080
Who are you trying to fool?

28
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,400
When did I ever trick you?

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,000
Then tell us the buyer's name.

30
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,159
What's their phone number?

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,879
Where do they live?

32
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,560
Say it.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,400
Say it.

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,599
Say it, come on.

35
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,759
Can't say it, can you?

36
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,719
You've been networking these days,

37
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,520
just for the batch of goods they seized from you.

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,479
As for us,

39
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,599
we're just your free muscle.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,319
It's all a misunderstanding.

41
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:44,800
I...

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,560
I really did help you sell the game.

43
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:47,879
I swear to God.

44
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,039
I really sold it.

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
Really?

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Then what about Qiang Ge?

47
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,960
How do you explain that?

48
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,400
Qiang Ge.

49
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,439
It's just a small misunderstanding.

50
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,400
A small misunderstanding.

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,680
The police seized my goods.

52
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,439
You jerk.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,599
If it's just a misunderstanding,

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,719
I wouldn't need to ruin you.

55
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,520
Damn it, you guys sold me out.

56
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,479
Qiang Ge, I...

57
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,240
I didn't.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,319
The cops—

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
would never listen to me.

60
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,879
My goods got seized too.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,919
Otherwise,

62
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,000
would I be hiding like this?

63
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,080
Your goods got seized,

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,240
what's that got to do with me?

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,319
Shut up.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
So noisy.

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,919
Is that how you talk to Qiang Ge?

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,879
Qiang Ge.

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,439
Learn from me.

70
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,680
Qiang Ge.

71
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,840
I've checked.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,599
In the batch they seized from him,

73
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
half of it is yours.

74
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,360
What? Say that again.

75
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,159
I said,

76
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,080
in the batch they seized from him,

77
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,360
half of it is yours.

78
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,639
Son of a bitch.

79
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,439
Was it that guy from Taiwan, China?

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,639
To save money,

81
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,560
he shipped both our goods together.

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,759
My own goods got mixed in too.

83
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,479
You jerk.

84
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,439
Qiang Ge.

85
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Could they be teaming up to trick you?

86
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,520
Qiang Ge.

87
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,599
I've already investigated.

88
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,960
This is the list of goods the police seized.

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,719
See if your goods are on it.

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,040
Qiang Ge.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
You saw it too, right?

92
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,920
I didn't seize your goods.

93
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,439
They really got confiscated.

94
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,240
I couldn't do anything about it.

95
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,439
Now you've reported my goods too.

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,639
How about

97
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,800
we call it even?

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,519
What do you two think?

99
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,199
Qiang Ge, I think—

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,399
Pete can be a bit sneaky,

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,680
but this time he really didn't

102
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,639
try to keep the goods for himself.

103
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,879
If we keep him around,

104
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
it's another supply channel for us.

105
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,959
There's a saying in China—

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,680
Be forgiving when you can.

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,839
That's right, Qiang Ge.

108
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,399
Discretion is the better part of valor.

109
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,720
A step forward opens up endless possibilities.

110
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,519
Alright.

111
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,360
We'll let it go this time.

112
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,439
If anything goes wrong next time,

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,759
I'll blame it all on you.

114
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,120
Thank you, Qiang Ge.

115
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:20,920
Thanks, thanks.

116
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,959
Take care, Qiang Ge.

117
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,839
I really don't know if I should thank you

118
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
or curse you out.

119
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,160
Pete—

120
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,360
We almost got tossed in the sea because of you.

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,519
We haven't even beaten you up yet.

122
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,759
My bad, my bad.

123
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,680
Let me ask you—

124
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,759
that game,

125
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,240
are you still buying it?

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Look at me now—

127
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
do I look like I can afford a game?

128
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
I know a buyer.

129
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
A big boss.

130
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,000
Rich and knows the business.

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,920
He can definitely buy your game.

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,040
Really?

133
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,560
Yeah.

134
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,439
Come on.

135
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,079
This boss is Korean.

136
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,560
His company is in the capital.

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,639
Korea.

138
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,639
The capital.

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,920
Miss Zhao.

140
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,079
That's the end of my story.

141
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,360
These experiences

142
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,240
led me to seek you out.

143
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,319
Guess it's fate.

144
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,480
Next,

145
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,439
I'd like to talk with you

146
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,079
about the game I brought.

147
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
If you were a player,

148
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,000
what would you want most?

149
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,480
It's all about the best weapons.

150
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
And top-tier gear.

151
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,319
Right?

152
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,920
If you score a rare weapon,

153
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,920
or some elite gear,

154
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,399
what's the first thing you'd do?

155
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,480
Of course, you'd show off to your friends.

156
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,199
Brag a little, right?

157
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,319
Say all your friends have seen it,

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,959
and you've admired it yourself.

159
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,720
Wouldn't you want to share it with strangers?

160
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,759
But if those strangers

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,120
aren't interested in your gear at all,

162
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,160
or maybe

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,399
they don't even play games,

164
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,199
so,

165
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,839
I think if there were a place

166
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,279
where people who play the same game

167
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,959
or just love gaming could gather,

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,439
and share with each other,

169
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,480
and show off,

170
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
then those people

171
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,399
would treat that place like home.

172
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,680
Mr. Zhou and I think exactly alike.

173
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
My company is working on

174
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,879
an online game built around interaction.

175
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,079
Even if the veterans think I'll fail,

176
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,399
I don't care.

177
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,759
I believe

178
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,319
this will lead a new era.

179
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,319
Yes.

180
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,720
What's wrong?

181
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
The game they brought has issues.

182
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,600
Would you like to take a look?

183
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,279
Mr. Zhou's game is quite interesting,

184
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,480
but

185
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,680
it has major problems.

186
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,440
Mr. Zhou,

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,879
you almost had my trust just now.

188
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,639
But unfortunately,

189
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,559
this game

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,879
doesn't make the cut.

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,919
Mr. Zhou,

192
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,200
your game's source code is missing a lot.

193
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,639
It's not just unfinished,

194
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,080
it could crash at any time.

195
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,399
He says the game is incomplete,

196
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,720
and could crash at any moment.

197
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,279
Crash?

198
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,639
If the missing source code

199
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,360
still means there's a risk of crashing,

200
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,799
then to launch this game,

201
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,799
we'd need to invest more people and time

202
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
to fix everything.

203
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,159
It's not worth it for the company.

204
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,399
It was always just a prototype.

205
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,600
I don't care if it's unfinished.

206
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,240
I want to see the finished product.

207
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,720
But...

208
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,639
Go ahead.

209
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,440
No,

210
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
how did this game get corrupted?

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,679
How would I know?

212
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,279
I can't make sense of it either.

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,879
Mr. Pan made this game just fine.

214
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,639
It shouldn't be like this.

215
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,440
Something must've gone wrong.

216
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,399
Let's try.

217
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,279
Ask the tech lead.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,440
I'll follow your lead.

219
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,159
We have to try whatever we can now.

220
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,080
Let's go ask.

221
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,039
Come in.

222
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,679
What can I do for you?

223
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:44,919
Go ask him.

224
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:45,759
Is our game

225
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,840
actually working or not?

226
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,159
What's wrong with our game?

227
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,519
There's a problem with the code.

228
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,679
Only your developers in China can fix it.

229
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,799
The tech lead says

230
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,600
the game code has issues.

231
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,399
Only Mr. Pan can solve it.

232
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,279
Thank you.

233
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,799
You're welcome.

234
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Rui, Rui, Rui!

235
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,840
Their game looks pretty fun.

236
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:13,600
Check it out.

237
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,279
Pete,

238
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,279
can you ask him for me?

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Can we try this game?

240
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,480
Hello.

241
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,039
What are you working on?

242
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,960
We're testing a mainland game.

243
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,600
How is it?

244
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,320
Want to give it a try?

245
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,080
My friend is hooked on your game.

246
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,240
If possible,

247
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,039
let him try it out.

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,480
Of course.

249
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,639
The tech lead says we can give it a go.

250
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,240
Thanks.

251
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,039
Thank you.

252
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,039
Please be sure to tell me later

253
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,960
how you feel about the game.

254
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,480
The tech lead wants our feedback.

255
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,360
Okay.

256
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,679
Thank you.

257
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,159
How do you play this?

258
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:08,960
With the mouse?

259
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,879
Yeah, come on, come on.

260
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,759
Do I pick this one or that one?

261
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,840
Definitely this one.

262
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,879
Bro, click it with the mouse.

263
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,320
What is this thing?

264
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,200
One, two, three, four.

265
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,399
There's something! Something's here!

266
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,519
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

267
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,559
Look, something dropped!

268
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,840
Where are those two Chinese guys?

269
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,600
They're trying out our new online game.

270
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,960
What feedback?

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Looks like they really like our game.

272
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,480
They've been playing all afternoon.

273
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,000
How's the global agent recruitment going?

274
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,480
The response is average.

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,039
So far, only one Chinese company is interested.

276
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,559
But their offer is very low.

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,799
Just one hundred thousand dollars.

278
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,159
Of course,

279
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,080
that's just their initial offer.

280
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,799
The boss of that company

281
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,720
wants to meet us in Yucheng, China.

282
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,440
Miss Zhao

283
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,279
Are we still buying games
from Chinese developers?

284
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,960
As long as they finish the game
and the deal goes smoothly.

285
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,440
Alright.

286
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
I had someone ask around
in Yucheng.

287
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,919
The developer of that game

288
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,320
is indeed Mr. Pan.

289
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,720
But since he’s working alone,

290
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,840
the game’s development
is moving slowly.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,879
No rush.

292
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Good games require patience.

293
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,879
Besides, if any issues come up,

294
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,159
they’re in Korea,

295
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,320
so there’s nothing to worry about.

296
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,679
Do we still need to sign
a contract with them?

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Yes.

298
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,960
We absolutely must sign.

299
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,360
Pay fifty thousand up front
to show our sincerity.

300
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,080
If they can’t deliver,

301
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,720
then our legal team

302
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,600
will sue them

303
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,320
until they go bankrupt.
