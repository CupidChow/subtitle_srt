1
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,920
Just a small token, nothing fancy.

2
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,000
Please, Jiang Long, accept it.

3
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,280
Just a little something.

4
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,319
Of course.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,719
As for me,

6
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,840
I have another favor to ask.

7
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,719
I hope you can help me out.

8
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,560
In the future,

9
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,280
I'll have a generous gift for you.

10
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,359
That depends if I can actually help.

11
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
You can.

12
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,159
Brother Jiang,

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,040
if you help me get Zuma Land,

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,000
I, Li Changtian, will reward you well.

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,599
The rights to Zuma Land.

16
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,319
It's just three hundred thousand dollars.

17
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,760
Why come to me, Mr. Li?

18
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,280
I didn't say the rights to Zuma Land.

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,680
I meant Zuma Land itself.

20
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,840
Feels pretty nice.

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,199
Nice? Not really.

22
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,680
Money's stressing me out.

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,560
Jiayi's dancing to cheer us up.

24
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,960
Hey guys,

25
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,719
let me show you something.

26
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,159
Two hundred thousand dollars.

27
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,639
That's my absolute limit.

28
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,719
Jiaming.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,159
How'd you pull that off?

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,840
Did you forget where I work?

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,199
The bank, man.

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,039
You didn't rob the bank, did you?

33
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,319
Of course not.

34
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,800
It's my mortgage loan for a wedding home.

35
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,120
None of you knew, huh?

36
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,879
I almost had to beg my old man.

37
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,759
I told him, if he didn't help,

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,039
I'd never get married, ever.

39
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,639
No worries.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,159
I can introduce you to my rich friend.

41
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,960
Really? That's great.

42
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,199
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,240
Awesome.

44
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,639
Awesome.

45
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,080
Awesome.

46
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright, enough with the "awesome."

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,719
Don't forget,

48
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,199
you're still short a hundred thousand.

49
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,319
That's a buzzkill.

50
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,759
Miss Zhao,

51
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
do you think our Bowen

52
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,000
is worth a hundred thousand dollars?

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Come on, don't joke.

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,840
Hey, Old Pan.

55
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,360
He's right.

56
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,560
He means

57
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,639
we trade technology for equity.

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,839
It's popular overseas.

59
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,040
That's exactly what I meant.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,560
That's actually a good idea.

61
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,519
I'm open to the technology for equity option.

62
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,519
But the legal contracts

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,319
must be signed,

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,639
not a single one missing.

65
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,759
You can treat it like a binding contract.

66
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,680
Everyone

67
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,839
has their own value.

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,759
That's how the market works.

69
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,040
You need to learn to accept it.

70
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,879
After all, you don't have much time left.

71
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,920
Technology for equity, huh?

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,879
Make a half-baked game and get shares?

73
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,560
That Jiang Long guy,

74
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,959
didn't get anything done,

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
and brought useless info to take credit.

76
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,199
That guy, Zhou Mingrui,

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,959
I remember him now.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,079
Back then,

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,160
Old Cripple's business in Raonan District

80
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,319
was snatched by him, right?

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,040
That's right.

82
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,839
It was him.

83
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,720
Get some guys for dirty work.

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,160
Make sure it's quick and clean.

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,639
Okay.

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Jiaming,

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,279
until Miss Zhao's final deadline

88
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,439
there are only two days left.

89
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,519
All the money we have now,

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,920
it's only about two hundred twenty thousand dollars.

91
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,040
Son of a bitch.

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,319
That Peter Zhang—

93
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,920
he'd better hope I don't run into him.

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,600
If I had that fifty thousand deposit,

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,079
I'd still have the confidence

96
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,519
to negotiate with Miss Zhao.

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,000
Right?

98
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:52,879
Rui,

99
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,680
Rui,

100
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
look who's here.

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,279
Peter Zhang.

102
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,199
You actually dared to show up?

103
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,800
Gentlemen,

104
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
please, don't be angry.

105
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,959
I'm here to help you.

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
I wronged Mr. Zhou before,

107
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,079
and I really feel bad about it.

108
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,279
Cut the act.

109
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,959
Why didn't you think of that when you tricked me?

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,879
If I hadn't been smart,

111
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,879
I'd be dead in a barrel by now.

112
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,240
No, no, nothing like that.

113
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,639
Alright.

114
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,959
Since you're here today,

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,519
don't even think about leaving.

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,240
Jiaming,

117
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,240
call Miss Zhao.

118
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,199
I'm here to make amends.

119
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,000
Look,

120
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,199
Boss, a bowl of noodles, please.

121
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
Just like theirs.

122
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,800
After I left Korea,

123
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,839
I came straight to Yucheng.

124
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,040
After some digging,

125
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,399
I found Jiang Long is mixed up with them.

126
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,600
That guy—

127
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,240
his name is Yang Zhicheng.

128
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,319
His godfather is Li Changtian.

129
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,800
He monopolized the mainland CD market.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,519
His business is huge.

131
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,240
Now he's moving into the internet.

132
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,959
He saw games making money lately,

133
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
so he's getting into that too.

134
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,160
Yang Zhicheng—

135
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,879
what,

136
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,600
you guys know him too?

137
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,240
Wait a second.

138
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,800
Li Changtian—

139
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,079
CDs...

140
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,680
I remember now.

141
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,639
Back when we were in the CD business,

142
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
Li Changtian was the boss behind the scenes.

143
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,399
Even in Sister Feng's business now,

144
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,319
he still has shares.

145
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,800
Li Changtian...

146
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,680
Funny how things work out.

147
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,199
A year ago, this guy

148
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,399
saved Jiaming and me.

149
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,240
But now,

150
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,759
what does he have to do with us?

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,519
Come on, boss,

152
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,959
he's the one fighting you

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,439
for the Zuma Land distribution rights.

154
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, it's him?

155
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,319
So, if that's the case,

156
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,639
Li Changtian must be loaded.

157
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,040
If he suddenly throws money at it

158
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,600
and grabs the Zuma Land rights—

159
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,560
No, no, no.

160
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,639
Boss,

161
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,920
you're overthinking it.

162
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,839
Everyone in the business knows Li Changtian.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,680
He's got huge ambitions.

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120
I'm sure he doesn't just want the rights.

165
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,519
He wants the whole Zuma Land game.

166
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,439
Look—

167
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,160
when Jiang Long came in,

168
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,800
he didn't have that suitcase.

169
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,360
But he had it when he left.

170
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,800
About what happened before—

171
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,120
it was all my fault.

172
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,680
Boss,

173
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
how about giving me a chance?

174
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,399
You didn't come here to apologize.

175
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,360
You just want

176
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,759
to ask if Li Changtian will

177
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,120
join the Zuma Land distribution business.

178
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,360
But he ignored you.

179
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,879
You got shut out.

180
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,240
That's why you came to us, right?

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Gentlemen,

182
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,199
I'm just a businessman.

183
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,759
I go wherever the money is.

184
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,360
That's just how it works.

185
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,439
Hope you understand.

186
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,560
I heard

187
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,959
your wife is close with Miss Zhao.

188
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
I'd like to ask her

189
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,840
to put in a good word for me with Miss Zhao.

190
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,320
No way.

191
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,600
I had some supply channels in Korea,

192
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,600
but Miss Zhao cut them all off.

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,879
Whatever you need me to do from now on,

194
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,240
I'll do it.

195
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,440
If I break my word,

196
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,639
may lightning strike me down.

197
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,679
Mr. Peter,

198
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,879
here's the situation—

199
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,240
right now,

200
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,799
we're all worried about the money.

201
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,080
It's driving us crazy.

202
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,399
So,

203
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,279
we really don't have time to meet Miss Zhao.

204
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,600
That's true.

205
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,120
We want to distribute Zuma Land,

206
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,720
but we can't raise the money.

207
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,840
Gentlemen,

208
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,080
I genuinely want to invest too.

209
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,679
How about this—

210
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,919
let's be honest with each other.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,120
How much are you short?

212
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:11,840
I...

213
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,519
I'll put it up.

214
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,759
What do you think?

215
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,519
Three hundred thousand dollars.

216
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,879
Three hundred thousand dollars.

217
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,279
I don't have that much.

218
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,879
Well then, Mr. Peter,

219
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,759
we've already raised two hundred thousand.

220
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,039
We're still short a hundred thousand.

221
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,600
A hundred thousand left to go.

222
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
I've already got it ready for you.

223
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,519
Look.

224
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,759
Good brother, you are.

225
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,679
Here, take it.

226
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,960
Didn't expect you to be so rich.

227
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,759
How am I rich?

228
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I took your fifty thousand deposit before.

229
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,399
Then made another fifty thousand.

230
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,519
Isn't it all riding on you now?

231
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,320
Come on, eat noodles, eat up.

232
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,600
Try some spice.

233
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,440
This chili is great.

234
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,279
Smells amazing.

235
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,639
Come on.

236
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,559
This pickled veggie is good.

237
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,720
Add some pickled veggies.

238
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,399
We're all friends, dig in, don't be shy.

239
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,080
Come on.
