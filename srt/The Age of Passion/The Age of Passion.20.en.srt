1
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,359
I've already fixed the bug.

2
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,400
This game

3
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,799
has now entered its most crucial stage.

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,400
The character combat debugging phase.

5
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,239
You're so amazing.

6
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,400
This is so difficult.

7
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
Look, none of them know how to do it.

8
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,319
Only you do.

9
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,079
How are you so great?

10
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,159
So cool.

11
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,519
It's alright.

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,519
How is it?

13
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,879
Are you used to living in Korea?

14
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
As long as I can make games,

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,360
it's the same for me anywhere.

16
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,159
Well, in that case,

17
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,680
why don't you stay here?

18
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,039
I'll make you our company's game director.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,280
I can't do that.

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,960
Mingrui and Jiaming are waiting for me back home.

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,680
We have to make our new company a success.

22
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,599
Am I not better than those two guys?

23
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,080
I still think they're better.

24
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,000
Today,

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,639
Kaisheng Games is officially established.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,080
In the field of Chinese gaming,

27
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,120
we will achieve a great victory

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,199
and create a glorious summer.

29
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,000
Great!

30
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,199
I heard from Mr. Zhao in Korea

31
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,599
that Old Pan's game has entered the testing phase.

32
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,400
It can be launched on the market next month.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,280
Then we have to step it up too.

34
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,199
A two-front battle.

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,560
We have to win on both.

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
It's more than just two fronts.

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,439
I heard

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,520
that Feng Jie has been promoting us lately.

39
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,159
We have to win on both fronts.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,479
We will definitely succeed.

41
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,479
Yes!

42
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,560
Success!

43
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,599
Success, success!

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
Success!

45
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,520
Success!

46
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,439
Success, success, success!

47
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,360
Go to point A. This time, go to point A.

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,439
Go through the middle lane.

49
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,439
Point A, point A, point A!

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,919
Take a look.

51
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,919
I brewed this for you myself.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Feng Jie, what's this?

53
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,560
Everyone, quiet down.

54
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,439
Quiet down.

55
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,000
This

56
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,039
is a new game from my partner.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,199
The server will launch in our country next month.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,639
You guys better remember to play it.

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,039
Okay!

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,120
Feng Jie.

61
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,719
If you hadn't said anything,

62
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,400
I would've thought you were handing out wedding invitations.

63
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,479
Just pretend your big sister is getting married.

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,279
Speaking of getting married,

65
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,680
you guys...

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
shouldn't you give me a wedding gift?

67
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,759
Of course we should!

68
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,319
Definitely.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,120
For sure.

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,879
Alright.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,439
Next month, this internet cafe is free.

72
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,480
You guys better come and play

73
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,759
for seven days and seven nights.

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,959
No one is allowed to leave.

75
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,560
Okay, okay, okay.

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,000
You got it, Feng Jie.

77
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:08,959
Brother Rui.

78
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,560
Are you a little nervous?

79
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:12,959
Nervous my ass.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,120
Let me tell you,

81
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,240
this chair...

82
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,240
was a gift from Zhao Meihui.

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,439
It can bring us all good luck.

84
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,319
What's there to be nervous about?

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,639
I have faith in this game.

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,279
Then stop shaking your leg.

87
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,399
Why am I a little nervous too?

88
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,240
Feng Jie.

89
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
Why don't we go out and get something to eat?

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,399
Sounds good to me.

91
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:46,800
Don't move.

92
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:48,720
It's moving.

93
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,600
It's moving! It's moving! It's moving!

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,879
It's moving!

95
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,360
Sixty thousand concurrent players.

96
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,639
Sixty thousand!

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,759
It's moving!

98
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,120
We did it!

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,439
We did it!

100
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,639
We did it!

101
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,959
This is great! We did it!

102
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,160
We did it!

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,120
We did it!

104
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,639
Come on, come on.

105
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,639
Over here, over here.

106
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,519
Hurry up.

107
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,160
Hurry up.

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
You can go this way.

109
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,240
Right here.

110
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,560
Go, go, go!

111
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,120
Let's go together, let's go together.

112
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,920
You click.

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,720
Click here.

114
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,920
Use it, use it, use it!

115
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,560
Use the fire spell! Use it!

116
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,199
What are you doing? Use the fire spell!

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,639
Kaisheng Games developed rapidly.

118
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,160
Its licensed game, Zuma Land,

119
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,720
attracted more and more players.

120
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,639
Do you plan to develop new games?

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,319
Of course.

122
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,040
We at Kaisheng will continue to forge ahead.

123
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,279
We'll give back to the market with more and better titles.

124
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Kaisheng has developed so well in just a few years.

125
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,040
What is the secret to its success?

126
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,279
Hard work.

127
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,040
Perseverance.

128
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,439
And wisdom.

129
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,639
I heard the three of you grew up together.

130
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,399
So, how are your roles distributed?

131
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,839
The three of us brothers,

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,839
we each have our own strengths.

133
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,199
Because we believe

134
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,800
that hard work is an essential spirit for young people.

135
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,480
These ungrateful bastards.

136
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,759
All of this should have been mine.

137
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,720
Fine.

138
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,879
If I, Li Changtian, can't have it,

139
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,839
then no one else can either.

140
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Godfather.

141
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,199
The partnership proposals we sent were all rejected.

142
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,439
Kaisheng has no intention of working with us at all.

143
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,279
That little brother of yours,

144
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,439
I got him out.

145
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,360
This matter,

146
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
let him handle it.

147
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,160
Him?

148
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,279
He was just released.

149
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,240
Isn't that inappropriate?

150
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,799
Getting older, my hearing's not so good.

151
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,039
What did you just say to me?

152
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,799
It's not a good fit, right?

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,960
You told me it's not a good fit.

154
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Not a good fit?
