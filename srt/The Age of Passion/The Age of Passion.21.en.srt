1
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,200
Come.

2
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,760
What kind of liquor is this?

3
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,799
It's so strong.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,599
I told you not to act rashly.

5
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,719
It must've been tough inside, huh?

6
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
What's so tough about it?

7
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,120
I was the boss in there too.

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,000
I ate well and drank the best.

9
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,439
Life was even freer than outside.

10
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,040
Now that I'm out,

11
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,400
I want to do things right.

12
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,200
Find some honest work.

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,640
I'll pave the way for you.

14
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,159
Look at you, all dressed up now.

15
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
You really should help me out.

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,439
I heard

17
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,560
those Zhou Mingrui Brothers

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,760
are doing pretty damn well now.

19
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,439
Don't think about revenge.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,719
We can't mess with those three.

21
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,919
You weren't the one locked up.

22
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,120
Of course you don't care.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,719
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,759
I've always treated you like a brother.

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,199
I kept thinking about you while you were inside.

26
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,280
Cheng Ge.

27
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,960
My parents passed away when I was young.

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,000
I grew up eating at your place.

29
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,560
I've always seen you as family.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
I heard

31
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,400
you got yourself a rich godfather.

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,039
Looks like it's true.

33
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm happy if you're doing well.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,039
Big gold chain.

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,240
Just gave it away.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,960
Now I'm drinking XO with you.

37
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,280
Good stuff.

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
Godfather, huh?

39
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,159
Nice move.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Did you give the money to Zhang Jie?

41
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,719
What money?

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Handled what godfather arranged.

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,000
What? What money?

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,800
What money?

45
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,280
What money?

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,719
Seriously, what money?

47
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,800
If you trust me, don't ask.

48
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll find you a way.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,560
Find what way?

50
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,919
You've already got connections.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,840
You have big money deals.

52
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,759
But you won't let me in.

53
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,280
It's about taking on the Zhou Mingrui Brothers.

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,599
I'll give you fifty thousand yuan.

55
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,319
Nice job, brother.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,919
Good work.

57
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,000
You know,

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,439
while I was inside,

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,719
I thought about this every single day.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
First thing out, I want to do this.

61
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,919
Now I get to make money too.

62
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,719
Why not go for it?

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,240
Tell me.

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,080
When do we do it?

65
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,520
What's the plan?

66
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,439
Time and place.

67
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,639
Sit down first.

68
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,240
Alright.

69
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,160
So, we take our time, right?

70
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,879
No killing anyone.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,720
Everything goes by my plan.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

73
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,279
Alright, we'll do as you say.

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,319
Don't act impulsively.

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,199
Hurry, follow me.

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,120
Follow, let's go, go, go.

77
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,920
Real man.

78
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,680
Come play Zuma.

79
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,639
This poster design is great.

80
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,680
Which one of you designed it?

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,240
Me.

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,600
Make a few more for me later.

83
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,240
Can you do that?

84
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,959
I'll go deliver some to my old friends.

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,439
Have them all hang it up for me.

86
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,240
Sure thing, Feng Jie.

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,519
I'll take care of it now.

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,279
Go ahead.

89
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,079
Give it to me.

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,120
Let's go, let's go.

91
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,560
Lure the boss over here.

92
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,160
Hurry up.

93
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,199
Bring it over.

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,759
Lead it into the corner.

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,000
You're still playing this game?

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

97
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,720
Lots of people.

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,680
Admin.

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,800
Found a boyfriend yet?

100
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,920
You, of course.

101
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,720
Hey, Lao Niu.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,720
Haven't seen you in days.

103
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,519
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,399
What game are you playing?

105
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,879
Just launched Zuma Land.

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,439
The graphics look great.

107
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,639
It's fun.

108
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,680
Let me play for a bit.

109
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,800
Sure, sure.

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,560
Come on, come on.

111
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,120
Make way, make way.

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,879
Let the newbie play.

113
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,439
Let me play, let me play.

114
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,040
Alright, alright.

115
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,040
Move aside, move aside.

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:33,959
Quick.

117
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,959
Lure the boss over here.

118
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,240
Bring it over.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,279
Lead it all the way to the corner.

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,439
Into the corner.

121
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,759
Feng Jie.

122
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,759
It's posted.

123
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,199
It's up, Feng Jie.

124
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,600
Never thought, Feng Jie,

125
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,560
Rui Ge's company is listed overseas.

126
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,120
Of course.

127
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,160
Just look.

128
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,519
Everyone here is playing Zuma.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,079
If he didn't go public,

130
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,079
that'd be strange.

131
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,839
Hey, Feng Jie.

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,439
You're a shareholder too.

133
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,000
Going public made big money.

134
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,519
But you're still running the cybercafe.

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,240
If I were you,

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,399
I'd sell the cybercafe.

137
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Just stay home and count money.

138
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,399
How comfy is that?

139
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,680
You don't know shit.

140
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,920
That Zhou Mingrui,

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
if he hadn't met me,

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,319
if not for this prime spot,

143
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,399
could he have made it big?

144
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,360
That's true.

145
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,800
This cybercafe,

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
is priceless.

147
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
No amount of money could make me sell.

148
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,560
Go get to work.

149
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,240
Today we are gathered here together

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,680
to celebrate our city's famous game company

151
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,160
Kaisheng Technology

152
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,360
successfully listed on Nasdaq

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,040
Now, please welcome Chairman Zhou Mingrui to the stage

154
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,959
Okay

155
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,439
Thank you

156
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,040
Hello to everyone at Kaisheng

157
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Hello

158
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,399
Today is a big day for Kaisheng

159
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,120
It's a day worth celebrating for all of us

160
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,199
Yes

161
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:20,759
Because

162
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,040
Kaisheng has succeeded across the ocean

163
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,879
and gone public

164
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:33,759
Listed, listed, listed

165
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,199
These past few years

166
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,759
Kaisheng

167
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
has struggled and persevered

168
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,079
from an unknown small workshop

169
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,040
to the scale we have today

170
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,519
All the hardships are self-evident

171
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
I want to thank

172
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,519
everyone who helped me along the way

173
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,560
especially

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,639
my two good brothers

175
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,680
Welcome

176
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,000
President Xu

177
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:55,920
President Pan

178
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,040
Welcome

179
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,639
Please invite them to the stage

180
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,800
Let's have President Xu say a few words

181
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,519
In the past

182
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,279
someone told me

183
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,439
success depends on luck and fortune

184
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
I didn't agree

185
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,199
I always believed if you work hard

186
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,560
and persist, you will succeed

187
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,920
But until today

188
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,160
I just realized

189
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,120
the greatest luck for the three of us

190
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,559
was meeting all of you here

191
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,679
Thank you all

192
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,080
Thank you, President Xu

193
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,080
Come

194
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's have President Pan say a few words

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,519
Everyone knows President Pan is quiet

196
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,519
But if he doesn't speak today

197
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,200
it really wouldn't be right

198
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,240
Let's welcome him with applause

199
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,879
President Pan

200
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,039
President Pan, President Pan, President Pan

201
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,799
I want to dance

202
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,080
Kaisheng, Kaisheng, Kaisheng

203
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,120
Kaisheng, Kaisheng, Kaisheng

204
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,639
Kaisheng, Kaisheng, Kaisheng

205
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,919
Kaisheng, Kaisheng, Kaisheng

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Kaisheng, Kaisheng, Kaisheng

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,639
Kaisheng, Kaisheng, Kaisheng

208
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,440
Down with unethical companies

209
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,919
Down with unethical companies

210
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,120
Kaisheng Technology is electronic opium

211
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,399
Kaisheng Technology is electronic opium

212
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
Down with unethical companies

213
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,799
Down with unethical companies

214
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,960
Kaisheng Technology is electronic opium

215
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,240
Kaisheng Technology is electronic opium
