1
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,719
Where is this place?

2
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,480
Rui Ge

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,879
Rui Ge

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,159
This is the spot.

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,920
Peter Zhang

6
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,560
Peter Zhang

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,640
Peter

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,040
Come out!

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Peter

10
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,200
Peter

11
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,520
I'll beat you to death, Peter!

12
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,240
Keep it down.

13
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
Do you think we're at the wrong place?

14
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,800
I was thinking the same, this dump.

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,919
Could Peter Zhang be a scammer?

16
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,039
We can't be that unlucky, right?

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,520
What are you staring at?

18
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,719
Never seen a pretty girl before?

19
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,319
Huh?

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,759
Huh?

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,280
Huh?

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,879
Huh?

23
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,199
Who are these people?

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,680
What do we do next?

25
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,240
How should I know?

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,039
Or maybe...

27
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,159
Wait.

28
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,759
We came all the way out here.

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Jet lag, seasick...

30
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,439
Oh my god.

31
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,240
Hey, buddy.

32
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,680
Damn it!

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I've been waiting here for days.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,280
Finally, you guys showed up.

35
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,000
Hey!

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,919
Who are you, man?

37
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,560
Ah Sheng

38
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,199
Why are you talking to these two?

39
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,800
They're definitely Peter Zhang's lackeys.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,479
They must know where that punk is.

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,560
Buddy,

42
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,280
we're also

43
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,360
here to find Peter Zhang.

44
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,840
We also

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,400
want to know where he is.

46
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,400
Just like you.

47
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,240
What's inside?

48
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,719
None of your damn business.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,319
You say you have nothing to do with Peter Zhang,

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,280
then show us what's in there.

51
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,840
Can't you understand plain language?

52
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,719
Don't move.

53
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,039
What are you doing?

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,199
Your hand's shaking.

55
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,520
Your hand's shaking.

56
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,520
Bro,

57
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,599
we came to Hong Kong, China to collect a debt from Peter Zhang.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,120
He owes our boss a lot of money.

59
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,159
If you want to fight,

60
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,000
drag him down with you.

61
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,080
So you're really not Peter Zhang's lackeys?

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,759
Are you serious?

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,759
It's just a misunderstanding.

64
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,160
It's all a misunderstanding, guys.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,279
Please,

66
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,639
let my friend go first.

67
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,600
Fine, I'll let go.

68
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,639
But you put the knife down first.

69
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,279
It's down.

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,040
Give it to me.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,199
Damn it!

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,560
I'll deal with you later.

73
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,800
Sorry about that.

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,160
Guys,

75
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,519
here's my card.

76
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,319
If you find Peter Zhang,

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,319
please let us know.

78
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,639
Thanks.

79
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,920
No problem.

80
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,920
Let's go.

81
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,319
Damn it!

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,519
When did you learn Cantonese?

83
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,959
From movies, punk.

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,040
What the hell is going on?

85
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,120
It's that Peter Zhang.

86
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,959
Every time I see him, I want to hit him.

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,959
He's totally unreliable.

88
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm telling you, he's a scammer.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
What's this now?

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Bosses,

91
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,360
Over here.

92
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,959
Who are you?

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,560
Who?

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,319
Me.

95
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,079
I'm the Peter Zhang you're looking for.

96
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,160
Bosses,

97
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,360
it's not safe here.

98
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,160
Let's talk over there.

99
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,800
Come on, let's go.

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,920
I'll smash you!

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,920
Are you kidding me?

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,199
You eat this much by yourself?

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,959
Were you starving in your past life?

104
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Sorry.

105
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,079
Sorry.

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
Things are tense lately.

107
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,879
I don't dare go out.

108
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,199
I haven't eaten in days.

109
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,360
Let me calm down first.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,759
You came out with us so easily.

111
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,399
Didn't you hear we're here to collect?

112
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
I never owed money in the mainland.

113
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,079
I'm doing fine in the mainland.

114
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,720
Usually, mainland friends come to me

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,920
for business.

116
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,079
What kind of business are you here for?

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,519
I heard you like Pan Bowen's game.

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,120
You want to buy it, right?

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,360
The Pan you're talking about is...

120
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,680
Pan Bowen

121
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,759
The college student you met in Beijing?

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,319
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

123
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,519
This game is awesome.

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,879
It's sure to be a hit.

125
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,800
But...

126
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,560
Mr. Pan says it's not finished yet.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,319
Seems he doesn't want to sell.

128
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:10,839
He's been avoiding me.

129
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,160
Nothing I can do.

130
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,759
I had to come back to Hong Kong, China.

131
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,439
Let me tell you,

132
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

133
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,920
Just tell me

134
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,040
how much you're willing to pay.

135
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,759
Four hundred thousand Hong Kong dollars.

136
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,839
But I don't have the money right now.

137
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,560
Are you messing with me?

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,480
No, no.

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,680
It's just that the previous buyer

140
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,199
bought another game.

141
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,439
So...

142
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,959
I have to find a new buyer.

143
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,800
Start over.

144
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,839
How long to find a new one?

145
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,959
Tell me.

146
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,319
If it's quick,

147
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,759
maybe a month or two.

148
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,920
If it's slow,

149
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
a year and a half.

150
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,680
A year and a half.

151
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,360
Don't go, don't leave!

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,399
You all saw it too.

153
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm stuck at home, can't get out.

154
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,199
I can't find any buyers.

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,639
How about this?

156
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,120
Can you help me with a tiny problem?

157
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,759
Five hundred thousand.

158
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,439
If the game sells less than that,

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,040
I'll pay the difference myself.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,680
What do you think?

161
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,399
Are you serious?

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm serious, really.

163
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,720
Absolutely serious.

164
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,279
Guaranteed, no tricks.

165
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
We'll help.

166
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
What shady thing did that fat guy do?

167
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,320
Why do so many people hate him?

168
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,799
How would I know? Run!

169
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,840
Stop chasing!

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,159
Don't leave!

171
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,919
Don't go.

172
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,279
Oh my god.

173
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Bastard!

174
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,440
Peter Zhang, that guy...

175
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,159
We've been tricked.

176
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,440
That fat guy used us as pawns.

177
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,799
What now?

178
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
What should we do?

179
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,799
What now? We can't leave either.

180
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,919
Don't forget,

181
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,360
Pan Bowen is still waiting for us.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,559
It's fine, it's fine.

183
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,320
As long as we stay positive,

184
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,279
there's always a way out.

185
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,440
Or maybe...

186
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,519
Let's go talk to them again.

187
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,200
Talk?

188
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,279
How do we talk?

189
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,120
Don't make that face again.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,919
Change your clothes first.

191
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,159
Change clothes?

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,960
Trust me.
