1
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,079
Nine Bamboo

2
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,120
Two Bamboo

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,519
Help me out, help me out.

4
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,079
Damn it! You still dare show up?

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,879
Of course I do.

6
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,400
So, what now?

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,520
What’s up?

8
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,680
Here to get yourself killed?

9
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,120
Don’t get me wrong.

10
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,439
Don’t get me wrong.

11
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,199
Your own brother brought us here himself.

12
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,199
Hear us out.

13
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,080
Go ahead.

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,039
We want to talk.

15
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,080
Get that damn fat guy over here.

16
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,840
Me and you two mainland hicks—

17
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,319
Nothing left to say.

18
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,800
Zhao Ge.

19
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,919
That damn fatso.

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,039
He’s too scared to come.

21
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,159
About this matter—

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,759
No need to make it so—

23
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,520
So ugly, right?

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,159
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,560
What’s the point?

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,719
Am I the one messing with him?

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,599
It’s all that damn fat guy’s fault.

28
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,240
Damn it! Damn your whole family!

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,759
He said he had good stuff.

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
Asked me to team up with him.

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,039
And what happened?

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,400
Cops showed up before the goods even landed.

33
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,000
We all know where those goods came from.

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,759
Everyone knows the score.

35
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,439
Can’t get them back now.

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,840
I don’t care.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,520
That damn guy has to take full responsibility.

38
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,240
That’s right.

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,280
Please, let me explain.

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,159
I’ll say it.

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Here’s what I think—

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
It’s just about paying back the money.

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,240
If you don’t let him earn,

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,400
how’s he supposed to pay you back?

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
He hasn’t even started making money.

47
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,759
None of the brothers have gotten paid.

48
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,159
That damn fat guy—

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,240
I don’t trust him.

50
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,280
If you ask me—

51
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,879
Zhao Ge,

52
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,879
Everyone slips up sometimes.

53
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,319
Even a horse stumbles.

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,879
The most important thing—

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,599
is the brothers.

56
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,400
Let’s get to work first.

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Yeah.

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,560
What?

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Got any good ideas?

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,639
Zhao Ge.

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Have you ever thought about—

62
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,080
going legit?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,039
Pretty boy,

64
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,800
That’s easy for you to say.

65
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,719
I’d like to go legit too.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,039
But where’s all that cargo to move?

67
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,360
Hands—

68
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,319
Zhao Ge.

69
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,720
What?

70
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,160
mainland China.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,839
mainland China can take all the goods you’ve got.

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,600
Just think—

73
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,279
DVD players,

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,199
discs,

75
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,439
or tapes—

76
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,079
as many as you want.

77
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,600
And all guaranteed authentic.

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,519
When the time comes,

79
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,240
you and your crew

80
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
will definitely have work.

81
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,879
Hey, Zhao Ge,

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,959
do you know this guy?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,560
Is it Bill?

84
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,720
This guy’s a real big shot.

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,120
He owns a huge mall in mainland China.

86
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,240
Is that enough for you?

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,920
Let’s go.

88
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,560
Come on, come on.

89
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,199
Brother—

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
You’re so impressive,

91
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,519
why are you still vouching for that damn guy?

92
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,879
Zhao Ge,

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,720
just ran into a little trouble.

94
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,279
That’s business.

95
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,199
It’s all—

96
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,680
I help you,

97
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,800
you help me.

98
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,360
If I hadn’t helped Peter Zhang,

99
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
how would I have met you?

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,959
Or done such big deals?

101
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,399
Makes sense, brother.

102
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,040
Someone—

103
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:22,920
Bring the wine!

104
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,040
Alright, coming!

105
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,759
Bring out the good stuff we got this morning.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,480
Serve it up.

107
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:26,959
Alright.

108
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,720
I want to ask—

109
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,319
What are your surnames, brothers?

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,079
Zhou.

111
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,759
Xu.

112
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,279
Tonight, with Brother Zhou and Brother Xu,

113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,639
we drink till we drop!

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,399
Cheers!

115
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,879
Alright, Zhao Ge.

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
But I need a favor from you.

117
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,519
After we drink,

118
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,959
can you introduce someone

119
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,240
to me?

120
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,920
No problem.

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Come on, come on.

122
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,319
Alright, alright, alright.

123
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,879
You piss me off!

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,360
You know I hate people with no limits.

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,319
Even stealing an old man’s life savings—

126
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,639
People like that—

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,199
should be tossed in the sea

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,720
and fed to the sharks!

129
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,839
Alright, Qiang Ge.

130
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,439
Alright.

131
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,160
Are you stupid?

132
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,439
I was just talking.

133
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,319
We’re good citizens.

134
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,480
Just dump them at the police station.

135
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,319
Okay.

136
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,439
You two

137
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,240
are working for Peter Zhang

138
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,000
the two mainland hicks cleaning up his mess?

139
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,720
Actually,

140
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,160
we came here specifically

141
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,560
hoping to discuss business with Qiang Ge.

142
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,279
How much is Peter Zhang worth?

143
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,279
I really can't stand that damn fat guy,

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,800
but

145
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,800
I hate traitors who betray their friends even more.

146
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't get the wrong idea, Qiang Ge.

147
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,600
We're not here to betray Peter Zhang.

148
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
So what kind of business do you want to discuss?

149
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,799
Qiang Ge, don't be rash.

150
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
Please, have a seat.

151
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,000
Hear me out first.

152
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,919
Here's the situation.
