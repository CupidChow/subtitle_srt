1
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,879
Since Jiayi has spoken up,

2
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,640
I'll let Peter Zhang off the hook.

3
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,599
I'll come to your company tomorrow.

4
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,799
Wait for me. Bye.

5
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,959
Jiang Long.

6
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,640
There's an agency contract to sign tomorrow.

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,959
Have legal draft it for us.

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,200
Understood.

9
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,879
No wonder it's a seafood place.

10
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
So much seafood.

11
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,080
Eat as much as you want.

12
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,360
If we finish it, there's more.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,360
Peter,

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,560
You should really watch your figure.

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,000
Eat a little less.

16
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,840
Aren't you worried about high cholesterol?

17
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,400
It's fine.

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,719
Second bro, you—

19
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,319
You've worn those shades all night.

20
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,039
Trying to look cool.

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,199
Mainly,

22
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,159
they're expensive.

23
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,560
Let's get to business.

24
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,199
Once the contract is signed,

25
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,439
localizing the game is a huge project.

26
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,360
We'll be busy then.

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,199
Yeah.

28
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,360
By the way,

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,280
I've been thinking,

30
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,879
when our Old Pan

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,639
goes to Korea to make a new game,

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,319
the rest of us here

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,400
need to build a solid foundation.

34
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,080
Right?

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,800
To prepare for future games.

36
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,680
Come on.

37
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,039
Cheers!

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
No one can keep fish!

39
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,199
Bottoms up!

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,159
I will.

41
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:09,879
Me too.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,879
Zhou Mingrui.

43
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,360
It's them.

44
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:18,960
Get them!

45
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,319
Mingrui!

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,960
Are we about to get screwed here?

47
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,199
Hit them!

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,120
Go!

49
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,040
Are you okay?

50
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:36,759
Run!

51
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:37,839
Run!

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
Go, go!

53
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,000
Get in the car!

54
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,839
They went way too hard on us.

55
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,959
If I hadn't shown up in time,

56
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,560
you guys would've been toast.

57
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,519
I've thought about it.

58
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,720
It must be Li Changtian.

59
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,839
Around here,

60
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,680
only that bastard has the power.

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,959
The police should be after them now.

62
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,000
We should be safe.

63
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,360
Here's what I think:

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,079
You all go home first.

65
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,279
Will you be okay on your own?

66
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,040
Let's go.

67
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,199
Mingrui.

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
Where am I supposed to go?

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
We were just at my place.

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,040
Old Pan.

71
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,920
How about you stay with me tonight?

72
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,160
I'll help you pack in the morning.

73
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,279
I don't have anywhere to go either.

74
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,680
How about

75
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,800
I stay at your place too?

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,199
You were the fastest runner.

77
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,439
Go sleep at a hotel.

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,160
Let's go.

79
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on.

80
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,279
Careful.

81
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,879
Are you alright?

82
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,879
Why are you back?

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,040
Liang Yufeng.

84
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,639
You silly girl.

85
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,839
So immature.

86
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,800
How should I punish you all?

87
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:40,959
Godfather.

88
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,000
So what do we do next?

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
That Jiang Long—

90
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,439
From the very start,

91
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,439
he never planned to trade us the game source code.

92
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,000
He just wants the money without working.

93
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,120
Is my money that easy to get?

94
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Son,

95
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,319
let me tell you—

96
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,800
Remember this.

97
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,759
Everyone has a price tag

98
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,800
hanging over their head.

99
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,120
There's a price on it.

100
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,000
If you meet their price,

101
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,519
they'll do whatever you want.

102
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,319
Got it?

103
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,759
Send another five hundred thousand to Jiang Long.

104
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,919
If he dares refuse,

105
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
tell him

106
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,039
he won't get Zuma Land.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,039
I'll go talk to Zhao Meihui myself

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,720
about her employee's bribery.

109
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,279
When the time comes,

110
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,159
let's see how the Zhao family deals with him.

111
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,399
Understood.

112
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll go right now.

113
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:50,879
Okay.

114
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,279
Zhou Mingrui.

115
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,399
Liang Yufeng.

116
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,559
Interesting.
