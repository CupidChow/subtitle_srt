a certain amount of accountability.

190
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,440
I just can't do it, Rin.

191
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,480
It hurts.

192
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,120
It really hurts.

193
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,600
Okay, okay.

194
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,760
It's just...

195
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,080
taking a bath, okay?

196
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,320
Yes, just take a bath.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,720
Thank you, Rin.

198
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,520
Thank you for seeing me at the hospital.

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,040
And now you're giving me a bath, too.

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,320
Mm...

201
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,600
I see this like

202
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,280
giving a puppy a bath.

203
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:02,671
But this young pup is really adorable,
isn't it?

204
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,560
Really?

205
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
Ow...

206
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Hey...

207
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,240
Oh...

208
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,600
Ouch.

209
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,040
Hey.

210
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,720
You got an injury here, too.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
Is it a deep cut?

212
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't know.

213
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
Maybe it's only skin deep.

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,920
I got it during the car accident.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
And...

216
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,520
You've been enduring the pain all night?

217
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Yes.

218
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,160
If it were just a splinter,

219
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
I would've taken it out forever ago.

220
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Khem.

221
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
You've been there for me for so long.

222
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,700
Now, let me do it, too.

223
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Rin.

224
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Are you going to give me a show?

225
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Nope.

226
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm simply paying you back.

227
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,680
You're not declining, are you?

228
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,960
Now, do you know how it feels?

229
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I do...

230
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Hey.

231
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,680
It's only the second time,
and you're already out of breath?

232
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm not.

233
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,360
Are you sure?

234
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,400
How about we do it for the third time?

235
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,000
Rin!

236
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,920
That's enough.

237
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,880
If we keep going,
it might be too much for me.

238
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,840
Okay.

239
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:47,912
Watch your hand.

240
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,360
- Hold it here.
- I forgot that I was in pain.

241
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,800
So, it's time to take a bath.

242
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,440
Why are you so shaky?

243
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
I don't know.

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
I don't know it either.

245
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,720
How about...

246
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,200
we go for another round?

247
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,960
Oh, Rin!

248
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,920
I can't do it anymore.

249
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,120
I can't continue.

250
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,880
Come on! Let's go for one more round.

251
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,400
Please stop, Rin.

252
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,840
One more.

253
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Get up. Hurry!

254
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Well...

255
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,960
It's my turn, okay?

256
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,330
Oh!

257
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,760
Khem!

258
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
That's enough.

259
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,080
Your hand is injured, remember?

260
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,520
This hand is fine, though.

261
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,200
There!

262
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,840
Rin, you're a meanie.

263
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,560
I can't.

264
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
I just can't.

265
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,280
Why did you harass my daughter-in-law?

266
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,640
Khemjira...

267
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,000
is my daughter's husband.

268
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,840
Nobody might have known about this,

269
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
but even if Khemjira is just an employee,

270
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,480
you have no right to harass her.

271
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,640
Can you explain the reasons
for your actions?

272
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

273
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
I was just angry that she came in

274
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,960
and got my partner laid off.

275
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
Your partner?

276
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Do you think we lay off
employees without justification?

277
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
Our rules and regulations

278
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,680
have been approved by the legal department.

279
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,560
If an employee were to get fired
without a reason,

280
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
don't you think they'd take legal action?

281
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,480
I already told them to do it,

282
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
but they refused.

283
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,040
That's because they're in the wrong.

284
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,360
You probably don't know the reasons

285
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,640
behind your partner's termination.

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Your partner got fired

287
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,320
because of an inappropriate
workplace relationship

288
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
during work hours.

289
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
They were caught on CCTV, too.

290
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,120
They wouldn't dare tell you the truth.

291
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,880
Now, I hope that's clear.

292
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,920
At my company,

293
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,440
I'm allowed to assign Khemjira
to any role or line of work.

294
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,320
There's no need for me to fire your partner
and replace them with her.

295
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
More importantly...

296
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,880
I'd like you to remember this.

297
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,080
If it weren't for Khemjira's request,

298
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
you wouldn't have just received a warning.

299
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,560
Dad.

300
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,280
Are you done with the meeting?

301
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,760
Mm.

302
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
Don't tell me that

303
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,040
you just gave her a warning.

304
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
That's what Khem requested.

305
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
Now, it's my turn

306
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,840
to make her pay.

307
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:04,920
What are you going to do?

308
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,240
As her wife,

309
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,280
I have my own ways.

310
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,080
I think this is pretty good, too.

311
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,870
Right.

312
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,560
Gee, is this alright?

313
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,240
Hey.

314
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm asking you if this is okay or not.

315
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,840
It looks okay to me.

316
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
So, we...

317
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,760
Was it you who made the mess yesterday?

318
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,080
I'm sorry, Boss.

319
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,160
I have no idea that Khem is...

320
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,880
your husband.

321
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,760
Even if she isn't my loved one,

322
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,880
you have no right to harass any employee

323
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,680
or anyone in particular.

324
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
On that day,

325
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,440
was it you who locked Khemjira
in the archive?

326
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Answer me!

327
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Yes, it was me, Boss.

328
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,080
I'm really sorry.

329
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,000
Did you know that Khem has claustrophobia

330
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,360
because she was in a serious accident?

331
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
Perhaps you knew that,

332
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,320
which is why you harassed her like that.

333
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,680
I have no idea about that, Boss.

334
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,440
I'm deeply sorry.

335
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,880
I've learned my lesson.

336
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Now that you've admitted your guilt,

337
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,520
focus on your work

338
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,080
and don't cause any more problems
for the company.

339
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,640
I don't want my employees

340
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
wasting time harassing each other.

341
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Here, we're family,

342
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,320
and it has always been my intention

343
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,480
to keep it that way.

344
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,680
Do not jeopardize the structure.

345
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,960
I think it's best we call it here.

346
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
Oh, okay.

347
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,240
Oh, gossip time.

348
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,400
Come here. Quickly.

349
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,440
Balloon.

350
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,240
Boss is such a badass.

351
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,272
I've been alive for over 30 years,

352
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,960
but I've never seen anyone this angry
yet so collected.

353
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,800
Hey.

354
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,760
Get your mind out of the gutter.

355
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,160
She's Khem's wife.

356
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,200
I was talking about Boss,

357
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,720
not Khem.

358
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,120
But I'm talking to you, not Boss.

359
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,560
Hey!

360
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,720
Let's get back to work.

361
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,840
Back to work, everybody.

362
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,520
Let's see...

363
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,560
Mm.

364
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm actually single, though.

365
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,420
If you've got something on your mind,

366
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,960
feel free to tell me.

367
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,520
Huh?

368
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Jay!

369
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm actually available!

370
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,800
Balloon.

371
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,000
You're the biggest bigmouth in the company.

372
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,960
It's a big deal, you see.

373
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,520
So I have to keep you posted, no?

374
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,960
Also, do you know that Jay and I...

375
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Huh?!

376
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,440
Don't tell me you're going to make a move?

377
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Yes.

378
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,840
Boss and you aren't the only ones
running the show.

379
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,983
Whoa.

380
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,960
Also, about us gossiping about Boss...

381
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,720
We're dead afraid right now.

382
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,080
Oh, go ahead and tell them

383
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,200
I don't discuss those matters with Rin.

384
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,760
No need to worry, okay?

385
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh, what a relief.

386
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,040
My heart was about to pop
when Boss walked into the office.

387
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,120
By the way, get well soon, alright?

388
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,360
I'm so lonely out here.

389
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,640
Jay is always too flustered
and keeps running away from me.

390
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,520
Sure thing, Balloon.
See you soon.

391
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,800
Whoa, Rin!

392
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,240
I miss you so much.

393
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,440
I've been waiting so long
to have a meal with you that my tummy hurts.

394
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,200
Why are you waiting for me?

395
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,080
Why don't you have your dinner
and take your medicine?

396
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
Hey.

397
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,920
You didn't take care of yourself, did you?

398
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,800
I want my dear wife to take care of me,
you know?

399
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,560
I love you, Rin.

400
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,960
Gosh! You're annoying.

401
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:05,984
Well...

402
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,969
Rin. Let's go and have a meal.

403
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,520
Hold on.

404
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,680
Hello, Prapai?

405
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,600
What's going on?

406
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,800
Where's the hospital?

407
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,840
Mm.

408
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,800
Please don't go.

409
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,440
It's already late evening.

410
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:42,840
You can see her tomorrow.

411
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
I'll go there with you.

412
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,880
I'm going.

413
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,800
You also need to have a rest.

414
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,680
Have dinner and take your pills.

415
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Rin.

416
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,640
Please stay.

417
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,720
I don't want you to go.

418
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,400
I want to stay with you.

419
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Hey.

420
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,120
Can you stop messing with me?

421
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
I'm going,
and who do you think you are to stop me?

422
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,760
If you go,

423
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
you won't be able to move on

424
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,120
and will keep getting hurt.

425
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,040
She will never come back and love you.

426
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,120
Please stop talking to her.

427
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,960
It's you who needs to stop talking to me.

428
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
Excuse me.

429
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,120
Which room is
the patient named Prapai staying in?

430
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,520
Oh, Ms. Prapai?

431
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
Her room is that way.

432
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Thank you.

433
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,480
Doctor.

434
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,920
How's Prapai?

435
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,760
She fainted

436
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,025
due to the lack of sleep.

437
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
However, she can go home tomorrow.

438
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,000
Did any of her relatives
or her partner come to see her?

439
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I didn't see any.

440
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,720
If that's all, please excuse me.

441
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,720
Thank you.

442
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,800
I'm going to talk to Rin.

443
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
This is getting out of hand.

444
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,600
Hey!

445
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,960
Please don't.

446
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,800
That wasn't her best intention.

447
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,560
We just had some arguments, Kwanrin.

448
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,800
Just some arguments?

449
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,280
Was the cut deep and painful?

450
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,400
Be mad at her for your own sake.

451
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,400
No matter how much you love her,

452
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,720
there's no need to
suppress certain emotions for her.

453
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,680
I'm upset

454
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,640
and a bit sad.

455
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,960
Why didn't you tell her, then?

456
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,000
Even if I did, she wouldn't listen.

457
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,669
Khem.

458
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:35,000
You're acting strange, you know?

459
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,080
Strange? How?

460
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,800
Back then, you used to cheer her up
when she was hurt.

461
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,040
You messed around with her
so she could forget about her past.

462
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,080
Now, you're becoming like her.

463
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,151
You're doing everything you can
to cling to someone you love,

464
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:55,425
even though you're hurting awfully.

465
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,960
You're right.

466
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
I'm becoming who Rin is.

467
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,720
You love her a lot,

468
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,680
so it makes sense.

469
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,480
It's true, of course.

470
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,680
I really love her.

471
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,040
I really do.

472
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,880
But sometimes,

473
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,760
I'm nothing more than a disposable napkin
she uses to wipe away her tears.

474
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,480
It's okay, Khem.

475
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,800
Try again.

476
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,480
You still have a lot more time
to make her forget her past love.

477
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,560
I'm rooting for you, alright?

478
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,480
Thank you, Kwanrin.

479
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,560
"I made you an omelet.
It's on the dining table."

480
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,560
"If you're hungry, go and have it, okay?"

481
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,680
Khem.

482
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,460
Are you hurt?

483
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,720
I'm sorry.

484
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,160
I hope you know
I didn’t mean to do it.

485
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,040
I'm sorry.

486
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,560
I did it a bit too hard.

487
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,560
What do you mean by that?

488
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,920
I mean...

489
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,400
I got up a bit too suddenly.

490
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,720
Oh.

491
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,000
I woke up by myself, actually.

492
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,840
Mm...

493
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,440
As an apology for hurting you
the second time,

494
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,080
I'll let you hitch a ride with me to work.

495
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:41,629
Ow...

496
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Really?!

497
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,960
Mm.

498
00:35:46,872 --> 00:35:49,472
You work late in the morning, though.

499
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,800
I'm cool with having a driver
take me there.

500
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,360
Why do you have to go to work
so early, though?

501
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,960
Is there even anything to do at work?

502
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,520
Mm...

503
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,640
At first, I was afraid of the traffic.

504
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,520
Heading out early means

505
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,240
there's less traffic,

506
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,440
so I'll be able to drive slowly.

507
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
If I head out late,

508
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,480
the traffic's bad, and I have to rush.

509
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,040
I'm scared.

510
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,320
I'm scared that I'll be in a car accident.

511
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,600
Don't be scared,

512
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,040
just come to work with me.

513
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,440
I'm not a reckless driver.

514
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,040
You're good at driving, I know.

515
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,240
Mm.

516
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,360
Let's take a shower together

517
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
so that we won't be late.

518
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,660
Let's go.

519
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,640
Wait, Rin.

520
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,720
Huh?

521
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,600
This is the third time this week.

522
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
You're right.

523
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Yay!

524
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,800
Ow! Ouch!

525
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,360
Are you okay?

526
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,880
You usually don't eat breakfast, right?

527
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
I've...

528
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
I've changed my mind.

529
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,120
You also have to eat a lot

530
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
and finish your plate.

531
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,040
This is such a weird morning.

532
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,960
You seem to care about me more than ever.

533
00:37:58,249 --> 00:37:59,240
You've talked too much.

534
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,760
How sweet of you...

535
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,080
Can you feed me as well?

536
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Don't ask for too much.

537
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,280
- Are you okay now?
- I'm fine.

538
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,840
Good morning.

539
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:32,327
Rin...

540
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,080
How am I supposed to act normal?

541
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,360
Well...

542
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
It's fine.

543
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,160
Come have lunch with me at noon.

544
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
I'll have Mai prepare your dishes.

545
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Why is that?

546
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Well...

547
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,760
No reason.

548
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,085
I have to go now.

549
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,240
Work hard, okay?

550
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Right.

551
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,240
Miss you.

552
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,400
Good morning, everybody!

553
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,320
Good morning, Khem!

554
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Come and sit here.

555
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,800
Alright, alright.

556
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Boss' husband,

557
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,040
you've been away for days, you know?

558
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,560
If we hadn't known that
you're living in the same house as Boss,

559
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,400
Balloon and I would've come and found you.

560
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,720
Here you go.

561
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
It's a get-well gift.

562
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,800
Thank you very much.

563
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Hold up.

564
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
You two are holding hands?

565
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,880
Are you guys finally dating?

566
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,240
Nuts!

567
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,520
Nope!

568
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,960
You're talking nonsense.

569
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,680
Aww...

570
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,600
What is there to be ashamed of
now that you've taken it this far?

571
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,160
Right?

572
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,960
Stop being flustered.

573
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Khem.

574
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,920
Yes?

575
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,560
I've got something to say.

576
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,680
I'm sorry

577
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,320
for hurting you

578
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
because of my misunderstanding.

579
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,640
It's okay.

580
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,120
I'd also like to apologize

581
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,280
for slapping you in the face.

582
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,840
At least now, we're even.

583
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Thank you.

584
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,680
However, I've quit my job.

585
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,600
The head of the department is going to

586
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,249
assign a new leader tomorrow.

587
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,000
Best of luck to you, Gee.

588
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,520
It's a bit weird, isn't it?

589
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,520
Mm, yeah.

590
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,640
She looks like she's made a mistake

591
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,800
and actually feels guilty about it.

592
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,040
I think she's learned a lesson
from what she did.

593
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:37,560
[Director: Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

594
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,120
Today, I...

595
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,920
I feel like I've met
another version of myself,

596
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,280
someone so bottled-up that

597
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,040
they make others feel

598
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,280
insecure,

599
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,160
even though

600
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,720
it's actually me who feels that way.

601
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,840
I thought I was over it with Prapai.

602
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,120
However, I hurt Khem again,

603
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,360
even though she never did the same to me.

604
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,520
I don't want her to end up like me.

605
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,320
I don't want her to feel like
she has to do everything

606
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,120
to make someone stay,

607
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
even though she's in a lot of pain.

608
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,680
From the next morning on,

609
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,240
I'll start over,

610
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,920
not just as her wife,

611
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,520
but as a lover who wants
to make her know that

612
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,040
she is my home,

613
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,760
my peace of mind,

614
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,800
and someone I don't want to lose again.

615
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,520
Praenarin.

616
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,520
Give it your best shot.

617
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,400
The person waiting for you is

618
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,240
someone who truly loves you.

619
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,960
What's with the sad face?

620
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,240
So... Shall we take a bath together?

621
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,440
Do you want us to do our thing?

622
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,120
My right hand still hurts quite a bit,

623
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,680
but my lips and left hand are still fine.

624
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,840
[Prapai]

625
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,240
At the end of the day, you'll be nothing more than
a napkin for her to wipe her tears with,

626
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,080
which she'll throw away when she's done.

627
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,120
Get out of my life.
