00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,840
everyone is jealous of.

189
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,120
Kiri, well...

190
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,960
It's not like that.

191
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,633
Then,

192
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,213
what is it?

193
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,320
I'm already married.

194
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,520
I have a husband.

195
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,560
You're married?

196
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,000
This is not a lie.

197
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,033
It's true.

198
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm not saying that you're lying.

199
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,880
I'm just surprised because...

200
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,894
I've never heard about it.

201
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
I'm married.

202
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,600
Moreover,

203
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,120
you're not my type.

204
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,440
However, don't be so sad

205
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,584
because...

206
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,840
Every man on earth

207
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
isn't my type either.

208
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,880
By the way,

209
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,604
thank you for the flowers.

210
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,753
Kiri.

211
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,720
It's been days since I last saw you.

212
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,920
I miss you so much.

213
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Here's your bouquet of flowers.

214
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,400
You got this just for me?

215
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,513
Mm.

216
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,600
Take it.

217
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,040
But...

218
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
You do know

219
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm allergic to flowers.

220
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,153
I'm sorry.

221
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
I forgot.

222
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
I love you, Kiri.

223
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,160
Even if I make you hurt...

224
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,640
Even if I'm hurt,

225
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,280
I still love you.

226
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,160
Please don't disappear from my life, okay?

227
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,920
Hello, Ms. Maturot?

228
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,040
Ms. Khem,

229
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:02,385
after lunch,

230
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,450
please visit Rin's office.

231
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,360
Uh...

232
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:09,825
Doesn't she have lunch outside?

233
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,160
Yes,

234
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,360
but lately she's been
having lunch in her room.

235
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,440
What kind of drinks does she dislike?

236
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,880
I've never seen her drink anything

237
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
but coffee.

238
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,920
Another thing she loves is chocolate,

239
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,585
both chocolate bars and drinks.

240
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,320
She doesn't drink milk
unless it's in her coffee.

241
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
Oh, I see.

242
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,514
Thank you very much, Ms. Maturot

243
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,440
Milk?

244
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,360
- Rin!
- Good heavens!

245
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,240
Ah.

246
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,160
Surprised. I was surprised.

247
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,600
And...

248
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,045
Why are you here so early?

249
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,520
I told you to see me after lunch, didn't I?

250
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,280
Here it is.

251
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,120
I'm having lunch with my dear wife.

252
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,520
After I'm done,

253
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:41,665
shall we discuss our work right away?

254
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
And what is that?

255
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,320
Oh?

256
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,280
A cup of latte.

257
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,440
Mine's a cup of bubble milk tea.

258
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
Did I ask you to get that for me?

259
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Nope.

260
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,680
I got it myself.

261
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:07,265
I saw you didn't get
8 hours of sleep last night,

262
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,480
so I thought you might want
another cup of coffee.

263
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,800
Hey, listen.

264
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,080
Yes?

265
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,440
Let's just get to the point.

266
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,720
I want you to send me a report

267
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,600
on your performance from Day 1 up to today.

268
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,065
Describe everything thoroughly,

269
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,810
from morning until the end of each day.

270
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,247
A report?

271
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,240
A thorough report?

272
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,080
Yes.

273
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,360
Make it as detailed as you can.

274
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,280
We need to determine

275
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,920
if you'll pass the trial period.

276
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,240
By submitting a report

277
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,880
to the CEO?

278
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,600
Yes.

279
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,520
When's the deadline?

280
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,840
Tomorrow.

281
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,720
Tomorrow?

282
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,080
Sure.

283
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
I'll definitely get it done.

284
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Hey, you.

285
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,680
Don’t you have any questions
or counterarguments?

286
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,400
I don't.

287
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
This is the first job after graduating.

288
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,520
I also have no idea
what things are supposed to be like.

289
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,600
That's why...

290
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,400
My wife's orders

291
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,920
are my command.

292
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,680
Sometimes,

293
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,440
I might overdo things, too.

294
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,400
Hey!

295
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,000
Yes?

296
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,160
I kiss you because I love you, Rin.

297
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,520
How dare you kiss me?

298
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm your boss, remember?

299
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,720
So what?

300
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We're on a break.

301
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,440
I kiss you

302
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,920
while you're taking a break
from being a boss.

303
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
I've done nothing wrong.

304
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Cheeky.

305
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,440
My cheeks and my heart are yours, Rin.

306
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,800
I have to go back to work now.

307
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
See you!

308
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
You crazy girl!

309
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Gosh...

310
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,960
Dealing with a younger partner
is such a mess.

311
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,880
Lastly, it's Khem's turn.

312
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,040
Have you finished your assignment?

313
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,160
I specifically said today is the deadline.

314
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,840
You assigned a new team member
to do this task, Gee?

315
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,800
Isn't it usually Jay and Balloon's?

316
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,680
Everyone on the team
must be able to do all the tasks.

317
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,690
I notice that Khem is a fast learner.

318
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,080
So I decided to give her a shot.

319
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,000
What about you? Did you finish it?

320
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,600
We have to submit the design
to the salesman and the client.

321
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,560
Or are you still working on it?

322
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,080
New employees here can usually
handle all of that

323
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,480
within a week or two.

324
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
It's not like that.

325
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,480
I just want to say that

326
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,120
it's easier than I thought.

327
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,320
Here you go.

328
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,240
Mm.

329
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,760
This is good to go.

330
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,360
Thank you.

331
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,200
Your mentors have done a fantastic job.

332
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,920
Your work is neat and ready to use.

333
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,790
This task may be easy
for experienced workers,

334
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,360
but for a new employee here
for less than a month,

335
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,360
it's great progress.

336
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,320
You did a great job.

337
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Thank you.

338
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,560
Alright.

339
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,440
Let's compile all of the projects
and submit them to the system.

340
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,680
After that, inform the sales department.

341
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Understood, everyone?

342
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,080
Yes!

343
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,160
Yes!

344
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,120
Yay!

345
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,960
I was extremely worried back there.

346
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,440
I thought you didn't finish it.

347
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,840
So was I, actually.

348
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
I almost didn't render the model in time.

349
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,400
Fortunately, I was the last person
in the presentation.

350
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,480
Yeah.

351
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,280
I think Gee has been acting weird.

352
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,640
She knows we didn't teach you the program,

353
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,560
but still gave you the work.

354
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,680
Come on, that isn't important now.

355
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Anyway,

356
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,240
let's go submit the projects to the system.

357
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,200
After work, let's go grab something, okay?

358
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,280
Uh...

359
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,040
I can't make it today.

360
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,160
I have some urgent business to attend to.

361
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Right!

362
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,840
Let's go submit the projects, okay?

363
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
Tag along if you change your mind, okay?

364
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,440
Yes.

365
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,360
- Okay.
- See you!

366
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,120
Okay!

367
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,320
Go and submit your work!

368
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
I'm good at doing my things!

369
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
See you!

370
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,040
Submit your work!

371
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,200
I'm working on it.

372
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:03,000
[Smile more!]

373
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,360
[prae.narinn liked your post (now)]

374
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,400
Whoa!

375
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,080
This place's looking great, Kwanrin.

376
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,200
Is the rent expensive?

377
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
It's alright.

378
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,760
I chose this place
because the neighborhood is good.

379
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,080
Is this place close to your workplace?

380
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,320
Yes, very close.

381
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,800
Thank you for taking me today.

382
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,200
If you have any problems,

383
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,840
feel free to come find me.

384
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,280
Huh?

385
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,400
Please don't jinx it.

386
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
I'm kidding.

387
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,680
You should head home now.

388
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,480
You're having dinner with Rin, aren't you?

389
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,600
I am.

390
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,840
I'll be seeing you around then.

391
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,880
Good luck, Kwanrin.

392
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,840
Mm, likewise.

393
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,800
Right!

394
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,880
- I'll text you later, okay?
- Okay.

395
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,960
Are you actually running an errand,

396
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,880
or just sneaking off to hug someone?

397
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Rin!

398
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,160
Why do you look like you haven't slept?

399
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,720
Have you been working too much?

400
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,520
No.

401
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,040
I'm doing fine, though.

402
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,760
Don't forget that I'm working as the CEO.

403
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,200
I have meetings every day.

404
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,920
If you say you're fine,

405
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,440
why do you look like this?

406
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,640
Or, last night, did you...

407
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,480
Did you do...

408
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,240
this kind of stuff?

409
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,120
- Hey!
- Gosh, that's disgusting!

410
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,120
I don't do those nasty things, okay?

411
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,040
Why would I do that
with someone I don't love?

412
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,760
Right! If you say so.

413
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
You're blushing,
but I guess I'll take your word for it.

414
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Hey, Rin.

415
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,120
If you don't love Khem,

416
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,680
then why did you marry her?

417
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,360
Well...

418
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,160
After being married to her for two years,

419
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,240
I'll be appointed president.

420
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,960
If I don't do it,

421
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,800
I'll have to wait until my dad is too old

422
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,480
to attend the meeting.

423
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,320
Come on.

424
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,840
Do you want to be president that badly?

425
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,340
Of course, I do.

426
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,280
Hey, do you know

427
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,560
how exhausting working as the CEO is?

428
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,600
I have to attend meetings every day

429
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,760
with the executives

430
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,465
and all the departments in the company.

431
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,920
I also...

432
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
I want to be the president for my mother

433
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,320
and for myself, actually,

434
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,480
so I hold the most power.

435
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,160
Rin,

436
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,600
you've already been ditched once,

437
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,280
and you want it to happen again?

438
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,120
You want her to come back
and say she didn't love you?

439
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
I'm actually not waiting for Prapai
to come back.

440
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,240
It's just that, deep down,
I still care about her.

441
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,560
Rin, I'm serious.

442
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,600
Stop caring for those who don't love you,

443
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,720
and open your heart for those who do.

444
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,000
Khem seems to really love you.

445
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,240
It's very obvious from her eyes
during the wedding speech.

446
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,200
I'm worried about you.

447
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,160
Yeah.

448
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,240
Thanks.

449
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Time for a hug.

450
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,920
- It's okay.
- Don't cry, okay?

451
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,840
You still have us on your side, okay?

452
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
- Yeah.
- Mm.

453
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,680
Don't cry. You're ruining your makeup.

454
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,080
We look prettier, actually.

455
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,360
See? You look like crap now.

456
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,800
Hey...

457
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,520
Hey.

458
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,600
Get up.

459
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,960
I told you to sleep outside the bedroom,
didn't I?

460
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,160
Are you deaf or what?

461
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm not leaving.

462
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,120
I will not sleep anywhere else.

463
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,560
Hey, Khem!

464
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,680
Why are you so naughty?

465
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,400
I get naughty only with you, Rin.

466
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Tricky.

467
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Cheeky.

468
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
It's not time to submit
the report just yet,

469
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,800
but we still have things to do.

470
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,640
Hey!

471
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,480
Ow!

472
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
What is it?

473
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,840
Are you flustered?

474
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,000
[Director:
Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

475
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
It began just as an agreement.

476
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,240
That's what I've always told myself.

477
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,320
But why is it

478
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,680
that just not having you by my side

479
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,000
makes me restless?

480
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,800
You held my hands while I was asleep,

481
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,960
and I didn't want you to let go at all.

482
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,800
Last night, I was actually the first one
to move closer to you.

483
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,360
How long must I keep

484
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,000
lying to myself?

485
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Khem...

486
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,520
You're making my heart tremble,

487
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,960
even though I'm convinced

488
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,720
I will...

489
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,640
never fall in love again.

490
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,520
Rin, you're such a strange woman.

491
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,240
You always act tough with me,

492
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,920
but last night
you were the one who came closer.

493
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,680
Who's the one playing the game now?

494
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,160
Don't worry, though.

495
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,920
I won't think much of it,

496
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,360
but I do think that...

497
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,760
If you do start having feelings for me,

498
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
don’t deny them for too long.

499
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,320
'Cause I've been

500
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,200
playing with fire for quite some time.

501
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,560
However, I've actually never been consumed
by the fire of love.

502
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,560
By the way, last night,

503
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,600
did you dream about me, Rin?

504
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
There's a rumor
going around the company that

505
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,240
Kiri isn't Boss’ husband.

506
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,760
If it's not him,

507
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,960
who else can it be?

508
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,200
Khem, do you know who the person is?

509
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,360
Why are you blushing like that?

510
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,600
I'm fine.

511
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,320
Submit your work and leave.

512
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,800
I'd like to give this to you.

513
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,840
You're giving me the chocolate

514
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,000
because of what happened last night, right?

515
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,040
Hey!

516
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,800
Hey, Khem.

517
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,480
Why are you so naughty?

518
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,080
It's not time to submit
the report just yet,

519
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,600
but we still have things to do.

520
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,960
Hello, Prapai.

521
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,960
Is she going to come back for dinner?

522
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,080
No, she's going to have dinner elsewhere.

523
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,960
Do you ever think about Khem
and how she'll feel?

524
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,040
You love the other girl,

525
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,000
even though she doesn't love you back.
