Yes, ma'am. Say it, and I'll do it.

Oh, no.

Are you really asking me to
register our marriage with you?

You're right.

20
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:30,018
So, we can officially be husband and wife

21

Today?

27
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,626
I used to believe the saying that
love is a beautiful lie,

a manacle

29
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,792
that I would never allow
to shackle me again.

30
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,470
Until...

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,876
she walked into my life

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,959
with that smirky smile

33
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,360
and a heart that
I never imagined giving in to.

34

Before I became this happy,

35
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,209
I used to be someone
who didn't believe in love,

36
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:14,409
almost missed the freedom I was chasing,

37
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:17,018
and neglected this little puppy

38
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,417
who was ready to love me wholeheartedly.

39
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,083
Once I realized it,

40
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,102

No, please.

49

I completely forgive you.

50

You can do whatever with me,
but don't you leave me.

will set you free from this pain?

00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,936
Tell my dad

192
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:54,437
that you don't want to marry me.

193
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,914
If you do what I say,

194
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,917
you'll get some money
to start your new life.

195
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:02,751
Oh...

196
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,634
Nope.

197
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,375
I will marry you.

198
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,751
And I will willingly do it!

199
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,459
Thank you.

200
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,233
I don't feel like eating.

201
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,627
Eat it.

202
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,414
So yummy.

203
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:18,736
Thank you.

204
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:24,128
Will you stay the night with me?

205
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,773
Me?

206
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,292
Why though?

207
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,240
Your dad told you

208
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,065
to take care of me tonight?

209
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,209
Hey, girl.

210
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,175
We're nothing to each other.

211
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,125
Why do I have to stay?

212
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,834
Do I need to take care of you?
In what role?

213
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:48,551
Well...

214
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,915
As my soon-to-be girlfriend.

215
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:54,957
No way.

216
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,957
Oh, Rin.

217
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,749
You're so cruel.

218
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,635
Will you leave me sleeping here alone?

219
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:07,915
I'm afraid to sleep by myself,

220
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:11,249
I'm scared of ghosts.

221
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:19,207
Please stay with me.

222
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:22,915
Umm.

223
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:24,304
Eat it.

224
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,915
You're hungry, aren't you?

225
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,209
Ouch.

226
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,282
Rin,

227
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,584
my head hurts.

228
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,956
Rin,

229
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,623
can you please take care of me a bit?

230
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,459
No.

231
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,876
I'm not your nurse.

232
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,792
Oh, my.

233
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,048
You might not be a nurse,

234
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:22,000
but you're still my future wife.

235
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,042
Huh?

236
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,709
Sure.

237
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:31,500
Hey.

238
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,192
Ooh, Rin.

239
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,667
You're a cutie, though.

240
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:51,959
Ouch.

241
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,251
Ouch...

242
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,834
O-ouch...

243
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,422
Hey.

244
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,174
Headache?

245
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,508
Are you hurt?

246
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,209
You want me to call the doc in?

247
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,626
What should I do?

248
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,667
Can I get moral support from you?

249
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,167
I must have sweet dreams tonight.

250
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,125
What the heck.

251
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,787
You're cuter than I thought.

252
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,662
Please go to bed, Rin.

253
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,430
Rin,

254
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,495
are you afraid of thunder?

255
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,287
I am not.

256
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:05,340
Rin.

257
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,287
Hello.

258
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:50,662
Hello.

259
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:53,604
Khem,

260
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:55,128
please allow me to take you to your room.

261
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,204
Yes, please.

262
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:01,040
Khem, are you sure about this?

263
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:04,787
Yes, I am.

264
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,025
I will marry Rin.

265
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,537
You have no problem with us

266
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:13,372
moving here, right?

267
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,577
I don't.

268
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,370
If you still need me.

269
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:21,630
You're the only one I have.

270
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:24,705
I love you as if you were my real sister.

271
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,287
Oh.

272
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:36,871
Khem.

273
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,766
Hello, Uncle.

274
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:40,662
Hi.

275
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:42,798
How are you?

276
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:44,355
Are you feeling better?

277
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,593
If you feel any pain, let me know,

278
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:48,717
don't keep it to yourself, okay?

279
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:50,790
Got it!

280
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,506
I'm feeling better now.

281
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,783
Uh... the thing is...

282
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:58,537
can Kwanrin stay with us?

283
00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,370
Oh,

284
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:00,829
sure.

285
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,038
Thank you, sir.

286
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,457
Thank you.

287
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:28,231
Please enjoy yourself, Khem.

288
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,912
I'll take care of the bed
for Kwanrin myself.

289
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:33,440
Thank you.

290
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,813
Uh... Malai,

291
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:38,490
when does Rin usually return?

292
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,897
She finishes her work at 5 P.M.

293
00:27:40,937 --> 00:27:43,995
If there's no urgency,
she'll be back by 6.

294
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,204
Oh.

295
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,710
Thank you.

296
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:49,495
Alright,

297
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:50,712
- I'd like to excuse myself.
- Okay.

298
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:52,745
See you later, Kwanrin.

299
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,292
Hey.

300
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:06,204
Why are you in here?

301
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Well...

302
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,292
This is also my room, isn't it?

303
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:11,583
Khemjira...

304
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:16,626
You have to chase me off like that?

305
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:19,009
I'm not a dog, though.

306
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,092
Of course,

307
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:21,902
this is my bedroom,

308
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,459
you're not allowed to enter.

309
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,334
Oh...

310
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,890
It's okay.

311
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,852
I may not be allowed now,

312
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,334
but maybe later,

313
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,358
after we get married.

314
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,375
Your room

315
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,570
is mine.

316
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,823
Your bed

317
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,701
is also mine.

318
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,542
Hey.

319
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:48,042
You're more evil than I thought you were!

320
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,892
Don't ever think that

321
00:29:50,977 --> 00:29:53,167
I'd have a feeling for you.

322
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,628
Even after we get married,

323
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:59,602
you still can't sleep
in the same bed with me.

324
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:01,717
Over there!

325
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,125
After marrying,

326
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,334
that'll be your spot.

327
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,033
It is said that

328
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:14,104
beautiful ladies are so mean.

329
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,984
But that is okay,

330
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,861
I can sleep anywhere,

331
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:21,068
as long as I have
this beautiful lady in my life,

332
00:30:21,093 --> 00:30:22,197
that’s more than enough.

333
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:26,368
You...

334
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,376
get out of my room.

335
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:30,620
I'm feeling tired now.

336
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,542
Get up.

337
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,626
- Get out.
- Ooh, Rin.

338
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:37,796
Rin!

339
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:38,838
Ouch.

340
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:52,061
Uh...

341
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,087
Rin,

342
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,570
where is the door?

343
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:55,855
That way!

344
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,023
Oh, over there?

345
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:57,856
Yes.

346
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,026
Alright then.

347
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,068
I surely leave.

348
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,934
You seem so stubborn, Rin.

349
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,586
But that is fine by me.

350
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,008
I'll win over your stubbornness

351
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:26,026
with my own hands after getting married.

352
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:29,545
One day, you will eventually love me!

353
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,182
You'll be mine!

354
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,658
Good morning, Rin.

355
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:19,081
Not good.

356
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:20,237
Lively.

357
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:26,168
Good morning, Rin.

358
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,926
Good morning, Rin!

359
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:34,603
Oh!

360
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:44,097
Good morning, Rin.

361
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:47,960
Whoa!

362
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:50,293
Hey.

363
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:51,293
What?

364
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:54,907
Are you planning to go to work
in this miniskirt?

365
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:56,639
Well...

366
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:58,355
it's normal, isn't it?

367
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:01,186
Or are you...

368
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,509
being possessive over your husband-to-be?

369
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:06,627
Don't mess with me.

370
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:08,543
And do not talk to me.

371
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,295
Please wait, Rin.

372
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:13,217
Uh...

373
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,710
Can I get along with you?

374
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,806
Same way, less gas, you know.

375
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:20,891
Please, Rin.

376
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:21,933
- Please.
- Hey,

377
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:24,585
my family got so many drivers.

378
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:26,861
Ask them to drive you anywhere you want.

379
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:27,968
Why are you bothering me?

380
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:31,011
But I don't want to go anywhere
with the driver.

381
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,156
I want to go with you.

382
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:33,823
I'm begging!

383
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:35,491
It's your business,

384
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:36,866
not mine! Stop bothering me.

385
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:38,460
Jeez...

386
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:48,888
How come she always

387
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:51,552
gets that angry face...

388
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:54,467
But I...

389
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:56,835
I like Rin.

390
00:33:57,553 --> 00:33:58,710
Rin!

391
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:03,001
Umm.

392
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:04,293
Nakhun,

393
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,251
you've told the human resources
about Khemjira, right?

394
00:34:07,438 --> 00:34:08,689
All done, sir.

395
00:34:08,773 --> 00:34:10,460
Umm, that's great.

396
00:34:12,276 --> 00:34:13,543
Keep this between us,

397
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:16,019
HR department, and Rin's secretary.

398
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:19,451
Maybe she doesn't want to disclose this.

399
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,242
If she wants to, let her do that herself.

400
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:36,585
Whoa...

401
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:40,971
Uncle's office is something.

402
00:34:41,848 --> 00:34:42,543
Uh...

403
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:44,502
Hello there!

404
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,028
Hello, may I help you?

405
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:48,054
Uh, I'm here to meet Miss May.

406
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:49,666
Oh, she's over there.

407
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:50,394
Oh,

408
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:51,793
thanks.

409
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:04,086
Are you Miss Khemjira?

410
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:05,636
Yes.

411
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:07,248
Are you May?

412
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:08,288
Yes.

413
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:10,146
I'll escort you

414
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:12,330
to the relevant departments

415
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,856
and your desk.

416
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:14,896
Are you ready?

417
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:16,485
Sure thing!

418
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:17,177
Alright.

419
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:21,581
Our R&amp;D Department is for
research and development

420
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,331
to find what fits the market.

421
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:25,393
And the main work here is

422
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,602
co-working with the team,
designing new furniture pieces.

423
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:28,859
Hmm.

424
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,527
Looks so spacious.

425
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:34,948
Of course, we got 12 teams.

426
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:36,755
You'll be assigned to Team 1

427
00:35:36,795 --> 00:35:38,664
which has the fewest members.

428
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:41,115
And I've arranged mentors for you.

429
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:43,721
Do not worry,

430
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:45,228
they both are so kind.

431
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,835
Thank you, May!

432
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:49,636
Shall we continue?

433
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:50,970
- Yes.
- Follow me.

434
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:59,102
Everyone, stop what you're doing,
and listen to me.

435
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:01,051
Go ahead.

436
00:36:04,781 --> 00:36:06,436
Hello, everyone.

437
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:09,155
It's Khemjira

438
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:11,623
or you call me "Khem" for short.

439
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:14,339
It's my first day here,

440
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,943
please welcome me.

441
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:20,629
Let me know if you need a hand.

442
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:30,014
Are you a nepotism kid?

443
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:34,053
Nah, I'm my dad's kid.

444
00:36:35,347 --> 00:36:37,141
Who do you think that brat is?

445
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,005
How could she ever take
your boyfriend’s place?

446
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:40,913
I have no clue.

447
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:42,960
But for sure,

448
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,330
she gets ahead because of someone.

449
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,199
Don't you think it's strange

450
00:36:47,463 --> 00:36:51,032
she appeared right after
your man got kicked out?

451
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:54,027
I don't care who she is,

452
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,616
but from today onward,

453
00:36:58,307 --> 00:37:01,141
she is my enemy.

454
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:05,512
Khem!

455
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:08,490
I'm Jay, your mentor.

456
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:10,035
I'm Balloon,

457
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:11,455
your other mentor.

458
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:13,914
Let's go to your seat, there.

459
00:37:13,954 --> 00:37:15,784
Come here.

460
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:19,262
Sit here.

461
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Wait!

462
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,640
What the heck are you doing?

463
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:17,387
Can I get home with you, please?

464
00:38:18,116 --> 00:38:18,846
Please.

465
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:20,886
How did you come to work this morning?

466
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:23,222
A cab.

467
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:26,400
Just do what you did.

468
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:30,563
Don't be so mean, Rin.

469
00:38:30,754 --> 00:38:34,062
If you don't mind, let me drive.

470
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:35,382
I got a driver's license.

471
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:37,756
My ride will be the smoothest!

472
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:39,741
You can sit in the back seat.

473
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:41,055
Does that sound great?

474
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:42,932
I'm not heading home.

475
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,259
What?

476
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:47,155
I have an appointment with a friend.

477
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:49,572
If you don't want to take a cab,

478
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:51,079
call the driver to pick you up.

479
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:52,392
Rin,

480
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:54,725
that way will waste the Earth's resources.

481
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:57,300
What do you mean?

482
00:38:57,676 --> 00:39:00,458
Do you know how much carbon dioxide
Thailand releases yearly?

483
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:01,625
If you do not know,

484
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:03,082
- I will tell you...
- Stop.

485
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:06,569
I don't want to know.
Could you please stop messing with me?

486
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:08,046
Go your way.

487
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,550
You annoyed me so much.

488
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,810
I hate seeing you so much.

489
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:11,810
Hey,

490
00:39:12,676 --> 00:39:15,302
this little puppy has feelings too.

491
00:39:17,598 --> 00:39:18,518
Listen.

492
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:20,768
We're going to get married in a few days.

493
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,533
I want to tell you something.

494
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:25,674
I'm not your wife,
and you are not my husband.

495
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:26,714
Therefore,

496
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,976
stop annoying me now.

497
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,110
You are so annoying.

498
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:48,059
After you, madam.

499
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,852
Oh, ooh!

500
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,101
Beautiful ladies are indeed evil.

501
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:04,101
I'll do everything to make you love me!

502
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,614
This is my wedding invitation.

503
00:40:13,084 --> 00:40:14,821
It will happen in the next 15 days.

504
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,954
Wedding?

505
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:17,794
Who are you marrying?

506
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:19,496
Who?

507
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:23,145
Don't tell me you got back with Prapai.

508
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:25,371
Oh, no.

509
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:27,145
Her name is Khem,

510
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:29,048
she is my father's friend's daughter.

511
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:32,356
When did you move on?

512
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,064
You just cried with us the other day.

513
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,679
I am not dating that kid.

514
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,201
I'm forced to,

515
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,784
in exchange for inheritance and everything.

516
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:43,207
Hold on.

517
00:40:43,714 --> 00:40:44,629
"That kid."

518
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:45,629
Um.

519
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:48,196
What kid, you mean?

520
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,590
How old is she?

521
00:40:51,154 --> 00:40:53,448
Probably 23.

522
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:57,056
B*tch,

523
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:58,997
are you having a young hubby again?

524
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:01,395
That's 12 years apart!

525
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,084
12 years.

526
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,437
You should have dragged her here, though.

527
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,695
- It must be more fun.
- Jeez!

528
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:09,478
Stop that thought!

529
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,395
It's an arranged marriage.

530
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:15,707
My dad told me to marry her for 2 years

531
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:17,652
in exchange for everything my dad has.

532
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:18,990
But, in reality,

533
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:22,102
those are mine anyway.
Get it?

534
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:23,880
But you agreed to, didn't you?

535
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,419
Did your dad throw you into a gunfight
or something?

536
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:29,609
Hey.

537
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:31,973
He asked you to marry her for just 2 years

538
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:34,432
in exchange for ten billion,
what a variety show it is.

539
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:36,411
It's so worth it.

540
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:38,242
Hear me out,

541
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:39,709
2 years of marriage

542
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:40,838
for the president title

543
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:41,948
and inheritance of
over ten billion baht worth,

544
00:41:41,988 --> 00:41:43,512
and a young, delicious hubby...

545
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:45,070
Oh...

546
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,463
What a dream!

547
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:48,853
Well...

548
00:41:49,254 --> 00:41:50,604
Do you have her Insta?

549
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:51,811
Let me see.

550
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,468
Let me see my friend's hubby's face.

551
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:55,080
No, I don't have hers.

552
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,330
And stop calling her my hubby.

553
00:41:57,986 --> 00:41:59,472
That's so freaking annoying.

554
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:01,061
But...

555
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,463
if you get married for real,

556
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:05,422
one day,

557
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:07,149
you accidentally fall in love with her,

558
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:09,566
will you dare call her your wifey?

559
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:10,692
Wifey.

560
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:12,679
My wife.

561
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,961
Oh, stop it,

562
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,907
you jerks.

563
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:21,696
Falling in love?

564
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:23,855
No freaking way.

565
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:54,270
Where are you, beauty?

566
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:55,978
I'm waiting for you.

567
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,462
It must be the night.

568
00:43:09,876 --> 00:43:12,895
This little puppy will get
the heartless dog tonight!

569
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:16,632
Cheers.

570
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:26,629
Stop calling her my hubby.

571
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:28,087
- I don't like it.
- "Hubby."

572
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:29,905
- "Hubby."
- "Wifely."

573
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:30,563
- "Hubby."
- "Wifely."

574
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:31,395
Guys!

575
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:45,081
[Khemjira: Where are you, beauty?
I'm waiting for you]

576
00:43:46,382 --> 00:43:47,242
What's wrong?

577
00:43:48,123 --> 00:43:49,395
Why are you making that face?

578
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,627
That's weird.

579
00:43:51,877 --> 00:43:53,114
Nothing.

580
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:56,425
Nothing, just that puppy
annoyed me via text.

581
00:43:56,465 --> 00:43:58,201
Huh? Little puppy?

582
00:43:58,243 --> 00:43:59,869
Annoyed?

583
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:03,921
Or you like being annoyed?

584
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:45,183
[Directed by:

585
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:49,168
My father forced me to marry
a crazy kid named Khemjira.

586
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,458
I...

587
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:57,954
I never expected this to happen to me too.

588
00:44:59,644 --> 00:45:01,178
But today,

589
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:05,622
that kid was showing her side,

590
00:45:05,812 --> 00:45:08,269
annoying, and invading my bedroom.

591
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:10,913
This is my bedroom.

592
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:12,475
You are not allowed.

593
00:45:12,517 --> 00:45:14,121
Your room is

594
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,312
also mine.

595
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:18,564
Your bed is

596
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:20,426
also mine.

597
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:21,229
Hey!

598
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:25,905
Today, I've done
the most extreme thing in life!

599
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:28,655
And that is invading Rin's bedroom,

600
00:45:29,051 --> 00:45:31,097
and saying this in her face,

601
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,787
I said,

602
00:45:35,665 --> 00:45:38,082
"Your bed is also mine."

603
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:40,288
Good, guys?

604
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,439
I don't know

605
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:46,381
what to do with this.

606
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,472
Today is the last day

607
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,614
of Khem's father's, Anek, funeral.

608
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,796
I don't know if I should feel this much.

609
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,222
My father promised to take care of Khem

610
00:46:00,106 --> 00:46:01,330
by giving Khem

611
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,330
to me.

612
00:46:05,236 --> 00:46:06,413
But actually,

613
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:09,557
I don't think Khem
deserves to be alone either,

614
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:13,538
she doesn't need to act that strong

615
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:15,163
so that no one worries about her.

616
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,314
I think

617
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:21,787
she doesn't need to
understand the reality this quick.

618
00:46:23,922 --> 00:46:26,496
In fact,

619
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:30,371
I'm afraid...

620
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,105
I am afraid that

621
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,397
Rin will kick me out,

622
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,496
and I will annoy her.

623
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:40,481
My dad passed away,

624
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:42,538
I have nothing left,

625
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:45,746
only Uncle's promise that remains.

626
00:46:46,277 --> 00:46:47,079
But...

627
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:53,330
I don't want to
sympathize with myself forever.

628
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:59,104
I know Rin has not opened her heart to me.

629
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,000
She doesn't believe in love

630
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:04,712
nor family.

631
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:09,097
But the thing I fear the most...

632
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,124
I feel like...

633
00:47:14,806 --> 00:47:18,585
I kinda enjoy having...

634
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:20,322
you in my life.

635
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,070
Boss,

636
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:40,319
these are new furniture designs I did.

637
00:47:40,854 --> 00:47:42,529
I think they're not good enough.

638
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:43,822
Fix them.

639
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,919
If you're being kind to me a bit,

640
00:47:47,202 --> 00:47:50,611
I might be more encouraged, who knows?

641
00:47:51,832 --> 00:47:52,569
Hey.

642
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:53,902
Kid.

643
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,360
I'm treating you well

644
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:00,256
because you are sick.

645
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:02,383
Shall you let

646
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:05,929
your feelings grow once tonight?
