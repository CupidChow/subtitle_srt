every time you tell me to leave,

53
00:04:57,224 --> 00:04:59,584

go and take my own life?

189
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
my dear wife.

190
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,974
You crazy girl!

191
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,520
[Prapai: Incoming LINE call]

192
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,480
Hello, Prapai?

193
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Rin.

194
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,960
Are you free this evening?

195
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,114
Well...

196
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,740
I am.

197
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,240
Do you need something?

198
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,616
Today's my birthday,

199
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,560
and I'd like you to have dinner with me.

200
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,360
Can you come with me?

201
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,240
Mm, sure.

202
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,520
See you at the same place.

203
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,760
Alright.

204
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,040
I'll be waiting.

205
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,040
Right.

206
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,640
[I'm helping Malai with the dinner today]

207
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,440
[I'm also making you an omelet,
your favorite]

208
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,480
[Would you like to have anything special?]

209
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,520
[No, I'm having dinner outside]

210
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,800
[Tell my dad to have dinner without me]

211
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,200
[I'm coming home late in the evening]

212
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,841
[Where? Can you tell me
in case you're drinking too much?]

213
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:15,000
[I will go there and pick you up]

214
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,720
[Why do I have to tell you anything?]

215
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,160
[Well, I'm worried about my dear wife]

216
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,360
[I miss you]

217
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,920
[I miss you so much that I can't breathe]

218
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
What's going on, Khem?

219
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
What's with the smile?

220
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,200
Was someone texting you?

221
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,432
It was my wife.

222
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,440
Your wife?

223
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,840
Is Rin coming home for dinner?

224
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,640
No.

225
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:26,905
She's going outside.

226
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:31,464
You haven't asked her
who she's going out with?

227
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,020
Mm...

228
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,665
There's no need for that.

229
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:37,384
I know my dear wife isn't someone

230
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:41,000
who simply goes out
to have dinner with anyone.

231
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:42,225
Isn't that right?

232
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,360
Good evening, Prapai.

233
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,105
How are you doing?

234
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,290
Did I keep you waiting?

235
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,240
Thank you for coming.

236
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,096
Of course, I have to be here.

237
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,760
It's your birthday after all.

238
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,960
And...

239
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:40,545
Is it just the two of us?

240
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:43,784
You know that

241
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:46,512
I've got nobody else but you.

242
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,400
That's fine.

243
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,640
Please enjoy yourself.

244
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:56,745
The dinner's on me.

245
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Thank you.

246
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,880
Alright.

247
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,520
Happy birthday to you.

248
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Prapai.

249
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,720
Can I ask you something?

250
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:33,335
Yes?

251
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:37,544
Who gave you that bruise?

252
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Oh.

253
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:46,065
It's nothing.

254
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,720
I was just being clumsy,

255
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:54,865
bumping into things.

256
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,080
What about your boyfriend?

257
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:08,792
Forget that.

258
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,360
If you have anything,

259
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,800
feel free to tell me.

260
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:17,105
I'm right here.

261
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,120
I got you a present, too.

262
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,400
Yes?

263
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:40,784
Really?

264
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:42,424
Okay.

265
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:44,249
I'll be there as soon as possible.

266
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,880
Rin.

267
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
I have to go.

268
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:52,065
My boyfriend's hosting
a birthday party for me.

269
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,800
Wait, Prapai. What about...

270
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,920
Thank you for having dinner with me.

271
00:23:56,616 --> 00:23:57,616
I've got to go.

272
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,344
Here's the cake you ordered, ma'am.

273
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,800
Please box it up for me.

274
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:27,985
I'm taking it home.

275
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,254
Also...

276
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:30,816
Give me the bill.

277
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,442
Okay.

278
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,120
[You're having dinner with Prapai?]

279
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,400
Dad.

280
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,600
You're still awake?

281
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:03,704
You usually go to bed at 8 P.M.

282
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,000
Where have you been, Rin?

283
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,120
I was having dinner elsewhere.

284
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:14,632
Khem didn't tell you that?

285
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,270
She did.

286
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,280
Then, she said
she wouldn't be staying home tonight.

287
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,120
Huh?

288
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,520
She's not staying home?

289
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,840
What does that mean?

290
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:29,225
Who is she with?

291
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,480
No clue.

292
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,040
She said she was hurt,

293
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:36,792
sad,

294
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,632
and upset.

295
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,840
That's why
she's spending a night elsewhere.

296
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,960
Hm.

297
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:47,456
I don't care.

298
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,640
She can stay wherever she wants

299
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:51,455
and be as weird as she likes.

300
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,020
It's you who's acting weird.

301
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,472
You got cheated on

302
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,400
and third-wheeled,

303
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:01,464
yet you still love her.

304
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,000
Even though she doesn't love you at all.

305
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,120
I know where you've been.

306
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,600
And that cake...

307
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,480
It was for that girl, wasn't it?

308
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,051
Khem told you that?

309
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,120
She's got loose lips, doesn't she?

310
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,760
Once she's back, she'll be in deep trouble.

311
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,320
She didn't tell me that.

312
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,160
I had Nakhun go after you,

313
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,160
and Khem saw it all.

314
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,560
Happy birthday to you.

315
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,000
Do you ever think about Khem

316
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,345
and how she'll feel?

317
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,760
You love the other girl,

318
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:55,705
even though she doesn't love you back.

319
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,840
Hm.

320
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,720
Take this as my request.

321
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,780
Stop keeping in touch

322
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,720
and go see that girl.

323
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,600
Stop hurting yourself.

324
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:13,304
Do you want to go back
and relive those days?

325
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,160
If you don't love yourself,

326
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,560
at least think about your father, Rin.

327
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,640
Do you know why I want you to marry Khem?

328
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,267
That's because I know that

329
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,160
she loves you.

330
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,760
I also believe that
she will never break your heart.

331
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,200
No matter what is going to happen to her,

332
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,000
I believe that

333
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,200
she can take care of you.

334
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,360
You're as precious as fine wine.

335
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,600
The more it ages,

336
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,600
the better it tastes.

337
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,960
And fine wine is...

338
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,200
perfect for someone who doesn't know
how to drink it, like me.

339
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,800
Fine wine

340
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,800
should suit a sommelier better,
shouldn't it?

341
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,840
Hmm...

342
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,680
If it's in the hands of a sommelier,

343
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,480
they might only focus
on its exquisite flavor.

344
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,560
However, when it comes to someone like me
who doesn't drink wine,

345
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,360
even if the bottle of wine has gone bad,

346
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,240
I still find it enjoyable

347
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,600
and more valuable.

348
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
Dad...

349
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,360
I have no clue.

350
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:30,808
If you're eating too much food this late,

351
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:33,632
GERD’s gonna knock on your door real soon.

352
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,560
If it comes knocking,

353
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:38,295
just tell it

354
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:39,534
I'm not home.

355
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,520
Is your fear of driving getting any better?

356
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:55,217
It has.

357
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:57,192
I only need one thing.

358
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,017
I hope that nobody honks at me

359
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,880
or tries to tailgate me.

360
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,904
You're worried that
if you go to work a bit later,

361
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:16,672
there'll be more cars on the road, right?

362
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,280
Yes.

363
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,720
Does this lifestyle suit you?

364
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,745
Are you okay with it?

365
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,440
It's pretty okay, actually.

366
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,760
I just have to be a bit more careful,

367
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,560
but it's not much of a hurdle for me.

368
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,800
Malai still prepares a breakfast box for me
every day instead of you.

369
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,240
Are you full, though?

370
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,840
Yes.

371
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:57,192
There aren't that
many cars on the road now.

372
00:32:57,232 --> 00:32:58,432
Do you want to head back to your room?

373
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,480
You have to clock in early, don't you?

374
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,280
Right.

375
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:13,560
Next time, don't run off like this again.

376
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,463
This house always has a place for you.

377
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:26,472
If you have problems with Rin,

378
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,840
come and see me, okay?

379
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Thank you very much, Kwanrin,

380
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,760
for hanging out with me.

381
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:44,457
If it wasn't for you,

382
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,705
I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.

383
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,720
Thank you so much.

384
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,120
It's time to head home.

385
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,976
It's getting late, too.

386
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,760
Take care of yourself, okay?

387
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Okay.

388
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,880
Goodnight.

389
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,440
Okay, goodnight.

390
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:03,160
See you!

391
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,680
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye.

392
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,560
[Where are you staying tonight?]

393
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,280
What's gotten into you, huh?

394
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,220
Are you on your period or what?

395
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:23,168
Why do you have to run off like this?

396
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,320
Malai.

397
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:17,048
Has Khem come back?

398
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,320
No, she hasn't.

399
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,880
Khem called me and told me she was fine,

400
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,000
and that was it.

401
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,504
Dad.

402
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,529
Aren't you going to tell me anything?

403
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:39,551
What do you want me to say?

404
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
You told me that

405
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:45,672
you didn't care
where Khem was going to stay.

406
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:53,224
I was just asking.

407
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:54,249
I asked out of politeness.

408
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:56,056
I didn't care about her or anything.

409
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:57,484
Mm...

410
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:01,151
I'm going to work.

411
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,440
Do you know why I want you to marry Khem?

412
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,920
That's because I know that

413
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,880
she loves you.

414
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,560
I also believe that
she will never break your heart.

415
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,920
Ta-da!

416
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,400
- Oh, wow!
- Wow!

417
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,520
You have a lot of goodies with you today.

418
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,880
Is there something special?

419
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Nope.

420
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,240
I noticed you've all been working hard,

421
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,920
so I got you some snacks.

422
00:39:53,536 --> 00:39:55,416
This one's for someone here

423
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:57,004
in another department.

424
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,440
Sheesh!

425
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,000
I wonder who it is.

426
00:40:02,728 --> 00:40:04,240
I want to find out now.

427
00:40:04,473 --> 00:40:05,160
It's true.

428
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,080
Oops.

429
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:14,288
You haven't been

430
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,880
bootlicking someone here, have you?

431
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,400
I'm not a dog.

432
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,160
One more thing.

433
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,760
Even if I do,

434
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,295
I hope to bootlick someone with the power

435
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,257
to decide the outcome of my tryout.

436
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,200
Who knows.

437
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,840
Ms. Maturot has been
on the phone with you a lot lately.

438
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,280
Or are you into

439
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:45,216
older women?

440
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,000
I know that I'm married,

441
00:40:50,025 --> 00:40:52,345
but you don't have to teach me this.

442
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,760
I know what morality is.

443
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,040
As for you, Gee...

444
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,840
You should behave like a proper senior.

445
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,440
If someone finds out,

446
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,960
you would look bad.

447
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,400
Let's dig in!

448
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:27,425
Please enjoy.

449
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,598
- All yours.
- Aww...

450
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,183
Please enjoy, guys.

451
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,720
What did that kid tell you?

452
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,840
That kid was taunting me.

453
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:40,288
How should I deal with her, Hong?

454
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,360
I've heard that
she was talking to her mentor

455
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,624
that before working here,

456
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:46,985
she had experienced a car accident.

457
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,871
Her father died,

458
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,129
and she was
hospitalized all alone for days.

459
00:41:51,504 --> 00:41:53,064
Moreover,

460
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
she couldn't enter the elevator by herself.

461
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:01,904
She couldn't enter the elevator alone?

462
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,416
I've heard that if she has to use one,

463
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
she has to use
the glass elevator over there.

464
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,200
It's time to have some fun.

465
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,720
[Have something after waking up!
Snacks might have already gotten cold, though.]

466
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,560
[Love Rin with all of my heart]

467
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:47,864
Are you heading home?

468
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:52,056
Where did you stay last night?

469
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Somewhere else.

470
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,080
Where is it, then?

471
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,359
Somewhere else that wasn't home.

472
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:02,445
Khemjira!

473
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,760
Why do you want to know
where I spent the night?

474
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,240
I actually don't want to know.

475
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:15,385
I was just asking questions.

476
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,920
I was seeing Kwanrin.

477
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,680
And so?

478
00:43:30,936 --> 00:43:32,176
Why are you telling me this?

479
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,840
After we chatted,

480
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,840
we immediately parted ways.

481
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:39,776
Kwanrin went back to her room,

482
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:42,641
while I drove back to the hotel.

483
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,720
Tonight, however,

484
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:50,025
I'm back at the house.

485
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:50,850
Hm.

486
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm sorry

487
00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:55,369
for making you spend the night all alone.

488
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,800
Last night...

489
00:43:57,825 --> 00:43:58,825
Was it lonely?

490
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,760
I never feel lonely.

491
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:07,292
And...

492
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:09,095
When you weren't home last night,

493
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,480
I had the best sleep I'd ever had.

494
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,360
One more thing.

495
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:15,425
If you want to stay at the hotel
for another year or two,

496
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:16,464
it's fine by me.

497
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,720
Aww...

498
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,880
I'm not going to do that.

499
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,960
I miss my dear wife.

500
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,400
You miss me

501
00:44:28,855 --> 00:44:29,911
even though

502
00:44:30,472 --> 00:44:32,592
I went to see my ex last night?

503
00:44:33,056 --> 00:44:34,616
Are you over your heartbreak?

504
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,686
I only have 2 years to be with you.

505
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,311
Why would I waste my time
with that kind of stuff?

506
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,240
That's up to you to decide.

507
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,600
But remember this.

508
00:44:55,575 --> 00:44:57,775
I will never love you,

509
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,960
ever.

510
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,440
You really won't love me?

511
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
Never.

512
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,360
Then why are you

513
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:27,788
secretly looking at my fingers?

514
00:45:27,813 --> 00:45:29,054
I wasn't doing that.

515
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,720
It feels good

516
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,360
when these fingers reach you, right?

517
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,360
That’s gross!

518
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,880
You enjoy that, don't you?

519
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:04,064
Let go of me,

520
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:05,089
you psycho!

521
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,880
Let's prove it

522
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,240
and see if you're
actually not going to feel anything.

523
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,160
Khem.

524
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,960
Khem...

525
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,720
[Director:
Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

526
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,120
It feels so lonely in the room, Rin.

527
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,160
Yet, your scent lingers.

528
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
But...

529
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,920
You...

530
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:36,345
I don't know where you've gone.

531
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,936
I'm going to get upset at you, Rin.

532
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,600
I'd get to hug you to sleep every night,

533
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,480
but tonight,

534
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,440
I have to hug the side pillow instead.

535
00:47:52,256 --> 00:47:54,976
You're such a meanie, Rin!

536
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,280
If you're not coming home tonight,

537
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,080
I will never smooch,

538
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:05,385
plead,

539
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,780
or hug you.,

540
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:08,585
I will sleep with my back against you.

541
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,360
If you come home right now,

542
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,960
I'll let you sleep in my arms
for free tonight.

543
00:48:19,304 --> 00:48:21,024
Rin!

544
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,160
Please come back to me already.

Please come back to me already.

00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:15,320
who Prapai's new lover is?

549
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,080
Do you know that

550
00:49:17,105 --> 00:49:19,625
you're a very disgusting man?

551
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,320
And...

552
00:49:21,672 --> 00:49:24,272
Do you still have to hit on Rin?

553
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Khem.
