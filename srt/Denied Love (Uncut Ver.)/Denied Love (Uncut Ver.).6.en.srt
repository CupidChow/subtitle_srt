00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:28,904
where do we want to go?

191
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
Shall we have a shabu-shabu hotpot?

192
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,240
Shall we?

193
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:33,425
That's a no.

194
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,431
It's the weekend.

195
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:36,456
I want to rest.

196
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,440
Go where you want to go.

197
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
I want to sleep.

198
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,600
Okay, dear.

199
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,920
I'll prepare breakfast for you, okay?

200
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,200
If you're hungry,

201
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:51,665
go downstairs and have some breakfast.

202
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Mm.

203
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,320
Kiri,

204
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,480
I've prepared the dishes.

205
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:26,745
Let's have them together.

206
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,600
I told you not to do anything by yourself.

207
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
It's okay.

208
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
This is nothing.

209
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,880
I'm so sorry

210
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,720
for causing you pain so often.

211
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
It's not your fault.

212
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,840
It's fine.

213
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
Does Rin

214
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
still love you?

215
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,120
As far as I know,

216
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,520
she loves me

217
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,896
like always.

218
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,080
But you know

219
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,520
why I approached you, right?

220
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:32,936
At first, I didn't know.

221
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
Now, I know.

222
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,320
You have to date her

223
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,160
because it's your mother's order, right?

224
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,640
It's about your family's status,

225
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,720
and that's why it's a necessity.

226
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,456
But you do know that

227
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,560
I love you, don't you?

228
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Yes.

229
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:14,856
And...

230
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,720
Do you still have to get together with Rin?

231
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,200
You know that

232
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:28,497
she's already married, don't you?

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,880
Yes.

234
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,200
Next time,

235
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,185
don't hide anything from me, okay?

236
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:46,616
Next time,

237
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:49,504
I'll tell you everything.

238
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,120
Come in.

239
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Excuse me, sir.

240
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:33,224
Mr. President,

241
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:35,489
I have some reports about Prapai.

242
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Let's hear it.

243
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
On the night of Prapai's birthday,
I drove after her

244
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,560
and discovered that she no longer lives
at the same condo.

245
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:47,665
She's now residing in
a high-end luxury condo.

246
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,320
She's probably living with
her new boyfriend.

247
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
That's correct, sir.

248
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,080
It's Kiri.

249
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,080
Kiri?

250
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,001
Yes, sir.

251
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,160
That means

252
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,200
Kiri is the one behind
Prapai and Rin's breakup?

253
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:08,072
It may seem so, sir.

254
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,200
Is there anything
you'd like to talk to me about, Dad?

255
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,400
Oh, have a seat, dear.

256
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Calm down.

257
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:27,456
So what is this about?

258
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:29,544
Rin, have you found out

259
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,040
who Prapai's new lover is?

260
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I do not know.

261
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,800
Since she's got into a new relationship,

262
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,160
she's been acting mysterious.

263
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
She hasn't been active on social media.

264
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Kiri.

265
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Kiri?

266
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
What was that?

267
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,071
Prapai's new lover is Kiri.

268
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,200
I don't get it.

269
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,920
What do you mean, Dad?

270
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
Go ask him

271
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
why he needs to get together with Prapai,

272
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,920
making her break up with you.

273
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,960
On top of that,

274
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,480
he's been trying to get to know you.

275
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,400
Ms. Rin, you have an afternoon meeting.

276
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,680
Postpone the meeting.

277
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,440
I'm seeing Kiri.

278
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,400
Khem.

279
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:58,865
- Yes?
- I need to go.

280
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,040
The meeting's probably for about 2 hours.

281
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,280
Finish the assignment I gave you, okay?

282
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Sure thing, Jay.

283
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,800
Guys, it's time for the meeting.

284
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
Let's go.

285
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,440
Khem.

286
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,400
I need your help.

287
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
What is it?

288
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
These files need to be stored
in the archive.

289
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,400
They contain historical data,

290
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:30,385
so archive them accordingly.

291
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,960
That's everything?

292
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Yes.

293
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,200
You're the only person
who's not attending the meeting.

294
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,360
Got it.

295
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Ouch! Ow!

296
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,920
Hey! Wait!

297
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,920
Wait! Wait!

298
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,800
Wait!

299
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,960
Hey, wait!

300
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,600
Hey!

301
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,760
Help me!

302
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,705
Help!

303
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,120
Please help me!

304
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,080
Help me!

305
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,360
Can anybody hear me? I'm locked inside!

306
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,240
Anybody?!

307
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,120
Help me!

308
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,160
Stay there overnight for being so arrogant.

309
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,320
I've heard that you have
something important to talk to me about.

310
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,920
What is it?

311
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,360
I have a question I'd like to ask.

312
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,720
If you're a real man,

313
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,480
please be honest with your answer.

314
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Right.

315
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Go ahead and ask me.

316
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,240
Why did you try to hit on me back then?

317
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
It was because

318
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,480
I fell in love with you, of course.

319
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Liar.

320
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,240
Just how could you fall in love with me

321
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,520
when you're secretly dating someone else?

322
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,080
You have an ulterior motive, don't you?

323
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Please be upfront with me.

324
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,320
We can talk about this, Kiri.

325
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Rin...

326
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
You already knew it?

327
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,560
You approached Prapai

328
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,600
and made her fall for you.

329
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
Eventually,
she started dating you on the side

330
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:44,505
and broke up with me.

331
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,880
Next, you approached me
so that we could become business partners.

332
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,116
What exactly are you after, Kiri?

333
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm so disappointed in you.

334
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,920
I shouldn't have known you.

335
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,480
My mother...

336
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,280
She wants me to marry you.

337
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,640
Your mother?

338
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,960
She knew that

339
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,960
you were already dating someone.

340
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,360
So...

341
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,960
She tried to end the relationship

342
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,520
by having you date Prapai?

343
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,720
God.

344
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,880
This is ridiculous.

345
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,120
So, Mrs. Nuankhae

346
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,200
played dirty

347
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,880
to make me her daughter-in-law?

348
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,200
Do you know that

350
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,720
you're a very disgusting man?

351
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,240
You will never know

352
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
how I felt.

353
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,440
It cut me so deeply that

354
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,200
I almost took my own life

355
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,945
because I couldn't handle the breakup.

356
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,920
Prapai and I had been
dating for 5 years, Kiri.

357
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,040
I love her very much.

358
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,880
You have no idea how I felt.

359
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,580
I never knew.

360
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,034
I just knew that

361
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,040
I had to abide by my mother's orders.

362
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,800
What a subservient brat.

363
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,360
Be honest.

364
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,720
What do you think of Prapai?

365
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,120
She loves me very much.

366
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,240
"She loves me very much."

367
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,560
Hm.

368
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,400
And you?

369
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,080
I know what you've done to her.

370
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,800
You're nothing but scum.

371
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,680
You hurt Prapai, didn't you?

372
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I...

373
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,560
It's my fault.

374
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,640
Listen, Kiri.

375
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,800
If you don't love her,

376
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,160
give her back to me.

377
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
I'll take care of the person I love myself.

378
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,920
I'm sorry,

379
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,560
but I cannot do that.

380
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
What is it?

381
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Rin!

382
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,440
Rin!

383
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:43,545
Rin, please help me!

384
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,120
I'm going to hang up
if it's nothing important.

385
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,440
Please, no!

386
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,160
Please come and help me.

387
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
Please come and help me, Rin.

388
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
I'm scared.

389
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,792
Hold on. Pull yourself together.

390
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,960
Do not hang up.

391
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,560
Wait until I get there.

392
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Just a second.

393
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Khem, Khem...

394
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,280
Calm down. Do not hang up.

395
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,520
Easy.

396
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,080
I'm on my way.

397
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,930
Rin!

398
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,010
Are you okay?

399
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm scared.

400
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:31,796
Rin...

401
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,230
Are you my wife?

402
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,800
What the heck are you saying?

403
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,200
I'm asking if you're okay or not.

404
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,280
Rin...

405
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,080
You are my wife, aren't you?

406
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,160
Yes, yes.

407
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,406
I am your wife.

408
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Is that enough?

409
00:28:53,188 --> 00:28:54,895
I'm scared, Rin.

410
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,160
It's okay.

411
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,240
I'm right here.

412
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
You're safe now.

413
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
It's okay, alright?

414
00:29:58,676 --> 00:29:59,760
Sit down. Gently.

415
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,720
You're fine now.

416
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Are you that claustrophobic?

417
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,600
Yes.

418
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,520
I am.

419
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,280
I have a severe case of claustrophobia,

420
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:26,456
especially when I'm alone.

421
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,040
But...

422
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,440
You were never like this before.

423
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
So...

424
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,040
How did that happen?

425
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:36,345
When did you have it?

426
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,920
Not too long ago.

427
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,680
How did you end up inside that room?

428
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,000
The door's locked from the outside.

429
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,840
I was trying to store away the files,

430
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
but the door was suddenly locked.

431
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
That means you were harassed.

432
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm not sure.

433
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,840
Khem.

434
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,600
This is the wrong time to be optimistic.

435
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,760
Think about this.

436
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,080
If you didn't have your phone
with you there,

437
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,440
imagine what you'd be like by now.

438
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,520
The security told me that

439
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,560
people rarely go to that floor.

440
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:32,345
There was no way that
the door was randomly locked.

441
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,040
This isn't normal.

442
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,160
It was probably just an accident.

443
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,280
Maybe somebody came by,

444
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:46,105
saw the door was left open,

445
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,160
and they closed it.

446
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
Mm...

447
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,840
Do you want me to find the culprit?

448
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,360
This is your matter,

449
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,440
so I shouldn't care either way.

450
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,520
However,

451
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
you need to see a doctor.

452
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,840
During workdays are fine.

453
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,160
You can take a day off.
You have my permission.

454
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,800
As for the bill,

455
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,800
if it's too much, simply tell me.

456
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,600
I'll help you out.

457
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,920
Oh, Rin...

458
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,160
I'd like to take a half-day off.

459
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,440
Am I allowed to do it?

460
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Sure, go ahead.

461
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
If you're not feeling okay,
go home and get some rest.

462
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
You have my permission.

463
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,720
Thank you.

464
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,200
Well...

465
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,520
Now,

466
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,120
let me return to my duties.

467
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,960
For the day off...

468
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Well...

469
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,560
Don't forget to inform
the head of the department.

470
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,200
Right.

471
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,240
I'd like to review the CCTV footage
of the empty floor

472
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,985
near the R&amp;D department.

473
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,280
Uh...

474
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,400
Boss...

475
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:16,095
The security cameras around
the perimeter are under maintenance.

476
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,360
What do you mean?

477
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,400
Rodents severed the wires

478
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,000
a few days ago.

479
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,015
We're waiting for the technicians
to work on the wires.

480
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,240
The earliest maintenance possible
is tomorrow.

481
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,600
Hey.

482
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,740
Do you think that

483
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,340
if someone were stuck in a room there,

484
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,000
how long do you think
it would take us to find them?

485
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,920
Failed CCTV cameras must be serviced
within the same day.

486
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,616
Do not let this happen again.

487
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,760
Yes, Boss.

488
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,440
- Get it done.
- Yes.

490
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,240
I'm screwed.

491
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,080
What do I do?

492
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,320
Gosh...

493
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Why do I hesitate so much
over just a glass of milk?

494
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,200
Rin.

495
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:50,864
Where are you taking that glass of milk?

496
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
It's nothing.

497
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,120
Please go and have a rest.

498
00:35:57,145 --> 00:35:58,305
I'll turn off the lights myself.

499
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,160
Okay.

500
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,520
Quickly, come on.

501
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,360
Stealth. Don't let them see you.

502
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
Just stay mid if you're already there!

503
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:47,345
Why are you going to that lane?

504
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,720
There.

505
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,520
Farm up, please.

506
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,464
Be right back.

507
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,240
You got me a glass of milk?

508
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,520
Huh?

509
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,680
Okay? I'm going to brush my teeth.

510
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,560
Oh...

511
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,960
Don't go just yet.

512
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,360
Can we brush our teeth together, Rin?

513
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:28,849
Rin.

514
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:32,064
Are you always the sub?

515
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,200
What do you mean?

516
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Well...

517
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:45,225
When you're the sub,

518
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,160
and I'm the dom,

519
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,320
I'd like to know

520
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:53,065
what you were like

521
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,880
with your ex.

522
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,880
Well...

523
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,360
I did it both ways.

524
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,760
Oh...

525
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,840
Interesting.

526
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,320
What are you doing?

527
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:23,151
Your hands are always all over the place.

528
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,120
I just take the lead.

529
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,600
You...

530
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,440
You want to do this every night?

531
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,840
Why?

532
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:48,360
You don't like it when I kiss you here

533
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,800
or touch you there?

534
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,360
Or...

535
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,760
You don't like it when your heart's racing?

536
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,480
Shut up already.

537
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:08,296
I like it, though.

538
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,920
I like it when you moan.

539
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,560
I like it when you tremble under me.

540
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,440
I also like it when you

541
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,865
feel so good that you can't look at me.

542
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:29,560
You nasty.

543
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,760
Why did you just bite me?

544
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,960
You're too irresistible, Rin.

545
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,320
That hurt, Khemjira!

546
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,480
You're not getting away from me, though.

547
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,200
Can I have it, Rin?

548
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,663
Let me feel your body.

549
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,920
Please.

550
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,440
Good morning!

551
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,720
Good morning.

552
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:33,855
- Good morning, Balloon.
- Good morning.

553
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Good morning.

554
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,800
Good morning, everyone!

555
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,200
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

556
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,200
Good morning, Gee.

557
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Khem, anything?

558
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Up and early today, are you?

559
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,840
Where's the key to the archive?

560
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,120
Do I have to tell you that?

561
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,400
Of course, not.

562
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm asking you just in case

563
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:23,665
you have any files
that need to be stored there again.

564
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,480
That way, I'll be able to assist you.

565
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,160
Yesterday...

566
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:33,720
Did you store all the files correctly?

567
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,680
It was nicely done.

568
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:39,872
Unfortunately,

569
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,897
I was locked inside.

570
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,030
Is that so?

571
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,480
How did you get out?

572
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:52,040
Thankfully, I had my phone with me.

573
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:54,065
So, I called for help.

574
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:56,096
Gee,

575
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,280
do you know who did it?

576
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:18,527
How would I know?

577
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,904
I wasn't there watching you.

578
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,915
The one who helped me was a gentle soul,

579
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,960
unlike the one
who locked me in the archive.

580
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,880
That type of person

581
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
isn't very nice, is it?

582
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,360
Alright, I'm off to work now.

583
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:48,120
[Director:
Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

584
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,680
This morning...

585
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,920
Khem said I looked gorgeous.

586
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,160
She compliments me every day,

587
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
but it's just that...

588
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,760
This time, it was a bit strange.

589
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,360
I don't know.

590
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,320
Maybe it's because

591
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,520
she complimented me
while I was still drowsy.

592
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,680
Or maybe it's because

593
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,080
she complimented me
after looking at me for too long.

594
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,120
I don't like receiving compliments.

595
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,280
But when

596
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,280
Khem says them,

597
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,600
I feel so over the moon that

598
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,080
I want to hear them again.

599
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,040
Oh, dear!

600
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,640
Am I...

601
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,920
Am I being flustered by that girl?

602
00:44:55,256 --> 00:44:56,496
But if...

603
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,640
If she complimented me again,

604
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,560
I'd probably be fine.

605
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,240
I think we need to talk

606
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,640
about you doing your thing.

607
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,080
I haven't done the thing, though.

608
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
The show's over.

609
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:29,727
You don't have my consent.

610
00:45:29,752 --> 00:45:31,592
I'm the top performer.

611
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,160
I won't let the show
go quiet for a single minute.

612
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,600
Are you going to reward me
for my performance?

613
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:39,744
Hey, you.

614
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,680
What's up with you?

615
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,200
I'm jealous.

616
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,160
I'm jealous of my dear wife.

617
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,360
This young pup has a heart too, you know?
