Mr. Wasin actually has been asking me
several times already

43
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,440
to get me to tell him where Khem is.

44
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,720
Yet, every time, I lied

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
and said I had no idea.

46
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm sorry for keeping you
waiting until now.

47
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,600
You actually did that, Dad?

Rin,

49
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm really scared, dear.

50
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,760
I almost lost you once,

51
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,880
and I'm not gonna let it happen again.

52
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,060
If something were to happen to you,

53
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,960
I wouldn't be able to go on.

54
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm sorry, Dad.

55
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,040
I promise that no matter what happens
from now on,

56
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
I won't do it again.

57
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,840

59
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,160
Can you please tell me

60

where Khem is?

61
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Khem actually told me
not to tell you where she is.

62
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,240
I've also promised that I wouldn't,

63
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,400
but I don't want her
to suffer forever either.

64
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
So...

65
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll tell you where Khem is.

66

These are all the details
I have about where she is.

67
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,120
The reason I'm telling you
everything today is that

68
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,080
if I were to tell you later,

69
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,280
you might not get to see her again.

70
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
What do you mean?

71
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,920
She's moving overseas.

72
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,240
If you choose to go after her today,

73
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,200
you'll still be able to find her.

74
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,480
Thank you very much, Kwanrin.

75
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,640
I promise I'll do my best

76
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
to bring her back home.

slip from my grasp?

a very nice position there.

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,680
Hey, Khem.

188
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
You're talking too much.

189
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,480
Just sit still and be quiet.

190
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,240
We're almost home, you know?

191
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,000
Hello, Dad.

192
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,760
You're finally home, Khem.

193
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,560
Feeling better now?

194
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,320
Yes, I'm better than ever.

195
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,080
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

196
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Rin and I have finally reconciled,

197
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,120
and we have no hard feelings
toward each other.

198
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,000
We've talked things through

199
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,000
and agreed that there will be
no obligations in our marriage,

200
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,640
along with a 2-year agreement
to secure the role of president.

201
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,600
We're simply going to live
as a real married couple.

202
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,280
From now on,
may your relationship be smooth sailing.

203
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
If there's a problem,
please stay calm, talk it out,

204
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,080
make changes, and learn from each other.

205
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,720
Right.

206
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,800
From now on, please stop drinking.

207
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,840
I want you to live a happy life.

208
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,400
If I had known you'd be drinking this much,

209
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,320
I would've come back to your arms that day.

210
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Well...

211
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,960
Don't try slipping away from me again.

212
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,560
Stay with me.

213
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,080
Understand?

214
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,200
I understand.

215
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,040
Well then,

216
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,720
how about we do something fun
to take our minds off it?

217
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,760
Hold on...

218
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,120
Before returning home, we'd already...

219
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
Nope, I mean...

220
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,680
Shall we make dinner?

221
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,760
I want to spend a lot of time
doing fun things with you.

222
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
You!

223
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,620
You still can't stop teasing me, can you?

224
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,320
Let's make dinner.

225
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,480
Please?

226
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Please.

227
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,240
Okay, okay.

228
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,480
But...

229
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,680
Don't mess up the kitchen, alright?

230
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,790
- Shall we?
- Let's go!

231
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
It smells so nice.

232
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,200
You know how to make Thai clear soup?

233
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,400
Of course, I do.

234
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
I've trained with the housemaids.

235
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
It tastes exactly the same
as what you had at a restaurant.

236
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
How is it?

237
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
This is so good!

238
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,680
Of course.

239
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,920
The secret ingredient I added is love.

240
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Uh, is it okay if I ask

241
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,960
why you enjoy omelets so much,

242
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,840
even though they're such a simple dish?

243
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Well...

244
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,560
When I was little,
after coming home from school,

245
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,080
my mom would always make me omelets.

246
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,880
That's why I love them so much.

247
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
My mom also loved making me dishes
when I got home from school.

248
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,640
She knew how to make a ton of dishes, too.

249
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,120
I had to take extra classes,

250
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,600
and when I got home,
I'd be so, so hungry!

251
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,160
And...

252
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,400
What's your favorite?

253
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,720
It's you.

254
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,240
I love tasting you.

255
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,920
Come on.

256
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,640
We're cooking here.

257
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,240
Whenever you give me a smile,

258
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,320
you look really pretty.

259
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,240
However, whenever you make a sad face...

260
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
What?

261
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
You still look pretty

262
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,600
but in a different way!

263
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,440
You're gorgeous no matter what,

264
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,320
and that's because I really love you, Rin.

265
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,600
You're my first love

266
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,120
and the only one I want.

267
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
You crazy love-struck pup!

268
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,840
Want to try it?

269
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,080
You really nailed it.

270
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,960
Here.

271
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,560
Feed me, please!

272
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,280
Let me have it, too.

273
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,240
Good job, me!

274
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,320
Your cups of matcha are here!

275
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,560
Served with life and joy.

276
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,280
Here. This one's for you, Balloon.

277
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,720
And this one's for you, Jay.

278
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,000
Thank you so much.

279
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,880
You're always as lovely as ever.

280
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,660
Come on.

281
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,560
You've been very sweet to us

282
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,000
since you got back, haven't you?

283
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,640
Of course, I have to!

284
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,440
I don't want to get fired again.

285
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,580
By the way,

286
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,160
when are you getting married?

287
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Don't forget to send me an invitation.

288
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,730
I want to be your bridesmaid.

289
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,320
Are you crazy? What are you saying?

290
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
We're just getting started.

291
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
That's right.

292
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,720
That's way too soon.
Nobody gets married that quickly.

293
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,500
We just started dating.

294
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,920
It's too soon!

295
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,280
What about my relationship?

296
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,360
We got married even though
we hadn't dated each other.

297
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,240
On top of that,
we didn't marry out of love.

298
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,560
Now, we love each other, though.

299
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,880
We really, really do.

300
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,880
Sure, you love-struck girl.

301
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
So...

302
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,760
They say that couples eventually learn
to love each other after getting married.

303
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,160
I guess this is what it's like.

304
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
It's true!

305
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,200
I can confidently say that
from my relationship.

306
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,840
Drink up.

307
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,120
They're really good.

308
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,520
Thank you.

309
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Hong?

310
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,360
This way.

311
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,600
Join us.

312
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,120
- Come here!
- Aww!

313
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,680
Don't hide behind the silence.

314
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,510
So good.

315
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,700
Cheers!

316
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,880
Gosh, I can't take this anymore.

317
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,760
You're madly love-struck.

318
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,360
That's right.

319
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,480
Very much so.

320
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,600
You see, we didn't marry out of love.

321
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,880
I can't help myself
now that we love each other!

322
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
I love her so much, Jay.

323
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,880
Nothing we can do, alright?

324
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm single, though.

325
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,120
Hong?

326
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,200
Oh, dear.

327
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,240
"It's too soon to get married, you know?"

328
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,480
Please give me a hug, too?

329
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,920
The matcha drink's really good.

330
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,160
Please enjoy it a whole bunch.

331
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

332
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,080
My dear wife!

333
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,010
- I'm here!
- I know!

334
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,920
Ow!

335
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,030
Hey!

336
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,800
Stop it, Khem.

337
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,640
You're kissing me too much
that my cheeks are bruised.

338
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,400
Well, I miss you.

339
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,640
Now...

340
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,840
Do you remember

341
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,480
when I told you

342
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,720
there was something
I never wanted to tell anyone

343
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,640
but

344
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,920
you and you alone?

345
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,920
What is it?

346
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,040
[30/5/25: unread
2/7/25: unread]

347
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,280
[5/7/25: unread
7/7/25: unread]

348
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,520
[12/7/25: unread
15/7/25: unread]

349
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
She never read your messages?

350
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,520
Um...

351
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,600
I actually have two phones.

352
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,040
I created that account on my other phone.

353
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,800
What do you mean?

354
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
It means...

355
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,440
I didn't send those texts to Prapai.

356
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,920
I sent it to myself

357
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
because

358
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,800
I couldn't share those feelings with her.

359
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,240
Instead, I shared them with that account

360
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,240
so that it felt like

361
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,400
she was always there,
waiting to read them.

362
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Rin.

363
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,760
From now on,
I'll be the one to hear your voice.

364
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm always here if you want to talk,

365
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,560
so feel free to tell me
whatever you're feeling, okay?

366
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,310
You no longer need to
embrace the emptiness in your heart.

367
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
Thank you very much.

368
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,800
But actually...

369
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,440
I no longer feel that way.

370
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
I just want to tell you

371
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,640
before I delete that account.

372
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,480
["Your birthday is coming up,
and I wish I could celebrate it with you..."]

373
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,320
That means...

374
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,160
I actually make you feel better, don't I?

375
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,400
Of course, you do.

376
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I really have to thank you

377
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,440
for coming into my life.

378
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,920
Ever since you came into my world,

379
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,460
I haven't had time
to think about trivial things

380
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,560
or miss my days with Prapai.

381
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
Rin...

382
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,400
You've actually fallen for me, haven't you?

383
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Nonsense.

384
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,320
Don't cry, my gorgeous.

385
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,000
I love you, you know?

386
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,920
Or else you won't look pretty, you know?

387
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,640
Ow...

388
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,280
Oh, my goodness!

389
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,240
Oh, Rin...

390
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,680
It's my heart. My heart...

391
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,880
- What?
- Aww...

392
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,800
Why are you so sweet to me?

393
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,960
My heart can't take it anymore, Rin.

394
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,640
Come on!

395
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,040
I just gave you a kiss.

396
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,320
Why do you have to get this excited?

397
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,360
Please let me

398
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,840
kiss you back.

399
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,770
- Stop it.
- Ow...

400
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,600
Listen.

401
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,240
I called you here

402
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
because

403
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,560
I have something important to ask you.

404
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,680
Ask away.

405
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm at your command.

406
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Okay.

407
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,880
Yes?

408
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,400
Let's make it official.

409
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
Rin?!

410
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,160
Are you for real?

411
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Yes.

412
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,680
Let's register our marriage.

413
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,840
This way, we'll officially
be a married couple,

414
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,360
specifically, a wife-and-wife couple

415
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,720
legally at last.

416
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,240
And...

417
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,000
After that,

418
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,960
we'll raise our kids.

419
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,760
Rin...

420
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,040
Do you want to have kids?

421
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,080
Mm.

422
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Yes.

423
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,660
Well...

424
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,680
I want to have kids

425
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,960
before I turn 40.

426
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,920
Also, another thing I'll need is...

427
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,960
a lot of sleep.

428
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,920
I need to raise kids,

429
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,680
or else I won't be able
to take care of them.

430
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,160
Taking care of you is already exhausting.

431
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,240
And...

432
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,720
When are we going to register our marriage?

433
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Today.

434
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,150
What did you just say?

435
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
- Today?
- Yes, today.

436
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,680
We'll get it done right away.

437
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,240
I've reached out to everybody.

438
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,320
After having lunch,

439
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,560
we'll get our marriage registered.

440
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Okay?

441
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,800
I always thought that

442
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,960
love was nothing but a lie.

443
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,600
It was just a relationship

444
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,800
that was meant to end.

445
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,720
I used to love and get left behind.

446
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,880
I was once blinded by the past.

447
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,400
I refused to be loved

448
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,240
because I believed it didn't exist.

449
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,640
I married her not because I loved her,

450
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,240
but out of obligation.

451
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,720
I tried to make her go away

452
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,640
and deny any feelings I had for her.

453
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,520
I was scared,

454
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,000
yet she was always there.

455
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,120
No matter what,
she was always there for me.

456
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,840
Then, one day,

457
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,120
I finally realized what true love means.

458
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,680
Love is not only about giving

459
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,880
but also about receiving.

460
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,040
It means allowing yourself to have feelings

461
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,160
and be willing to love someone

462
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
without fearing that
it will come to an end.

463
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,080
I never knew

464
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,680
when I started falling for her.

465
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,880
I just know that

466
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,120
if I lost her,

467
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,880
I simply couldn't go on with my life.

468
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,280
Now, I believe wholeheartedly
that love is real

469
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,000
because it makes me
want to spend the rest of my life with her.

470
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,360
Yay! Rin!

471
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,680
We're about to make it official.

472
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,360
Ms. Mai! Ms. Mai!

473
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,210
Ms. Mai!

474
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,640
I'm about to become Rin’s legal wife!

475
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,920
Keep it down!

476
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Let's get it done today.

477
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,000
Are you ready?

478
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,460
Rin!

479
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,280
Having a younger partner

480
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,000
means you need a lot of energy
to keep up with them.

481
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,640
My little pup is still enjoying life,

482
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,600
having fun as a young adult.

483
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,760
For me, however,

484
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,160
I don't find happiness in fancy things.

485
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,880
Just seeing the person I love
flying high with happiness

486
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
is more than enough for me.

487
