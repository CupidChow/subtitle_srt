00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,465
you are 35 years old now.

192
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:08,505
Hey!

193
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Are you making fun of my age?

194
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,017
I'm not,

195
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,640
I just mean that

196
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:17,479
people who are 35

197
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,245
usually don't use silly tricks like that
to tease others.

198
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,785
Ouch.

199
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:28,105
Rin, that hurts!

200
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,440
Why?

201
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,920
Why are you teasing me?

202
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,920
It's because...

203
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,816
you annoyed me.

204
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,440
Oh.

205
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,936
You did that

206
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:55,480
so you wouldn't fall for me, right?

207
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,640
Hey.

208
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:11,544
Kid.

209
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What's wrong?

210
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Your nose is bleeding.

211
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:19,888
What's wrong? What happened?

212
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,736
I am fine.

213
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,896
I just didn't get enough rest.

214
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Stop it.

215
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,560
Come with me, and I'll help you.

216
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:38,921
Rin, I'm okay.

217
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,400
I can walk.

218
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
Hey,

219
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:43,712
don't be such a kid.

220
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:47,361
If something happens to you

221
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,560
and my dad takes back the inheritance,
what should I do next?

222
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
Let me help you.

223
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,665
Why do you smell so good?

224
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:00,152
What perfume are you wearing?

225
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,200
Why do I have to tell you?

226
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,040
I'll buy it and wear it.

227
00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:10,064
Maybe it'll help you open up more.

228
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,502
Hey.

229
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,928
I'm treating you well

230
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,080
because you are sick.

231
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,880
So keep your mouth shut.

232
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:05,193
Is she really sick,
or is it all part of her plan?

233
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,097
Miss Rin, you might not know this,

234
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:11,536
but she's been like this
since she was young.

235
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:22,431
When she doesn't get enough rest,

236
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:24,336
she'll be like this,

237
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,240
feeling nauseous, vomiting,
or getting a rash.

238
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,480
She already threw up once this morning.

239
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:32,888
I told her to call in sick, but she didn't.

240
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:35,456
Really?

241
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:38,424
Do we need to take her to the hospital?

242
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
No,

243
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,737
just give her some rest,

244
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:42,977
and she'll get better.

245
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:44,824
Miss Rin,
you don't need to worry about her.

246
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,960
Hey,

247
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:49,369
I am not worried, it's all in your head.

248
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:53,937
Why didn't your master...

249
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:56,944
go to bed properly?

250
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,320
She stayed up late
to finish the work for you.

251
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:07,736
Alright, go do your thing somewhere else.

252
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,800
All right.

253
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:30,376
Why are you so relentless?

254
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:49,952
If you don't want to get picked on,

255
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:51,992
stop annoying me.

256
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
Cancel the wedding!

257
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,400
Do you understand?

258
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,400
I didn't intend to sleep next to you.

259
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,000
I didn't say anything.

260
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:05,281
Well, what are you doing in my room?

261
00:31:08,024 --> 00:31:09,504
I just came to check on you,

262
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,400
and if you happened to die,

263
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:13,745
I could immediately tell my dad
to call off the wedding.

264
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,958
Oh, you've been looking after me.

265
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,663
Just be honest.

266
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:24,776
Say you're worried
about your future husband.

267
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Nonsense!

268
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,671
How are you feeling?

269
00:31:30,024 --> 00:31:31,184
All good now?

270
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,609
I'm feeling better.

271
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:37,647
But if you want to continue
taking care of me,

272
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,920
I'm not saying otherwise.

273
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Mmm.

274
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:46,689
Don't work too hard next time.

275
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:48,720
It'll cause trouble for others.

276
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Understand?

277
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,449
Just don't tease me
or assign me too much work.

278
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:55,768
If I really do end up dying,

279
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,685
you won't get the inheritance,

280
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,365
I won't be able to help you then.

281
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,190
Hey, kid.

282
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,107
Hey...

283
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:11,489
Hey!

284
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,720
Hey...

285
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
Why did you try to get up?

286
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,720
Did you pass out?

287
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Why?

288
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:48,696
You hurt your prey badly,

289
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,632
then felt guilty about it?

290
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,558
That doesn't really live up
to your wild cat title…

291
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,920
Hey.

292
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,840
Can you stop saying cheesy things?

293
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,144
That's so annoying.

294
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,160
[Prapai: Okay, see you at the wedding]

295
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Pai...

296
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,360
Is there something wrong?

297
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,800
Nothing.

298
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:24,816
Did you invite your ex
to our wedding too?

299
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:29,329
Why did you do that?

300
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,080
You wanted her to come to you
before the wedding?

301
00:33:36,729 --> 00:33:38,009
This is none of your business.

302
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,320
Why isn't this my business?

303
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,435
What's yours is also mine.

304
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
If you're hurt,

305
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,000
I am hurt too.

306
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,240
But that's alright.

307
00:33:58,063 --> 00:33:59,423
Get hurt as much as you need to,

308
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,040
then marry me.

309
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,984
I promise I'll help heal your wounds.

310
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,840
And I'll help you forget about your past.

311
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
You think I'm gonna fall for you?

312
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,640
I don't know.

313
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:40,344
It's just that
your heart is racing right now.

314
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't be so full of yourself.

315
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll wait until you're ready,

316
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,120
so it'll be you who hugs me.

317
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,680
Go to sleep.

318
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:00,936
You're talking back like that,
are you feeling better now?

319
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,600
Rin.

320
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
Rin.

321
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,700
Rin!

322
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,680
Rin.

323
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:50,816
Pai broke up with me.

324
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,185
I have no one, literally no one.

325
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,079
I want to die. Hear that?

326
00:35:58,104 --> 00:35:59,280
I want to die.

327
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,200
Rin.

328
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:03,968
Do you think death
will set you free from this pain?

329
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:10,224
Rin,

330
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,680
you are not alone.

331
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,080
I love you.

332
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:49,856
Before the wedding day,

333
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,520
the bride and groom aren't supposed to be
in the same room, right?

334
00:37:00,328 --> 00:37:01,688
Who do you think

335
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,920
you are?

336
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:10,296
I don't know.

337
00:37:15,544 --> 00:37:17,144
All I know is that

338
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm the one
who loves you with all my heart,

339
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,616
unconditionally.

340
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:31,768
Even if I can't define my love for you,

341
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
but...

342
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:42,288
stop playing games
and just let me love you!

343
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:51,696
Rin...

344
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,720
What?

345
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,880
Have you ever thought about

346
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
how you'd feel

347
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,160
after the wedding?

348
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:07,751
I don't know.

349
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:15,727
Shall you let

350
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,080
your feelings grow once tonight?

351
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,840
Hello, sir.

352
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,984
Rin, you are as beautiful as your mom.

353
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:43,064
Thank you.

354
00:40:43,737 --> 00:40:45,008
Mom is beautiful,

355
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,564
I must also be beautiful.

356
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:54,944
I'll be welcoming the guests for you.

357
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:56,544
Okay.

358
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:03,304
Thank you, sir.

359
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:05,344
You're welcome.

360
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,920
Hey, wait!

361
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:14,873
What's now?

362
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:16,273
I'll go welcome the guests myself.

363
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,800
But we are going to be
a husband and a wife today.

364
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:23,928
Even though I'm a woman,

365
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,840
I still want to be your husband.

366
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:29,480
You're talking nonsense.

367
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
Are you off your rocker?

368
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,600
Oh...

369
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,025
Oh my, what an old saying!

370
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:37,600
That really tells me your age!

371
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,280
Are you making fun of my age again?

372
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:43,376
No, not at all.

373
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,840
Can I kiss your cheek just one time

374
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,840
before you become my wife?

375
00:41:56,193 --> 00:41:57,193
Hmmm!

376
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,320
Be humble!

377
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,160
My hair's messed up, Rin.

378
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,960
Oh, how can I stop myself?

379
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,040
My wife is so gorgeous!

380
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,458
- Hey.
- What?

381
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,240
Let me get this straight,

382
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:19,833
why do you like me?

383
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,714
There are a lot of women,

384
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,040
why don't you like anyone else?

385
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,240
Why can't I like you, Rin?

386
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,760
I like you so much.

387
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,120
Like you the most!

388
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,560
You surely can.

389
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,480
Umm!

390
00:42:37,913 --> 00:42:39,873
But I'm way ahead of you in age, though.

391
00:42:41,252 --> 00:42:42,920
What are you expecting from me?

392
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,280
Inheritance?

393
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:50,832
Let's keep this for tonight,

394
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,840
I'll tell you why I like you.

395
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:59,391
So annoying. This kid's super annoying.

396
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,466
Oh, whoa.

397
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
Rin...

398
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,225
Alright, everyone.

399
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:46,745
It's time for our bride to say her vows.

400
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:48,505
Miss Praenarin, please say your vows.

401
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:50,224
Thank you.

402
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,240
Here you are, Rin.

403
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,120
I've never thought...

404
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,010
I'd be standing right here.

405
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,800
I don't believe in love,

406
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,116
and think no one
will make me change my mind.

407
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:11,792
But I get to have someone

408
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:13,632
who will be with me forever.

409
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:17,392
Then it must be...

410
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:19,112
Must be...

411
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:20,552
this person.

412
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:24,161
The most annoying person ever.

413
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,960
It must be her.

414
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,960
And it's Khem's time to say her vow.

415
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,825
Is there anything you'd like to say
to this beautiful bride?

416
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:50,450
Or maybe share the story
of how your love began

417
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,930
and how you two fell in love?

418
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,615
Pai...

419
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,080
Rin.

420
00:45:58,752 --> 00:46:00,232
Look at me, Rin.

421
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,320
Don't do that, I beg.

422
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,960
We're getting married.

423
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:10,151
The guests are watching us.

424
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,640
Rin, get yourself together.

425
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,720
Wait until the ceremony ends,
I'm begging you.

426
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,800
The story of our love from my side?

427
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:30,871
When I was born,

428
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:33,776
Rin was studying in middle school.

429
00:46:34,785 --> 00:46:35,785
Hey...

430
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:37,145
Are you mentioning my age again?

431
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,720
How can't I skip this part?

432
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,560
You are my first love.

433
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,840
My love has bloomed

434
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,920
since the day I met her.

435
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,400
And that was the time
I remembered it so well.

436
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,160
Hey, you...

437
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,560
Are those vows

438
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,225
or just a declaration
of how young you are, Khemjira?

439
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,560
Of course, those are my vows.

440
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,560
Because I promise

441
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,880
to make you love me in the end!

442
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,320
[4 years ago]

443
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:30,641
Wipe your tears.

444
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:35,568
And stop crying.

445
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,120
If you keep crying like this,

446
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,560
no matter how strong you are inside,

447
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:48,064
people will still think you're weak.

448
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:53,304
I just want to choose what I like.

449
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,800
Why does my dad never let me choose,
not even once?

450
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:05,488
Do you want me to talk this out for you?

451
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,560
Are you helping me?

452
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:14,216
I think I can help you.

453
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,560
Hey,

454
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:17,584
your dad

455
00:48:17,624 --> 00:48:19,424
isn't that cruel.

456
00:48:19,952 --> 00:48:22,592
He's just worried about your future.

457
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,120
But if you can prove

458
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:29,184
you're capable,

459
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,168
he'll give you more freedom, somehow.

460
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,360
Trust me.

461
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,960
Thank you.

462
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:43,136
Umm.

463
00:48:43,176 --> 00:48:45,096
Stop crying now.

464
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,960
Thank you.

465
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,800
Please give a big hand
to these two brides!

466
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:40,161
Rin,

467
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,360
I love you.

468
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:53,512
I've been doing all this for you,

469
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,960
and I'll keep doing it forever,

470
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,481
until the last second of my life.

471
00:50:03,824 --> 00:50:06,696
Now, both brides, it's time

472
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:08,736
to show your love...

473
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,760
You may kiss the bride!

474
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,665
Go ahead and kiss!

475
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:14,410
Kiss!

476
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,290
- Kiss!
- Kiss her!

477
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,380
Rin,

478
00:50:20,096 --> 00:50:21,176
please give me that.

479
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,200
Please hold my hand.

480
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:25,426
I'm right here.

481
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:28,976
Just forget about her.

482
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,345
And it's time to toss the bouquet.

483
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,545
Ladies, please come forward!

484
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,745
Come, come.

485
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:41,782
Don't wait up, just come forward.

486
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,920
Are you all ready, bridesmaids?

487
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,880
So gorgeous!

488
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:03,080
[Prapai: Congrats]

489
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,904
What are you reading, Rin?

490
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:18,639
Nothing.

491
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
It's alright,

492
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,720
I won't ask you anymore.

493
00:53:25,904 --> 00:53:27,104
But tonight,

494
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,200
I'll tell you why I like you.

495
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,960
Hmm!

496
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,480
So annoying.

497
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,880
[Director:
Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

498
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,280
A lot has happened to me today.

499
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,960
But what made it the most chaotic

500
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,040
was that kid.

501
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,840
Today, she was working

502
00:54:02,384 --> 00:54:03,984
and slept at the desk.

503
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,585
Actually,

504
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:13,945
no one forced her to work that hard.

505
00:54:16,377 --> 00:54:17,777
And...

506
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,840
she said my name in her dream, too.

507
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:23,985
Rin...

508
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,520
Rin, can you help me finish the work?

509
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:41,144
I felt nothing at all.

510
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,880
Really.

511
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,920
But...

512
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:51,824
If she...

513
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,480
looks at me like that again tomorrow,

514
00:55:04,616 --> 00:55:06,136
what should I do then?

515
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,368
Khemjira...

516
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:16,536
You think you can beat me, right?

517
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,240
Try me.

518
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:22,849
'Cause I...

519
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:26,264
I'm a bit unsure about myself too.

520
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:30,880
Oh...

521
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,640
Today is Saturday.

522
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,360
Should we go outside?

523
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,110
Go wherever you want!

524
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:51,785
If I want to use the couple promo,

525
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:53,730
we have to go as a couple!

526
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:57,280
We're about to guess
who Boss Rin's husband is.

527
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,185
Who is that?

528
00:55:58,225 --> 00:55:59,105
Oh, Rin.

529
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,920
That's Mr. Kiri.

530
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:04,512
You're as precious as fine wine.

531
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,140
And good wine is...

532
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,960
perfect for someone who doesn't know
how to drink it, like me.

533
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,752
Only one time, okay?

534
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,600
I want to sleep.
