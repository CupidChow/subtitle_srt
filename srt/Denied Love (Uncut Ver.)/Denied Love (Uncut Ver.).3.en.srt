6

I think they're not good enough.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,960
Fix them.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,080
If you're being kind to me a bit,

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,760
I might be more encouraged, who knows?

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,640
Hey.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,760
Kid.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
What's wrong?

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,840
I have to submit my work
to Rin's office at 9.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,700
Work is more important than health?

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,320
Everything is important to me, Kwanrin.

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
I love you.

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,280
I promise I'll help heal your wounds.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,720
Just forget about her.

19
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:50,696
[Prapai: Congrats]

20
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,015
I don't believe in love,

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,356
and think no one
will make me change my mind.

22
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:03,032
But I get to have someone

23
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:04,872
who will be with me forever.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,440
Then it must be...

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,480
The most annoying person ever.

26
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:45,477
What are you reading, Rin?

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,000
Nothing.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
It's alright,

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,070
I won't ask you anymore.

30
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,015
But tonight,

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,840
I'll tell you why I like you.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,160
Hmm!

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
So annoying.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,600
You're no longer looking for that lady?

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm done.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm tired.

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,240
I want to go home

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,720
and take a bath.

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,720
Then, change your clothes

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,600
and we'll head back home.

41
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:38,784
I can't wait to tell you why I like you
when we're all alone.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,065
Let's go.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay?

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,480
Let's get going.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,590
Come on.

46
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,140
From now on,
please take care of each other.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,300
Khem.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
Yes?

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Please take care of Rin, okay?

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,840
Also, from now on, you can call me 'Dad.'

51
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:18,088
I'm not just a random old man.

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
Come and see me tomorrow.

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,440
I have something for you.

54
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,296
It's just a fake wedding.

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Dad.

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,856
Sleeping in separate bedrooms
is already perfectly fine.

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
There's no need for us
to share the bedroom.

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,440
Who says it's fake?

59
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,216
Is it you or...

60
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:42,764
Well...

61
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,680
No.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,560
There's no such thing as a fake wedding.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,760
Although this ends in 2 years,

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,240
this relationship

65
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,840
is more than real to me.

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,680
Now, now...

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,160
Please go and have a rest, you two.

68
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:01,720
I have to call it here, too.

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,320
Rin, you heard it, didn't you?

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,760
It's not just a fake wedding.

71
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,856
It's a relationship that lasts 2 years.

72
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:11,766
Once it's over,

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,200
feel free to pursue becoming the President.

74
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,200
You also need to treat Khem

75
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,720
like a married couple.

76
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,920
Yes.

77
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
Thank you very much.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm going to bed now.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,200
How sweet.

80
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
What's with you?

81
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,320
It's nothing.

82
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,360
It's just that you're spectacular

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,360
for managing to pull through the wedding

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,800
while your ex was there.

85
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,582
Mm.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,880
I'm going to take a shower.

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
You can hit the shower after me.

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
If she fell asleep while I was showering,

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,071
when would I get to tell her

90
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,840
why she deserves my love?

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
Wait!

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,660
That's a no.

93
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:06,015
This bedroom is pretty big,

94
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:09,528
but the bed is very tiny.

95
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,120
So what?

96
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
Do you roll around when you sleep, Rin?

97
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm worried I might fall out of bed.

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,520
Sleep there if you've got a problem.

99
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,320
It's your spot.

100
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,600
Aww, Rin!

101
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,080
You're such a meanie.

102
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Sleeping on the floor isn't as fun
as sleeping next to you.

103
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Hey, listen.

104
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,600
Stop messing with me

105
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,536
and keep your distance.

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
Well...

107
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Tonight,

108
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,080
let me be by your side in your dreams.

109
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,575
Rin, are you blushing?

110
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,600
Oh?

111
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,705
No, I'm not.

112
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,032
You're moving away from me, though.

113
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Or perhaps...

114
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,040
Are you afraid of something?

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,400
Hey.

116
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes?

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,120
If you don't want to
experience this tonight,

118
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
please go ahead and fall asleep.

119
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm going to sleep either way.

120
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,296
This is my bed.

121
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,880
Oh, ow!

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Hey!

123
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Khem!

124
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,320
Let go of me! What are you trying to do?

125
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,120
I'd like to hug my own wife.

126
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:18,464
My dear wife,

127
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,415
tonight is the nuptial night.

128
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,440
How about we do things
like married couples do?

129
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,960
Hold on.

130
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,256
In the evening,

131
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,320
you've already kissed me
without my consent.

132
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,136
Oh!

133
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,343
The emcee told me to do it.

134
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,040
That's why I...

135
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:55,728
I'll answer your question

136
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
about why I like you

137
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,080
even though we're 12 years apart.

138
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:06,911
Mm...

139
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
And...

140
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Why is that?

141
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,383
You're as precious as fine wine.

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,576
The more it ages,

143
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
the better it tastes.

144
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,033
And fine wine is...

145
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:27,184
perfect for someone who doesn't know
how to drink it, like me.

146
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
How strange.

147
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,440
Fine wine

148
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,431
should suit a sommelier better,
shouldn't it?

149
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Hmm...

150
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,440
If it's in the hands of a sommelier,

151
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,240
they might only focus
on its exquisite flavor.

152
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:49,455
However, when it comes to someone like me
who doesn't drink wine,

153
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,183
even if the bottle of wine has gone bad,

154
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,080
I still find it enjoyable

155
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,880
and more valuable.

156
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,520
Are all sapphics sweet talkers?

157
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,120
That's up for debate.

158
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,880
But...

159
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,153
You're the only one
I'll ever say these words to.

160
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,120
Now, can I give you a kiss,

161
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,505
my dear wife?

162
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
Khem.

163
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,840
Stop.

164
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,417
Please.

165
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,080
Let me do my job.

166
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,000
I swear that I'll make you as happy

167
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,222
as you want to be.

168
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,520
Only one time, okay?

169
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:00,016
I want to sleep.

170
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,520
Yes, love.

171
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Hold up...

172
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Please don't stop me, Rin.

173
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:07,077
Well...

174
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
I've never done this.

175
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,540
Me neither.

176
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:49,384
Do you like it?

177
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,871
Good morning, Rin.

178
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,600
Mmm!

179
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,960
Hey,

180
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:12,616
don't act like we're close.

181
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:13,903
Why not?

182
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:17,111
We're a married couple after all.

183
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:23,503
I do not accept this.

184
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,320
Well,

185
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,040
I need to change your mind, right?

186
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,127
Rin?

187
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Rin!

188
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,360
Can we do it again?

189
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Rin!

190
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,280
Thank you, Kwanrin.

191
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
How are you doing, Rin?

192
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,000
Was last night exhausting?

193
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,360
You woke up at noon.

194
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,400
Well...

195
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:32,535
A little bit.

196
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,520
I didn't wake up at noon, though.

197
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,095
I woke up at 11 A.M.

198
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:42,544
Mm...

199
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:45,905
Rin never wakes up later than 9 A.M.,

200
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:47,631
even on days off.

201
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:49,584
Perhaps,

202
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:53,207
you woke up late because of me, right?

203
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,640
Hey, stop making it sound bad.

205
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,520
Huh?

206
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,168
It was true, wasn't it?

207
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,600
You had to deal with the wedding all day.

208
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,265
Since you were exhausted,
you had a lot of sleep.

209
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:08,863
Am I wrong?

210
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Now, now...

211
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I'm going golfing for a bit.

212
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,505
You two do things you have to do, okay?

213
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,880
Oh,

214
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,529
about your honeymoon,

215
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,160
please let me know when you're going,

216
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,800
so I can look after the company for you.

217
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes.

218
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,501
See you soon, Dad.

219
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:40,056
Enjoy golfing.

220
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Khem.

221
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:45,983
Never do that again.

222
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:47,808
You can't say stuff like that.

223
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,376
I won't do it again, I guess.

224
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,840
It's Saturday.

225
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,625
How about we hang out outside?

226
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,920
I'd like to have some BBQ
this evening, too.

227
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,440
I've heard there's a promotion for couples
at that place.

228
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,800
It's such a huge discount, Rin.

229
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,760
Let's go there.

230
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,080
Please!

231
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,016
That's a no.

232
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:14,416
Go wherever you want on your own.

233
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Or else...

234
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,280
Invite Kwanrin,

235
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:19,695
not me.

236
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,800
A promotion for couples means

237
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:23,865
I need to go with my partner,

238
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,815
right, Kwanrin?

239
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,440
That is correct.

240
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,070
Please don't look so displeased, Rin.

241
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,400
That can make you age faster, you know?

242
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:39,143
Ouch! Ouch!

243
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
That hurt!

244
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:43,207
If your partner died,

245
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,848
you'd be a widow quite young.

246
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,567
Even if you kicked the bucket here,

247
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
I wouldn't feel sorry.

248
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:55,896
I'm pretty good in bed, though.

249
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,992
Aren't you gonna love me for that,
at least?

250
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,017
Khemjira!

251
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:01,896
Okay.

252
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,151
I will stop talking now.

253
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:07,456
I'm going to keep my mouth shut.

254
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,288
I will keep it a secret from everybody,

255
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:11,856
and I'll listen to every word you say,
my wife.

256
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,840
- How's that sound?
- Shut up!

257
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,400
You couldn't sleep last night, Rin?

258
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,000
Were you thinking about something?

259
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:36,992
Hey.

260
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I told you to stop talking about it.

261
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,960
But you...

262
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,080
You look like you have stuff on your mind.

263
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,240
Nothing's on my mind.

264
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,880
You're such a bad liar.

265
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,520
Khem.

266
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
You want to mess with me this badly, right?

267
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,920
I'll make you realize that

268
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,560
I can be meaner than you expect.

269
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:19,672
We'll see about that.

270
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,840
Hey.

271
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,480
Just pick a movie already,
don’t just stare at me.

272
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,800
Please don't get upset so often, Rin.

273
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,360
You're a gorgeous girl,

274
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,320
so act like one.

275
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,040
Mm.

276
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,120
Am I that beautiful?

277
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,360
Of course, you are!

278
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,840
You're so beautiful that
I can't take my eyes off you,

279
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,360
especially under the dim orange light.

280
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,760
That's when you shine the most.

281
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Mm! Mm!

282
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
Go ahead and choose what you want to watch.

283
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
And...

284
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,440
don't forget to get me some popcorn.

285
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,480
My lover is stunning, isn't she?

286
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,280
Absolutely.

287
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,560
She's absolutely sexy, isn't she?

288
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:29,640
Let me go already!

289
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,080
Hey, Rin!

290
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,160
That movie was really fun.

291
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,745
Let's watch a horror film next time.

292
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:39,024
I've been wanting to watch
that kind of film with my partner for ages.

293
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,640
It was a shame that I hadn't had one.

294
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,080
Please?

295
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Let's watch it next time.

296
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:48,064
Consider this our honeymoon.

297
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,680
Yes?

298
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,240
Our honeymoon?

299
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Yes.

300
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,360
Coming with you here

301
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,200
counts as a honeymoon.

302
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,105
Okay?

303
00:23:58,224 --> 00:24:00,024
Also, go ahead and tell my dad that

304
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,360
we've had a honeymoon.

305
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,720
From now on,
there won't be any more of this

306
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:07,368
'cause I've got work to do.

307
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:17,735
Honeymoon?

308
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,360
You called hanging out at a mall
a honeymoon?

309
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,720
Gosh!

310
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:26,585
A honeymoon is when a couple
shares sweet moments together.

311
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,560
Rin!

312
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,800
I'd like to reserve
our honeymoon for somewhere else!

313
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,480
Oh, Rin?

314
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,600
Fancy meeting you here.

315
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:46,672
You're here to do something?

316
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,680
Yes.

317
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
By the way,

318
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,392
you're working on Saturday?

319
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:55,672
Uh...

320
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:58,177
We have some business to attend to.

321
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,320
If that's the case,

322
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,008
can I come with you?

323
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,440
I have some important things
to discuss with you.

324
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,368
We have private business to attend to.

325
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:14,000
Do you know what that means?

326
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,760
Let's go, Rin.

327
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Come on!

328
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:22,960
Let me go.

329
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:24,385
Hey, you!

330
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,040
Let go of me!

331
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,040
That's Kiri, my client.

332
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:30,905
How dare you talk to him like that?

333
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:32,384
It's Saturday.

334
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,840
It's your day off.

335
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,640
We're also here as lovers.

336
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,760
I can't let that weirdo follow us around.

337
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,120
Why didn't you say no to him?

338
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:40,465
- You...
- Why did you have to keep quiet?

339
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,400
You're so rude.

340
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,240
How dare you call him a weirdo?

341
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:47,505
We're here for our honeymoon,

342
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,313
so we have to make the most of it.

343
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,040
Here.

344
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,680
It's for you.

345
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Listen.

346
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,440
About last night...

347
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,880
What is it?

348
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:30,288
Let’s keep it just between us,

349
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
about us making love.

350
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,500
Sure thing.

351
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:41,472
If you don't want me to mention it,

352
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,080
then I won't.

353
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,860
Don't worry about it, Rin.

354
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:52,408
I'm in this relationship for only 2 years.

355
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
After that,

356
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,560
it's over between us.

357
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,680
Only 2 years?

358
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:03,616
Well...

359
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:05,664
In these 2 years,

360
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:08,809
I'll make sure you remember me forever.

361
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,584
Prapai?

362
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,304
Oh, come on!

363
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,048
We're on honeymoon.

364
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,840
What a day!

365
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm so sorry that
I didn't get to congratulate you.

366
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Something urgent came up.

367
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,680
Mm.

368
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,920
That's totally fine.

369
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,960
And...

370
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,560
How are you doing?

371
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,880
Are you doing well?

372
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,080
I rarely see you on social media at all.

373
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,280
When it comes to your new partner,

374
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
I don't even know what he looks like.

375
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,360
Lately, something's been troubling me.

376
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,760
About your new partner?

377
00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:21,495
You know my thoughts so well,
as always, Rin.

378
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,704
Mm.

379
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:28,760
You've always been
the only person on my mind.

380
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,880
But...

381
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
You're already married.

382
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Pai.

383
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,160
It's for business reasons.

384
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,760
It's for the benefit.

385
00:28:42,383 --> 00:28:44,623
The marriage only lasts for 2 years.

386
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,480
Then, it'll be over.

387
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,320
But...

388
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,920
that girl really seems to love you.

389
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Pai.

390
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,687
Please don't disappear on me.

391
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
I'd like to know what you're up to.

392
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,800
If you need someone by your side,

393
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,585
just tell me. I'm always here.

394
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,160
I'm sorry,

395
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,000
but Rin is married.

396
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,080
Oh, is this Prapai?

397
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,160
Would you like me to dig you a grave?

398
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,480
Don't look at anybody else but me.

399
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:32,265
Stop saying that she'll never love me

400
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,040
because she actually does.

401
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:44,440
Good heavens.

402
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Was that what I had in my head?

403
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,960
Rin?

404
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,000
Are you okay?

405
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,200
Mm.

406
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
I want to go home.

407
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:28,456
Then, let's head home.

408
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,600
Let's go.

409
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,509
Come on.

410
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Kwanrin,

411
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,040
what kind of dish does Rin like?

412
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,840
Um...

413
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:48,935
I'm not sure.

414
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,320
Oh, I think it's an omelet.

415
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Omelet?

416
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,080
Yes, I noticed that

417
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,680
she has an omelet and rice every day.

418
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:01,863
That's perfect.

419
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,080
For this meal,
I'd like to make her an omelet myself.

420
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:08,888
Khem.

421
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,284
Yes, Kwanrin?

422
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,040
I got a new job,

423
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:22,904
and I think I'll be moving away
from this house

424
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,800
to somewhere else.

425
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:28,293
I just want to let you know in advance.

426
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,110
Aww...

427
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,480
Is there something on your mind?

428
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,280
Did I make you upset,

429
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:38,359
or you don't find this place happy?

430
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,880
No, I just...

431
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,216
I've already graduated, you know?

432
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:48,241
You've secured yourself an amazing job.

433
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,560
You're also married.

434
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,176
I just want to pursue
the career path I studied for.

435
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,680
When are you leaving?

436
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,592
Have you found a place to stay?

437
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,440
I've already informed
Mr. Wasin that I'm leaving next week.

438
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,560
I also have a place to stay.

439
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,312
Thank you

440
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,400
for always taking care of me well.

441
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,176
I love you like I love my sister.

442
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,823
Thank you very much, Kwanrin.

443
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:44,864
I'm going to miss you a lot.

444
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,760
What a jerk.

445
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,520
You even hugged other people.

446
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,200
Why should I even care?

447
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,480
Who she hugs is her business.

448
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,744
There's no point for me to care.

449
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:45,239
Thank you so much, Kwanrin.

450
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:47,615
Please take care of yourself.

451
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,960
Likewise, Khem.

452
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,040
Call me if you miss me.

453
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,200
No doubt.

454
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:59,543
Let me cook up an omelet first, okay?

455
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,385
Sure, I'll help.

456
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Perfect!

457
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,360
Huh.

458
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,815
You blamed me for simply talking to Kiri,

459
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,000
yet you hugged the other girl?

460
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,880
You're such a meanie!

461
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,927
Die.

462
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:23,674
Perish.

463
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:30,423
Khemjira,

464
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:32,824
die!

465
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:33,849
I'll kill you!

466
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,200
Die!

467
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:40,624
What's going on?

468
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,640
Nothing.

469
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,320
You're holding the plush toy.

470
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Do you have a name for it?

471
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:57,873
'Mookhem.'

472
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,200
I'm calling it Mookhem.

473
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:06,232
Mookhem?

474
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,480
Mm.

475
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,160
It's got part of your name in it.

476
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:15,471
When you act naughtily,

477
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:18,736
I can just spank it instead of you.

478
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,480
Alright.

479
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,880
Mookhem it is.

480
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Hey, you.

481
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What are you trying to do?

482
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,840
Well...

483
00:35:55,248 --> 00:35:56,328
I'm trying to sleep.

484
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280
No.

485
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,040
You can't share the bed with me.

486
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:02,623
That's your spot.

487
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Now, go to bed.

488
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,120
Over there.

489
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:09,103
- There?
- Yes.

490
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:11,896
But we hugged each other
to sleep last night.

491
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:12,801
We even kissed

492
00:36:12,826 --> 00:36:13,843
- and had...
- Stop!

493
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,000
If I say no, then it's a no.

494
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,200
I mean what I mean.

495
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:21,456
Your sleeping spot is

496
00:36:22,192 --> 00:36:23,072
over there.

497
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,200
Get out of my bed. Now!

498
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Perfect.

499
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,248
It's nice to have the bed all by myself.

500
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:00,273
What was that?

501
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Nothing.

502
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
Nothing...

503
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,040
Khem.

504
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Khem.

505
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:15,320
Is she in a deep sleep?

506
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,640
It's not that I'm worried about you.

507
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,431
I was simply afraid that
you'd give me a jump scare.

508
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,880
Rin!

509
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:16,544
Rin!

510
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,640
Hey!

511
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Khemjira.

512
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,751
Yes?

513
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,000
Rin?

514
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,640
Why?

515
00:40:22,344 --> 00:40:24,344
You're such a naughty girl!

516
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Last time, someone drove you here, right?

517
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,960
Why did you drive her yourself today?

518
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,400
Oh.

519
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:54,703
I got a car now,

520
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:56,168
so I don't want to bother anybody.

521
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,880
Hey.

522
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:00,385
Be honest.

523
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:03,344
Before you came in,

524
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:04,767
my partner

525
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:07,281
got fired without doing anything wrong.

526
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,839
Then, you immediately took the position.

527
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:12,896
Don't you think it's kind of weird?

528
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:16,744
Are you sure there was nothing wrong?

529
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:20,897
Have you ever asked your partner
the reason behind the layoff?

530
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,080
It's to give you the position, of course.

531
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,640
Just who are you related to, really?

532
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:28,152
Why are you stealing other people's jobs?

533
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,920
Did her brain stop developing
at a young age?

534
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,360
I don't know what happened exactly

535
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,560
but you'd better not step on my toes.

536
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,040
Just do our jobs as best as we can.

537
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,320
We're on the same team anyway.

538
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Guys! Guys!

539
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,400
I got something to share.

540
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,356
Come on, guys.

541
00:41:58,584 --> 00:41:59,464
This way.

542
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,760
Come here.

543
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
- What is it?
- What's it about?

544
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,200
What is it?

545
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:06,063
Here's the story.

546
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:07,930
Good morning!

547
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,520
- Oh!
- Good morning, everyone.

548
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,440
Hello.

549
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,520
Congrats on your marriage.

550
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:14,785
Thank you.

551
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,800
And...

552
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,505
What are you guys discussing?

553
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,730
It's about Boss.

554
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,720
On Friday, she got married, right?

555
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We're about to guess who her husband is.

556
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:31,463
Oh, and...

557
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Who is it?

558
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:34,465
Of course, it's Kiri,

559
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,960
a charismatic entrepreneur.

560
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,960
He's handsome, rich,

561
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,360
and comes from a very good family.

562
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,520
Early this morning, he came to see Rin

563
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,000
with a bouquet of flowers.

564
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,440
I don't think it's him.

565
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,320
If a guy like that's getting married,

566
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:54,560
his name better be in the headline.

567
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,520
Or maybe...

568
00:42:57,545 --> 00:42:59,780
They held a private wedding.

569
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:00,297
Mm.

570
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:02,920
These days, a lot of celebrities

571
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,360
have private weddings.

572
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,560
It's true.

573
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:06,944
I don't think

574
00:43:07,216 --> 00:43:08,616
it's him.

575
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:12,240
You're acting a bit weird.

576
00:43:12,704 --> 00:43:14,104
You seem to hate the couple.

577
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:18,033
Oh, it's nothing.

578
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:20,832
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

579
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:23,463
Oh.

580
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,478
Gosh.

581
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:25,903
Let's go.

582
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:27,928
Let's get back to work.

583
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,840
Hey.

584
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,240
Yes?

585
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,120
I'll have you know that

586
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,400
everyone's shipping Kiri and Boss

587
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,160
If you don't want to get frowned upon,

588
00:43:55,185 --> 00:43:56,105
be quiet.

589
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,260
Ah!

590
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,863
Uh...

591
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:51,583
[Call me Daddy or Daddy-licious]

592
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:17,064
You're as precious as fine wine.

593
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,666
The more it ages, the better it tastes.

594
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,480
And fine wine is...

595
00:45:22,505 --> 00:45:25,181
perfect for someone who doesn't know
how to drink it, like me.

596
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,640
Here.

597
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,520
Do you have a name for it?

598
00:45:33,224 --> 00:45:34,184
'Mookhem.'

599
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,471
It's got part of your name in it.

600
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,960
When you act naughtily,

601
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,800
I can just spank it instead of you.

602
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,960
[Please share the bed with me tonight]

603
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,320
I've already hit send...

604
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,640
Hey!

605
00:47:19,323 --> 00:47:21,040
Hey, you!

606
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,360
You smell so nice.

607
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,825
It's too warm. Why are you hugging me?

608
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:31,415
I miss my dear wife.

609
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,520
Let go.

610
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,320
Oh, why did Kiri pay you a visit today?

611
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,480
Does his coming to visit me

612
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,520
have something to do with you?

613
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:49,495
I'm your husband, though.

614
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,560
So what?

615
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,496
I love you, Rin.

616
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,800
I'm possessive of my wife.

617
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
Really?

618
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,040
Which 'Rin' do you love?

619
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,040
Is it Praenarin or Kwanrin?

620
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,960
Huh?

621
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,240
Why did you ask me that?

622
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,440
Well...

623
00:48:16,273 --> 00:48:19,433
I saw you two hugging in private.

624
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,825
That's why I was wondering
which girl you love.

625
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,600
Oh...

626
00:48:29,184 --> 00:48:31,544
Aww, Rin!

627
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,360
I just want to say goodbye to Kwanrin.

628
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,880
She's leaving in a few weeks.

629
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,360
I love Kwanrin like a sister.

630
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:43,783
As for you, Rin,

631
00:48:43,808 --> 00:48:45,608
I love you like my wife.

632
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,080
Please!

633
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,760
Please believe me.

634
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,920
Please, please, please!

635
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,880
Please!

636
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,840
Please, Rin.

637
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
Please!

638
00:48:59,305 --> 00:49:00,105
No.

639
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,760
Sleep in your spot.

640
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,200
I don't want to!

641
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,950
I hate sleeping there.

642
00:49:07,975 --> 00:49:10,329
I don't want to sleep there anymore.

643
00:49:10,354 --> 00:49:13,448
It hurts my back and my heart.

644
00:49:14,816 --> 00:49:17,896
I want to hug my wife to sleep.

645
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,976
My dear wife,

646
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,560
tonight,

647
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,600
shall we do things in bed again?

648
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,120
I wasn't satisfied with that night.

649
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,520
Are you kidding me?

650
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,360
We did it for hours, Khem.

651
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,440
I'm not satisfied, Rin.

652
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:44,705
To make me satisfied,

653
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:46,496
we have to do it all night.

654
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,280
You're out of your mind.

655
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,680
Rin, please believe me.

656
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,560
I'll make you as happy as you've ever been.

657
00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:00,288
I'll also make you

658
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:01,993
feel it even more.

659
00:50:03,216 --> 00:50:04,736
You already know

660
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:08,576
how soft my tongue is.

661
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,560
Khem...

662
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:42,896
I hope you get that letting you do this

663
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,520
doesn't mean I love you.

664
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,040
I know.

665
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:55,608
And I hope you know that

666
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,296
everything I do,

667
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,840
I do with love.

668
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,520
Do you like it?

669
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,700
Yes.

670
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,520
What about this spot?

671
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Do you like it?

672
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,080
Yeah.

673
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,640
Do you like it?

674
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,080
Please allow me to do this, Rin.

675
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,320
Mm.

676
00:53:56,712 --> 00:53:58,312
If you come across this video,

677
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,240
you don't have to try to understand me.

678
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,720
Because I don't understand myself either.

679
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,640
Whenever Khemjira

680
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,800
looks at me in the eye,

681
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,840
it always makes my heart soften.

682
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:22,592
I used to think
love was a nonsensical thing.

683
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,680
But this puppy girl

684
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,440
makes me argue with myself
almost every day.

685
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,640
She held my hands really tightly today.

686
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,000
She even told me

687
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:42,704
she'd never let go of my hands.

688
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,256
What if I actually believe what she said?

689
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,200
Khemjira,

690
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,520
can you stop making my heart tremble?

691
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,226
Rin.

692
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,888
I've lost again, haven't I?

693
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:06,376
I've lost to the one
you still have feelings for.

694
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,360
I've lost the game before it even started.

695
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:13,216
We even hugged each other to sleep.

696
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:15,591
I thought I'd get a step closer,

697
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,640
but nope.

698
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:20,743
It was nothing but a honeymoon.

699
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,480
Rin!

700
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,800
That's okay, though.

701
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,880
I'm a fighter.

702
00:55:30,312 --> 00:55:32,232
This is the battle I'm fighting.

703
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,040
Today, you held someone else's hand.

704
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,960
Tomorrow, I'll hold your hand.

705
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:41,265
If you ever let me hold your hand,

706
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:45,360
I'll smile like I've gone insane!

707
00:55:49,903 --> 00:55:52,223
I'm not the best out there, though.

708
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:56,416
Even so, I'm very determined.

709
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,800
Please don't throw me out.

710
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,400
If you try,

711
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:09,288
I'll still be here either way!

712
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,120
I want you to tell Kiri
that you're married.

713
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:37,968
If Khemjira hears the news...

714
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:39,473
I'm worried about how she'll feel.

715
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:41,546
I love you, Rin.

716
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,560
I'm confident that if we end up together,

717
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,280
we'll be the kind of couple
everyone is jealous of.

718
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,880
If you have any problems,

719
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,800
feel free to come find me.

720
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,200
Mm, likewise.

721
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,120
Right!
