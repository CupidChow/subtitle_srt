1
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,375
Is my phone battery about to die?

2
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,291
You first.

3
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,541
Do you want me to help?

4
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,625
Uh, sorry, I can't speak Thai.

5
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,500
Let me help you.

6
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,250
Here you go.

7
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:25,916
Okay.

8
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,125
Thank you.

9
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,125
You saved my life.

10
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,041
No problem.

11
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,666
Bye.

12
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,791
Everyone, it... it's coming.

13
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,750
I shouldn't have eaten papaya salad. It's coming.

14
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,916
Chaba has to excuse herself for a moment. She'll be right back.

15
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:34,666
Nadol.

16
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:35,750
Go sing quickly.

17
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, no way.

18
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,125
Come on.

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,875
The customers will all leave.

20
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,000
They won't, trust me.

21
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:42,750
Go.

22
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,250
Just a little bit.

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,500
You guys...

24
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:54,041
Nadol, Nadol, Nadol.

25
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,750
Hello everyone.

26
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,125
My apologies on behalf of our singer. There was a slight mishap.

27
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,250
Let's just say I'll buy everyone a drink today.

28
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,000
And I will take on the role of the singer.

29
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
For now, I'll stand in for our singer.

30
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,416
Thank you. Thank you all very much.

31
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,791
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

32
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,666
Can I buy him a glass of red wine?

33
00:06:59,166 --> 00:06:59,791
Hey.

34
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,750
Thanks for the drink.

35
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,125
You're welcome.

36
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,166
What do you want?

37
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,916
Wh-what do you mean?

38
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,250
I mean...

39
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,791
You keep looking at me, and you even ordered me a wine.

40
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,375
I like the song you sang.

41
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,791
Yes, really.

42
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay, thanks.

43
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,875
Want to have a drink together?

44
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:36,916
Sure.

45
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,041
Hey.

46
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,250
What about your power bank?

47
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,000
It's time to return it, isn't it?

48
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,500
It saved my life.

49
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,000
Hand it over.

50
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,416
Thanks.

51
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:25,916
So...

52
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,791
How was your day?

53
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,750
I'm not sure. This is my first time in Thailand.

54
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,000
My name is Nadol. [cite_start]What's your name? [cite: 3]

55
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,000
Sanliang.

56
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:41,916
Sanliang?

57
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:43,875
[cite_start]Nadol. [cite: 3]

58
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,750
And... where are you from?

59
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,500
- I'm from Taiwan.
- Taiwan.

60
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,625
And how long will you be in Thailand?

61
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,916
Not sure.

62
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,125
Not sure?

63
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:04,541
Did you come alone?

64
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:09,875
Yes.

65
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,416
Don't be sad.

66
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,750
I'm free tomorrow.

67
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,750
I'll take you.

68
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:25,041
To a beautiful place around here. Are you interested?

69
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,875
Really?

70
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:28,791
Really.

71
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,875
Won't I be bothering you?

72
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,375
No, I'm free tomorrow.

73
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,291
Do you drink?

74
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,750
Yes, I do.

75
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,750
What would you like to drink?

76
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,541
Everything.

77
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,041
I'll go get it for you.

78
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,750
Try it.

79
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:36,625
It's good.

80
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:37,916
Do you like it?

81
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,750
Of course.

82
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,625
Cheers.

83
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,041
Another one?

84
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:52,500
It's all gone.

85
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,291
It's all gone.

86
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,500
Just a little bit.

87
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,625
Good morning, Sanliang.

88
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,500
Hey, morning.

89
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,625
Sorry, the traffic was terrible.

90
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,750
No, it's okay. I just got here myself.

91
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you ready for an adventure?

92
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,791
Of course. Where are we going first?

93
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Just follow me.

94
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,166
It looks delicious. What is it called?

95
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,166
It's called Pad Thai.

96
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,291
Pad Thai.

97
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,750
Pad - Thai.

98
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,625
- Pad
- [cite_start]Pub? [cite: 4]

99
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:42,500
Pad.

100
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,000
Pub.

101
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,791
Never mind. Okay, just eat.

102
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,416
Pad Thai.

103
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,250
Correct.

104
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,916
- I get to try it first?
- Yes, you first.

105
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,000
How is it?

106
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,416
Everything goes so well together.

107
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,875
Pad Thai.

108
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,125
Is it delicious?

109
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:15,500
Delicious.

110
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,500
- It's delicious, right?
- Delicious, isn't it?

111
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,500
Do you like it?

112
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,250
I like it.

113
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,375
Okay, eat up.

114
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,000
Eat it all.

115
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,625
And here's a shrimp, I'll give it to you.

116
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,625
Do you like shrimp?

117
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes, I do.

118
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:31,750
Okay.

119
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:43,750
Stop.

120
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,916
I have something to show you.

121
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,166
It will make it more delicious.

122
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,625
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

123
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,041
With this.

124
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,125
Peanuts.

125
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,000
Peanuts.

126
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:56,625
That's right.

127
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,291
Peanuts.

128
00:13:59,125 --> 00:13:59,750
Do you like it spicy?

129
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:01,500
A little bit.

130
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,291
A little bit.

131
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,125
Just a little bit.

132
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:05,875
Don't do it.

133
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

134
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,625
Yes.

135
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,875
Sugar.

136
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:16,791
Sugar.

137
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,375
That's right.

138
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,125
Sugar?

139
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,750
Yes.

140
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:21,791
[cite_start]Fish sauce. [cite: 5]

141
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,416
[cite_start]Fish? [cite: 5]

142
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

143
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,250
I'll mix it for you.

144
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,416
You look like an expert.

145
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,125
Okay.

146
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,250
It's ready.

147
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,000
Try it, try it, you have to try it.

148
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,125
Can I trust you?

149
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,125
Yes, of course.

150
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,500
Excellent.

151
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:02,416
But...

152
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:03,500
It's spicy.

153
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,916
Water.

154
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,250
Plain water.

155
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,750
Is it delicious?

156
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,041
Delicious.

157
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,000
Eat it all.

158
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:22,750
Eat a lot.

159
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,250
Eat a lot, yes.

160
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,375
After this.

161
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
After that, I'll take you somewhere else.

162
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,791
- A beautiful place.
- Really?

163
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,791
- Where?
- Do you want to go?

164
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,000
Of course.

165
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,250
Around Bangkok, there are many beautiful places.

166
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,041
Okay, but now you...

167
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,125
You have to eat. Eat first so you have energy.

168
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,625
Delicious.

169
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:10,625
Delicious.

170
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,416
- Very delicious.
- It's like the word "delicious."

171
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,500
- Delicious.
- Yes.

172
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:16,750
So much.

173
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:17,625
Really?

174
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,916
Do you want more?

175
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,541
You're terrible.

176
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,541
- How do you feel?
- Very comfortable.

177
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,125
[cite_start]Do you like Pad Thai? [cite: 4]

178
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,916
[cite_start]Not at all, no. [cite: 6]

179
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,250
Sanliang.

180
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,125
I think I have to go now.

181
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,166
Thank you, Nadol.

182
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,250
Today was amazing.

183
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,000
The best day in Bangkok.

184
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,041
You're welcome. I had a lot of fun too.

185
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:56,500
But...

186
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,000
Goodbye.

187
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,750
Hey, Nadol.

188
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,166
I think we bought a lot of snacks and drinks.

189
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,666
Do you want to come up to my room?

190
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,500
Okay, great.

191
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,166
Follow me.

192
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,125
You first.

193
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,625
Welcome to my home.

194
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,875
Have a seat.

195
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,166
Thank you.

196
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,375
Are you thirsty?

197
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,750
For you.

198
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,875
Just one glass.

199
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,000
Just a moment.

200
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,500
Thanks, I'm starving.

201
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:54,625
Me too.

202
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,000
Is it delicious?

203
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Delicious. Did you make it?

204
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,416
No.

205
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,916
I bought it.

206
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,750
It's better than being alone.

207
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,791
It's okay.

208
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,250
Cheers.

209
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,875
How do Thai people say "cheers"?

210
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,500
Chon gâew (cheers).

211
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:28,625
Chon gâew (cheers).

212
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:29,500
Correct.

213
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,500
Chon gâew (cheers).

214
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:46,375
It tastes good. Cheers.

215
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:58,875
Nadol.

216
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,125
Yes?

217
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,125
I need to take a shower first.

218
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,416
I feel so sticky.

219
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,875
Make yourself at home.

220
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,791
He brought me to his room.

221
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,791
And then went to take a shower.

222
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,875
Is he hitting on me?

223
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:21,375
[cite_start]Sanliang. [cite: 7]

224
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,500
What happened?

225
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,375
Sanliang.

226
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,625
Hey, are you okay?

227
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:39,375
It's okay.

228
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,541
Close your eyes.

229
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:48,500
Better?

230
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,166
Nadol.

231
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,750
Thank you so much for a wonderful day.

232
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:31,041
I'm sorry.

233
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,041
That I couldn't say goodbye to you.

234
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,875
I promise.

235
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,375
That we will meet again someday.

236
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,666
Sanliang.
