1
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:00,250
We always find time for what matters most to us.

2
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,791
No matter how much or how little time we have at that moment.

3
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,208
But it’s strange, isn’t it?

4
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:13,125
Why does time fly so fast when we’re happy?

5
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,375
Is it because happiness makes us lose track of time?

6
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:23,416
Or could it be because of love?

7
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,416
What exactly is it that makes our clock hands spin faster than usual?

8
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:34,916
Day 2

9
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,166
Okay.

10
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,500
alright.

11
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,083
We’ve arrived. You go rest now.

12
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,166
Today I hurt her so many times.

14
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,541
I'm okay.

15
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,708
accident.

16
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,333
I don't think to much.

17
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,250
Really?

18
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,083
I am Strong.

19
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,958
Please take this!

20
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,500
What?

21
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,875
You made me bleed and all I get is 100 baht

22
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,208
No, you keep it.

23
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,000
We're friends.

24
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:25,958
I’m your  brother.

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,708
You're happy. I'm happy.

26
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:29,791
Win-Win

27
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,625
Thank you so much. I had such a great time today.

28
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:35,541
Chai Mai

29
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,583
Yes!

30
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:37,916
Thank so much.

31
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,291
I want to apologize to you again.

32
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,416
I'm okay.

33
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:46,791
See you tomorrow.

34
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,125
No.

35
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,791
It's not me tomorrow.

36
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,583
I think...It’ll probably be

37
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,458
Another people

38
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,500
Okay.

39
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,333
Stay safe, okay?

40
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:02,958
See you next time.

41
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,208

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,833

Oh! That was really loud.

62
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,416
That was so loud, the whole neighborhood
must’ve heard it.

63
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,250
Come on, Mom. I’m just happy. Want me to cry instead?

64
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,500
Keep it down, will you?

65
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:03,916
Mom.

66
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,500
Where are you off to now?

67
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,166
I’m just stepping out for a bit.

68
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,250
Where to?

69
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,625
I’m taking Victor out.

70
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,666
Didn’t you say you’d only help him for one day?

71
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,166
I’m giving him a bonus day.

72
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:19,375
I’m off.

73
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,291
Don’t come home too late.

74
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,000
Got it.

75
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,750
Who is this girl with the red umbrella?

76
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,500
Yesterday, Malison was so thankful to Tontrae.

77
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,916
Thanks for helping me.
My relatives just returned from France.

78
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,916
So we did some family activities together.

79
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,666
Your relatives live in Rong Fong, not France.

80
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:24,666
What a liar.

81
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:25,458
What did you say?

82
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,958
You look radiant today, Malison.

83
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,000
Of course I do.

84
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,708
So today, Tontrae, you don’t have to worry.

85
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:40,125
Because I, Malison, will take care of everything.

86
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:42,833
So dramatic.

87
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,250
What?

88
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,291
Nothing. Nothing at all.

89
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:47,916
Hello.

90
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:51,791
Here.

91
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,833
Hello.

92
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,333
Are you Mr.Victor, right?

93
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,208
Yes, nice to meet you.

94
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,208
That’s right. Nice to meet you.

95
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,333
So over the top.

96
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,625
My name is…Double Jasmine.

97
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,583
You can call me…

98
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,208
Just Malison.

99
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,083
Okay, nice to meet you.

100
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,875
Nice to meet you too.

101
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,916
So today, P’Victor, you don’t have to worry Don't worry.

102
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,708
Because this Malison right here…

103
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,208
…will be taking care of you.

104
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:39,875
Are you okay?

105
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,333
Okay.

106
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,166
Malison thinks that…

107
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,250
Today we’re going to help protect our planet together.

108
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,666
We’ll fight global warming by riding bicycles.

109
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,541
This one’s mine.

110
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,250
And this one’s for P’Victor.

111
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:02,875
Oops.

112
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,625
I didn’t realize Tontrae would be joining us.

113
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,166
What should we do now?

114
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,875
Is this bike still working?

115
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,291
Well then…

116
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,750
Tontrae, you take this one. I’ll make the sacrifice.

117
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,125
Let P’Victor ride with me.

118
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,083
Victor rides, Malison rides along.

119
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:33,708
Okay.

120
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:35,958
I can’t ride it.

121
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,041
I don’t know.

122
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:42,791
Sorry.

123
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,333
I not really good at it. I risk.

124
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,250
Can you help me?

125
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,541
You really don’t know how to ride?

126
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,833
Yeah… that’s right.

127
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,208
Alright, fine.

128
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,500
I’m only helping because you’re handsome.

129
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,000
Back up, back up—oops, sorry!

130
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,208
Oh, oh! Thank you!

131
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,708
Was that too far back?

132
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:06,708
Okay, let’s start.

133
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,166
What fate is this?
Malison never gets to ride along like her name suggests.

134
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,958
Ended up being the one pedaling instead.

135
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,208
Ready?

136
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:14,916
Let’s go.

137
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:18,791
Okay?

138
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,416
Okay… it’s not moving.

139
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,250
One, two, three!

140
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,625
And next, I’m proud to present.

141
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,666
The City Pillar Shrine!

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,916
Right here…

143
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,916
It’s the spiritual heart of Phrae province.

144
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,583
No matter where you go, near or far…

145
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,916
You must return and pay respect here.

146
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,541
Pray for work—get work.

147
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,000
Pray for money—get money.

148
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,750
Ask for love and you’ll receive lo…

149
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:38,416
Love.

150
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,416
Let’s go make a wish!

151
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,041
Come on!

152
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:44,833
Let’s go.

153
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,500
Oh, come on! Stop staring at each other already.

154
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,416
Okay, repeat after me.

155
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,875
If you want to happy all day all time

156
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,833
Just call and do like this.

157
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:23,583
Like this…

158
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,541
When you’re about to make a wish…

159
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,000
You wish more stonger.

160
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:30,791
More handsome.

161
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,833
And when you wish you just.

162
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,125

163
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,625
“One.”

164
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,166
Two.

165
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,583
“Two.”

166
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,208
Three.

167
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,208
“Three.”

168
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,583
You’re mine now.

169
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:14,708
Let’s go.

170
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:21,833
That spot is beautiful, Victor! You should take a picture.

171
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,208
Over there! That way!

172
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:24,750
Go!

173
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,375
Oh no, my bracelet fell!

174
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:35,375
Tontrae, help me pick it up.
I’m wearing a sinh skirt—it’s hard to move.

175
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:36,666
I can’t.

176
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,625
Alright, alright. I’ll get it.

177
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,750
Thanks, Tontrae.

178
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:44,875
Ahhh!

179
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,250
Dog poop!

180
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,166
Malison’s hungry. I’m heading home first.

181
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,166
Ugh… so embarrassing!

182
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,708
Malison, you’re not taking the bracelet anymore?

183
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,708
Nope!

184
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:06,375
Serves you right.

185
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,958
It stinks of dog poop.

186
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,750
Malison, She so funny.

187
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,375
Malison, She so funny.

188
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,416
Okay, if you want to compliment Malison…

189
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,916
You just say…

190
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,375
Ee Malison.

191
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:27,541
“Ee Malison.”

192
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:28,875
That girl.

193
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,041
“That girl.”

194
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,375
Ee salid nak.

195
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,666
“Ee salid nak.”

196
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:33,916
Ee salid dok.

197
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,916
“Ee salid dok.”

198
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:35,750
That’s right.

199
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:36,625
Excellent.

200
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,583
What does it mean?

201
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,416
Just...She so beautiful and She so funny.

202
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,583
Okay, next time I I’ll try.

203
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,000
Victor.

204
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,083
Yeah?

205
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,416
ํYou like her?

206
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,916
Nope

207
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,583
Why? She so funny and so beautiful.

208
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:55,750
Hmm.

209
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,166
But I don’t like her.

210
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,750
Are you single?

211
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:02,833
Yeah.

212
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,125
I’m single.

213
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,416
Me too.

214
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:15,583
Really?

215
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,000
Actually…

216
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,458
I’m so handsome.

217
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,125
I have a lot of girls.

218
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,291
But now…

219
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,208
I’m single.

220
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:25,958
Okay.

221
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,333
I trust you

222
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,500
And do you have…

223
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,666
Do you have a type?

224
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,583
what a my type?

225
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,875
It is my type.

226
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,000
Handsome, right?

227
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,250
Good

228
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,833
You type is good.

229
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,000
I have a good eye.Right?

230
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,041
you like it?

231
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,708
Bad picture

232
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,000
– Really, it’s bad.
– You don’t like it?

233
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,041
Next time, I’ll try better. Okay?

234
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,125
- Okay.
- You trust me?

235
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:26,666
I trust you.

236
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,291
What?

237
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,000
I’m sleepy now, so… sleeping.

238
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,375
You’re going to sleep at this hour?

239
00:19:59,375 --> 00:19:59,875
Yes.

240
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:00,666
Okay.

241
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,833
Hey P’Nankrai.

242
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,333
Are you here to travel? Let’s go together!

243
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,125
Ahem.

244
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,833
Hey, P’Ton!

245
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,333
Oh! P’Ton!

246
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,708
Are you free, bro?

247
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:58,708
Yes, I’m free.

248
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,000
We’re raising money for flood relief.
Just one song, please?

Please, just a little bit.

252
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,041
Okay.

253
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:09,375
Victor.

254
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,000
Stay here. I’ll have somting to show you.

255
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,125
Okay.

256
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,958
Alright then, let’s go!

257
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,791
Come on, come on, come on!

258
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,541

Hey guys, the market’s pretty fun today, huh?

287
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,875
Hey, what’s going on over there? Wanna go check it out?

288
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:35,666
You're all having so much fun!

289
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,666
Thank you.

290
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:30,541
P’Nankrai

291
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:31,875
P’Nankrai sir.

292
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:32,916
P’Nankrai.

293
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:35,208
Huh?

294
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,208
You came too?

295
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,166
And…

296
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,083
What about Nankrai and Somo? Aren’t they coming?

297
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,250
They probably died of heartbreak.

298
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,625
Wait, what happened? Who died of heartbreak?

299
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,708
Some people just don’t know, and never will.

300
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah.

301
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,875
If you don’t know, you just don’t know.

302
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,083
Yeah, you fool.

303
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,583
Me? I’m the stupid one?

304
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,750
Hold on, Pond.

305
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,416
– Mark!
– Nice try.

306
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,875
Come on, everyone! Donate some money to help out.

307
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:09,750
Come!

308
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,666
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

309
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:16,375
Come on in! Wow—mae liang, please, right this way!

310
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,583
Come on, mae liang!

311
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:27,791
P’Nankrai.

312
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,541
P’Nankrai.

313
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:32,750
P’Nankrai.

314
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,250
I have something I want to ask.

315
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,750
Please answer me truthfully, P’Nankrai.

316
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,000
Do you love…

317
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:47,583
Do you love…

318
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,916
Love singing, right?

319
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,333
You felt left out, didn’t you? Because Tontrae

320
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,375
didn’t invite you to the karaoke, right?

321
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,333
He was really inconsiderate toward you.

322
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,458
“ฮักเมาคนงาม” is your favorite song, isn’t it?

323
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,000
You can tell me. Maybe someday…

324
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,000
I’ll bring you to perform at a big provincial event!

325
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:15,208
A grand show, with tons of people just to see you.

326
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,708
Sounds good, right? I’ll handle everything.

327
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,208
Please, pretty please?

328
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,375
I’ll make it happen. You want to sing, right?

329
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,416
I’ll take care of it all for you.

330
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,541
P’Nankrai.

331
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,166
P’Nankrai Sir.

332
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,041
I have to find out.

333
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,166
What happened to P’Nankrai?

334
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:38,125
Let’s go.

335
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,500
P’Nankrai.

336
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,041
P’Nankrai.

337
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,208
P’Nankrai.

338
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,458
Wait for me!

339
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,500
Well, since we’re here already…

340
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,666
End of the shift, let’s toast!
hy didn’t you wait for me, man?

341
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,083
Mark! Cheers!

342
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,666
Let’s have some, come on!

343
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:03,750
Oof, that burns.

344
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,875
Nice

345
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:10,791
I’m in. See ya.

346
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:11,625
Wait!

347
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,541
What’s going on with you guys?

348
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,541
Come on, cheers! Cheers!

349
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,083
You didn’t even fill mine yet.

350
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,083
Hey, Nankrai!

351
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,166
Where have you been?

352
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,458
Come, come, sit down!

353
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:28,500
Sit with us.

354
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,208
Come on, bro.

355
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,041
Here.

356
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,458
Take a new glass, take a new one.

357
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,333
You’ve worked hard today.

358
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,625
Oh wow, this is it.

359
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,416
Alright! Cheers, everyone!

360
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,750
Cheers! Cheers!

361
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,625
P’Nankrai seems stressed.

362
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:58,000
Should we play a game? Let’s play something fun.

363
00:28:59,041 --> 00:28:59,375
What game?

364
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:00,750
Spin the bottle.

365
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,458
If the bottle points at someone…

366
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,875
They have to choose—pass or accept the dare.

367
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:12,666
Alright.

368
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,125
Wanna try?

369
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,916
Will you drink… or kiss the person to your right?

370
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,541
Kiss on the cheek.

371
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:27,416
Drink.

372
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:30,875
No way, really?

373
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,375
Pour it, come on!

374
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,250
This is the good stuff.

375
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,000
You’re drinking, right?

376
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,416
It has to be that strong local liquor.

377
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,166
Bottoms up!

378
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,375
Spin again!

379
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:56,791
Look over there!

380
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,625
A foreigner? Nah, pass.

381
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,375
What is this?

382
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,625
That’s sweet bitter melon.

383
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:01,291
Mara Waan

384
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,250
“Mara Waan”

385
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,041
Mara Waan

386
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:03,541
"Mara Waan"

387
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:05,541
Broccoli.

388
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:09,583
How much per bunch?

389
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:10,625
10 baht.

390
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:12,791
It looks like a flower.

391
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:13,791
My flower?

392
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:15,833
Thank you.

393
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:16,875
“Khop khun khrap”

394
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:19,916
I think this one is really nice.

395
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,083
Okay.

396
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,208
I’ll take two.

397
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:24,916
Sure.

398
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,458
Thank you.

399
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,958
Amazing. So delicious!

400
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:34,000
Let’s go.

401
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:36,583
Cheers!

402
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,208
Cheers!

403
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,416
Do you like dancing?

404
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,541
Yes, I love watching you dance.

405
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,041
Oh.

406
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:35,375
Okay.

407
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:36,541
Victor.

408
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,333
Today, I want to say…

409
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:45,541
Thank you so much, Victor. I’m really, really happy.

410
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,166
Victor mee khwam-suk mak mak (I So Happy)

411
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,375
Thank you, TK.

412
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:50,500
Okay.

413
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,583
I’ll come pick you up tomorrow morning.

414
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,250
Really?

415
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:55,583
Yes

416
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:56,250
Okay.

417
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,250
If we don’t meet, I won’t go home.

418
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,041
“If we don’t meet, I won’t go home.”

419
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:59,166
I waiting for you.

420
00:32:59,541 --> 00:32:59,791
Okay.

421
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,125
Don’t leave and your with me.

422
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:01,708
Okay

423
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:40,541
Hey bro

424
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:42,458
If, let’s say…

425
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,958
You could travel anywhere in the world…

426
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,083
Where would you want to go?

427
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:50,333
No.

428
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:52,375
I don’t want to go anywhere.

429
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,000
Staying like this…

430
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:55,958
…it’s already good enough.

431
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,250
I just want to go out and live life…

432
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:06,500
…in the way I want.

433
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,708
You already like someone, don’t you?

434
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,125
Tell me.

435
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,333
Someday

436
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:16,708
…you’ll find out.

437
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:18,083
Just wait.

438
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,875
Whoa.

439
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,458
So this is who’s drunk here.

440
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:33,750
I thought you ran off to flirt with Somo.

441
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,791
I ran into Dan and Mark at the market.

442
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:39,000
They said you disappeared with Somo.

443
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,083
So I figured…

444
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,708
…maybe you two hooked up or something.

445
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:44,916
Huh?

446
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,125
Just teasing.

447
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,833
Whoa…

448
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:52,500
What’s wrong, bro?

449
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,208
You’re this drunk?

450
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:59,291
Did some girl break your heart or something?

451
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,791
Tell me, I’ll go take care of her for you.

452
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,958
I’ll hook left, hook right, then smack her temple!

453
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:11,083
What’s wrong?

454
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:13,500
It’s nothing.

455
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:15,791
Nothing at all.

456
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:18,583
I…

457
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,083
It’s all my fault.

458
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,291
It’s okay.

459
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,791
It’s really okay.

460
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,416
What’s wrong?

461
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,041
I’m fine.

462
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,916
Then why are you crying?

463
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,041
It’s okay, it’s okay.

464
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,416
Let’s go home.

465
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,791
Come on, let’s go home.

466
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:10,791
I’ll take you home.

467
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:20,875
Get up.

468
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,583
You left your bike over there.

469
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,083
I’ll take you there.

470
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,375
Come on, get up.

471
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:26,833
Come on, get up.

472
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,375
Wait, wait.

473
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,583
Hold on.

474
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:34,708
Just a sec.

475
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:36,791
Can you stand?

476
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:38,250
Just walk straight.

477
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:39,833
Where are we going?

478
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:41,458
Walk straight ahead.

479
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:43,333
Can you handle it?

480
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:44,166
Come.

481
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:45,916
Give me your hand.

482
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,375
Why are you so good at this?

483
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,000
Oh no, your duck’s all dirty.

484
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,041
Who pulled it?

485
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,291
Are you carrying rice?

486
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,458
Ton.

487
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,375
Tontrae.

488
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,583
Tontrae.

489
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:07,416
Tontrae, are you okay?

490
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,166
I’m okay. Are you?

491
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,375
Of course I am.

492
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,250
Oh no, oh no.

493
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:14,875
My back is breaking.

494
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,333
Go, go, go.

495
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,416
My back’s totally messed up.

496
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:32,583
Get out.

497
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,458
It stinks.

498
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,458
What did you just eat?

499
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:51,416
Don’t move too much.

500
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,583
Huh? The bed is…

501
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,666
What should I do first?

502
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:00,958
Come here. Take your shirt off first.

503
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,541
No, you’ll get vomit on the bed.

504
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,250
Take your shirt off first.

505
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,000
Take your shirt off. Raise your arms.

506
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,291
Help him raise his arms first.

507
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:23,583
Take it off first.

508
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,041
Slowly, slowly.

509
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:35,875
Lift your arms.

510
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,791
I told you not to squirm.

511
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:40,333
It hurts.

512
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,208
You raise my arms first.

513
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,583
I’ve never been this drunk before.

514
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,291
Take your pants off first.

515
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,416
Take your pants off.

516
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,000
Be more gentle, will you?

517
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,583
Lift your butt… One, two, three.

518
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,291
What kind of karma is this?

519
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,875
Your feet stink.

520
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,541
You sleep here.

521
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,291
I’ll go get a wet towel to wipe you down.

522
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,791
Cover up first.

523
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,833
I’ll get a wet towel to clean you up.

524
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,291
I feel sore all over.

525
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,125
Where did all the wet towels in this house go?
