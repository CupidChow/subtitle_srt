1
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,708
A very long journey

2
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,791
No one has ever known.

3
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,958
Is it good or really that bad?

4
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,541
Because those people had gone out.

5
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,166
No one’s ever come back to tell us.

6
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,083
They say those who have died...

7
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,583
They’ll go to heaven.

8
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,458
But deep down, I don't think it's really like that.

9
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,625
People say

10
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,291
the ones who’ve died...

11
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,208
Don’t wander into someone’s heart.

12
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,375
And they go on living in that person's memory.

13
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:42,541
Don’t travel into someone’s heart... and live on only as a memory.

14
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,333
Victor

15
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,375
When you go back.

16
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,375
plase you contact me.

17
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,125
You can go past the hotel. Do you understand?

18
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,375
Yes.

19
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,125
I promise.

20
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,291
When you go back.

21

Are you promise?

22
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,125
Every time you see  this pic

23
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,746
Please you missing me, right?

24
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,610

I promise.

26
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:06,750
My mom.

27
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,083
And my dad.

28
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,625
Fall in love

29
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:13,916

30
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:14,741
Yes

31
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,500
This so romantic

32
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,541
And i want

33
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,541

00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,416
You mean...

35
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,333
You and me

36
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,583

You too

39
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:29,125
Consider

40
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,083
- Excuse me
.- Yes?

41
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,250
Did someone leave a package here…

42
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,750
for someone named TK?

43
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,750
No, there isn't.

44
00:06:53,638 --> 00:06:55,471
– Is there a package box for me?– No, there isn’t.

45
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,013
letter?

46
00:06:56,221 --> 00:06:56,805
No, there isn’t.

47
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:57,430
Tel.?

48
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:58,513

Has anyone sent something or left a package for someone named TK?

53
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,875
No, there isn’t.

54
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,250
Are you sure? Nothing at all?

55
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,125
No, nothing.

56
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,453
Thank you.

57
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,326
A delivery has arrived.

58
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,041
Hey, excuse me.

59
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:33,583

– Did you deliver something to this hotel?– Yes, I did.

61

Not yet, sorry.

74
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,531
Excuse me, I noticed you've been waiting here all day. What are you waiting for?

75
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,365
Just... hope.

76
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,865
I'm here waiting for hope.

77
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,291
Tone.

78
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,000
Why are you sitting here all alone?

79
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,833
No lights on, and it’s pitch dark. What are you doing?

80
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,750
Let me see. What’s wrong?

81
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,875
What’s wrong? Tell me, okay?

82
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,208
Why do you look so sad?

83
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,708
Can I see your smile? Just one time.

84
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:57,958
Take a deep breath. You’ll be okay.

85
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,875
Stay strong. We have to be happy.

86
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:02,666

Let’s go, quickly!

100

Let’s ride a motorcycle together.

102
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,541
Relax, I’ve got the ride covered.

103
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,208
Okay?

104
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,833
Woohoo!

105
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:31,750
Hurry up, let’s go!

106
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:11,596
Nice weather, isn’t it?

107
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:13,971
Yes

108
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,846
No need to be sad.

109
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,971
you’re an adult now.

110
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,430
You always get them with sweets, huh?

111
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,083
No need to be sad.

112
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:42,666
Don’t be sad.

113
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,458
Show me—what’s your smile like?

114
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,041
Smile for me."

115
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:48,958
Hey, show me your smile.

116
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:49,750
Let me see your smile.

117
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,402
Smile

118
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,000
I’m sorry.

119
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,958
Tone, I’m sorry.

120
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,583
I’m sorry.

121
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,208
I’m sorry.

122
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,208
You don’t have to apologize to me.

123
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,708
You haven’t done anything wrong.

124
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,833
It’s me who needs to say sorry to you.

125
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,750
What I feel for you…

126
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,416
it really can’t go any further than this, okay?

127
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,791
Our relationship has gone beyond the boundaries.

128
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,083
We both grew up together.

129
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,916
"In my life, the one I’ve told you about.

130
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,291
Other than mom,

131
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,083
I only have you.

132
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,583
I don’t know how to act or what to feel.

133
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,583
No problem.

134
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,833
I know the answer well.

135
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,041
The answer is…

136
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,166
I...

137
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,125
have no hope.

138
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,750
It’s okay, alright?

139
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,416
Don’t feel sad.

140
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,125
Hello.

141
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,125

146
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,791
Yes

147
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,291
Kaengjod.

148
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,500
Even if I’m not here.

149
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,458
P’Nankrai will always be by your side.

150
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:45,958
P’Nankrai

151
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,250

Please take me home.

153
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,625

154
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,251
I’m going to bed now.

155
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,418
Tone

156
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,376
Good night.

I love you.

158
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:54,168
And I will love you forever.

159
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,996
If P’Nankrai can’t be by P’Tonetare’s side.

160
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:54,455
I, Kaengjod, will always be by your side, P’Tonetare

161
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:57,330
Even if I, Kaengjod, am not here."

162
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,788
P’Nankrai will always be by your side.

163
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:24,663
I forgot your shirt—the one stained with my nosebleed.

164
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:26,330
You can remamber?

165
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,288
Just keep it

166
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,421
for of memory

167
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:16,190
What is this

168
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:20,523
It’s a box. Someone left it at the hotel. It’s labeled ‘TK.’ Is it yours? Take a look.

169
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:21,911
Taiwan, China, you know.

170
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:26,418
Yes.

171
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:28,418
This is mine.

172
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,738
-– Why are you so happy, bro?
– Yeah.

173
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:43,626
Careful!

174
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,000
you overjoyed.

175
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,703
English? What’s written there?

176
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:05,126
Huh?

177
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:06,460
This is my friend’s.

178
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:26,015
Whoa, did you win the lottery?

179
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:27,920
No, it’s not.

180
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,878
My friend is from Taiwan, China.

181
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:31,753
He invited me to go on a trip over there.

182
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,733
I don’t know who it is.

183
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:37,650
How can you believe him?

184
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:40,855
You.

185
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,896
Looking at the situation, I don’t think we’re going anymore.

186
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,166
You.

187
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,913
"I’m going to head out now. You seem upset.

188
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:50,083
P’Jamnean, I’m heading home now. We’ll talk again later.

189
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:22,908
I just want to travel to Taiwan, China.

190
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:23,491
alright?

191
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:25,825
Don’t say anything.

192
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:28,158
Please, I want to go to Taiwan, China.

193
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:31,200
Because my friend already sent the money.

194
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,075
Mom, look at these addresses and postcards from each place.

195
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:35,491
Please

196
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,741
Don’t say anything more. We won’t talk about this again.

197
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,408
I’m not allowing you to go.

198
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,408
How can you go? Do you really know him well?

199
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:46,408
What if you go and he ends up deceiving you?

200
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,200
Have you known him for a long time?

201
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,241
I already know him. We’re friends.

202
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,658
He’s going to take me sightseeing. Every place is so beautiful, Mom.

203
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,366
I’ve never gotten to go anywhere, Mom. Please?

204
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:00,450
No way! I’m not letting you go!

205
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:02,033
How can you go?

206
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:04,658
You've never been anywhere before.

207
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:07,908
How will you even manage to go?

208
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,116
What if he’s lying?

209
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:10,950
Huh?

210
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:12,741
Think carefully about it.

211
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,033
Seriously, who would suddenly send money and things like that for no reason?

212
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:20,908
Mom...

213
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:24,200
Please… let me have this one, just this time.

214
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:00,001
Take it

215
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:03,751
take the money.

216
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:06,918
Don’t take his money.

217
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,166
Mom...

218
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,416
Can I live my life the way I want to?

219
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:39,626
Alright… I’ll let you.

220
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,293
I’ll let you go.

221
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:48,376
Go live your life — the one you truly want.

222
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,376
Thank you

223
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,293
Go live the life you truly want, my dear.

224
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:12,668
"Live a happy life.

225
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:19,501
Whoever you love

226
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,565
I’ll love them too.

227
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,458
Uncle, I want to visit Taiwan, China.

228
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,708
Could you teach me a bit?

229
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,583
About how to prepare for the trip.

230
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,083
To Taiwan, China?

231
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,958
– Yes.– It’s not hard.

232
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:58,000
Anyone can go. It’s pretty easy and convenient.

233
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,416
When you go, trust me—it’s super easy.

234
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,958
I’ve done business in Taiwan, China since I was young.

235
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:06,958
So first, you need to start by contacting…

236
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,000
Buy a plane ticket.

237
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:14,586
Choose your travel date carefully.
Taiwan, Chinaese people are kind.

238
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,795
When we deal with them, we must be honest.

239
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,754
Be sincere too.

240
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:22,087
And always be straightforward.

241
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:24,170
Don’t worry. It’s easy.

242
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:26,795
No need to worry — it’s totally fine.

243
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,879
Okay then. If you say it’s not scary.

244
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:30,004
I’ll go — I have to.

245
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:30,587
Let's go

246
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:33,587
Tell me if something comes up. I’ll look after it for you.

247
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,045
– Thank you.– Yes.

248
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,625
P’

249
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,583
Have you ever been to Taiwan, China?

250
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,625
Taiwan, China? That’s my place, little bro.

251
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,096
What can I say? I walk in and suddenly everyone's in love.

252
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:33,795
Gift

253
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:36,253
Clothes

254
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:38,295
Shirt

255
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,169
Where does he work?

256
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,544
It’s nothing / It’s okay.

257
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:14,169
No / Doesn’t exist

258
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,252
No?

259
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:22,877
I don’t know him/her.

260
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:33,131
I’m here traveling with my relatives.

261
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:37,595
Auntie,

262
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,137
I want to go to Taiwan, China.

263
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:40,387
Kid

264
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:42,992
– You need to get your passport first.– Okay

265
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:44,617
Walk this way.

266
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:46,784
At the intersection, turn left.

267
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,887
After turning left, go a bit and then turn right.

268
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:51,679
Turn right, then go straight. It’s just ahead.

269
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,595
It’s just a little. Not hard at all.

270
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,095
Just walk a little further this way.

271
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,762
– Is that it?
- Sure, no problem.

272
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,159
You took my stuff—give it back!

273
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,200
Give it back now—hurry!

274
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:35,943
Tomorrow

275
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:38,276
I’m flying there to visit you.

276
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,151
See you soon, Victor.

277
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:09,908
Mom

278
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:11,783
You don’t have to worry about me.

279
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:16,908
How could I not? I’m your mom. Of course I’ll worry.

280
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:19,366
I’m all grown up now.

281
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:21,501
Wait.

282
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,700
Go live the life you want—and be happy.

283
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,325
Let me know when you arrive, okay?

284
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:37,741
Thank you.

285
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:46,283
I’m heading off on my trip now.

286
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:52,991
I’m off now.

287
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,033
Let’s go.

288
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:01,658
Mom

289
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:03,491
I’m leaving now.

290
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,325
Write me a letter too, okay?

291
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,575
Okay.

292
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:46,590
You mean… you’re going to Taiwan, China?

293
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:47,215
Yes.

294
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:48,590
Do you want to come on the trip with me?

295
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:00,654
Let’s pinky promise.

296
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:01,696
"“Pinky promise.”"

297
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:02,779
Let’s go together.

298
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,613
“Let’s go together.”

299
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,015
You’ve come this far, Tontrae. You’ve done well.

300
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:37,491
Hang in there.

301
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,533
Just a bit more.

302
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,658
Almost there.

303
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:43,750
Fight on.

304
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,585
My bag, my bag!

305
00:37:11,658 --> 00:37:13,616
Where have you been? Why won’t you answer your phone?

306
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:18,138
I hope nothing happened to you.

307
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:29,708
Yes, auntie.

308
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,000
You used to live in Taiwan, China, right?

309
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,583
Do you know

310
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,375
Oh.

311
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:39,541
Oh, you haven’t?

312
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,250
Okay, I see.

313
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:42,875
Thank you so much.

314
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:48,541
Let me call uncle.

315
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:55,750
Hello, uncle?

316
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,250
Have you ever been to Taiwan, China? I can’t get in touch with Tontrae.

317
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:00,500
Yes.

318
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:04,750
No one at all?

319
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,625
That’s okay. Thank you very much.

320
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:18,958
Unless...

321
00:38:38,341 --> 00:38:40,633
I’ve been searching for the address all day.

322
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:43,550
Still haven’t found Victor’s address.

323
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:50,216
Maybe we wrote it down wrong.

324
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:55,966
Please, sacred spirits…

325
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,466
Guanyin, Goddess Tubtim,

326
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,133
Please help me find Victor’s address.

327
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,758
Please help me find Victor’s address.

328
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,425
Hello, I’m here to pick him up. I’ll take him with me.

329
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,583
Hello, I’m here to pick him up. I’ll take him with me.

330
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:34,041
– Sure. He’s all yours now.– All he does is talk on the phone during the trip.

331
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,223
So we’re not going anywhere now.

332
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:38,934
This trip was a waste.

333
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:40,922
No idea what we came for.

334
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:43,624
So boring.

335
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:44,844
Excuse me, bro.

336
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:46,407
Sorry to bother you.

337
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,699
Uh… yeah?

338
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:48,865
Are you from Northern Thailand?

339
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,074
Yes.

340
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:51,615
Bro,

341
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:53,199
Can you help me for a second?

342
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:54,907
I’m lost.

343
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,407
This is my first time in Taiwan, China.
I came to see a friend at this address.

344
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:01,124
Do you know it?

345
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:03,207
Can you teach me how to get there? I have no idea where to go.

346
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:05,999
It’s here.

347
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:07,499
Same place as our hotel.

348
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,290
Very close, same area.

349
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:14,469
If it’s close, you can come with me.

350
00:40:16,032 --> 00:40:16,782
Thank you so much.

351
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:19,115
– I’ll go with you.– Yeah, sure.

352
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,365
– Grab your bag first. Get your stuff.– Okay.

353
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:22,990
– Come on.– Yep, bring your bag.

354
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:29,915
Thank you, sacred spirits. Thank you!

355
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,092
Victor.
