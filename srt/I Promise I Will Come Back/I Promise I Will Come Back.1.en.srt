1
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,375
If it comes to waiting,

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,208
There is a legend that has been passed down in Phrae province.

3
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,333
Is an immortal love legend.

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,125
Of two people

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:32,000
He's tied up with a pledge.

6
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:42,500
Two people have said that...

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Aranyani

8
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,416
I'll wait for you here.

9
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,708
Even a hundred years, as long as a long time, still hope.

10
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:04,375
Please keep watch despite the power.

11
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:09,541
The next life is still waiting for you.

12
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,666
First encounter

13
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,583
There are many people.

14
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,166
Once told me that

15
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,416
Waiting is the most torturous thing.

16
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,750
But it's weird.

17
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,458
That everyone

18
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,791
Still watching the wait

19
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,708
Or because deep down,..

20
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,625
The results we got from the wait, it was worth it.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,166
Or on the way of waiting.

22
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,166
There is one thing.

23
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,166
That allows us to live on every day.

24
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,208
Let me call that...

25
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,375
"Hope."

26
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,125
Look at me

27
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,333
Beautiful is also beautiful.

28
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,000
The color is perfect.

29
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,000
It sells for 100 to 200 baht each.

30
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,666
Doing until the back is all stiff.

31
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,958
Look at Pat's house, Fuse.

32
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,666
His house sells paint, sells wood.

33
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,958
Rich and rich again

34
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,791
Until sending children to study in Bangkok.

35
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,500
outside the country.

36
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,833
Then what about me?

37
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,583
Must come to help mom work every day

38
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,041
You can't go anywhere.

39
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,125
You think about it!

40
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:48,583
Oops.

41
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,166
Complaining what?

42
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,000
It's because you dyed the cloth, isn't it?

43
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,500
To send you to finish school

44
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:54,666
What else will you take?

45
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,666
Hurry up and do it.

46
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,125
Will get to do other things

47
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,916
Just joking.

48
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,375
This is complaining.

49
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:05,958
What's wrong with you?

50
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,666
Huh, you see? Make a play, make a face!

51
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,250
Turn this around.

52
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:13,666
Turn again

53
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:14,875
Why would

54
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:15,666
This is it.

55
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,291
Tone the horn. Don't.

56
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,333
- What do you say?
- Don't.

57
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,583
You want another one? It's all wet.

58
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,708
Tone the horn. Don't.

59
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,958
What did you say?

60
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,458
Why are you smiling?

61
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,375
Whoa, whoa.

62
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,250
Can you use it?

63
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:23,916
I'm good at it.

64
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,375
Stay still.

65
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,166
Draw handsome

66
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,166
Take it more handsome than the real one

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,583
Similar.

68
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,958
Like being good at drawing too

69
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey.

70
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,500
Can I borrow your leg as a pillow for a moment?

71
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:01,666
Elder

72
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,541
If you assume

73
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,916
He let you choose to travel anywhere on this planet.

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,208
Where do you want to go?

75
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:13,625
No.

76
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,666
Don't want to go anywhere

77
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:18,583
Oh, no dreams with him?

78
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,875
Oh, no dreams with him?

79
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:21,916
You want to go there,

80
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,500
you want to go here, you don't have any?

81
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,791
It's good to stay here.

82
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,083
Hey.

83
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,833
If it's you

84
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,625
I want to travel around the world.

85
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,625
I want to know

86
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,291
Want to see

87
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,041
How they live in other cities.

88
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,791
Let you stay but spread.

89
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,083
I'm bored.

90
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,250
You just want to...

91
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,166
Let's go out and live.

92
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,125
In the way you want to be

93
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,041
Come on.

94
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:03,708
Close your eyes.

95
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,125
- Huh?
- Close your eyes.

96
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,208
Um,

97
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,291
Wherever you want to go, dream.

98
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,250
Is that too much?

99
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,958
You want me to close my eyes and imagine this?

100
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:26,041
I mean, I really want to go.

101
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,291
I want to go to live.

102
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,375
In the way you want to be

103
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,000
Someday.

104
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,791
I will take you to

105
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,666
Let's go together.

106
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,125
But now, close your eyes.

107
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,500
See you in your dreams

108
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,791
Not investing at all

109
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,458
What? I don't know.

110
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:34,750
Pencil?

111
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,375
I doubt it because I drew a picture just now.

112
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,333
How to draw a picture to make it messy?

113
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,541
Sorry, sir.

114
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,166
Where are you going?

115
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,333
Go to work?

116
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,750
One, two, three, four.

117
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,541
- Here, you. Four of them have been delivered.
- Yeah.

118
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

119
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,208
If sold out, tell me so I can deliver it again.

120
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,791
Rich, Heng, you. Thank you.

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,958
I'm gone

122
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,000
I already brought the swag pepper.

123
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,916
If it's over, you tell me.

124
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,083
Thank you very much.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,500
That's enough.

126
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,791
Hello, sir.

127
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,125
Take this

128
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,708
Can I taste it?

129
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,375
Yeah.

130
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:21,875
Take all of this.

131
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:26,541
Come here, come here.

132
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,916
Here we go.

133
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,416
Tae Dae

134
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,875
Who wants to eat grilled pork?

135
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,625
Who wants to eat grilled pork?

136
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,625
Follow me. Follow me.

137
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,875
Don't compete

138
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,458
Gul, you are reaching the intersection now.

139
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,875
You will turn right into the transport and take the delivery.

140
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Yes, wait a minute.

141
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,166
Yes, I

142
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,500
Uh, hi.

143
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,708
Today. I'm Jenny from Phrae province.

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,916
Today, Jenny will take a trip to transport.

145
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,375
Ouch, tell me, the atmosphere is great.

146
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,416
A lot of tourists.

147
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,208
Hu, a lot of people are very busy.

148
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,333
Ouch! Who is this?

149
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,541
What is that handsome?

150
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,708
Wow, can I shoot too? you are handsome

151
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,833
- Hi.
- Hui, hi.

152
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,708
Very handsome. Scream.

153
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,583
Hu, please let me faint.

154
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,041
Hey Gul

155
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,125
Yes, you're here?

156
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,458
I took the delivery.

157
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,458
Take it inside.

158
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,041
Uh, what is this?

159
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,083
The flowers are here.

160
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,416
So fragrant

161
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,458
Go inside, and I transferred the money to your mom in here.

162
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,333
Yes, thank you.

163
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,125
thank you.

164
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:48,916
Yes sir

165
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,791
There are oranges in the shop. Take it to your mother too.

166
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,916
Thank you

167
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,625
- Here you go.
- Yes.

168
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,458
Very, very beautiful.

169
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,583
Hello

170
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:11,833
Super handsome

171
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,875
- What do you want?
- Hello.

172
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,958
Oh, what's so handsome? It's very handsome.

173
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:19,583
Beautiful?

174
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,375
Beautiful, very suitable

175
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,250
I'll take this hat.

176
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,333
Uh, how much is it?

177
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,625
185 Baht

178
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,375
"185 baht."

179
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,125
Okay.

180
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,458
Wow, he's incredibly handsome!

181
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,833
Thank you so much

182
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:36,958
Thank you.

183
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,125
Oh, boy, where are you?

184
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,875
The change was not taken.

185
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:55,958
Oh...

186
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,250
- Hey Ton traee
- Yes.

187
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,541
Deposit money to the young father.

188
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:02,916
That person

189
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,250
Just bought a hat and he didn't take the money.

190
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,750
Yes.

191
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,291
Give it to him. Stay over there.

You like it?

245
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,458
Do it yourself?

00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,041
Why are you so good? Who's got a wife is so lucky.

00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,958
This is too talking.

249
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,041
You can try

250
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,416
Hey NanKrai

251
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,375
It's definitely delicious.

252
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,541
Really delicious.

253
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:03,500
It's great, like the love of the two of us.

254
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,875
But you are doing this good

255
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,791
Isn't there a reward?

256
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,583
- Some O!
- Oh.

257
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,666
That's enough. The messy labs are porridge.

258
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,250
That's great.

259
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,625
It's great. Look.

260
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,333
Nan Krai is definitely finished today.

261
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,958
Wait, where's the Ma khwaen?

262
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,250
Mark, don't buy it for me anymore.

263
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:40,041
Dream, can I bother you for a second?

264
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,958
Can you buy Ma khwaen?

265
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,083
I always

266
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,208

267
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,541
Thank you

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,041
Start now.

269
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,458
You'll fall for me!

270
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:55,916

271
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,250
Today!

272
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,000
Our lives are really tough.

273
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,916
My head wobbles until my neck is stiff.

274
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,833
Can't you see? The road's bad.

275
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,166
Be careful of the uneven ground.

276
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,166
Slowly.

277
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:21,750
My neck

278
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,916
My condition is like going to war.

279
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,791
I came to see a man.

280
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,416
Really my difficult

281
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:42,333
Hold it.

282
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,583
Oh, my legs are short.

283
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,041
Let's go.

284
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,333
No.

285
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,500
Go eat together.

286
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,583
Not going.

287
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,125
Why?

288
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,958
Let's eat cow labs together. Don't you like it?

289
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,458
I don't like men

290
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,000
Depends

291
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,500
This is it.

00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,125
How do I look?

293
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,333
It's pretty

294
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:18,958
It's not.

295
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,750
Look carefully.

296
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,208
How are you?

297
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,083
Your face and back are the same.

298
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,625
I prepared

299
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,166

Not going, okay?

306
00:23:59,083 --> 00:23:59,416
No.

307
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,791
Wait a minute.

308
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,416

00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,166
Sore throat

00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,208
Oh...He's worried.

384
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,166
Eat raw

385
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,916
Who could they be worried about?

386
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,458
Hey NanKrai

387
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,625
your Beef larb

388
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:50,416
- Huh?
- Ripe donkey.

389
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,083
Don't you eat?

390
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,000
Roasted here

391
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,291
Ahem, yeah.

392
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,208
NanKrai,Beef larb

393
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,666
Eat freshly boiled too.

394
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,333
Eat a lot of spicy. It will hurt your stomach.

395
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:17,750
Yes.

396
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,250
Nobody eats. I can eat. Come on.

397
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:25,833
Take all this

398
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:26,750
- I'll eat for you.
- I'll eat for you.

399
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,666
- I eat first.
- I eat first.

400
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,250
- I eat.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

401
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:33,833
I hid.

402
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,041
Want to eat, don't tell

403
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:38,166
Where is my spoon?

404
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,750
I made a donkey for Nankai.

405
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,416
Can not eat

406
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:42,666
Eat it.

407
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,166
Thank you.

408
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,541
What about rice? Bring sticky rice in.

409
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,083
Very good.

410
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,250
Grapefruit, you want to taste what it's like.

411
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,125
- I tried, too.
- Is it delicious?

412
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,250
Eat your veggies!

413
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:21,625
Hey, this is delicious.

414
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:24,500
Hey, this is awesome.

415
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:25,875
Must eat

416
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,500
The next round will be cooked.

417
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,625
Don't talk too much. Eat this.

418
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,000
Ugh

419
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,750
We shared the meal.

420
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,541
But when it comes to washing dishes,
suddenly no one wants to do it!

421
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,666
These crazy bastards.

422
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,416
Come on. I'll help you.

423
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:11,750
It's okay. You go. You've been working hard all day.

424
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,958
I can wash the dishes by myself.

425
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,875
It's okay. We'll be done soon.

426
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:21,833
Hey you

427
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:23,500
Huh?

428
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,416
I have something to ask.

429
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:32,000
I think...How's SomeO?

430
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,083
No, answer.

431
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,291
I think he suits you well.

432
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,458
Lovely, nice.

433
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,958
Also made with delicious food.

434
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,583
NanKrai my brother.

435
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:52,416
Isn't the heart wavering?

436
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,375
Do you like her?

437
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,708
No.

438
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:01,583
Don't like

439
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,250
you don't like SomeO.

440
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,250
So that shows...

441
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,916
You already have someone you like.

442
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,500
Han sure, right?

443
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,416
Do you already have someone you like?

444
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,250
No, answer, no, answer.

445
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,708
Will you wash your dishes or wash your face?

446
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:33,833
I'm sorry.

447
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,083
I want to know.

448
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,458
NanKrai

449
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,666
Show that you already have someone you like, right?

450
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,416
There it is.

451
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,333
I think I have sure.

452
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,500
If you guess

453
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,291
Guk, Koi

454
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:54,875
Chicken, Kae.

455
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:57,041
Or will it be?..

456
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,916
Jack, Jum's brother.

457
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,166
Kwan, Kham, Ban Chong

458
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:05,916
Aunt Light

459
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,416
Or will be Kae, Aunt Toi's child

460
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,000
There must be one person.

461
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:14,916
Do you have

462
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,583
Who do you like? I told you.

463
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,916
What are you going to know now?

464
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,416
Oh, it's you.

465
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,166
I don't have a secret with you.

466
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,125
That's elder...

467
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,583
I didn't really tell you.

468
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,916
What are you telling me?

469
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:34,000
I want to know who you like.

470
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,083
Yeah, yeah, I told you.

471
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,250
Who do you like?

472
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,083
Someday...You will know by yourself.

473
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,541
Wait.

474
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,583
- Hurry up.
- Wait. When is it?

475
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,833
Nankai, tell me who you like.

476
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:51,958
Who do you like? I told you!

477
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:53,625
Hurry up and wash.

478
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:56,791
I said how to help each other.

479
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,125
Yeah, I can't tell you.

480
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,416
Can be traced

481
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,208
There must be someone that Nankai secretly loves.

482
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,708
It's not beyond my ability.

483
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,041
Now it's your time with him.

484
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:57,625
Age of tuberculosis, Sukang, Phalang

485
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,083
Amen.

486
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:14,333
Mom.

487
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,125
What?

488
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,166
What's up?

489
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:21,875
Mom.

490
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:26,875
I don't think I had a good dream last night.

491
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,875
I dreamt I was going somewhere. It was like a cave.

492
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,416
And I met a woman, Mom.

493
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:34,625
He told me...

494
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,541
"It's time..."Something I can't remember.

495
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:41,000
And then...I met a man walking in.

496
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:44,833
I tried to dim my eyes, focus.

497
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,750
I can't see who he is.

498
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:50,291
Eat a lot, so think a lot, keep dreaming

499
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:51,458
It's nothing.

500
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,250
Here. Take the water to the gravel under the tree.

501
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,000
It's nothing. Take it. Take it.

502
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,083
Here, hold on.

503
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:57,708
Gravel under the tree.

504
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:58,458
Yes.

505
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,625
Think too much. Go and take the water to the gravel.

506
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,041
Go

507
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:01,541
Yes.

508
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:15,250
Amen.

509
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,083
Itang Meñatinang, Hatu, Sukita, Noon Tui, Yatayo

510
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:23,458
I dedicate this merit to the angels.

511
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:25,500
Late ancestors.

512
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,708
All the sacred things that preserve and protect me.

513
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:30,250
Amen.

514
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,875
May the person you met in your dream

515
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,250
If he and I have a relationship with each other

516
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,208
Please meet

517
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:48,291
Hey.

518
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:49,916
Where are you going today?

519
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,541
I'm not going anywhere.

520
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,416
Whether to go to the waterfall with friends at the wood shed

521
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:56,458
Go together?

522
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:57,708
Let me go ask mom first.

523
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,791
If you go, go to see me in the wood shed.

524
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:01,375
Yes.

525
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,000
Go wait

526
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:02,625
Yes.

527
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,750
Ton, are you there?

528
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,125
Yes.

529
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:20,000
Erm, good. See you too, the better. There is a disturbance.

530
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,041
You're home?

531
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:21,458
Yes.

532
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:22,250
Let's go.

533
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,083
Let's quickly stop by your mom's place.

534
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:33,375
Hey, brother.

535
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,375
I'm tired because
I've been running around asking so many people.

536
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,375
Running to ask anyone who is busy again

537
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,083
Therefore have a disturbing matter for a moment

538
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:39,958
About what?

539
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,416
It really bothers the young man.

540
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:43,333
What is this?

541
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,708
China Taiwanese people, he is a tourist and then a photographer.

542
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:47,916
The Prime Minister.

543
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,083
He said

544
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,833
"Mae, take him for a picture."

545
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,416
"Go take a picture of the lifestyle and the wooden house for the king."

546
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,083
Oh, die, die, die.

547
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,791
I hope you won't ask me again.

548
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,500
Talk to him, know about where?

549
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,375
Well...Go find someone else.

550
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,041
He also has to help with my work.

551
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,250
Oh, you.

552
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,166
Go find someone else. Ask someone's house. Whoever he says is busy.

553
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:09,500
See?

554
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,041
Please, please.

555
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,500
Think of helping the province spread us now.

556
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,333
The city is very popular.

557
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,833
It's good for the king. It's good for old architectural houses.

558
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,083
Then what to do

559
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:25,500
How can you say "this"? Crazy. Can't you please?

560
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:26,833
Please

561
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:30,958
Can go help him

562
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:33,083
You will also practice English.

563
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:35,708
Yes sir.

564
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,833
Ah, It's allowed.

565
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,291
- Ton can do.
- Beautiful and beautiful.

566
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,875
I know, you don't need to butter me up.

567
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,250
I Don't know who to rely on anymore

568
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,583
Just because it's you.

569
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,291
So I went to help you.

570
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,375
Uh.....What time do I have to go?

571
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:53,875
10: 00. He's at the royal guard.

572
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,708
- Yes.
- Try to see him. His name is

573
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,875
"Victor."

574
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,250
"Victor."

575
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:58,708
Umm

576
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:00,208
Okay, sir.

577
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,708
Then you'll go to the shower and change mine clothes.

578
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:03,125
Yeah.

Let him practice English.

581
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:11,250
Well, that's good, too.

582
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,041
He will practice English too.

583
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,958
Why is it so coincidental?

584
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:28,750
