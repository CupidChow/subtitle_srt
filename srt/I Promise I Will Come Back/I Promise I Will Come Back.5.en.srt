1
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,000
When we get close to someone,

2
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,333
A chance to touch his hand.

3
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
or even just a part of their body,

4
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,766
our heart starts to beat out of rhythm—

5
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,466
even if we didn’t mean for it to happen.

6
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,833
Just by meeting their gaze, looking at their face,
being near them…

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,933
it’s enough to fill our heart with warmth and joy.

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,766
Is this what they call… my heart

9
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:11,833
starting to tremble?

10
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:23,466
Day 4

11
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,233
I love you

12
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,600
I appreciate it.

13
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,433
Have been together since small until grown up

14
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,766
Are you confessing to love this younger person?

15
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,100
Wait a minute.

16
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:45,833
What is this?

17
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:48,366
Did you drink?

18
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:51,466
Or sick

19
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:56,700
Elder

20
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,866
I love you too.

21
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,300
I love you so much

22
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,233
In this life of you

23
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,000
Besides mom,

24
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,633
You only have elder.

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,200
My dearest, most loving brother.

26
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,866
I'm so happy.

27
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:39,933
I’m going now.

28
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,866
I need to help them pack.

29
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,233
Don’t drink too much, okay?
If you do, no one’s going to bring you home.

30
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,433
You’ll end up so drunk, you won’t know which way is up.

31
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,566
Enough. Don't drink too much.

32
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:01,566
Someday

33
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:03,466
Someday...

34
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,600
Even if one percent

35
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,066
You will wait.

36
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,566
I get it.

37
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:24,966
I understand you, Somo.

38
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,033
Mark’s not here?

39
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
Guess not. Let’s go.

40
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,466
I'm crying. Don't you think I'm asking?

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,933
What’s wrong with me?

42
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,600
You should ask him, right?

43
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,000
Then try asking—one, two, three.

44
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,500
What's wrong with you? Who made you cry?

45
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:33,966
- You're done.
- Oh, okay.

46
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,033
Listen to me first

47
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:44,233
I'm heartbroken

48
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,633
P’NanKrai rejected my love.

49
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:54,433
Very ordinary

50
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:06,966
Pond!

51
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,400
you know the shaman, right?

52
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,000
Can you take me to see the shaman?

53
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,633
- You’re really going to the shaman?
- Yeah.

54
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:17,900
Right?

55
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,166
- No, no, no.
- Help her.

56
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:24,066
I think we can do it.

57
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:29,100
Let’s go. This time, this is the way—it has to work.

58
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,733
Hello, Uncle Maan Noi.

59
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,400
Victor. My name is Victor.

60
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,333
- Victor.
- Yes.

61
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,666
May I take him to the room where I drew?

62
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,266
– Welcome to Phrae Art Center.
- Thank you, sir.

63
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,100
Make yourself at home. Feel free.

64
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,166
You look happy, dear.

65
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,000
That’s good. Life is short, after all.

66
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,933
Want to do anything, do

67
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,366
Love whoever you want to love.

68
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,433
No, Uncle. Please don’t misunderstand me.

69
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,833
That person. He's my friend from Taiwan, China. I brought him on a trip.

70
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm not...

71
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:25,900
Not what?

72
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,666
I'm not...

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,066
Come on, sit here.

74
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,133
Sit and have a talk with me.

75
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,500
In life, moments of happiness are so short.

76
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,166
Just a moment, it's all gone.

77
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:49,266
Uncle

78
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,233
What if

79
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:55,566
I am...

80
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,466
What's wrong?

81
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,366
You’re a person, of course.

82
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:02,400
What else could you be?

83
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,966
What are you asking? Say something weird.

84
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,866
What if I’m not like other people?

85
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,266
Will everyone be disappointed in me?

86
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,433
No one is disappointed in you, Ton

87
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,900
You don't have to worry. Your qualities are all ready.

88
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,933
You’re the apple of our family’s eye.

89
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,966
You’re talented in everything—even your paintings have been exhibited at the gallery.

90
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,500
It's not easy.

91
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:39,833
You’re great at photography too—everyone wants your help.

92
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:45,166
You wake up early to help your parents run the business. That’s amazing.

93
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,133
Don’t worry—everyone accepts you for who you are.

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,833
Trust me.

95
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,833
Yes.

96
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,033
And then...How many days will he stay in town?

97
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,733
He said he’ll be staying for one week.

98
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,600
One week, this is it...

99
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
Then there aren’t many days left.

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Make the most of the little time you have—be happy.

101
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,800
Your uncle has been through something like this before.

102
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,433
You know what?

103
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,433
Surprised, aren’t you?

104
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
What was his name?

105
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,166
His name is Peter. He's Filipino.

106
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,466
I met him 30 years ago.

107
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,900
He completely stole my heart.

108
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,833
You look really happy when you talk about him.

109
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,700
Yes!

110
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,266
Same goes for you, Tontare.

111
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,333
The time you have left with him now.

112
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,533
Make the most of it.

113
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:01,933
Okay?

114
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:02,866
Yes.

115
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,400
Come on. Give it back.

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,333
Go back to your friend—you’ve left him alone too long.

117
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:09,833
Yes.

118
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,400
Wait, don't tell anyone about your uncle.

119
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:16,300
Dead

120
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,333
Go see your friend now—don’t keep him waiting. Go, go!

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,866
Go see your friends.

122
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,300
This is my area.

123
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,366
Wow, you painted this place?

124
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,433
Why you so artistic?

125
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,133
I'm  artist.

126
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,900
ํToday. I'am darwing your picture.

127
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,666
- You take sit now.
- Okay.

128
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:56,966
Okay.

129
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,600
What is it, Tai Chi?

130
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,966
Not Tai Chi.

131
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,100
I imagining

132
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,133
How get you feeling?

133
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,066
Waterfall

134
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,433
Flowers

135
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,100
anything else?

136
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:18,533
Animals

137
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,000
Something else?

138
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,400
ํYes sir.

139
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:23,233
You're so funny.

140
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,266
Okay, I'm ready.

141
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:27,100
Come on.

142
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,533
How do I look, okay?

143
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:45,433
Okay.

144
00:12:59,366 --> 00:12:59,733
finish

145
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,266
Really? I want to see.

146
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,066
Don't wait there.

147
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:09,633
What?

148
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,100
quickly

149
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:20,466
Victor.

150
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,200
Tae Dae

151
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,033
Do you like it?

152
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,533
- Is this me?
- Yeah.

153
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,433
Very good. I like it.

154
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:31,766
Really?

155
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,633
Yes Yes.

156
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,266
You choose more handsome?

157
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:37,366
This one.

158
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,566
Don't. I'm kidding.

159
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:44,933
I like it.

160
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:46,966
Victor.

161
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:52,500
When you go back,

162
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,566
Can you promise me something?

163
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:58,866
Whenever you look at it...

164
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,300
This picture

165
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,866
Please, you're missing me.

166
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,900
away

167
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,933
I promise.

168
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:13,766
You promised.

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,333
I promise.

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,266
promise you have my words

171
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,933
Let’s pinky promise

172
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,933
- Seal it together.
- Seal it together.

173
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,066
But I don't have any gift for you.

174
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,066
it's okay.

175
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,433
What?

176
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,233
I've never kissed before.

177
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,233
First time?

178
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:22,700
you first time?

179
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:24,333
Really?

180
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,533
Yeah, why is it?

181
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,166
I don't believe you're that.

182
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:30,733
True

183
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,433
It really is.

184
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,833
Can I try again.

185
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,900
Can I… touch you body?

186
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:30,533
Yeah.

187
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,600
You big meal.

188
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,400
No.

189
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:45,566
Really.

190
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:46,266
Stop it.

191
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,433
- You big chest.
- No, why is it? - No.

192
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,666
And...Can i touch ?

193
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,233
– You’re such a cheeky one.
_ You so bad.

194
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:42,966
Victor.

195
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,566
You promised me.

196
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:47,466
Yes.

197
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,333
Hurry up, Aunt Nid will come get this box soon.

198
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,900
Help carry it too, don’t just stand there talking.

199
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,333
Just joking.

200
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,333
I was just joking, it’s fine.

201
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,233
Let me do it.

202
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,200
Stay still.

203
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:31,166
P’.

204
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,900
Hey NanKrai, do we handle this wood the same way as before?

205
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,100
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

206
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,633
Huh? Not burning it anymore?

207
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,933
What are you going to do with it then?

208
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:09,900
P’…

209
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,800
Do you think trees have life?

210
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:17,600
Would it be sad that we cut it down?

211
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,333
How could it feel sad?

212
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,933
It’s just part of nature.

213
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,533
Don't think too much

214
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,133
You’re right

215
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,033
it’s just nature.

216
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,966
And what about these leftover pieces?

217
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,333
What are you going to do with them?

218
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:37,966
Just throw them away.

219
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,666
Or burn them.

220
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:46,200
If I were born as one of these wood scraps,

221
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,500
I’d feel sad.

222
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:53,100
I used to be a whole tree, and people cut me down to be used.

223
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,066
Then when there’s only this much left, I
just get thrown away or burned.

224
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,400
Even though I could still be useful in so many other ways.

225
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,533
You’re so kind

226
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,500
you even feel sorry for scraps of wood.

227
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,933
What if I get abandoned too?

228
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,700
Would you feel sorry for me?

229
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,533
Then I’ll just burn you along with the wood scraps.

230
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:22,033
Now that doesn’t sound very kind. Not cute at all.

231
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:25,433
If I got thrown away, doesn’t that mean I wasn’t a good person?

232
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,466
Now, this time I’ll let you burn me.

233
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,833
But if possible,

234
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,466
do something more useful with me, okay?

235
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,166
Why is it so creepy here?

236
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,266
Is there really anyone here?

237
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,700
- Let's go back.
- No, it’s this house.

238
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,900
Let's go back.

239
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,300
I'm scared too

240
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:20,766
Then let's go back.

241
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,633
Wait! What’s the rush?

242
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:27,000
We’ve come all this way.
Come on, take me to see the shaman first.

243
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,266
- Go, go, go.
- I don't want to.

244
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,366
We’re here. The late-rising shaman’s place.

245
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,000
We’re here?

246
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,766
Is this the place? No one’s home?

247
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:49,733
It’s almost evening—someone should be up by now.

248
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:52,366
- Someone must be here.
- Hurry up.

249
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:09,633
Be careful.

250
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:10,700
Beware

251
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:18,400
Be careful.

252
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,533
So beautiful place. right?

253
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,166
Yeah, it's very beautiful.

254
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,400
I bring you here.

255
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:58,466
I want you. use...

256
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:01,766
This camera

257
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,633
You put and You keept it.

258
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,266
This memory here.

259
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,033
And

260
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,400
This Memories.

261
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:16,166
You have a camera. I have a camera.

262
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:24,700
Just put here

263
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:25,666
Yes!

264
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,733
You know?

265
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,766
This is my secret place.

266
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,666
secret place?

267
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:34,333
Yes.

268
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,133
Why?

269
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:42,466
“Tontrae” means in thai  jumping water

270
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:47,466
You mean name.  jumping the water?

271
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:48,300
Yes!

272
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:49,100
Really?

273
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:50,033
True

274
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:51,466
Oh, I didn't know that.

275
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,133
My mom and my dad.

276
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,366
fell in love.

277
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,933
When jumping water

278
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:04,433
in here?

279
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Yes!

280
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
This Romantic.

281
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,666
And I want...

282
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:13,966
Same story

283
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,633
You mean

284
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,666
You and me.

285
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,033
Fall in love, same your mom and dad in here?

286
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:23,533
Yes

287
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,566
Very, very cold, very cold.

288
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,900
Why does he really live up to the name “late-rising”?

289
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:30,533
I’ve been waiting for hours and he’s still not up.

290
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,666
- Fine, I give up.
– Wait.

291
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,366
I know

292
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,733
You’re here because of love, right?

293
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,166
Wow, he really is accurate.

294
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,566
Yes… I got my heart broken by a guy.

295
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,866
So, do you have a way to help me find true love?

296
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:07,933
You came to the right place, girl.

297
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:12,666
My place specializes in love spells.

298
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:14,400
Take it.

299
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,033
But wait.

300
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,000
I will cast a spell first.

301
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,266
Na-mo…

302
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,233
But if you’re going to use it…

303
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,466
- Yeah.
– It must come with a spell.

304
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,733
It’s strong stuff, You know

305
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:32,833
Really? What kind of spell is it?

306
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:35,800
I can only reveal it to the one
who’s going to use it.

307
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,333
You, come here.

308
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:40,766
Just say it, please.

309
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,733
It’s guaranteed to work.

310
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,000
It’s ridiculously long.

311
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,033
Take it. Take it.

312
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,166
Namo!

313
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,000
- Take it.
- Thank you.

314
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:07,233
I got it.

315
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,566
Alright, we got it now.

316
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:11,900
Aren’t you going to give me
anything in return, dear?

317
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:16,500
Money.

318
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,566
Do you accept payment via QR code?

319
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:20,800
Sure, just scan downstairs, okay?

320
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,633
Since you showed up,
I had to wake up early.

321
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:24,733
Didn’t even make a proper offering first.

322
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,800
Thank you again, Shaman.

323
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,500
We’re all set now.

324
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Let’s head back then.

325
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:33,866
Oh wait, hold on!

326
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,533
This morning, I’ll bless you with holy water for good luck.

327
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,300
Yes, please.

328
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,933
Come closer, child.

329
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,133
I’ll sprinkle holy water on you.

330
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,266
Shaman?

331
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,733
What time should.

332
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,033
I give the holy water to him?

333
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,000
Anytime is fine, dear

334
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,666
whenever it’s convenient for you.

335
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:06,233
Come on.

336
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,166
Shaman…

337
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,366
It’s really hot these days…

338
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,166
If I put the holy water on ice,

339
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,533
will it lose its power?

340
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:24,266
That bitch!

341
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,966
Nothing from my temple ever loses power.

342
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,233
Do you know who I am?

343
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,933
My power is unmatched—nothing ever fades!

344
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,000
Okay.

345
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,233
One more round

346
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,933
Shaman…

347
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,066
Let me ask you seriously…

348
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,333
Does this holy water… really work?

349
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,933
I’m afraid it won’t work.

350
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:51,733
Get out.

351
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:54,400
Go! Leave my temple!

352
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:56,966
- Go, you go. Go.
– Guys, let’s just go.

353
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,766
– But… does it really work?
- Yeah!

354
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,700
My name, my temple—get out now!

355
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:04,500
These people really wore me out.

356
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:11,233
Victor.

357
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:12,400
ํYou...

358
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:14,066
Do you drink?

359
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,100
Some times.

360
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,000
Sometimes?

361
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,833
I think every time

362
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
No every time. What about you?

363
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:23,600
No.

364
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,000
- No?
- No?

365
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,266
- You want to try?
- Yeah, I want to try.

366
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,566
Try it now

367
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:41,766
to strong

368
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:45,133
How you feel? Okay, okay, water.

369
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,200
water.

370
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,400
this water right?

371
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:52,300
Not water.

372
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:53,866
Too much already

373
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:57,633
- Mao Laew "Drunk."
- Mao Laew "Drunk."

374
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,466
