1
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,833
Has anyone ever wondered

2
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,250
why people are often afraid to express their true feelings?

3
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:49,250
Some people have a lot of feelings, but instead choose not to say a thing.

4
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:55,583
It’s not because they don’t feel it, but deep down…

5
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,875
I think they’re afraid.

6
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:03,125
Afraid of the answer they might get, or afraid that what they say

7
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,000
might cause consequences.

8
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,125
And that’s the reason

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,875
why the loudest voice in their heart

10
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:17,791
Back in silence. As if nothing had ever happened.

11
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:28,500
Day 3

12
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:38,750
See? If Mom finds out, you’re getting scolded for sure.

13
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,916
Come on, let’s wipe you down.

14
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,916
Okay. I brought you a special herbal

15
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,416
inhaler.

16
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,708
Ouch! What the heck?!

17
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,958
Serves you right. Come here, this’ll help you sober up.

18
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:08,750
Raise your arms.

19
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,625
Lift your arms.

20
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,458
Both of them.

21
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,541
There you go!

22
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,500
It’s cold.

23
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,416
Cold? Seriously?

24
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,791
It is cold.

25
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,958
You’ve become a drunk.

26
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,291
Cold…

27
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,875
Enough. Let me wipe you quickly.

28
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,083
Cover this first.

29
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,750
I’ll go get you some pants.

30
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,083
Let me go.

31
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,375
If you don't see you as a brother

32
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,208
Otherwise, I would’ve left you by the roadside.

33
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:29,250
Come on.

34
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,000
Let’s change your pants first, bro.

35
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,125
Take off your pants first.

36
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,208
Lift up.

37
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,250
Sis...

38
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,208
Let go of me.

39
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,458
Sis!

40
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,416
I’ll give you one last chance.

41
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,875
To tell me P’NanKrai…

42
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,375
Who did he fall in love with?

43
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,833
Tell me!

44
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,208
I don’t know.

45
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,125
Tell me now!

46
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,083
I said I don’t know!

47
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,375
Let me go.

48
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,083
I don't know

49
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,041
Let me go! Why did you bring me here?!

50
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,125
How could you not know!? You work with him every day!

51
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,291
There has to be someone… that he’s in love with.

52
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,500
I said I don’t know!

53
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,416
Are you going to help your older sister or help someone else?

54
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,125
Help anyone, just not your sorry ass.

55
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,666
Watch your mouth.

56
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:29,625
Wait

57
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,208
You’re gonna get it from me.

58
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,291
Just wait and see!

59
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,250
No, not the balloon—hey!!

60
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,833
No!!

61
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,208
Hey… are you insane?!

62
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,625
You didn’t answer me! Just answer me first!

63
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,083
Who is P’Nankrai in love with?!

64
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,666
I don’t know, I don’t know!

65
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,791
You must know!

66
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,791
I said I don’t know!

67
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:54,875
You really don’t?

68
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,666
I don’t know!

69
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,166
Would you know

70
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,250
Do you want to know?

71
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,000
-  Do you or do you not want to know?!
- No.

72
00:08:59,083 --> 00:08:59,625
No!

73
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,375
You better know it now.

74
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,416
I don't know

75
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,750
Somo!

76
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,916
Why are you talking so hard?

77
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:05,791
- Give me your leg.
- What are you doing?

78
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:06,333
That's enough.

79
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:06,583
Stop it!

80
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,166
- You have to tell me.
- Tell me what?

81
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:07,958
Are you going to say it or not?!

82
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,833
Somo!, have you gone mad?!

83
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,375
Your consciousness is gone?

84
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,000
- Are you going to say it or not?!
- I don't know.

85
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:16,791
Tell me

86
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,000
Tell me now

87
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,250
Answer me.

88
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,041
Alright, alright! I give up!

89
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,041
Tell me!

90
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,791
But… you have to ask P’Dan too.

91
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,250
P’Dan said…

92
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:32,791
P’NanKrai…

93
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,166
He's in love with one.

94
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,708
And he’s been in love since they were kids.

95
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,625
Since they were little.

96
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,291
Maybe...

97
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,541
Maybe it's me.

98
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,625
I think it's not you

99
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,000
You don't have to come to Short Feel.

100
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,875
People say guys are usually stubborn.

101
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,833
Pretend to be uninterested

102
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,375
Maybe they’re just shy or conflicted inside.

103
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,125
Ouch!

104
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,750
He is so adorable. Let’s go see P’NanKrai!

105
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,916
P’NanKrai~ P’NanKrai~

106
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:11,416
Sister!

107
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,291
Let me go first!

108
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,125
Are you crazy or possessed or what?!

109
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,750
Before you fawn over NanKrai,
care about me first! I’m stuck here!

110
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:19,833
Ughhh…

111
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,208
What kind of karma is this…

112
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:27,875
Somo!

113
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,541
Are you crazy?

114
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,500
Somo!

115
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,458
I’m telling Mom!

116
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,250
Don't worry about it.

117
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,916
Don't worry about it.

118
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,083
What is this?

119
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,000
Tae Dae

120
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,708
Sticky rice

121
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,458
Sticky rice?

122
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,208
Yes

123
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,208
First time I tried...This.

124
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,375
This is this first time for you?

125
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,291
Come on.

126
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,333
Okay.

127
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:22,625
Look at this.

128
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,166
Wow.

129
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,333
Is this a rice ball? Okay.

130
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,541
And

131
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:33,750
Dip

132
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,541
What? What's this?

133
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,791
Jackfruit, you know?

134
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,708
"Jackfruit."

135
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,375
Tam-Khanun (Jackfruit salad).

136
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,541
"Tam Khanun."

137
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,000
Tam Khanun.

138
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,125
Tam–pa–noon?

139
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,125
No

140
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:47,791
“Tam” (means pound or mash).

141
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:48,458
“Tam.”

142
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,333
Kha.”

143
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:49,958
“Kha.”

144
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:50,791
Noon.

145
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:51,541
“Noon.”

146
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,041
Yes

147
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,666
“Tam Khanun.”

148
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,541
Tam Khanun.

149
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,291
Tam Khanun.

150
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,166
So just like this?

151
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,625
Yes!

152
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,833
- A-roi mai? (Is it delicious?)
- Very delicious.

153
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,666
-a  little bit
- A little.

154
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:16,833
Hm.

155
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:17,458
Really?

156
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:18,666
Delicious

157
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,875
And I recommend for you.

158
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,250
What do they call "Kaeng Kradang" in English again?

159
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,250
looks like curry

160
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:29,875
Curry?

161
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:30,750
Frozen

162
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,583
Kaeng Kradang.

163
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:34,666
Kaeng Kradang.

164
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,375
“Kaeng Kradang.”

165
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:35,875
Yes

166
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:36,666
Kaeng Kradang.

167
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,500
Okay, I wanna try.

168
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,208
Try

169
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,208
I look like a fool.

170
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,000
No no. not stupid.

171
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,708
Relly?

172
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,541
Good

173
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,791
I’m so sorry.

174
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,125
Is it tasty?

175
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,333
Very, very delicious.

176
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,708
-  Jing ror? (Really?)
- Yes

177
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,583
You trying to imitate me? "Jing ror?"

178
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,416
Jing ror?

179
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,375
Good

180
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,541
And finally,

181
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,958
I have special menu.

182
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,375
Foryou

183
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,166
Jing ror? (Really?)

184
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,125
Only you

185
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,291
Special menu.

186
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:22,875
Yes

187
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,500
Tae Dae

188
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,416
Oh! Let’s forget me out. Take away!

189
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,541
I can't eat it.

190
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,166
No no no

191
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,250
You see, pit pooty!

192
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,291

00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:49,208
I’m Victor. Nice to meet you.

347

It’s fine, dear. Take him around the fair.

348

Then I’ll trouble you a bit today.

349
00:25:59,125 --> 00:25:59,666
No problem, dear.

350
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,291

I knew you’d say that, P’Somo.

355
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,750
Today, you’re the prettiest one at the whole
Khum Chao Luang event, right?

356
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,708
Exactly. Beautiful.

357
00:26:58,833 --> 00:26:59,208
Mirror

358
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:09,208
Well, I mean… I look like this every day, you know.

359
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,791
I wake up like this.

360
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:16,333
Those eyebrows are arched like a bridge right when you wake up, huh?

361
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:17,875
It’s natural.

362
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:25,500
Grab it.

363
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,166
Shh! Did you see a chicken or something?

364
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,875
What chicken?!
That’s P’Nankrai! Didn’t you see him?!

365
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:32,083
Stop.

366
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:34,083
Let’s go.

367
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:45,958
Where are you rushing off to?

368
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,000
Compliment me already!

369
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,041

00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,458
So fair-skinned too.

00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,750
So pretty, so pretty, sooo pretty!

373
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,125
You are already beautiful

374
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:07,791
Well… I just wake up looking like this.

375
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Just a little touch-up and then…

376
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,833
Exactly like this.

377
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:18,041
This clear fair skin? I was born with it.

378
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:24,375
No injections, no supplements
my skin’s been glowing since I was a kid.

379
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:26,791
Come on, keep the compliments coming!

380
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
Naturally beautiful.

381
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:31,750
Soft and gentle.

382
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:33,666
Absolutely radiant.

383
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,583
You’re seriously stunning, P’Somo.

384
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,541
Hey P’Nankrai~

385
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,333
P’Nankrai sir

386
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,541
P’Nankrai~

387
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,333
Um… today…

388
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,250
I’ll be performing a traditional dance, and I just…

389
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:14,625
Can I get a little support from you, P’Nankrai?

390
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,458
Hmm… I’m cheering you on.

391
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,291
Thank you so much.

392
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,166
Looking good! Gorgeous, gorgeous!

393
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:33,458
You’re all set.

394
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,791
Well, there’s only one person in the audience
that matters anyway.

395
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,291
That's right.

396
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:41,583
He deserves you

397
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,125
Fighting!

398
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,458
Hope you mess up,
forget your moves, and trip on your skirt.

399
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Mark, you jerk! I’m telling Mom!

400
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:00,458
I already told her yesterday.

401
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,958
You’re the worst! You little brat!

402
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:04,333
Ugh, now I’m mad.

403
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:05,458
P’Nankrai’s being too much.

404
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,666
Can’t he just say a bit more?

405
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,291
I’m sorry.

406
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:32,875
P’Nankrai.

407
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,250
Dear Nankrai.

408
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,958
The things you keep inside…

409
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,916
If you don’t tell me, how would I know?

410
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,291
But if you say it, there’s a 50-50 chance.

411
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:47,625
Not trying?

412
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:52,583
But if you don’t say it now,
he’ll end up with someone else.

413
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,833
I still don’t have the courage to tell him.

414
00:33:59,083 --> 00:33:59,916
Why not?

415
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,750
He’s not going to wait forever.

416
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,125
Yeah.

417
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:13,666
That’s more like it.

418
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,833
Really? So if I like someone,
I should just tell them?

419
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,083
Then I’ll say it now.

420
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,375
- I like it.
- I like it.

421
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,625
So both of you like the dancer, huh?

422
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:26,875
It's not.

423
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:27,541
You like the dancer, huh?

424
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,666
Hey, I haven’t said where I’m going yet.
Let me say it first.

425
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:37,208
Come quickly.

426
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,791
Come and help us light the lanterns. Couples, come make a wish together!

427
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,666
Family members can light
them too for good fortune.

428
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:02,791
The lanterns are sold at the front booth.

429
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,916
Buy one, light it,
and make your wish for blessings.

430
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,666
It’s a Lanna tradition.

431
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:27,458
Please let me find love.
Let that idiot finally realize how I feel.

432
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:35,416
And I wish that he’ll love me the way I love him.

433
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:43,416
Then… may both of you get your wish.

434
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:52,958
Tone

435
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,166
Wanna light a candle with me?

436
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:57,791
Yes sir

437
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:04,250
P’Nankrai,
let’s go light the candle over there together~

438
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,166
Les go, come with me.

439
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,333
It’s okay, you can light it with P’Somo.

440
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,250
I’ll go light it with my Taiwan,Chinese friend.

441
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:14,958
Victor, come here.

442
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:19,708
Okay.

443
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,458
Take care. Take care.

444
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,125
Slow. Slow. Slow.

445
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:28,125
Okay.

446
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,875
Protex it, don’t let the flame go out.

447
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:32,833
Okay.

448
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:39,666
Okay.

449
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,166
I’d like to make a wish.

450
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,083
May my life from this moment on…

451
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,208
be bright and full of warmth like this flame.

452
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,333
And I wish that the one I love…

453
00:36:57,625 --> 00:37:02,750
May you be happy,
whether you’re awake, asleep, or dreaming.

454
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,750
I wish for him to be happy, always.

455
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,791
I wish for you happy all the time.

456
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,166
Okay, my turn.

457
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:24,416
May TK always smile brightly like this,
just like when we’re together.

458
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,500
Wishing you happiness and good health.

459
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,916
And may you always remember our precious moments together.

460
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,041
Amen.

461
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,166
Amen!

462
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,416
P’Nankrai, maybe focus over here instead~

463
00:37:58,541 --> 00:37:59,708
Come light a candle with me.

464
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,041
Come on.

465
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,125
Let’s light it together.

466
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,458
I’ll make a wish.

467
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,583
May our love shine brightly…

468
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,041
Just like this candle we’re lighting.

469
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:24,500
The wind’s too strong—I’ll relight it.

470
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,416
Somo…

471
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,791
There’s something I want to tell you…

472
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,208
I’ll go relight it.

473
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,041
Somo!

474
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,583
I really can’t see you as more than a sister.

475
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:40,708
I can’t love you that way.

476
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:49,833
It’s Tontrae, isn’t it?

477
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,916
The one in your heart…

478
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,041
is Tontrae, right?

479
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,208
I’m not stupid, you know.

480
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:09,166
I just said it…

481
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,041
I really tried my best.

482
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,000
But P’Nankrai, you never really cared about me.

483
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,791
We grew up together.

484
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,541
Wasn’t there even a tiny possibility?

485
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,166
All I asked for was just one percent…

486
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:37,750
Just one percent that you might love me.
Can’t I have even that?

487
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,041
T-Today, I’m just too tired.

488
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:09,500
I need to rest.

489
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,791
Repeat after me—the slogan of Phrae province.

490
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,208
Maw Hom Mai Sak.
(Indigo dyed cotton and teakwood.)

491
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,583
“Maw Hom Mai Sak”

492
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:31,875
Thin Rak Phra Lor.
(Land of the love legend of Phra Lor.)

493
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:32,833
"Thin Rak Phra Lor."

494
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,416
Phra That Cho Hae Sri Mueang.
(Phra That Cho Hae, the sacred heart of the city.)

495
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,166
"Phra That Cho Hae Sri Mueang"

496
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,000
Lue Leuang Phae Mueang Phi
(Famed for Phae Mueang Phi’s eerie beauty.)

497
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,416
"Lue Leuang Phae Mueang Phi"

498
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,000
Kon Phrae Nee Jai Ngam
(The people of Phrae are kind-hearted.)

499
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,541
"Kon Phrae Nee Jai Ngam"

500
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:43,416
Good Excellent

501
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,791
- Really?
- Sure.

502
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,041
Pack it up now.

503
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,833
Tone taree

504
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:50,833
Yes?

505
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,250
Can I talk to you for a moment, Tontrae?

506
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:56,916
Sure. What is it?

507
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,791
Can we talk outside for just a sec?

508
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:07,375
Yes.

509
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:11,416
Stay here.

510
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:21,041
Come here for a moment.

511
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:27,708
Ton.

512
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,333
What is it, P’? You dragged me all the way out here.

513
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,875
I wanted to say… um…

514
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:37,625
I want to...

515
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,541
I want to say that I love

516
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,625
I love you

517
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:49,041
Wow, that’s so touching.

518
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,916
We’ve been together since we were little.

519
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,250
And now you’re confessing your love to me?

520
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:58,458
Wait a minute.

521
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:02,375
What is this?

522
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:04,875
Did you drink?

523
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,000
Or sick

524
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,166
P’NanKrai sir

525
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,375
I love you too.

526
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,833
I love you so much

527
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,750
In my whole life…

528
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:28,541
Besides mom,

529
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,125
There’s only you.

530
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:40,000
My dear, wonderful brother.

531
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,416
That warms my heart.

532
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,375
I’m going now.

533
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,375
Gotta help them pack up.

534
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:03,750
Don’t drink too much, okay?
No one’s gonna carry you home.

535
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,916
Wasted out of my mind, bro.

536
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:09,083
Enough already. Don’t drink so much.

537
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,083
Someday

538
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,000
One day…

539
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,041
Even if it’s just one percent…

540
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:26,583
I’ll still wait.

541
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,083
I understand now.

542
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:41,500
I understand you, Somo.
