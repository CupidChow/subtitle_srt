00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,250
It might be true, what they say

2
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,041
There is no coincidence on this planet.

3
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,416
that in this world,Everything is already predestined.

4
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,041
Have you ever believed in destiny?

00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,250

00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,166
The person they're with

00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,583
The people they paired. In ancient times, they said

9
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:17,583
One way or another, it's like a thin yarn.

00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,375

If you find it, pontoons, pontoons.

00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,250
What does that mean?

45
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,000
Nothing.

46
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,458
Can you speak Thai?

47
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,083
I can speak Thai a little

48
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,375

00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,500
It's not that word.

70
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,708
It’s “Trae.”

71
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,208
So how do you pronounce it? Like “dae”?

72
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,458
It's not.

73
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:51,625

74
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,375

75
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,833
That word means…

00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:03,750

93
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,791
Yeah, it’s TK. Let’s move on.

94
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,583

That's right.

173
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,583
You said we’d go after work, right?

What else?

194
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:58,708
Just not hungry.

195
00:13:59,541 --> 00:13:59,875
Really?

196
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:00,666
Yeah

197
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,583
Or are you waiting for someone?

198
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,000
Hmm… who could I be waiting for?

199
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not done yet. Let's go.

200
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:06,791
Go ahead.

201
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,541
So you are waiting for someone.

202
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:09,875
I know.

203
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,208
Victor.

204
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,666
Are you hot?

205
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,708
Pink House

206
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,625
Pink

207
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,208
In Mandarin, we say "Fēng Hóngsè."

208
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,583
“Fěn hóng sè.”

209
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,250
This place is so beautiful, right?

210
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,291
Yes!

211
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,375
Do you like it?

212
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,583
Yes, it's so romantic.

213
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:44,541
Pink House

214
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,458
Yes, a pink house.

215
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,500
It looks really romantic.

216
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,250
Very much.

217
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,708
What  your color like…?

218
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,833
What like your color?

219
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,083
My favorite color?

220
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:55,541
Yeah

221
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:57,833
I think it’s red.

222
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:58,833
Red?

223
00:15:59,458 --> 00:15:59,833
And you.

224
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:00,583
Pink

225
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,375
Yes, I like pink.

226
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,708
Victor, I want to know when you were in Taiwan

227
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:07,791
What do you job?

228
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,083
I'm a photographer.

229
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,666
I like to travel the whole world

230
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,416
and I want to do my picture.

231
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,083
I can find myself and find my real, real soul.

232
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,125
Okay.

233
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,500
I want to talk with you.

234
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,791
I want to practice my English language .

235
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,833
Me, too.

236
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:26,666
Okay.

237
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,041
Then let’s keep going.

238
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,208
Yeah, let’s move on.

239
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:30,791
Yes.

240
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,875
Okay, let's go.

241
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,250
Dance with me?

242
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,500
My pleasure.

243
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,916
Oh, beautiful.

244
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,375
No, not that.

245
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,750
No, not that.

246
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,250
No? Oh… okay.

247
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,166
Try again

248
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,333
No, not that.

249
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,166
No, not that.

250
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,041

251
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:45,750
OK

252
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,166
OK

253
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:54,708
Close your eyes.

254
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,375
Close your eyes.

255
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,291

256
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,375
Okay

257
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,541
What?

258
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,416
Victor.

259
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,416
Do you believe in ghosts?

260
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,708
No.

261
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,291
I’m not afraid of ghosts at all.

262
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,583
Really?

263
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,875
You know what?

264
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,208
Every old place has ghosts, you know.

265
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,166
There are ghosts

266
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,291
Really?

267
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,416
Sorry, I realized Thai boxing

268
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,750
Are you okay?

269
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,583
Okay.

270
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,125
I'm okay.

271
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,041
Please...Sorry, really.

272
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,250
I'm so sorry.

273
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,250
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,291
You’re okay, right?

275
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,291
Okay

276
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,041
OKay What can I do for you?

277
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,375
Are you okay, TK?

278
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,166
Are you okay? Are you?

279
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,291
Okay.

280
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:26,833
I'm okay.

281
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:27,833
Okay, okay.

282
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:28,958
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,625
That's enough. I'm okay.

284
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,375
Okay, sit down. You sit down.

285
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,416
You wnat a more

286
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,458
No.

287
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,500
Damn, my whole body hurts.

288
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,666
How is it?

289
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,125
So delicious.

290
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,041
How to  say? "I'm so stupid" in Thai.

291
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,458
when you want to say "stupid" in Thai,

292
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,583
in Thai, we say “ngô.”

293
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:25,458
Ngo

294
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,333
But in Northern Thai,

295
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:28,708
It’s “ngâo.”

296
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:29,916
Ngâo.

297
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:30,750
Yes

298
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,333
For example,

299
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,041
Victor Jad Ngao (Victor is so stupid.)

300
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,208
"Victor Jad Ngao"

301
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,208
Yes!

302
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,416
Right?

303
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,958
Yes!

304
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:40,583
Ngâo.

305
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:40,958
Ngâo.

306
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:41,625
Ngâo.

307
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,250
You Ngâo.

308
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,208
Phom Ngao

309
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,458
It's not.

310
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,625
"Ngo"

311
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,958
Ngâo.

312
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,541
Ngâo.

313
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,125
Ngâo.

314
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,458
Ngâo.

315
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,458
Ngâo.

316
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:54,458
Ngaw

317
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,750
That sounds weird, that’s not it.

318
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,583
Ngaw

319
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,916
eah, it's pretty fun too.

320
00:21:59,041 --> 00:21:59,625
Just messing with him.

321
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,541
Victor.

322
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,083
Actually,

323
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,750
when you come to Phrae,

324
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,208
You should to try.

325
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,375
local food.

326
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,458
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,875
Do you know Northern Thai food?

328
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,333
Northern cuisine.

329
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:18,541
Do you know it?

330
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:19,750
Mmm, I understand.

331
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:20,625
Really understand

332
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,333
Just a little bit.

333
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:21,875
Just a little.

334
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,000
Why aren’t you eating this?

335
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,416
I like cheese and pineapples.

336
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:33,916
But...

337
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,833
this tastes normal.

338
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,125
You don’t eat dough?

339
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:37,875
Um,

340
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,208
I have idea

341
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,125
You don’t eat dough, right?

342
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,166
Okay

343
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:48,833
What is it?

344
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,958
This is

345
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,000
Nam Prik Nam Yoi.

346
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,541
“Nam Prik Nam Yoi.”

347
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,125
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,625
Like chili?

349
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,583
Chili and garlic

350
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,250
My mother made she made.

351
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,250
Really?

352
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:03,791
Yes, really.

353
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,458
Your mom?

354
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:04,916
Yes

355
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,500
Wow, is it expensive?

356
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:07,250
It’s handmade.

357
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,083
It smells good.

358
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:12,541
smells good,

359
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,333
smells so good

360
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:13,750
Okay.

361
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,125
I want to try it now.

362
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,166
Let's use this?

363
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:20,916
I have idea.

364
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500

00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,583
No glasses—cheers with pizza!

391
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,291
Oh? Cheers with pizza then!

392
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,208
It’s so late, and still not here.

393
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,708
Dinner’s all gone.

394
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,541
Make a wai gesture

395
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,000
Wrong way, wrong—go that way.

396
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,583
A little more.

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,833
A bit lower…

398
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:47,000
I can do it. Can you?

399
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,041
Twist it more—come on!

400
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,875
Twist more—he said twist more!

401
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,583
You go in! It’s hot, yeah!

402
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:04,791
I’m hot too!

403
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,625
So exhausting, right?

404
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,958
- – Absolutely.
- It's hot.

405
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,791
It’s so hot, I could die.

406
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,958
Without me, you’d be like a disabled person.

407
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,250
What disability are you talking about?

408
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,458
Hey Somo.

409
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,625
I think at this year’s party at the Lord’s Teak Mansion…

410
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,291
You’re definitely the most beautiful.

411
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:37,833
Right?

412
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,833
That's right.

413
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:40,500
You’re exaggerating.

414
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,833
Edream Mirror

415
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,750
Wait—let me ask first.

416
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:48,791
Yes.

417
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,375
Magic Mirror on the wall

418
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,083
Tell me right now!

419
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,958
who is the fairest one of all?

420
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:02,708
It’s you, P’ Somo!

421
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,333
P’ Somo, of course.

422
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:05,916
You’re beautiful.

423
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,625
So fair-skinned, look at you!

424
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,833
And tall, too!

425
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,583
Somo you so beautiful you like

426
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,000
Beautiful  from head to toe.

427
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,000
Your skin glowing. The face is radiant.

428
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:21,500
What did you just say?

429
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,833
How would I know?

430
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,708
Of course.

431
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:33,000
The future first lady of Phrae’s biggest lumber business…

432
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,625
…must be me!

433
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,458
Hey Nankrai. This little heart of mine…

434
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,458
…is waiting for you.

435
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:52,791
Ow! E-Dream.

436
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:53,916
Noisy!

437
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,708
Somo.

438
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:01,291
I heard your font (style) is amazing
everyone’s here to see it!

439
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,291
- That's right.
- I can’t remember the move.

440
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,708
P’ Somo, could you show me your pose again?

441
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,333
I’ll watch carefully—I really can’t remember.

442
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:09,875
Dream!

443
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,291
How to ?

444
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,708
Graceful hands, gentle motion.

445
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,125
Your foot! Sweep it in like this.

446
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,583
Sweep it out. Sweep!"

447
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:21,666
Sweep it long.

448
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,750
My legs are short and my shoes are thick, Dreem!

449
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:26,666
Yeah, that's it.

450
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:27,958
Arch more, arch!

451
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:28,958
Arch!

452
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:29,875
More arching!

453
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:30,583
Arch…

454
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,291
Ann Oh

455
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,250
Ow!  Dream!

456
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,375
My back’s about to break.

457
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,000
Gotta show them though.

458
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,625
I remember.

459
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,166
It's good.

460
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:49,916
Let’s call it a day.

461
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,708
My back hasn’t been great lately.

462
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,916
So beautiful, right?

463
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:02,958
Mmm, yeah.

464
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,750
Victor, I have a question.

465
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,750
How many days will you be here?

466
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,708
Mybe just 1 week.

467
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:32,625
1 week

468
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,041
"Neung Sap-da ."

469
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,375
Shot time, right?

470
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,833
Just so fa so good

471
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,583
So far so good

472
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:42,875
Okay.

473
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,250
When you have shot time,

474
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:50,708
I wish you have a good memory here.

475
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,083
That's it.

476
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,375
Thank you

477
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,166
Victor, do you have a social media account?

478
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,166
Do you have ?

479
00:30:58,708 --> 00:30:59,500
No.

480
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:00,375
Why?

481
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,791
Because, you know,

482
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,583
I want to travel around

483
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:06,000
In order to see, touch something about it...

484
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,000
something really...

485
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,583
truly feeling

486
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,708
you know what I'm talking about.

487
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:11,541
Um,

488
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:12,250
Yeah, yeah.

489
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,666
Okay, I. Understand

490
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:20,625
You're lucky.

491
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,125
You get to travel here and there.

492
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,958
You get to see things with your own eyes.

493
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:27,916
But me…

494
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,333
I can’t go anywhere.

495
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,333
I only see things in pictures.

496
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,166
What does that mean?

497
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,291
No, it’s nothing.

498
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,333
I don’t understand.

499
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,875
No need to understand come on, let’s go take some photos.

500
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,458
That was such a great performance just now.

501
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:02,666
Just now?

502
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,375
Where did that come from?

503
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:05,083
There it is.

504
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,375
Dan, aren’t you coming to play? It’s so fun.

505
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,208
Nah, not playing. Just sitting here is hot enough.

506
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,083
You need to work out sometimes, Dan.

507
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,375
Haven’t exercised at all?

508
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:18,958
I can't.

509
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,208
I’ll drag you out to play after this round.

510
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,083
Ahem ahem!

511
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,166
Why’s this gang suddenly so energetic today?

512
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:29,791
Where’ve you been today?

513
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:30,750
Haven’t seen you around.

514
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,708
Didn’t you say you’d join us to the waterfall?

515
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,000
Sorry, bro.

516
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,375
Today whant to practice my English language.

517
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,083
I really wanted to practice English today, P’.

518
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:46,250
Well, P’ Mae told me to help welcome the tourists.

519
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,875
So I went to practice English.

520
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,375
Once you’re good, come help me out too, okay?

521
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,291
Everyone, I almost forgot.

522
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,208
Let me introduce my new friend. Please introduce yourself.

523
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,375
My name is Victor. Nice to meet you all.

524
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,250
You can speak Thai too?

525
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,416
Just a little bit.

526
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,791
Whoa.

527
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,208
I’m NanKrai.

528
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,333
Nice to meet you, bro.

529
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,166
Nice to meet you.

530
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:15,791
Hey, I’m Dan.

531
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,250
My name is Amp

532
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,125
“Amp.”

533
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,875
Hey, I’m Golf.

534
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,500
Nice to meet you guys.

535
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:24,708
Victor?

536
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:26,875
Victor.

537
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,875
Wanna play football with us?

538
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:32,250
Do you want to play football with us?

539
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,833
Yes Yes I Whant I Whant. Let’s go!

540
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,083
Just wait and see me play.

541
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:42,875
Well, you guys aren't hot.

542
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:44,875
Victor, come on.

543
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:46,916
This way.

544
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,541
You’re really not going to play with them?

545
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,333
Come on!

546
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,000
Amp

547
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,041
Get it.

548
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,583
That guy’s group over there—so fair-skinned.

549
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:11,125
they're perfect

550
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,666
totally my type.

551
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,208
You shouldn't say this. We are women, must be reserved.

552
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:23,291
And besides, don't give these stimuli

553
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,291
And don’t let these temptations trigger your hormones.

554
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,708
Our duty is to study.

555
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,958
Hmm… that’s enough.

556
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,250
Hey, can I leave my shirt with you for a bit?

557
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,333
Ahhh! (screaming in excitement)

558
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:03,208
Whatever.

559
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,208
Forget the books—let’s just look at the guys.

560
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,708
Aaaaah!

561
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,208
Aaaaah!

562
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:56,625
Same team.

563
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,166
Come on, hurry!

564
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,750
Are you okay?

565
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,333
I'm okay.

566
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,500
I’m sorry, really sorry!

567
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:30,333
OIt’s okay.kay.

568
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,458
Hold it, hold it!

569
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,166
Okay.

570
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,291
Okay.

571
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,666
alright.

572
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,291
We’ve arrived. You go rest now.

573
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,583
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

574
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,333
Today I hurt her so many times.

575
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:05,666
I'm okay.

576
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:06,791
