1
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,458
Who are you? How did you get in here?

2
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,166
Victor.

3
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:10,875
Don't touch me!

4
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:15,916
Hey.

5
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:17,875
Victor.

6
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,416
It’s me, TK.

7
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,583
Do you remember me?

8
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,625
Are you TK?

9
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,791
Water.

10
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,250
Thank you.

11
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,166
I’m really sorry.

12
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,958
I don’t know how to say this… um… I…

13
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,125
I came here.

14
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,541
I wanted to see Victor.

15
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,333
I thought you were Victor.

16
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,666
I’m not Victor. I’m Chanliang.

17
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,041
We’re twins.

18
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,750
twins?

19
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,791
Same ball type

20
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,458
Ok I'm Introduce myself

21
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,916
My name is Tontaé.

22
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,916
You can call me TK.

23
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,083
I’m your older brother.

24
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,375
Brother?

25
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,625
Yes, I’m your brother.

26
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,541
where is Victor?

27
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,166
follow me

28
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,375
Brother.

29
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,666
The person you wanted to see…

30
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,791
I’ve brought him here.

31
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,375
Where’s Victor?

32
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,500
He’s gone.

33
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,250
Gone?

34
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,833
What do you mean. I don’t understand.

35
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:53,750
He's gone?

36
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,458
What that is mean

37
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,541
You…

38
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,250
Are you Victor is dead?

39
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,333
Can you promise me.

40
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Please you missing me,Right?

41
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,083
I will

42
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,000
I promise.

43
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,541
Actually, I really don't know.

44
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,416
Perhaps... he might be traveling to another planet.

45
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,041
Or maybe he moved to another house.

46
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,625
And no one can ever really know.

47
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,583
There's only a notebook.

48
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,458
That's all that's left, his last possession.

49
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,458
That recounts his story.

50
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,750
Those words.

51
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,166
Have recorded countless stories.

52
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,833
Which Victor experienced.

53
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,791
Among them is my story.

54
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,208
Even though I'm just a mere fraction.

55
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,250
Within the depths of his memory.

56
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,541
However, at least

57
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,916
I've gained a reputation

58
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,166
that I was recorded.

59
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,166
In Victor's life.

60
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:10,833
TK

61
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,583
Where did TK go?

62
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,583
TK

63
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,583
TK

64
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:40,583
TK

65
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,000
TK

66
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,625
Are you okay?

67
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,375
It’s okay.

68
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,125
No worries

69
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,541
It’s okay.

70
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,458
Victor.

71
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,000
Let’s go.

72
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,583
Are you Okay?

73
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,333
P’NanKrai, calm down.

74
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,875
Maybe his phone ran out of battery.

75
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,875
He said he’d call when he arrived, but he never did.

76
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,416
Who knows how he’ll be, all alone like that.

77
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,708
Please calm down, P’NanKrai. Tontaé is already grown up.

78
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,375
He can take care of himself.

79
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,666
Auntie, has Tontaé contacted you at all?

80
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,166
I haven’t been able to reach him at all.

81
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,166
I’m worried about him.

82
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,708
Please help me, dear.

83
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:51,708
Okay.

84
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,041
I'll try looking around my place.

85
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,041
If someone has children, maybe we can find a lead.

86
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,250
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

87
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,041
Please find him for me.

88
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,541
Of course. I’ll let you know if I hear anything.

89
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,666
Calm down, NanKrai.

90
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,500
Give us a smile.

91
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,291
Try it.

92
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,625
Thank you.

93
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:13,750
Yummy?

94
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,625
Yummy?

95
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,291
Yummy.

96
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,250
Beef?

97
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:21,875
Beef.

98
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,375
Sorry

99
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,791
I don't eat beef.

100
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,041
No beef.

101
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,625
Because... uh...

102
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,208
I'm making a vow to Guanyin, so I...

103
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,250
I wish to Guanyin.

104
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,458
No beef.

105
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,583
No beef...

106
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,041
So sorry.

107
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,833

00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,083

110
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:54,958

00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,000
You wanna hang out with me. go to out site

112
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,375
No.

113
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,208
You take a good rest.

114
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,291
You look like Victor so much.

115
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,458
You can recognize

116
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,541
who’s Victor and who’s Chanliang?

117
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,250
I think.

118
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,125
– This Chanliang.– Yes.

119
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,708
This Victor.

120
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,500
Yes.

121
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,333
You two look so much alike, Victor.

122
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:57,916
But love…

123
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,583
No matter how alike something may seem,

124
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,458
It can never truly replace what’s real, Victor.

125
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:11,625
I think...

126
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,833
Victor, Chanliang…

127
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,166
You all have beautiful lives.

128
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:28,541
I think Victor will always want you have beautiful life.

129
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,541
Um, TK may be you take shower.

138
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,708
I wish Chanliang happiness.

139
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,708
I wish him everlasting happiness.

140
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Amen

141
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,291
I hope TK can smile again soon.

142
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,250
Good veiw.Right?

143
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:01,708
Yes

144
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,458
What is the name of this place.

145
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,583
Tamsui Lover’s Bridge.

146
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,833
Ching-ren Chee-ow (the Bridge of Love)

147
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,041
Yes

148
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,833
If you like this place.

149
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,291
You can use this camera.

150
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,916
You can keep your memory.

151
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:36,666
In your hart.

152
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,125
Victor old me.

153
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
You put and you keep.

154
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,541
This memory

155
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:49,916
and

156
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,500
This memory

157
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:05,666
Victor told you?

158
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,041
Yes

159
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,416
I have someone special.

160
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,000
If I get the chance, I’ll definitely bring them here.

161
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:28,875
Huh?

162
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,500
Who is it?

163
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Come on.

164
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,625
Why do you look so serious?

165
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,208
Are you saying you have a lover or something?

166
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:40,541
No, not at all.

167
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,416
I told you, I don’t.

168
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,416
So what?

169
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,541
Come on, I told you my secret already.

170
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,541
You told me your secret? No way.

171
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,875
– Hurry up.– What? Why are you so serious all of a sudden?

172
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,375
– Are you sure? Don’t dodge the question.– I don’t have anyone.

173
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,083
– Why not?– Then just tell me already!

174
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:55,875
Tell me.

175
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,000
I think…

176
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,375
Tomorrow…

177
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,208
I’ll go back.

178
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,166
You can stay.

179
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:39,708
If you want.

180
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,208
You very kind.

181
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,291
But no Chanliang.

182
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,458
I think

183
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,208
I should go back to my place.

184
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:58,291
I hope

185
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:00,958
You can remember me.

186
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:03,916
Yes.

187
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,750
Yes. I  remember you

188
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:08,708
I promise.

189
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:35,291
Chanliang.

190
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,000
You know.

191
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,625
I love Victor.

192
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,958
Yes, I know.

193
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:49,708
Today…

194
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,875
The last time for me.

195
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,000
May i ...

196
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:56,791
May i ...

197
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,291
Okay

198
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:06,750
if you happy.

199
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,458
I'll happy

200
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,041
May i  hug you?

201
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:18,708
Yes.

202
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,791
Thank you. Thank you.

203
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,458
It’s okay, my child. It’s okay.

204
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,708
Mom is still here, right?

205
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,083
It’s going to be okay, sweetheart.

206
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,250
Mom…

207
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,333
If I’m not really a ‘man’ in the traditional sense…

208
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,916
And if I love another man…

209
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,541
Would you still love me, Mom?

210
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,875
No matter what, I’ll always love you.

211
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,166
Whatever you are, I’ll always love you.

212
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,125
When I come back here again.

213
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,458
When I turned around,

214
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,458
The sky here has already changed colors.

215
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,166
The things I used to say.

216
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,250
I am the sun.

217
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:55,041
You are the star.

218
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,708
If I am the sun, he is the star.

219
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,166
I just forgot to think about it, didn't I?

220
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:05,416
That no matter how close the sun and a star are,

221
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,916
Even if they are in the same sky,

222
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,250
But they never got a chance to meet again.

223
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,625
I am the sun.

224
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,583
You are the star.

225
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:28,958
I just want to...

226
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,250
Go out and live your life.

227
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,083
In the way you truly want to, brother.

228
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,166
Let's go

229
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,000
Close your eyes.

230
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,375
Close your eyes.

231
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,458
Mmm.

232
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:45,916
Where do you want to go?

233
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,541
Then dream about it.

234
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:52,833
You’re not even trying.

235
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:53,541
Someday…

236
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,458
I’ll take you there.

237
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:17,083
P’Am, P’Golf.

238
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,500
I haven’t been able to reach NanKrai for several days.

239
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,708
Have you seen NanKrai, P’Am?

240
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,083
P’Am…

241
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,500
What’s wrong? Where’s NanKrai?

242
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,125
P’Golf.

243
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,208
P’Am, he…

244
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,083
Mark.

245
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:57,125
Dan.

246
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,083
Pond.

247
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,125
Where did everyone else go?

248
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,791
And where’s NanKrai?

249
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,250
I haven’t seen him.

250
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:07,875
That means he’s not here, obviously.

251
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,458
Then where did he go?

252
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,291
Maybe he went somewhere you should’ve been with him.

253
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,666
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

254
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:18,958
Tell me!

255
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:20,208
Huh? Dan?

256
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,375
Now you suddenly care?

257
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,708
Now you want answers, huh?!

258
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,333
Didn’t you go with him?!

259
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:36,875
Who did I go with?!

260
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:37,958
Say it.

261
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,333
Tell me! Who did I go with?!

262
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,625
You left with that foreign guy.

263
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,208
So why did you even come back?

264
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,583
I just went on a trip to Taiwan,China, Dan.

265
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,041
That’s all it was—just a trip.

266
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,083
Didn’t you know?

267
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:52,708
NanKrai loved you.

268
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,125
He’s loved you since you were kids.

269
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,250
And what did you do to him?

270
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,458
Just tell me where NanKrai is.

271
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,375
He’s gone. Don’t you get it?!

272
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:10,833
He’s no longer here for you to see.

273
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,291
He’s not here for me either. He’s not here for anyone anymore.

274
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,083
Hello, P'

275
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,875
I’m traveling in Taiwan,China.

276
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,625
You don’t have to worry about me.

277
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,500
I’ll be back soon.

278
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,583
When I return…

279
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,958
Will you come pick me up?

280
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,458
That’s all for now.

281
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,208
I’m heading out to explore more.

282
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,291
Hello?

283
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,791
Hello.

284
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:52,666
P’NanKrai…

285
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:54,416
Hello?

286
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,958
Is the signal bad or what?

287
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,583
He’s not here anymore.

288
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,041
He’s really gone.

289
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:16,583
It’s all your fault.

290
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,166
Go wherever you want.

291
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,458
Go, if you’ve already chosen him.

292
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,750
Why the hell did you even come back?

293
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:26,333
Just leave!

294
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:30,833
You’re no longer my brother.

295
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:32,791
You’re not my brother anymore.

296
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,458
Go wherever you want. Don’t call me brother ever again.

297
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,833
Just go.

298
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,416
What do you mean?!

299
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:44,416
Where is NanKrai?

300
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,083
Can you just tell me?! Where is NanKrai?!

301
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,625
Someone, please tell me…

302
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:54,916
Where did NanKrai go?

303
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,208
I’m done talking.

304
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,541
I'm not saying anything more.

305
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,500
And I won’t talk to you ever again.

306
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,541
There’s no NanKrai left here for you to find.

307
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,250
Go look for him wherever you want.

308
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,208
Didn’t you promise me, brother…

309
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,583
That you’d take me with you?

310
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,166
You promised me.

311
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,083
You said you’d take me, didn’t you?

312
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,250
P'Nankrai

313
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,791
No matter where P'Nankrai is,

314
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:32,916
I wish for you...

315
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:38,958
...where...

316
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,333
And to the land P'Nankrai wishes to go.

317
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,541
Hello P'Ton Trae. My name is Kaeng Jot

318
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,875
If P'Nankrai cannot be by Tontrae's side,

319
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:54,125
Kaeng Jot will ask to stay by P'Tontrae's side.

320
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,291
Hope to see you in my dreams.

321
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,416
Someday, I'll take you there.

322
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,166
Let's go together.

323
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,625
But for now, close your eyes first.

324
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,916
See you in my dreams.

325
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:58,916
No investment at all.

326
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,083
How many years has the princess Jaonang been waiting?

327
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,083
The princess has waited until she turned to stone.

328
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:48,208
It makes me wonder how much they're suffering.

329
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,416
Is it because of Jaonang?!

330
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,416
Is it because of Jaonang?!

331
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,416
That made me…

332
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,000
Suffer like this.

333
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,500
Was it something I said? Or something else?

334
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,291
So she wanted me to suffer too?

335
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:28,791
This is too much.

336
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,083
Jaonang suffered…

337
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,708
So she wants her children and grandchildren to suffer too?

338
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,125
Fine.

339
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:43,583
Fine then.

340
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,375
If this is what you wants…

341
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,291
Then I’ll curse her.

342
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:51,958
I had to endure great suffering.

343
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,041
I had to keep waiting here.

344
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,833
Even if it takes hundreds or thousands of years.

345
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,083
Jaonang.

346
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:18,583
Now I understand.

347
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,791
What it truly means to suffer.

348
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,916
I understand now, Jaonang.

349
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,666
I truly do, Jaonang.

350
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,541
I know now how deeply you’ve suffered.

351
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,208
I understand.

352
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:46,125
I understand now, Jaonang.

353
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:53,458
I understand now.

354
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,750
Are you saying… Victor is dead?

355
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,166
Even if there’s no promise written in stone,

356
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,333
P’NanKrai will always be by my side.

357
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,125
Please let me find happiness in love.

358
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,250
Victor is the greatest happiness in my life.

359
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:11,500
I love you.

360
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,541
Keep it safe in your heart.

361
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,333
In your memories.

362
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:17,291
If it's possible

363
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,541
You should probably make better use of it.

364
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:22,666
I never kiss befor.

365
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:23,583
frist time?

366
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:27,875
I love you too, P'

367
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:29,791
In this life of mine…

368
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,583
You are the only one I have.

369
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,291
May my life from now on…

370
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,708
Be filled with light and joy.

371
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,541
Like the flame that never fades.

372
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:39,791
Pinky promise.

373
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,000
"Pinky promise"

374
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:41,875
Seal the promise.

375
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:42,708
“Seal the promise.”

376
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:43,875
you promise.

377
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:44,791
I promise.

378
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:46,333
Today.

379
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:47,666
I’ll be your guide today.

380
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,833
I’ll take care of you and show you around.

381
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,166
Sigh… P’

382
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,208
I asked everyone but no one’s free.

383
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,250
So I had to you, P’Jamnearn.

384
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:03,875
About what?

385
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:04,916
Here’s the situation…

386
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:08,125
Actually, I was going to ask Tontaé.

387
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,416
Why?

388
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:11,291
So.

389
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,250
The mayor asked me a favor.

390
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,083
There’s a tourist from Taiwan,China.

391
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,666
He’s also a photographer, so the mayor said:

392
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:20,291
"Mae, please take them out for a trip/outing."

393
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,208
"Let's go visit Ban Wongburi"

394
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,750
"House Khum Chao Luang, and those traditional wooden houses."

395
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:24,583
So why don’t you ask someone else?

396
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:26,916
He doesn’t speak Thai.

397
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,875
How could I talk to him?

398
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,750
Just ask Tontaé.

399
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:32,416
Just one day.

400
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,416
Go help him out.

401
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:40,958
Tontaé can practice his English too.

402
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,750
Come on, help me out just for a day.

403
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,875
Only one day.

404
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,625
What’s the tourist’s name?

405
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,375
Victor.

406
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,875
How did you know?

407
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:57,625
What’s going on here, P’?

408
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,625
What’s with him?

409
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:28,333
Are you Victor right?

410
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,375
Yes, I’m Victor.

411
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,750
To day. I'll be your guide.

412
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,833
I’ll take care of you and show you around.

413
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,666
Are you okay?

414
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,666
Of course, real big aid.

415
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:43,916
If, in the end

416
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:47,416
We’re not meant to be together…

417
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,208
Then I hope Victor finds happiness.

418
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:57,500
Live your life as you truly are.

419
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,000
May you be happy, Victor.

420
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:13,958
May you find joy.

421
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:18,791
If fate brings us together again…

422
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,666
May we meet again someday.

423
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,875
Send my love to ...

424
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,625
Chanliang.

425
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,458
My brother?

426
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:44,833
Hey.

427
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,041
You so handsome, you know?

428
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,416
You’re here?

429
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:13,833
Come sit here, quick.

430
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,125
Come.

431
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:20,708
Come quickly.

432
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:22,833
Come have some food.

433
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,875
This grilled pork is really delicious.

434
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:39,416
Eat a lot, okay?

435
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:40,500
Here, take it.

436
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:00,291
Hurry up.

437
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:01,666
Eat grilled pork.

438
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,958
Or it’ll get cold. We’ll go to the waterfall this evening.

439
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:07,666
This is Hang Lay curry — this one is really good.

440
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:09,541
Try it.

441
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,458
Or it’ll get cold.

442
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,958
This evening I’ll take you to the waterfall.

443
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,666
They say the waterfall is really beautiful this time of year.

444
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,875
The water’s nice and cool  let’s go play in it.

445
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:00,666
Tontaé.

446
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:13,625
P’NanKrai.

447
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,708
Thank you, brother.

448
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:18,958
For waiting for me.

449
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,541
I’ve always been by your side.

450
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,458
I waited right where I always do.

451
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,625
No matter what you do or where you go.

452
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:34,583
P’NanKrai.

453
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,958
Do you remember the wooden doll?

454
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:44,250
Can you make one for me?

455
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:46,708
Of course.

456
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,625
A wooden doll…

457
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:53,250
If I were to name it…

458
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,833
I’d like to call it…

459
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,750
“Nong Kaeng Jot.”

460
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:06,208
It’s okay.

461
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:09,708
It’s okay.

462
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:17,166
It’s okay.

463
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:26,541
No, no, don't cry.

464
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,541
It’s really okay…

465
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,208
It’s really okay…

466
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:55,666
All right.

467
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:56,916
Listen to P 'Ton.

468
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:58,125
Today.

469
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:00,500
It's P 'Ton.

470
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,125
I will come to tell a story for the younger siblings to hear.

471
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:07,333
Who likes to listen to stories? Raise your hand.

472
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,250
Everybody likes each other.

473
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:15,416
So what story should we tell today?

474
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:16,750
Ghost.

475
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:21,083
Who likes to listen to ghost stories?

476
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,375
About Pha Nang Khoi Cave.

477
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,083
If Pha Nang Koi

478
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:30,750
So...

479
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:33,458
Good I dea. This is better.

480
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:37,166
Anyone who wants to hear about Cave Pha Nang, show your hand.

481
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:43,166
P 'Ton said.

482
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:46,875
Maybe we should have a representative tell the story instead of P'Ton, what do you think?

483
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:49,000
Good.

484
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:54,875
Who wants to hear Plawan tell a story?

485
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,625
Applause for Plawan!

486
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,583
Stand up.

487
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,041
Okay, ready.

488
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:06,375
3 2 1

489
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,166
Hello, everyone.

490
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:14,666
Today I will tell you the legend of "Tham Pha Nang Khoi" for you to listen to.

491
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:17,666
It's the story of a noble princess.

492
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:20,791
With a young man whom he loved.

493
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
That are different in class

494
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:25,500
The love of two people

495
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:28,000
The princess waited.

496
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,291
Until the body turns to stone.

497
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:38,583
By the power of faithful love.

498
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:41,750
What will the story be next?

499
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:43,958
Let's follow and watch.

500
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:47,416
P'Ton, P'Ton! There's a lost tourist over there.

501
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,041
Can you go help him?

502
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:50,916
Okay, sir.

503
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:55,250
Kids, P'Ton needs to pause the storytelling for now.

504
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,000
Come sit here.

505
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,833
Okay, P 'Ton.

506
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,208
I'd like to go do my duty. Let's go help tourists first.

507
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes.

508
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,791
Okay?

509
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,791
-Yes.-Only then.

510
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,000
Don't be stubborn.

511
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,541
Don't be stubborn.

512
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,583
Don't be stubborn.

513
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,250
Sit here and wait.

514
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:18,166
Don't be stubborn.

515
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,625
Let me be this person.

516
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,166
I'm happy.

517
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,250
To travel far, far away

518
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,750
Instead of everyone.

519
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,958
Mom.

520
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,958
I won't be able to go back.

521
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,125
Mom, please let me go.

522
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,791
I appreciate it.

523
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,083
That my mother avoided me.

524
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,125
With love.

525
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,125
And cherishing

526
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:00,500
But I can't stay anymore, Mom.

527
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,416
P'Nankrai.

528
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,625
You don't have to wait for me.

529
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,916
If between the two of us

530
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,833
Someone has to stay.

531
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,041
Someone has to go.

532
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,125
I'd like to exchange it for you.

533
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,375
I'll be right there.

534
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,458
I want to tell my brother Nan Krai that

535
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:33,791
It warms my heart every time.

536
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,208
To have you by my side.

537
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:38,875
I love you.

538
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,375
Victor.

539
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,791
The story of the two of us is beautiful, Victor.

540
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,916
Even if it's the shortest time.

541
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,791
It is the most beautiful memory.

542
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,875
In our lives.

543
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,416
That the two of us

544
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:05,958
Probably have a chance to meet somewhere.

545
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:09,833
Where the two of us

546
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,791
Will be happy together

547
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:18,875
I love Victor very much.

548
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:31,083
And then the two of us were happily together.

549
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:33,250
Although...

550
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,708
Even if it's just a dream.

551
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:58,708
Oh no, is my phone battery running out?

552
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,666
Uh... Sorry i can not speak Thai.

553
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:36,833
Let me help you.

554
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:39,083
Here.

555
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:47,166
You're like a savior.

556
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:48,375
Never mind
