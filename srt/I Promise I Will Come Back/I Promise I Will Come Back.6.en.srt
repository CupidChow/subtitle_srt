1
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,958
Actually, I don’t think farewells are all that scary.

2
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:04,291
But the longing that follows a farewell — that’s what’s truly frightening.

3
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:09,250
The closer we are to each other,

4
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,875
and the more memories we share,

5
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,791
those feelings cut deep into our hearts and make us miss each other.

6
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,833
It’s true, as they often say,

7
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,000
no one has ever died from missing someone.

8
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:26,916
But sometimes,

9
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,666
missing someone…

10
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,291
in certain moments,

11
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,958
can be unbearably terrifying.

12
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,166
Victor

13
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,125
Before take shower.

14
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,791
You said

15
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,958
Jin Wan...

16
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,166
- Jin Wan Ni Tea Jen Chow Hao
- Uh, yeah, that's the word.

17
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:49,791
That one.

18
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,708
Another round

19
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,416
Jin Wan

20
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:53,708
"Jin is scared."

21
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,250
This is Teo Jen Chow Hao.

22
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,000
"Run away."

23
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,250
This is Tae Jen.

24
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,833
"Ni Ta Jen."

25
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,541
Chow, huh?

26
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,541
"Chow, hey."

27
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:02,375
"Jin Yuan."

28
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,875
Jin Wan

29
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:04,958
"Jin is scared."

30
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:05,875
Yes!

31
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,625
This is Teo Jen Chow Hao.

32
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,791
This is Tea Jen Chow Hao (You're done with me tonight)

33
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,333
What does it mean?

34
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,916
- You want to know?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm not tell you.

36
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:15,708
Why?

37
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,083
I want to know.

38
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,541
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

39
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,583
Follow me.

40
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:54,291
Day 5

41
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,791
Good morning, Victor. Victor, Victor.

42
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,291
Good Morning TK TK TK

43
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,125
Thank you, TK.

44
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:22,958
Victor.

45
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,166
Are you happy?

46
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,708
Yes.

47
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,000
For me...

48
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,291
I'm happy so so so so so much.

49
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:38,541
Really?

50
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,750
Thank you so much, Victor.

51
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,916
For coming into my life.

52
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,416
No matter what happens from now on,

53
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,541
I want you to know that—

54
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,958
You are my greatest happiness.

55
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,625
I love you.

56
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,125
Don't understand.

57
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,625
You don't have to understand anything.

58
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,916
Just feel it.

59
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,250
Yes

60
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,208
Already i know.

61
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,291
Today I’ll take you out. Are you ready?

62
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:29,958
Yes.

63
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,458
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

64
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,833
What’s up, Nan Krai?

65
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:55,708
Hello, Auntie.

66
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,083
Has Tontrae woken up yet?

67
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,125
How could he wake up? He’s not even back yet.

68
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,708
He said he went camping on the mountain with the tourists.

69
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,583
He probably won’t be back until later this morning.

70
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:08,625
Yes.

71
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,458
That’s alright.

72
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:25,750
Hurry up.

73
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,333
Come on

74
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:32,791
Wait for me.

75
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,416
- Victor.
– Yeah?

76
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,750
Last night you can remember at the royal party the other night?

77
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,208
Wait, what does the English party say?

78
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,791
The party at Khum Chao Luang, do you remember it?

79
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,375
The Contemporary Dance performance they showed.

80
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:08,375
It's the story. The woman she waiting her husband.

81
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,208
She waiting long long time and finaly,

82
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,833
She bocome stone.She turned into stone, right here.

83
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,125
- Really?
- Really.

84
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,458
- You want to see that?
- Yeah, I want to see

85
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Really?

86
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,083
Okay, go.

87
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,000
Victor

88
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:39,625
you look at this

89
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,833
Wow, it's amazing.

90
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,500
Take a picture now

91
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:54,666
Victor.

92
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,333
Yes?

93
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:57,958
You look at this.

94
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,458
You stay here.

95
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,375
Yeah.

96
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,041
Alright, hold still.

97
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,458
Victor, sir.

98
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,791
I want to kiss you, sir.

99
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,208
Really?

100
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,375
Where? Here?

101
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,208
No.

102
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,166
You have 30 minutes for visit here.

103
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,291
It's only 30 minutes? I need more time.

104
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,250
No, you only have 30 minutes. Go.

105
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,333
Yeah, waiting for me.

106
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,666
Yeah, I waitng for you.

107
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Last 20 minutes.

108
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,583
Really? No way. I need more time.

109
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,791
The princess looks beautiful, doesn’t she?

110
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,666
But she looks kind of sad.

111
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,500
How many years has she been waiting?

112
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,583
Even I nearly died waiting 30 minutes.

113
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,208
She waited so long she turned to stone.

114
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:11,041
I wonder how much pain she had to endure.

115
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,208
That’s really extraordinary.

116
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:59,166
Hey TK, come here quick! Look at that — it’s amazing!

117
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:00,541
Really?

118
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:36,416
P’Nankrai, this time — I’ve got you for sure.

119
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:48,916
May you love only me until the day you die.

120
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,041
Alright.

121
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,708
🎵 Hug goo, long goo, kued terng ha ga goo

00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,875

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,000

🎵 Tid pom, tid wee, hug goo, long goo

129
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:31,250
You two must take this holy water and make P’Nankrai drink it — for me.

130
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
Do you understand?

131
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,833
I’m not going. If you want to go, go by yourself!

132
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,083
I asked: do you two understand?

133
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,208
- I get it.
- Got it.

134
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,833
- You didn’t speak in sync. Try again
-  Say it together this time.

135
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,208
- Make it look confident.
– Make sure you sound sure!

136
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,791
Do you understand?

137
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,208
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

138
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,500
And don't let me know.

139
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,041
find out you didn’t give the holy water to P’Nankrai.

140
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,166
If you don’t — you’re both dead!

141
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,083
Why so aggressive?

142
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,250
Ouch! You ruined my hair. You take it yourself!

143
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,791
Then what do you expect me to do?

144
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,041
– No way. I don’t want to drink it yet.
– You’re older, you do it.

145
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,083
Take it.

146
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,166
Then what do we do? Who’s going to take it?

147
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,041
Take it!

148
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,375
Fine, I’ll do it.

149
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,041
It’s always me!

150
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,125
Good job.

151
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,333
How are we going to get him to drink it?

152
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,083
Just put him in a chokehold!

153
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,291
Why haven’t you two left yet?

154
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,541
– We’re going now!
- Go!

155
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,666
– Yes, going now!
- Hurry up!

156
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:51,625
We’re going!

157
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,541
Quick, quick.

158
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,458
These little brats… Ugh, never do anything right.

159
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,166
Ugh, never do anything right.

160
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,333
You should take it yourself.

161
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,916
Pond should do it.

162
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:08,833
You go!

163
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,000
- No.
– I don’t know how!.

164
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,291
Pond should be the one to take it.

165
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:12,958
You!

166
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,083
Hey!

167
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,166
Hey, what are you guys doing?

168
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,291
All done.

169
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,375
Come here.

170
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,208
Mark

171
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,458
Yes, P’Dan?

172
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,916
- Help me.
- This is it.

173
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,208
Here, take this.

174
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,666
Well, um…

175
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,041
Nankrai — I mean P’ Nankrai…

176
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,458
He just ate, so he’s probably thirsty. Go give him some water.

177
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:38,958
He’s probably hot too.

178
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,791
Sure, it’s no problem.

179
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,625
P’Nankrai, here’s some water.

180
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,083
Spicy!

181
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,541
P’Som-O, what should we do?

182
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:10,500
Water

183
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,083
To drink.

184
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,500
Water

185
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,291
Yeah, it’s stuck in my throat.

186
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,500
Give it to him! Quick!

187
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,500
Give it? Hmm… let’s trade.

188
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,166
– For you.
– Once I give it to you, you have to drink it.

189
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,333
Thank you.

190
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,041

Refreshing.

193
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,958
Here, drink more, drink it all.

194
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,625
Drink, drink!

195
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,208
Take it and drink it.

196
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,708
Drink it all — or it’ll get stuck again.

197
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,166
Drink properly, and have some more.

198
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:47,541
That’s it.

199
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,000
Very good.

200
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,083
Very, very good.

201
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:51,666
Excellent.

202
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:53,833
Enjoy your meal.

203
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,500
No, I'm full.

204
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,291
Hungry

205
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,375
I’m full, really, no more.

206
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:02,416
Go ahead.

207
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,833
You’re really lucky.

Everyone go to the temple.

Your clothes.

222
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:50,958
What kind of clothes?

223
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,750
I’ll make you into…

224
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,500
A northern Lanna guy — let’s dress in traditional Lanna style.

225

This is beautiful! What’s the pattern called?

235
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,875
It’s lace. A lace shirt.

236
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,000
- This one’s beautiful too.

Let's go

242

We can begin the event now.

243
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,708
Where are you going?

244
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,750
– Who’s this, Tontrae?
– Hello.

245
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,750
– Hello.
- Who?

246
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,500
It’s Victor — the one you asked me to look after.

247
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:22,583
He looks great.

248
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,583
He's P'Jamnean's son.

249
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,625
No one was available that day,
so I asked him to take care of Victor.

250
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,000
So cute. You both look adorable.

251
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,916
- Victor.
– You two look good together.

252
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:48,500
Victor.

253
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,708
I have something to show you.

254
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,791
Did you know that there’s a local belief here? We use long sticks.

255
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,083
When you wish.

256
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,916
if your stick is long enough,

257
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,416
your wish will come true, and you’ll find happiness.

258
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,583
Whoa, I had no idea. I really want to try it!

259
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,625
- Okay, go.
- Let's go.

260
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,791
This is the last round. May our love be fulfilled.

261

May love…

265
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,000
“May love…”

266
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,541
bless the two of us…

267
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,041
“Bless the two of us…”

268
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,500
to be happy…

269
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,541
“To be happy…”

270
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,583
and may our wishes come true.

271
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,666
“May our wishes come true.”

272
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,708
And may we love each other forever.

273
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,958
“And may we love each other forever.”

274
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:34,541
Right?

275
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,625
Yes!

276
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,708
You’re already so good at speaking Northern Thai.

277
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,500
Make one last wish.

278
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,666
Make your wish, go on.

279
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,291
May our love be fulfilled.

280
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:46,916
May this long stick be inspired...

281
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:48,875
Wishing you happiness and fulfillment.

282
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:57,958
