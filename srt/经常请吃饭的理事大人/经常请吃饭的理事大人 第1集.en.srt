170
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,110
Even if we put aside the fact that I'm a man,

171
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,780
how can you date someone you don't even know?

172
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Ouch!

173
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,000
Can't you just love me on your own then?

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,980
What do you mean?

175
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,570
Since you're involved you should love me, too.

176
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,620
You have a heart-shaped mole on your chest, right?

177
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,980
What... how did he know?

178
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,820
Director Min, did you put a curse on me

179
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,290
because I didn't agree to date you yesterday?

180
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,260
Calm down

181
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,620
and listen to me.

182
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,070
You're only feeling pain right now

183
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,660
but if you keep refusing to date me,

184
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,650
you might really die.

185
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm... I'm going to die?

186
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,680
If you don't believe me, you can try.

187
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,820
Director Min,

188
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,280
is having dinner together considered as dating?

189
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,010
Then when will the curse end?

190
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,920
When I really fall in love with you.

191
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,200
I thought I could just

192
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,280
date and marry normally like others.

193
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,380
Seol Dongbaek.

194
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,040
Seriously.

195
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,620
Director Min, what are you doing?

196
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,630
Don't act like a virgin and make a fuss about it.
