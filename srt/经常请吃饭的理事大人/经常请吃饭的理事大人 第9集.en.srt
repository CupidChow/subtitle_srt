Director,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
it's been a while since we last had dinner together,

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,710
do you want to eat together?

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,460
You want to have dinner at this hour?

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,030
Do you think I'm doing this because I'm hungry?

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,810
I'm doing this because I want to go to your house.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,770
I want to go to your house today.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,810
I noticed when I first came here,

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,080
that there's someone living in this home but it's so empty.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,210
If I still haven't appeared in front of you,

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,340
what would you have done?

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,410
I would've kept waiting.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,950
From now on, let's do everything together one by one.

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,070
I will become Youdam's trace from now on.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,090
Don't ever turn your back on me again.

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,180
I'm not done talking yet, don't just leave me alone like this!

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,120
Why are you taking so many pills?

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,620
Tranquilizer.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,390
When did you start taking it?

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,770
I don't know I can't remember.

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,130
Don't take so much medicine.

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,570
Calm down.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,830
I'll help you.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,450
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,850
You did a great job.

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,110
Good job.

28
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,570
You look pale.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm not feeling well today.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,470
I’ll go hug you after I finish my work.

31

[The Director Who Buys Me Dinner. Episode 9: Words I haven’t said yet.]

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,840
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,820
It's not that serious.

35
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,530
I'll probably get better after getting some sleep at home.

36
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,740
But still...

37
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,010
You don't have to worry about me.

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,740
Denis, are you okay?

39
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,920
Are you okay?

40
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,410
What's wrong with you? You should've sent him to the hospital right away.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,550
It's all your fault.

42
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,380
What?

43
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,920
You make people miserable.

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,220
Don’t you know?

45
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,010
Do you know why Dongbaek fainted?

46
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,980
Do you know what he was so busy with?

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,360
You don't care about what he wants or likes.

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,700
Min Youdam, isn't this your specialty?

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,579
You're good at using people and then abandoning them.

50
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,460
Stop pretending in front of me.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,940
I want to kill you.

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,460
Let's go.

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,120
Are you okay?

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,590
What's wrong?

55
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,890
I'm really fine.

56
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,670
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

57
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,149
I feel much better after taking a nap.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,280
Maybe it's because I've been exhausted these past few days.

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Also you didn't spend much time with me...

60
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,230
Exhaustion?

61
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,770
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry,

62
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,480
but there was a small problem in the Performance Planning Team.

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,680
I promised to help them do Denis' stage design.

64
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,909
Youdam.

65
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,380
It's all my fault.

66
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,710
What if it's because I held onto you

67
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,080
that made you unhappy?

68
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,550
I keep thinking about this.

69
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,760
No.

70
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,440
If you think like that, tell me right away.

71
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,730
I'll tell you that it's not like that.

72
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,180
When did you wake up?

73
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,440
Just now.

74
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,880
You're lying, your face isn't swollen at all.

75
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,200
Yet I'm too sleepy to even open my eyes.

76
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,130
I usually don't swell easily.

77
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,390
Let me see.

78
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,560
You're indeed a little swollen.

79
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,340
Come on.

80
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,940
The wound won't hurt anymore for a while now.

81
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,430
It's a bit of a pity.

82
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,590
Why?

83
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,450
Because that's one less reason to stick by you.

84
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,250
Even if there's no reason...

85
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,840
What do you mean?

86
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,870
You must be hungry, do you want to eat breakfast? I'll cook for you.

87
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,390
Do you know how to cook?

88
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,090
I can cook kimchi fried rice.

89
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,700
How can I let a sick person cook?

90
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,630
I'll cook for you, just wait.

91
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,420
Okay.

92
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,440
I...

93
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,290
have something that I haven't told you yet.

94
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,870
What? What is it?

95
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,790
In the past, I mean, in your past life,

96
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,550
you were killed because of me.

97
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,790
You killed me?

98
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,140
Didn't you tell me that I left without saying goodbye?

99
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,650
I forgot about this,

100
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,800
because I felt too guilty towards you.

101
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,530
I didn't have the right to have you,

102
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,320
but I was greedy.

103
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,680
Because of me,

104
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,210
you were killed in front of me. I saw it all.

105
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,780
It's okay.

106

I'm sorry.

I don't remember anything anyways.

whether it's back then or now,

110
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,160
I chose you so I don't regret it.

Are you leaving already?

112

If I leave later there might be a traffic jam.

113
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,700
Then help me take a look at this before you leave.
