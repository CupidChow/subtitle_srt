It's so kind of Min Entertainment to still keep him.

Of course I'm worried, I was so shocked.

98
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,510
It feels alright to have someone worry about me.

99
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,940
I'm sorry. I wasn't being careful.

100
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,450
Since you're not hurt, it's fine.

101

the pain will be relieved.

But,

104
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,700
is this one of the curses, too?

105
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,840
Probably.

106
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,670
I've always cared about safety first.

107
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,530
Is it because we didn't eat together last time...

108
