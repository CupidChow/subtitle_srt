2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,370
Isn't he an artist who has totally gone downhill?

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,390
It seems like the company will give up on him soon.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,580
It's so kind of Min Entertainment to still keep him.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,150
He's old and despised but still so stubborn.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
His skills are also dropping, how is he so confident?

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,050
Is it okay

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,930
to just let you be played in the palms of God?

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,520
-Sir! -What should we do?

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,150
Is this one of the curses, too?

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,600
Is it because we didn't eat together last time...

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,540
It feels alright to have someone worry about me.

13

[The Director Who Buys Me Dinner. Episode 5: You'll never get a chance to run away again.]

14
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,289
Ms. Seo was really funny today.

15
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,820
Well...

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Ms. Seo...

17
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,270
Didn't you hurt that arm?

18
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,840
How can you lie about something like this?

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,980
I was so worried about you.

20
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,160
I didn't mean to lie to you...

21
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,700
the doctor said we can remove the cast today,

22
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,700
but it still hurts.

23
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,680
What are you doing?

24
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,380
Because I want to be with you.

25
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,540
Why do you have to hug me to say that...?

26
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,940
I'm... afraid you'll run away.

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,900
I was actually just going to go drink water.

28
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,640
It can't be helped,

29
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,580
I have to stay by your side all the time.

30
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,790
Because that way I can protect you.

31
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,220
So, in order for me to protect you,

32
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,530
please don't run away.

33
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,880
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,150
Yes, I understand.

35
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,860
Dongbaek, the Director wants to see you.

36
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,310
Go in.

37
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,260
Okay.

38
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,660
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,010
What if someone sees?

40
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,510
I'm going to love you seriously from now on.

41
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,920
If, after I'm done with my work,

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,380
I see you waiting for me here,

43
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,460
I’ll assume that we feel the same way about each other.

44
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,550
If we end up sharing the same feelings,

45
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,080
then what?

46
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,980
Who... who's down there?

47
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,280
Yes.

48
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,170
Are you okay?

49
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,280
Performance Planning Team Director?

50
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,430
No, I'm not okay.

51
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,610
What happened?

52
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:30,100
The youngest... the youngest ran away.

53
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,880
Not only did he run away,

54
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,470
he also deleted the materials for Denis' new song launch event next month.

55
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,880
He ran away.

56
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,420
Director Min is going to kill me.

57
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,730
He's going to kill me!

58
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,410
Calm... calm down!

59
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,800
Wait, but

60
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,810
Seol Dongbaek,

61
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,170
didn’t you plan on joining the Performance Planning Team?

62
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,560
I think I saw you at the interview.

63
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,400
Yes, that was my plan at first.

64
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,980
Please save our team.

65
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,160
You can definitely do it!

66
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,740
What? Me?

67
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,410
I saw your portfolio,

68
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,230
didn't your work win a prize at Denis' concert competition?

69
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,000
I was the one who reviewed it.

70
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,880
You should've joined our team.

71
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,370
Min Youtan this jerk.

72
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,090
Anyways, Dongbaek,

73
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,630
please.

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,530
Please help me a little bit.

75
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,290
I'll hire someone right away

76
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,970
so before that just help me for a bit,

77
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,670
is that okay?

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,370
I don't think I'll be of any help,

79
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,800
I have other work to do.

80
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,740
All you need to do is put in a bit of work.

81
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,720
I need to ask for Director Min's permission.

82
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,520
What?

83
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,290
Is Director Min your homeroom teacher?

84
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,550
You need to get his permission for weekend volunteer work, too?

85
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,960
Volunteer work?

86
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,320
It’s just a metaphor.

87
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,340
Dongbaek,

88
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,920
let’s go to our team first and talk over there, okay?

89
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,050
Wait, now?

90
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,140
If Ms. Seo finds out...

91
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,930
It's okay, I'm her senior.

92
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,340
Have a seat.

93
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,390
Hi.

94
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,960
[Hi]

95
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,770
Here, I’ve prepared reference materials for you

96
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,130
so Dongbaek, just freely sketch some drafts.

97
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,020
It’s super easy, right?

98
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,330
It's okay, you can do it.

99
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,120
This seems like enough to solve the problem.

100
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,530
Are you here to see me?

101
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,750
Don't just keep rejecting me,

102
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,530
but close your eyes

103
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,590
and try to accept me.

104
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,160
Answer me.

105
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,710
Do we share the same feelings?

106
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,070
Why did you wait for me?

107
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,780
Because I want to see you.

108
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,140
Now,

109
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,680
you'll have no chance to run away.

110
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,140
[On the next episode]

111
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,860
I’ll tell Seol Dongbaek to come to the photo shoot.

112
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,440
Please take care of the set.

113
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,390
Should I call you brother?

114
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,660
I need a picture with a lipstick mark on me.

115
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,630
Seol Dongbaek, you help me.

116
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,150
Is this okay?

117
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,620
On the cheek, too.

118
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,390
If I start my own company,

119
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,940
Seol Dongbaek, will you come?

120
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,740
What?

121
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,820
You can do whatever you want with me then.

122
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,040
When I told you on set today to leave a lipstick mark,

123
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm sure you could tell I did it on purpose.
