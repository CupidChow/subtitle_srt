Do you know Seol Dongbaek?

Me?

6
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,640
I'm sorry,

7
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,030
but the company isn't that relaxed yet.

8
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,540
I heard that the new idol group still isn't ready to debut.

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,480
As far as I know, I'm also not that free of a person.

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,650
Do you want me to call you brother?

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,740
No, just call me what you want.

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,230
What... What are you doing?

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,880
I need a picture with a lipstick mark on me.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,910
Seol Dongbaek, you help me.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,670
Is this okay?

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,440
On the cheek, too.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,570
If I start my own company,

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,210
Seol Dongbaek, will you come?

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:49,920
What?

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,100
You can do whatever you want with me then.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,830
When I told you on set today to leave a lipstick mark,

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm sure you could tell I did it on purpose.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,910
Seol Dongbaek, I think I like you.

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,950
Don't go.

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Let go!

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,680
Why should I?

28
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,950
I keep missing out on what's important.

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,530
If you're sorry, give me a hug.

31
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,470
My wound seems to hurt a little again.

[The number you have reached is not available.]

39
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,650
I wonder if he has arrived safely.

40
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,630
I won't be able to see him for a while.

41
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,220
Is he busy?

42
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,930
Hello, Director.

43
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,480
I don't have a name.

44
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,290
Then let me give you a name.

45
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,140
A child who shouldn't have a destiny

46
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,390
suddenly has one now because he received a name.

That kid will be in trouble now.

48

Seol Dongbaek!

49
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,090
You brat! Die!

50
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,430
A shaman's child shouldn't leave the house!

51
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,409
Hey, don't look at him, you'll get cursed.

52
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,080
Let's go.

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,810
Goodness.

54
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,820
Thank you, my lord.

55
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,280
What are you doing? Take it.

56
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,290
What's your name?

57
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,970
I don't have a name.

58
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,760
You don't have a name?

59
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,960
Even dogs on the street have names,

60
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,280
how can a person not have a name?

61
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,200
I was born in that shaman's house,

62
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,220
so I don't have a name.

63
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,300
You're the child of God, so you don't have a name...

64
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,130
Then let me give you a name.

65
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,690
You are like a little flower that blooms in winter.

66
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,570
Dongbaek. Seol Dongbaek.

67
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,300
How about I call you Seol Dongbaek?

68
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,700
What?

69
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,780
It suits you.

70
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,340
A name can decide a person's fate.

71
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,330
The child of God is born without a name

72
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,809
because of this.

73
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,290
Goodness.

74
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,320
Are you still waiting for Young Master?

75
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,070
Is he inside?

76
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,180
I told you he's not coming to see you today.

77
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,000
Do you like Young Master that much?

78
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,130
Why do you like someone who is known in the capital for being a scoundrel.

79
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,990
He's not like what the rumors say!

80
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,440
He even gave someone like me a name.

81
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,700
Anyway, there must be a reason why Young Master doesn't want to see you.

82
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,440
It's getting dark, go back.

83
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,350
You not only named the child of God,

84
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
you even got caught in a rumor with him.

85
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,490
Till when are you going to bring disgrace upon the Min family?

86
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,320
All I did was give a name to a nameless child.

87
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,250
This is bad.

88
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,920
Do you really not know why that child doesn't have a name?

89
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,250
A child who shouldn't have a destiny

90
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,940
suddenly has one now because he received a name.

91
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,440
That child will be in trouble now.

92
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,840
What?

93
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,190
A name can trap a person's life,

94
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,870
but I thought of it too simply.

95
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,380
You are a disgrace to our family!

96
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,630

97
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,030
Yes.

98
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,740
Send this letter to him for me.

99
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,760
Goodness.

100
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,760
What if Master finds out?

101
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,190
I have something I need to tell him.

102
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,130
Dongbaek,

103
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,610
I have something to tell you

104
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,010
so wait for me at the place where we met every day.

105
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,230
I missed you.

106
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,960
I missed you too my lord.

107
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,640
Dongbaek,

108
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,490
leave with me on New Year's Eve.

109
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,310
Let's go to a place where no one knows us,

110
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,040
just the two of us.

111
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,900
I'll go find you

112
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,880
so pack your luggage and wait for me.

113
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,120
Young Master! Bad news!

114
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,150
Master found out about your plan to elope with Dongbaek

115
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,490
and is about to kill him!

116
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,610
Dongbaek!

117
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,580
Please... don’t...

My lord!

121

Dongbaek!

122
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,090
Dongbaek...

123
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,060
I want to kill you right now

124
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,070
but this child needs you, so I will endure it for now.

125
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,430
If I hadn't met you, you wouldn't have suffered.

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,710
what would you have done?

129
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,710
I would've kept waiting.

130
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,780
From now on, let's do everything together one by one.

131
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,240
Don't ever turn your back on me again.

132
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,420
I'm not done talking yet

133
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,600
don't just leave me alone like this!

134
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,950
Your face is so pale.

135
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,120
I'm not feeling well today.

136
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,400
I'll go hug you after I finish my work.
