00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,030
I was born in that shaman's house,

9

What are you doing? Take it.

You're the child of God, so you don't have a name...

It suits you.

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,420
You not only named the child of God,

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,440
you even got caught in a rumor with him.

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,020
it's been a while since we last had dinner together,

do you want to eat together?

51
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,110
You want to have dinner at this hour?

52
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,810
All the restaurants are closed now,

53
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,909
let's eat another day.

54
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,090
Then... what about your house?

55
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,020
What?

56
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,110
Can we have dinner at your place?

57
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,390
There's nothing to eat at my house.

58
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,330
Seriously...

59
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,640
Have you fallen for someone else?

60

What?

61
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,940
Do you think I'm doing this because I'm hungry?

62
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,140
I'm doing this because I want to go to your house.

63

I want to go to your house today.

Let's go.

65
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,820
I noticed when I first came here,

66
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,590
that there's someone living in this home but it's so empty.

67
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,650
There's nothing at home,

68
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,680
and you don't have friends or family.

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,490
Did you wait for me all alone like this?

70
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,710
Because to me,

71
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,040
those things don't have meaning.

72
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,190

73

But this is different from my plan.

74
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,240
I started an entertainment company

75
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,720
because you were beautiful in your past life

76
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,800
so I thought you'd become a celebrity in this life.

77
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,550
I never thought you would pursue the Performance Planning Team.

78
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,820
I ended up in the Secretary Team though.

79
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,440
If I still haven't appeared in front of you,

80

I don't know I can't remember.

Don't take so much medicine.
