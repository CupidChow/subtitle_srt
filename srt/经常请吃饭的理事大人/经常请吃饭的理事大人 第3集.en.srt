Yes, I did

So what's your solution?

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Since the theme of the concert is closely related to the country,

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,090
I don't think it'll be appropriate to add more content.

If it was appropriate,

97
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,930
the ticket price wouldn't be twice the amount for a domestic concert.

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,450
I don't want to sleep alone.

168
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,150
Don't you want to be with me, too?

169
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,750
You must have lived a long life,

170
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,210
you’ve become more sensitive and observant.

171
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,980
Leave Seol Dongbaek’s body immediately.

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,290
Well, what should I do?

173
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,020
Isn't it enough that I'm cursed?

174
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,810
The Seol Dongbaek now doesn’t remember anything.

175
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,720
I don’t think your memory is complete either.

176
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,730
What?

177
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,760
Pull yourself together

178
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,800
if you don't want to hurt this child again like you did in your previous life.

179
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,450
What do you mean?

180
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,420
Seol Dongbaek suffered

181
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,200
because you named the child of God.

182
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,230
The one who started it should end it.

183
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm going to take care of this.

184
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,230
Had I never met you, I wouldn't have suffered like this.

185
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,670
I wish I could kill you right now

186
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,490
but because this child needs you, I'm bearing it for now.

187
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,380
Stop wasting time

188
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,710
or else it'll become really dangerous.

189
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,660
[On the next episode]

190
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,730
Hello, Director Min.

191
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,190
Is it okay to just let you be played in the palms of God?

192
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,660
Isn't he an artist who has totally gone downhill?

193
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,990
It seems like the company will give up on him soon.

194
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,090
It's too kind of Min Entertainment to still keep him.

195
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,340
He's old and despised but he still hasn't gotten it together.

196
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,050
His skills are also dropping, how is he so confident?

197
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,280
Is this also one of the curses?
