1
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,206
(It's true what they say.)

2
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:32,566
(The first time, it's a mistake.)

3
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:35,006
(The second time, it's carelessness.)

4
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,046
(The third time, it's on purpose.)

5
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:40,046
(Ultimately, I can't escape the truth.)

6
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,606
(I did what I did)

7
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:43,366
(because I'm a terrible person.)

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,286
Korn!

9
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:01,046
I won't let it end like this.

10
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,137
You want to throw away your life right here?

11
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,326
I have nothing else to lose, Rina.

12
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:09,566
I only have my life to give now.

13
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,006
Korn.

14
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,566
I didn't want anyone to die, you know?

15
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,686
Then how can I live with it?

16
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,326
Please, don't make me feel more terrible than I already do.

17
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:28,326
I told you it was fine.

18
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:32,126
Korn, come back here.

19
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,166
Don't do anything stupid!

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,886
(I know paying with my life is not enough.)

21
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:42,006
(There's just no other way this could end.)

22
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,486
(I don't expect you to forgive me.)

23
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,006
(I won't ask you to understand.)

24
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:46,846
(I just want to let you know I'm sorry,)

25
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:50,006
(and I'm too ashamed to face anyone again in my life.)

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,806
(Six Months Earlier)

27
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,886
- Sorry, I'm late.  - It's okay.

28
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:15,566
- You've been late like twice?  - Yes.

29
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:18,881
- Is everything okay?  - Yes, sure.

30
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:20,886
Everything is fine.

31
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,846
- Yes. Have you tasted the wine?  - Yes, it's fantastic.

32
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:33,846
I don't see the need to pay this much for nothing.

33
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:41,526
Mr. Kiat wants his children to have a connection with the royal family.

34
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:46,246
Does he want a connection or does he want to join their family?

35
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:52,206
I thought this party is for the princess to select her Prince Charming.

36
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:55,726
Madam,

37
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:59,846
try to guess which one of your grandchildren is the star.

38
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,926
Honestly, I don't approve

39
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:30,086
of my grandchildren competing against each other,

40
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:34,806
especially when they're competing for the same woman.

41
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:38,886
Look, the next CEO

42
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:43,246
had better be some outsider like you, for example.

43
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,966
I still have a long way to go, madam.

44
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,166
Don't think I don't know about the bribes.

45
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,606
Kiat's corruption

46
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,246
will ruin our company.

47
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:04,446
You need to warn him.

48
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:17,406
Sorry, Dad. Your Grace?

49
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:20,766
The lady and I picked up some wild honeycomb for you.

50
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,686
She did most of the work.

51
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,606
There's only one person who can go against Mr. Kiat.

52
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,646
I heard he's back in Thailand.

53
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,806
This is our opportunity to bring him in.

54
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:48,726
They say there's a world in one dish.

55
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:51,606
If you want to know someone, look at their food.

56
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:55,006
What we have here is our universe!

57
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,926
It's so good! Have some!

58
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:11,406
(The number you dialed is not responding.)

59
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,926
If he turns on his phone...

60
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:01,206
Something happened. I think it's not far.

61
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,646
What is it? What's going on?

62
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,486
These guys are blocking the road and won't let us go home.

63
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,086
They said there's a convoy or something.

64
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,246
What convoy?

65
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:56,846
I'm sorry, sir. You need to clear the path.

66
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,806
Let our VIP pass.

67
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,566
Excuse us, sir.

68
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,606
Please move. We're in a hurry.

69
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:14,526
This is a public road.

70
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:18,526
If we don't get to travel this road, no one can.

71
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,126
Let's sit down and block them right here.

72
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:22,566
Come on guys!

73
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,766
- We won't be bullied.  - Let's block them.

74
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:30,686
Who do you think you are?

75
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,246
Hi!

76
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,606
Hey!

77
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,446
So this is what the VIP looks like?

78
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,406
That means I must look like a TV star.

79
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:07,166
You're messing with me because you know it's me, right?

80
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,886
You're in disguise.

81
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,846
You're fake. The real VIP is here somewhere.

82
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:15,926
Who are you disguising as?

83
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:19,206
Look at you. If you had a veil on your face,

84
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,246
I would have thought you were hunting bees.

85
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:24,006
Move it. I'm on duty.

86
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:30,606
Watch out!

87
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,366
What's this?

88
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,126
Korn, don't!

89
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:56,166
Let me see you.

90
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,366
You put on your disguise to avoid the media.

91
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,366
That means the Choenitsarachai

92
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,006
are up to no good around here, aren't they?

93
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:13,646
No, they're not.

94
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:19,891
If you put on the effort to disguise yourself, it is a big deal.

95
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:21,766
You know it's a big deal.

96
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:23,766
Why would you stop someone from doing their job?

97
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:29,326
They would surely appreciate you risking yourself like this.

98
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:32,526
What did they give you

99
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,646
to make you so obedient?

100
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:36,246
You're one to talk.

101
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,006
Everything is a mess because of you.

102
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:42,646
Stop, stop!

103
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,286
I knew it.

104
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,366
There's only one person who has the guts to mess with us.

105
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,806
Dad!

106
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:55,246
I heard something happened, so I came to check it out.

107
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,526
If it wasn't for a certain someone,

108
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,166
it wouldn't have come to this.

109
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,206
The media probably figured out our plan by now.

110
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,726
Who started it, huh?

111
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,966
Do you want to fight?

112
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,366
Hey, Rina!

113
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,006
Did you wrestle someone?

114
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,246
Or was it a dog?

115
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,766
Don't ask. It's nothing.

116
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,526
Why aren't you with the Lady?

117
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:17,126
None of us was selected. There's no point.

118
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:24,766
I won't attend a matchmaking party like this again.

119
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:27,646
All of us are single.

120
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,846
If you don't end up together with Karn,

121
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:34,166
who would you choose from the three of us?

122
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:40,726
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:43,166
You're embarrassed.

124
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,686
A certain someone said,

125
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:50,046
"When I grow up, all of you are mine."

126
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:55,526
(You won't let me play. I'm mad at you now.)

127
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:58,286
When I grow up, don't chase after me.

128
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,926
Someday, I'll own this place.

129
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:08,606
I'll be Cinderella. I'll be the bride of this family.

130
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:12,606
Oh, you will? You think you're so pretty, huh?

131
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:18,286
Someday, you will kneel before me to propose.

132
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,126
I'm so scared.

133
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:23,206
You have big calves, Rina.

134
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,926
You're still kidding around at this age?

135
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:50,486
Don't mind them.

136
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:55,806
You want to be Cinderella?

137
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:59,366
I'll make your dream come true.

138
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:13,446
If you want us to stop joking and get serious,

139
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:17,366
do you mean you would dump the Lady and be Rina's husband?

140
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,966
If I ever get married,

141
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:31,166
you'd be the only one for me.

142
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:36,086
You choose Rina over the Lady?

143
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:38,486
I respect your spirit, bro.

144
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,766
If I lived with someone I didn't choose,

145
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,246
I won't be happy.

146
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,126
Well, let's go.

147
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,686
- Let's go.  - I feel sick in the stomach.

148
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:04,326
Karn, don't give Rina false hope.

149
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,446
We're watching you.

150
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:17,886
You must not refuse the Lady.

151
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,686
Won't you think about me

152
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,326
if I really get married to someone?

153
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:30,526
If you found a good woman who's better for you,

154
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:33,061
I'd rather not get in the way.

155
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:35,286
I want you to be happy.

156
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,606
Are you pushing me

157
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:44,644
because you'd be more satisfied if I dumped the Lady for you?

158
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,286
No, I wouldn't.

159
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:51,166
I want you to be the real star of the show.

160
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:56,446
The Lady likes these osmanthus flowers.

161
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:59,606
I just realized how good they smell.

162
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,406
I wonder,

163
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,566
what flower do you like, Rina?

164
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,846
Why have I never known?

165
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,046
I won't tell you.

166
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,206
If I did,

167
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,766
you wouldn't be curious.

168
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:34,246
So,

169
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:39,366
if I guessed it right, that means I know your heart.

170
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:41,326
Isn't that right?

171
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,326
I think the answer is in your perfume.

172
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:16,606
Karn never disappoints.

173
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:23,206
I like those guys better.

174
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:27,486
It feels warm to see my grandchildren together like when they were young.

175
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,646
You feel warm but uneasy.

176
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:38,166
Have you not heard?

177
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:40,166
They say

178
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:42,566
a family business

179
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:45,141
tends to end with the third generation.

180
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:49,046
If that's how it turns out, you can't blame the children.

181
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:52,046
It's our fault for not raising them well enough.

182
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:54,006
At least, we have Karn.

183
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,726
He's the apple that didn't fall far.

184
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:03,526
Choenitsarachai didn't get to where it was because of one man.

185
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:17,166
So this is what fancy people do to feel humble?

186
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:21,406
This is a personal trip of the royal family.

187
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:25,566
We're bringing the Lady out to find wild honeycomb.

188
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,406
Wild honeycomb? It looks more like you're bragging about your wealth.

189
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,966
You're aiming for the top. I think you have an eye on their wealth.

190
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:39,966
Look, people have different circumstances in their lives.

191
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:46,166
If you judge them from your own perspective, everything seems nonsense.

192
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:49,086
Like you did.

193
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:52,806
You made a big fuss out of the village entrance.

194
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:54,766
Others said it was nonsense.

195
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,606
You mean Rina?

196
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:05,606
I'd rather have a female pig for a girlfriend.

197
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,806
The way you run your mouth.

198
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:13,006
I wonder how you survived

199
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,406
and grew up to this point.

200
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,006
Dad!

201
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:27,126
- Dad!  - Yes?

202
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,286
Are you leaving already?

203
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:31,326
I am leaving.

204
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:33,326
See you at home when I get back from Phuket.

205
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,606
The deal is done and sealed.

206
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:39,086
I think I owe you a consolation party.

207
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:43,326
Consolation for what?

208
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:49,926
You got your heart broken today. Of course, I'd be there for you.

209
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:53,086
- Dad!  - Poor thing.

210
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:57,606
- It's not like that. You should worry about yourself.  - Why?

211
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:00,606
You're in the north, and you're going south all in a day.

212
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,646
Are you in the condition to do that?

213
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,326
I've been doing this job all my life. What would go wrong?

214
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:11,486
- Dad.  - Yes?

215
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,286
Where is the watch I bought you?

216
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,806
- Hey!  - I think I lost it overseas.

217
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,366
Dad!

218
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:27,486
- It's nothing.  - You're so forgetful. Will you remember your home?

219
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,366
I will.

220
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:35,286
Go home and tell your mom to cook something nice. I'll be home soon.

221
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,566
- Really?  - Yes. Have I ever hung out somewhere?

222
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,797
Come here.

223
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,966
My big foreheaded girl.

224
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,006
- Bye.  - Bye.

225
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,726
Give me your forehead.

226
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:50,486
On the cheek too.

227
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:52,446
The other side.

228
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:54,686
Can I kiss your forehead too?

229
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,006
Are you your mom?

230
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:00,886
You're salty.

231
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,406
I was sweating.

232
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,246
- I got to go.  - Bye.

233
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:06,686
- Bye.  - I'm off. I'll be home soon.

234
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,606
Come, give me another hug.

235
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,606
- Bye, Dad.  - Bye.

236
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,686
Bye, Dad.

237
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:25,126
Rina.

238
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,366
Uncle Chai's leaving already?

239
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:32,366
Yes, he has a job in Phuket.

240
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:34,566
I got to go too.

241
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:39,006
Have a safe trip then.

242
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,166
Call me when you get there.

243
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:44,526
I'll call you.

244
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:46,446
See you.

245
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:11,486
- Let me see your luggage.  - No. I told you there's nothing.

246
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,686
You're suspected of carrying illegal items.

247
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,565
There's nothing illegal. Give it to me.

248
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,326
Sir, are you high?

249
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,086
- No, I'm not.  - Your eyes are red.

250
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:21,526
- I didn't sleep. I came straight here.  - You're high.

251
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:23,166
You can't board the plane, sir.

252
00:22:23,286 --> 00:22:27,086
- I'm not high.  - Let me see your luggage.

253
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:30,546
Korn, what's going on?

254
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:32,886
- Let me see your luggage.  - You again, you rat.

255
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:35,126
What did you do this time?

256
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:39,846
What is this, sir?

257
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:42,726
- What is this?  - Don't open it.

258
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:45,406
Don't open it! Don't...

259
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,286
What's that?

260
00:23:09,853 --> 00:23:11,246
I spent all day catching them.

261
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:16,101
Korn, lucky they didn't kick you off the plane. You almost got in trouble.

262
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:18,886
It's his fault. He said I was high.

263
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,526
Look at you.

264
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,246
I would have said that too.

265
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,246
I just got red eyes.

266
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:29,086
- Escalator?  - Korn, don't act up on the plane, please.

267
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:31,846
If someone's filming, you will be in trouble.

268
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:33,286
Then I won't go.

269
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,126
- I'm not going.  - Korn!

270
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,726
You idiot!

271
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,895
Yes, Uncle. I'm in Bangkok now.

272
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:44,486
We caused trouble for the media. That's why they wanted to attack us.

273
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:47,966
Yes. I just left him when...

274
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:53,206
Uncle, I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

275
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:55,046
Korn.

276
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:58,326
- Korn, where are you going?  - Whoa!

277
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:02,046
Do you realize that the media's stalking you?

278
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:05,246
The hashtag "high rich man" is trending right now.

279
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:07,686
- Come home with me.  - No.

280
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,541
- Let's go.  - No.

281
00:24:09,652 --> 00:24:12,286
- Let's go.  - Can we not go together?

282
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:15,606
Can I go alone, please?

283
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,686
- Let's go alone.  - No. Come with me.

284
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:18,886
We'll meet at home anyway.

285
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:21,366
- Just go.  - You want to come home with me?

286
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,926
Okay.

287
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,646
- Smell this! I came from the mountain.  - Korn!

288
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:34,446
It's a long drive.

289
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:36,246
The air conditioner is cool.

290
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:39,686
Korn!

291
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:43,966
You're going to make me crash.

292
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:45,486
Just drive.

293
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,766
You're all grown up. So cool.

294
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,086
Drop it.

295
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,006
How long have you been back?

296
00:24:57,806 --> 00:24:58,966
A while.

297
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,566
What were you doing in Chiang Mai?

298
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:04,046
I have my business.

299
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:05,726
It's none of yours.

300
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,446
How long are you staying here?

301
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:11,886
I'll think about it.

302
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:22,766
Korn!

303
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:27,326
Now do you understand?

304
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:30,366
How annoying it is when someone keeps messing with you?

305
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,046
Hey, Korn!

306
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:40,886
- Get back in.  - Whoo!

307
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:46,766
- Do you want another one?  - Of what?

308
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:50,926
Fine. I'll stay still.

309
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:42,606
Welcome home!

310
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,406
You're still here?

311
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:51,206
Where do you want me to go? I've been here for a long time.

312
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:57,446
You have great patience.

313
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:12,566
Auntie, is this Mr. Korn?

314
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:15,166
Is he the one in the photos?

315
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:21,446
He's too strange. That's why he couldn't stay at home.

316
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:23,646
It's a shame.

317
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:42,486
Look at you.

318
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:44,766
What would everyone think?

319
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:52,246
Me? I'm a hipster. What does a dinosaur like you know?

320
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,206
A hipster?

321
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:56,246
You look like a junkie.

322
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,846
You look like you broke out of prison.

323
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:00,286
Yeah, right.

324
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:04,366
I'm not Mr. Kiat or Mr. Karn like someone around here.

325
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:10,486
You're the black hole of this family. Do you know that?

326
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:13,478
Can you be more like your brother?

327
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,686
You ran out of money, huh?

328
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:18,726
Your friend took your company.

329
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,606
Isn't that right?

330
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,446
Don't worry about that, Dad.

331
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:26,006
I didn't come home for you to raise me. I can take care of myself.

332
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:29,406
Everyone calls you the Insect King Socialite.

333
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:32,006
Reporters are calling us all over the place.

334
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,966
Stay home and do nothing. Don't show up anywhere.

335
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,646
Stop embarrassing me.

336
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:40,046
Understand?

337
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:45,206
I did well for myself, yet I get disrespected for a useless son like you!

338
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:51,286
Hey, you're a trade magnate, yet you want to be Father of the Year?

339
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,391
Stop pretending, Dad.

340
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:55,486
Korn, shut up!

341
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:58,446
How do you feel? Does the blood rush make you feel good?

342
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,966
- With me to keep your temper high, you won't get old, Dad.  - Korn!

343
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,683
I'm going to die early because of you.

344
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,966
Are you done talking to him, Uncle?

345
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,046
I can't keep up with him, that brat.

346
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:26,126
Did he agree to stay home?

347
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,046
Where could he go?

348
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,646
He's broke.

349
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:33,006
He has to stay. Why else was he in the jungle?

350
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:35,126
He's stressing me out.

351
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:41,806
Okay! Let's relieve your stress today, Uncle.

352
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:43,846
We're going all out. Don't slack off.

353
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:48,166
I get tired just thinking about it.

354
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:29,086
All right! I got you!

355
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,366
- Ka!  - Let me hold on to you, please. I miss you so much!

356
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:35,446
Wait. I'm naked. Can't you see?

357
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,646
Remove the towel. I want to see it.

358
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,046
- Do it.  - Do you want to see it?

359
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,206
I'd strip for a price. Can you afford to pay me?

360
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:49,806
Whoa! Uncle Kiat needs to know. Korn is a prostitute!

361
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,406
Stop it! I'm bad enough for this family as it is.

362
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,686
I love your video at the airport. You were so alert!

363
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:02,686
You're my idol.

364
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:09,086
You don't want to be an outcast. Avoid a problematic child like me, okay?

365
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:14,606
We share the same DNA. We're both outcasts.

366
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,126
We're the only two that suck in this house.

367
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:21,246
Take this!

368
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:27,526
Who could be as neat as Rina, Uncle Chai's kid?

369
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,286
You're envious. That's a sign of a problematic child.

370
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,206
Well, it's true.

371
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:37,326
Ever since Rina came along, I look awful to everyone.

372
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:40,446
So, she got married and moved in?

373
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:44,886
Not yet, but she claims to be the in-law and messes with everything.

374
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,846
She took your house too.

375
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:50,486
So that's why my clothes are gone.

376
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,726
I'll look in the other room.

377
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:29,846
Peeking much? You perverted kid!

378
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,566
You want to see it, don't you?

379
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:34,406
- Come here!  - Hey!

380
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:37,945
- You're too young to do that.  - Korn, let me go!

381
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:43,606
Rina!

382
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,246
Get out right now!

383
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:51,446
I thought you weren't married. Why are you in here?

384
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:54,686
- Married to whom?  - You and Karn are...

385
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:58,286
Karn moved out long ago. This is my room now.

386
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:00,326
The shirt you're wearing is mine.

387
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,886
That's why it's tight.

388
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:15,526
What's wrong with my eyes?

389
00:34:15,758 --> 00:34:18,086
I can't see anything! I'm in trouble.

390
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,566
Get out!

391
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,366
Idiot!

392
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:47,006
Ka!

393
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:50,806
You brat. Where did you go?

394
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:03,222
Ka, you troublemaker.

395
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:08,526
- Ka, stop, stop right now!  - Whoa!

396
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:11,726
Why did you take my underwear and condom?

397
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:14,126
You didn't bring any souvenirs and won't give me these?

398
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:17,246
Are you crazy? You want used underwear?

399
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,126
If you have a used condom, I'll take it.

400
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:21,406
Do you have one?

401
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,646
This is too much for you.

402
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:26,032
What did you get into? We need to have the talk. Give it back.

403
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,806
- No!  - Give it to me!

404
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:30,446
So you're back, my chaotic boy.

405
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:32,886
Auntie, deal with him, please!

406
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,286
Give it to me!

407
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:36,606
- What's with you kids?  - I'm off, bye!

408
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,286
- Ka!  - Stop right there!

409
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:41,406
Where are you taking her to mess around? She's just a kid.

410
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:44,166
No, she's too horny for a kid.

411
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,406
- Ka!  - What happened?

412
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:47,846
- Stop it.  - Where'd she...

413
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,846
You need to act your age.

414
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:52,326
Good morning.

415
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,006
Mr. Korn is not here, sir.

416
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,126
He packed up his stuff and went out.

417
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:18,886
What a waste of time.

418
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,806
Does this guy ever have manners?

419
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,086
Serve us the rice.

420
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:33,366
I'll take care of the meal here.

421
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:36,406
Aunt Malai and Madmee, you can leave and do what you need to do.

422
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:38,206
- Okay.  - Okay.

423
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:41,406
Here, Uncle.

424
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:45,246
You've burnt calories. Now you can eat until you can't anymore.

425
00:36:47,294 --> 00:36:48,606
Here.

426
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:53,686
Here, Uncle. Stir-fried sesbania flowers, your favorite.

427
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:56,086
Eat a lot of this.

428
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:01,246
You have a home here.

429
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,726
Will you stop acting homeless?

430
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:06,646
You caused trouble as soon as you got here.

431
00:37:06,798 --> 00:37:08,606
Aunt!

432
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:12,046
Can you give me a suspended sentence this time?

433
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,610
Don't punish me by forcing me to stay.

434
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,366
I'll be a good boy. I won't be naughty.

435
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:18,526
I won't cause any more trouble. I promise.

436
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:19,966
I'm not Kiat.

437
00:37:20,062 --> 00:37:22,366
Reputation is not all that I care about.

438
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:25,437
I don't want everyone to say you're a slacker.

439
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,566
The girls' parents won't give their blessing when you want to get married.

440
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:31,366
About that? Don't worry, Aunt.

441
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:33,806
Nobody's going to make a husband out of me.

442
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:37,846
Look, I never expect anything from you in our business.

443
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:43,126
I only expect my grandnephews from you. 
I believe in your genes.

444
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:44,278
Understand?

445
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,486
Get married and give me my grandnephews.

446
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,246
My nephews and nieces are slackers. I'm not satisfied.

447
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:53,526
I'll make better kids out of the next generation and have them work for me.

448
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,646
Aunt.

449
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:58,526
All I got is inferior genes.

450
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:01,446
Your grandnephews will be mutants.

451
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:07,486
Don't worry. I found superior genes to save our clan.

452
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:11,086
I'm confident in my niece-in-law.

453
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,446
Who is it?

454
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:27,481
Your cooking is the taste I missed, Aunt Na.

455
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:30,486
This is what home feels like.

456
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,726
Right, Coco? Want some?

457
00:38:34,134 --> 00:38:38,166
If I'd known you were coming back, I'd have cooked a lot more.

458
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,686
This is a lot already.

459
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:45,046
Coco, you went right to Korn, huh?

460
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,886
Korn, what are you doing here?

461
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:50,966
Your father was expecting you at home.

462
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:55,046
You were taking care of my house and left your mom.

463
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:58,646
I'm beginning to wonder whose womb you came out of.

464
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:07,566
Did Mr. Kiat like the stir-fried sesbania flowers I cooked?

465
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:09,286
You cooked it?

466
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:12,246
I knew it. I remember your style.

467
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:16,326
Uncle loved it. He almost ate it all.

468
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,966
Are you lonely? Are you?

469
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:24,246
- I only ate a little so I could eat with you.  - Really?

470
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,766
Are you really not lonely?

471
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:29,526
Really? I love you without you sweet-talking me.

472
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:31,778
- I'll get you a plate.  - Okay. Thank you.

473
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:34,091
- An empty plate.  - Mom?

474
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:38,086
- I'll put rice on it. Okay.  - Two scoops.

475
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:50,486
(I want you to marry Rina.)

476
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:52,926
(I know Kiat)

477
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:55,206
(loves and admires Rina so much.)

478
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,166
If you two get married,

479
00:39:57,366 --> 00:40:02,886
I want to see how heartbroken Kiat feels.

480
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:09,166
Aunt. You want me to steal my brother's girlfriend?

481
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:25,086
Here, sweetie.

482
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:28,326
- Two scoops of rice, correct?  - Yes.

483
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:30,766
Why are your scoops so small?

484
00:40:31,035 --> 00:40:34,166
- Finish this plate. I'll give you seconds.  - Thank you.

485
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,886
What are you looking at?

486
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:49,900
I was thinking of the Thai stew I had for breakfast. It had balls of fat.

487
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:52,526
What Thai stew?

488
00:40:58,278 --> 00:41:00,566
What's wrong with my eyes?

489
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,846
At home, Auntie.

490
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:08,406
I had pork belly served with striped beef shanks with rows of cellulite.

491
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:14,406
Rina, aren't you eating?

492
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:17,006
I'm full.

493
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:20,886
Rina.

494
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:25,406
Aunt Na, it's okay.

495
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,606
This is good. Give it to me. I'll eat it all.

496
00:41:29,747 --> 00:41:31,166
Easy-peasy.

497
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:33,366
Coco, want some?

498
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,286
Aunt Na, please let me stay here tonight.

499
00:41:38,526 --> 00:41:40,286
I want to wait for Uncle Chai tomorrow.

500
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,006
Of course, Korn.

501
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:43,446
Okay.

502
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,206
- Eat a lot.  - Let's eat.

503
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,406
Dad.

504
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:07,206
This is the first time Karn called me his sweetheart.

505
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,886
Dad.

506
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,646
All of them remembered that I vowed to be the daughter-in-law.

507
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,246
Karn even argued back. He said,

508
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:24,126
"If you want to be Cinderella,

509
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:27,206
I'll be your Prince Charming."

510
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,046
Dad.

511
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:35,846
If a man says this to me,

512
00:42:36,046 --> 00:42:38,486
how serious is he?

513
00:42:40,526 --> 00:42:42,206
Dad?

514
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:46,246
Karn is a gentleman, unlike...

515
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:56,564
Dad!

516
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,150
How is the weather in Phuket?

517
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:00,646
It's cold?

518
00:43:02,485 --> 00:43:05,726
You're tired? Okay.

519
00:43:26,846 --> 00:43:28,126
Korn!

520
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:31,126
Korn, what are you doing?

521
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:35,606
Don't mix your clothes with mine.

522
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:38,510
I put it all in the laundry machine to save water.

523
00:43:38,607 --> 00:43:40,528
You can't. Don't wash your clothes with mine.

524
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:44,846
What's wrong? I did your laundry for you, and yet you're scolding me.

525
00:43:45,046 --> 00:43:47,846
We're not close enough to share our laundry.

526
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,126
Sis.

527
00:43:50,446 --> 00:43:54,246
You're my brother's sweetheart. We're family, you know?

528
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:57,566
What? Who's your sis?

529
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:02,146
Your dad called and said he still has to stay in Phuket.

530
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:09,006
Then I won't stay. I'll go see him there.

531
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:16,526
Sis, your bras are stuffed tight.

532
00:44:20,846 --> 00:44:22,246
Tight?

533
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,486
This is normal, isn't it?

534
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:38,526
Korn.

535
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:42,926
You don't have to see me off. I can go by myself.

536
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:46,486
No, I want you to give my dad his pills.

537
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,406
Thanks.

538
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:52,846
Korn.

539
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,566
You changed your mind?

540
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,606
Where are you going after you're done in Phuket?

541
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:08,286
If you want to tell my dad, tell him I'm resting in peace.

542
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:10,566
Then good luck.

543
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:16,886
See you again at your wedding.

544
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,286
Make Karn yours in this life, not the next.

545
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:32,486
Bye.

546
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:34,926
Lock the doors for me, please.

547
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,966
I'm your butler now, huh?

548
00:45:59,366 --> 00:46:01,606
Cheers!

549
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:05,406
Finally! All of us are together.

550
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:10,126
You've been gone for a year.

551
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:12,086
Then you suddenly showed up.

552
00:46:12,865 --> 00:46:14,794
I missed you, okay?

553
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:19,166
- I missed the vibes, so I came rushing to you.  - Really?

554
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:23,646
That's right. My daughter is not here.

555
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,046
I'll enjoy myself for the day.

556
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:30,366
Rina sure is the party pooper.

557
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:34,646
You've been losing weight because you've been having dinner with her.

558
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:37,566
Who can be as wild as you are, Korn?

559
00:46:39,326 --> 00:46:41,526
You're protecting her? I can't mention her at all?

560
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:44,166
That's not a mention. That's an insult behind her back.

561
00:46:44,726 --> 00:46:46,206
It can't be helped.

562
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:48,666
Your father-in-law talked about her first.

563
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:52,406
Did you find out

564
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,006
what flower Rina likes?

565
00:46:57,486 --> 00:46:58,806
Did she tell you?

566
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,206
I just want to please her.

567
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:09,700
A neat, strict, and serious person like Rina

568
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:11,486
shouldn't be a romantic one.

569
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,166
The flower for her should be...

570
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:20,806
(Broom flowers.)

571
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:23,772
(The Pakakayor people used them to sweep the floor.)

572
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:28,006
(It's believed that they can sweep evil away.)

573
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:30,446
(They're not flowers to look at.)

574
00:47:30,677 --> 00:47:35,086
(You carry them with you to feel safe. That's what's for Rina.)

575
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:39,886
So, you want to mess with me?

576
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:51,246
Rina is a wand to ward off bad luck.

577
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:54,726
She gets rid of bad stuff around her father. That's how I got blown away.

578
00:47:56,806 --> 00:47:59,246
You sure talk a lot!

579
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:01,606
You were in the mountains for a year

580
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,366
and this is all you got?

581
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:05,566
Who told you?

582
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:08,846
Check this out. "Leu Tabo Ter Kae Se,

583
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:11,846
Beu Ter Pler Tue Kae Me".

584
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:13,526
Or something.

585
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:15,086
What did you say?

586
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:20,406
What I learned from the mountains made me run to you and Uncle Chai.

587
00:48:20,894 --> 00:48:24,006
Go on a trip with me. I'll show you what it means, okay?

588
00:48:24,206 --> 00:48:25,806
It's definitely not a good thing, Uncle.

589
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,206
Yes.

590
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:44,126
Your father is really pleased with yesterday's feedback.

591
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:45,926
He couldn't stop praising you.

592
00:48:47,566 --> 00:48:48,926
(Have you rested well?)

593
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:51,646
I have, Karn.

594
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:56,006
I think if the Lady dreams of you,

595
00:48:56,837 --> 00:48:59,246
that's the only way this is a success.

596
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:05,726
So, have you been in touch with her?

597
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:07,966
How could I make time for anyone?

598
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:11,366
I'm spending all my time talking to you.

599
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:15,966
So,

600
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:18,966
when are you coming home?

601
00:49:23,238 --> 00:49:25,238
I don't know when I'll be home.

602
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,686
I'll let you know when I find out.

603
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,326
Okay.

604
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:35,970
Take care of yourself, Karn.

605
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,406
Of course.

606
00:49:38,006 --> 00:49:40,086
Don't just do your job.

607
00:50:00,046 --> 00:50:02,246
I've never seen Karn in love with someone.

608
00:50:02,393 --> 00:50:04,606
They're serious about each other, aren't they?

609
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:09,606
I want to see Karn live happily, and not be a zombie like my dad.

610
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,980
Then you have to come back and help Karn with his job.

611
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,166
I ruin everything I touch. What can I do?

612
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:24,166
Your company wasn't ruined.

613
00:50:25,998 --> 00:50:27,566
Your friend

614
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:30,246
just sold the company to your aunt.

615
00:50:31,502 --> 00:50:32,726
What did you say?

616
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,526
So the one who fired me

617
00:50:35,806 --> 00:50:37,166
was my aunt?

618
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:43,886
Korn.

619
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:47,886
Your aunt wanted to make you see

620
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,787
that your friend can betray you at any time.

621
00:50:49,868 --> 00:50:51,926
She wants you home.

622
00:50:54,214 --> 00:50:57,206
She cut my future short. How's that different from stabbing me in the back?

623
00:50:58,005 --> 00:51:01,086
She made my life a failure. Is this what a family does?

624
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:04,366
Your aunt

625
00:51:04,805 --> 00:51:06,486
feared that Mr. Kiat

626
00:51:06,669 --> 00:51:09,686
would take your company and give it to Karn.

627
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:13,006
She wanted someone to counteract his powers.

628
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:17,766
If you join them, you can get your company back.

629
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:24,646
She wanted to declare war and used me to betray my brother and dad?

630
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,766
This is insane.

631
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,006
What the heck is this war for wealth?

632
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,966
Don't tell me you've already taken her side.

633
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:38,286
I don't know how to refuse her.

634
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:43,326
I only think that you should come back and help

635
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:46,846
because Karn alone can't go against your father.

636
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,670
I'd rather be an outcast, Uncle.

637
00:51:50,126 --> 00:51:51,886
I don't want to compete against anyone,

638
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,686
especially not my family.

639
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,686
Stop telling me to compete against Karn.

640
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:02,406
He's the only one who's like a family to me. He's not my enemy, understand?

641
00:52:18,326 --> 00:52:21,446
Dad, did you get your pills?

642
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:29,126
Are you drunk?

643
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,926
No, I didn't drink much.

644
00:52:34,104 --> 00:52:37,546
Dad, what did Korn tell you?

645
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,566
Don't be soft with him.

646
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:42,686
I already did.

647
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,606
(He's not coming home this time.)

648
00:52:44,806 --> 00:52:46,806
It will take years for him to cope.

649
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:49,829
Don't expect anything from someone like him, Dad.

650
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:58,686
(Your company wasn't ruined.)

651
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,766
Your friend

652
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,326
just sold the company to your aunt.

653
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:05,366
What did you say?

654
00:53:06,573 --> 00:53:08,006
So the one who fired me

655
00:53:08,414 --> 00:53:09,766
was my aunt?

656
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:14,126
(I want you to marry Rina.)

657
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:16,166
(I know Kiat)

658
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:18,606
(loves and admires Rina so much.)

659
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:20,426
If you two get married,

660
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:26,206
I want to see how heartbroken Kiat feels.

661
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:32,286
You're the black hole of this family. Do you know that?

662
00:53:33,616 --> 00:53:35,246
Can you be more like your brother?

663
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:37,246
I did well for myself,

664
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,886
yet I get disrespected for a useless son like you!

665
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:47,806
She wanted to declare war and used me to betray my brother and dad?

666
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:50,006
This is insane.

667
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:34,886
(Korn)

668
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:02,669
Hi.

669
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,526
Did you sleep?

670
00:56:06,012 --> 00:56:07,166
What are you doing?

671
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:12,166
Don't tell me you cooked this.

672
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,046
It's a farewell party.

673
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:16,166
This is my goodbye to you.

674
00:56:16,461 --> 00:56:17,726
I'm leaving.

675
00:56:17,846 --> 00:56:19,606
Where is Uncle Chai?

676
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:21,326
I haven't seen him.

677
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:23,906
I think he's sleeping.

678
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:26,926
Okay, I'll go fetch him.

679
00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:28,766
Take this.

680
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:32,446
Don't run off anywhere. I want one last meal together.

681
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:33,766
I won't go anywhere.

682
00:56:34,718 --> 00:56:36,406
I'll wait to try your cooking.

683
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,846
Uncle Chai?

684
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,366
Uncle?

685
00:56:48,711 --> 00:56:50,406
Come out and have breakfast.

686
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:52,886
Uncle?

687
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:58,966
(Four Missed Calls - Uncle Chai)

688
00:56:59,255 --> 00:57:00,646
He called me four times?

689
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:07,246
Uncle Chai?

690
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:12,646
Uncle?

691
00:57:14,494 --> 00:57:16,126
Uncle? Are you okay?

692
00:57:18,243 --> 00:57:19,406
Uncle?

693
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:23,286
- Uncle?  - Korn? What's wrong?

694
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:27,006
I don't know what's wrong. He won't answer the door or his phone.

695
00:57:27,766 --> 00:57:29,086
Uncle!

696
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:31,486
Miss, do you have the key?

697
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:33,006
I do.

698
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,512
Give it to me.

699
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:37,406
Uncle?

700
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:40,646
Uncle? Uncle Chai?

701
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:44,006
Uncle? Uncle Chai?

702
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:47,686
Uncle Chai? Are you okay? Uncle?

703
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:51,966
Uncle? Uncle Chai?

704
00:57:53,634 --> 00:57:55,166
Uncle Chai, wake up!

705
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:57,246
- Can you hear me, Uncle?  - Call an ambulance.

706
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:59,486
- Yes, sir.  - Call an ambulance, quick!

707
00:58:00,646 --> 00:58:01,886
Uncle!

708
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:06,166
Uncle, wake up! Stay with me!

709
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:13,326
I'm here for you, Uncle. Wake up!

710
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,606
Uncle!

711
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:18,806
- Uncle Chai?  - Karn, help me!

712
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:24,166
How do we tell his family?

713
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,846
You should call Rina and tell her.

714
00:59:39,301 --> 00:59:41,046
Maybe you should bring her here.

715
00:59:43,669 --> 00:59:45,366
They need to perform an autopsy.

716
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,566
The police asked me and some staff to stay for questioning.

717
00:59:53,045 --> 00:59:54,846
Can you go and bring her for me?

718
00:59:56,949 --> 00:59:58,406
I'll get you a helicopter.

719
01:00:04,022 --> 01:00:05,246
Is this okay?

720
01:00:06,886 --> 01:00:08,366
I think if it's you...

721
01:00:15,622 --> 01:00:16,806
Excuse me.

722
01:00:17,806 --> 01:00:22,246
We found these pills. Does the deceased have an illness?

723
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:31,126
These pills are for his heart disease, officer.

724
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,206
He's been taking these for years.

725
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:41,086
I'll tell the medical examiner to look for complications.

726
01:01:00,674 --> 01:01:02,918
What should I tell Rina?

727
01:01:44,182 --> 01:01:46,326
(Take this money and start a new company.)

728
01:01:46,438 --> 01:01:48,438
(You need it to get back on your feet.)

729
01:01:49,366 --> 01:01:51,886
(Consider me your life partner.)

730
01:01:59,606 --> 01:02:02,566
(Take this money and reach your finish line.)

731
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,286
(I'll be there to celebrate your success.)

732
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,286
- Are you going off to work?  - Yes.

733
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:16,704
Look, I bought some santols.

734
01:03:16,846 --> 01:03:20,486
I'll make grilled pork soup with santols, his favorite.

735
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:24,086
You're this good and he still chooses his job over you.

736
01:03:24,325 --> 01:03:26,325
I wouldn't blame you if you found a new boyfriend.

737
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:29,406
Seriously,

738
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:34,046
I don't remember when was the last time we had a meal together.

739
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:39,086
If Dad misses it this time,

740
01:03:39,364 --> 01:03:42,206
why don't we go and surprise him in Phuket?

741
01:03:42,453 --> 01:03:44,086
Let's give him a delivery.

742
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:47,126
- Right?  - Yeah. That's good.

743
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:00,406
You said you were going to Phuket?

744
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,606
Why are you here?

745
01:04:12,085 --> 01:04:13,446
What's wrong?

746
01:04:18,478 --> 01:04:20,006
Something happened to Uncle Chai.

747
01:04:26,638 --> 01:04:27,966
What happened to him?

748
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:41,486
The autopsy came back.

749
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:42,846
He didn't die of heart failure.

750
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:45,766
He died of toxins in the pills.

751
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:47,606
He was poisoned?

752
01:04:47,726 --> 01:04:51,686
He was poisoned. Don't you think it's murder?

753
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:55,126
Can you really cope with the truth

754
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,406
that your father wasn't the good man you think he was?

755
01:04:57,566 --> 01:04:59,726
Where should I put this wreath?

756
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:04,006
I've always wanted to see old people get disrespected!

757
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:08,686
They're pretending. They act kind but secretly are at each other's throats.

758
01:05:08,886 --> 01:05:11,326
Are you satisfied now? Rina's head is all over the place!
