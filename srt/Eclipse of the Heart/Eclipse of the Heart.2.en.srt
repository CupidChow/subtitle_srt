1
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:59,643
- You want to fight?  - Do you realize the media's stalking you?

2
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,391
The hashtag "high rich man" is trending right now.

3
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:06,806
They call you Insect King Socialite. You're the black hole of this family.

4
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,806
Can you be more like your brother?

5
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:11,966
If I ever get married,

6
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,606
you'd be the only one for me.

7
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:19,446
She wanted to declare war and used me to betray my brother and dad?

8
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,206
This is insane.

9
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:25,886
- Uncle Chai!  - Uncle!

10
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,486
Uncle, wake up! Stay with me!

11
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,606
How do we tell his family?

12
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:40,566
- Are you going off to work?  - Yes.

13
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,366
Look, I bought some santols.

14
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:45,166
I'll make grilled pork soup with santols.

15
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:46,926
It's his favorite.

16
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:50,566
You're this good and he still chooses his job over you.

17
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,966
I wouldn't blame you if you found a new boyfriend.

18
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:56,003
Seriously,

19
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,686
I don't remember when was the last time we had a meal together.

20
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,406
If Dad misses it this time,

21
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,846
why don't we go and surprise him in Phuket?

22
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:10,566
Let's give him a delivery.

23
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:13,886
- Right?  - Yeah. That's good.

24
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:26,726
You said you were going to Phuket?

25
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,029
Why are you here?

26
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:39,766
What's wrong?

27
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,366
Something happened to Uncle Chai.

28
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,486
What happened to him?

29
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:58,966
Karn told me to bring you there.

30
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,046
Bring an outfit for Uncle Chai.

31
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,486
You're not kidding, aren't you?

32
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:08,766
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:14,252
We

34
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,766
couldn't save him.

35
00:05:57,965 --> 00:05:59,926
Don't tell my mom yet.

36
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,926
She can't find out yet.

37
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,846
Dad.

38
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:35,326
Dad!

39
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:46,886
Why did you leave me?

40
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:50,046
We were talking last night.

41
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:58,246
Why did you leave me?

42
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,326
Stay strong.

43
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:07,926
Karn, what did the doctor say?

44
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,926
Did he suffer?

45
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:14,766
I think he went in peace.

46
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:18,526
Don't worry about anything.

47
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,046
I was talking to him last night.

48
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:29,686
He didn't have any sign of illness.

49
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,046
He didn't like to dress too well.

50
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:46,286
He said these buttons were too tight.

51
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,326
Are these the pills the victim used regularly?

52
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,046
I don't know, officer.

53
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:29,126
All I know is he just received this set of pills from someone.

54
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,086
Who was it?

55
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:34,806
It's him.

56
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,926
Mr. Korn.

57
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:41,526
Yes?

58
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,566
Excuse me.

59
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,046
You were the one who found the body this morning, right?

60
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:49,686
Yes, I was. I found him.

61
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,566
I was going to wake him up for breakfast.

62
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:56,686
Did you suspect anything? Is that why you went to wake him up early?

63
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:01,286
I was just having a farewell meal before we parted ways.

64
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,766
The autopsy came back.

65
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,366
The victim didn't die of heart failure.

66
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,166
He died of toxins in the pills.

67
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,246
Was he poisoned?

68
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:16,686
I heard you brought these pills to him.

69
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,206
He was poisoned?

70
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:24,286
The police said there was rodenticide in the pills.

71
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,966
Someone murdered Mr. Chai.

72
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:29,686
Are you crazy?

73
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:31,366
Chai didn't even have an enemy.

74
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:35,926
What's worrying is that Mr. Korn is now a suspect.

75
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:42,326
He was the one who gave him those pills.

76
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:49,086
My son got in trouble again.

77
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:52,806
Did he do anything stupid this time?

78
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,206
He couldn't have done it. He loved Chai more than his own dad.

79
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:05,766
Sorry.

80
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:10,526
I mean, he couldn't have been involved.

81
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,166
Anyway,

82
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:14,326
send him a lawyer.

83
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:17,126
Keep Korn out of this case, no matter what.

84
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:20,326
It's a shame Chai was gone too soon.

85
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,806
We were just with him.

86
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:29,766
Make an arrangement to transport his body to Bangkok.

87
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:32,486
I'll pick him up myself.

88
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,046
Yes, sir.

89
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:50,606
When did you last see the victim?

90
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,406
Why did he call you repeatedly during the night?

91
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:58,046
I went out on a boat with the fishermen at night.

92
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,726
I didn't know he called me.

93
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:04,886
He might've been worried or might've been asking for help. I'm not sure.

94
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,846
Did you open the pill case at all?

95
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:09,806
Why would I open it?

96
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,806
The autopsy said the victim died of heart failure,

97
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:18,646
but we found an unusually high level of potassium chloride.

98
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:22,926
It might have caused his heart to fail.

99
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,726
You can take my fingerprints.

100
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,046
I never touched any of those pills.

101
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:32,686
I loved Uncle Chai like a father. I'd never hurt him.

102
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,526
- Good morning, Captain.  - Yes?

103
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,790
I'm a lawyer. I'm here to represent Korn and Isara Company.

104
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:47,086
His father sent me here.

105
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:53,046
If you want additional information, I'm willing to cooperate.

106
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:54,726
Yes.

107
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:04,366
What is it, sir?

108
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:05,886
Is Chai here yet?

109
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,367
He's on the way.

110
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:09,894
He'll arrive in about 20 minutes.

111
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,046
Tell them to wait.

112
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,006
I'll pick him up and deliver him to the temple.

113
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,726
Yes, sir.

114
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,766
Sir.

115
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,526
Things are more complicated than you think.

116
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:35,246
The authority refused to take the bribe.

117
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:39,406
If we can't make the payment as we agreed,

118
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,526
we won't be able to open the golf club.

119
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:49,206
Was Chai poisoned because of that money?

120
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:51,806
Maybe

121
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,606
the money wasn't even stolen.

122
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,606
I think he poisoned himself to avoid punishment.

123
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:02,606
I just found out about this.

124
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,726
Fifty million of our golf club's money in England is missing.

125
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,566
Combine that with the stolen bribe,

126
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,366
that makes it 90 million.

127
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:42,486
Thank you for everything, Chai.

128
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,006
If my family or I have ever wronged you,

129
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,966
intentionally or unintentionally,

130
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,566
please forgive us.

131
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,406
You took care of us for a long time.

132
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,126
You can rest easy now.

133
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,926
I'll protect

134
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,386
and cherish your family like my own.

135
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:11,206
We're family, after all, Chai.

136
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:42,166
Everyone has paid him respect. Should we put him in the casket?

137
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,086
What do you say?

138
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:52,566
I think we should wait for Uncle Kiat. He's not here yet.

139
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,726
He should have been here by now.

140
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:00,406
Don't wait.

141
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,365
I think my dad hasn't come to terms with it yet.

142
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:07,686
Then,

143
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,486
you can proceed.

144
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:12,206
I understand.

145
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:42,726
You're hiding here because you can't face Rina, right?

146
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,366
Of course.

147
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,926
She must think I killed her dad.

148
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:53,006
If the evidence says something else was put in the pills,

149
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,646
Rina should be a suspect too.

150
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:57,926
Who would suspect her?

151
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,926
That's his own daughter.

152
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,086
Now you're taking the blame for just delivering the pills to him.

153
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:08,806
I'm not rubbing it in or anything,

154
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,206
but you sure have bad luck.

155
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,046
I think someone is trying to frame you.

156
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:18,566
Uncle Kiat doesn't have the guts to show up.

157
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,423
I think someone intentionally framed you

158
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,646
to destroy your future.

159
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:29,606
Don't give up, bro.

160
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:58,806
Let's go home.

161
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:04,766
I can't leave Dad alone.

162
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,446
This is not his home.

163
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:20,766
I think you should worry about your mother.

164
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,846
Take her home to get some rest.

165
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,126
I'll drive you home.

166
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:22,246
Go home and tell your mom to cook something nice. I'll be home soon.

167
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,406
- Really?  - Yes. Have I ever hung out somewhere?

168
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,486
Come here.

169
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,606
This is the sun.

170
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,326
It shines like my name.

171
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,766
If I hadn't stormed out that night,

172
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,046
you'd still be talking to me.

173
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,486
It's my fault. I lost my temper with you.

174
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,726
It's nonsense.

175
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:43,406
We were arguing about someone else.

176
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:48,606
I feel like I'm so darn useless.

177
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,526
You must be so disappointed in me.

178
00:21:55,598 --> 00:22:01,366
"Leu Tabo Ter Kae Se Beu Ter Pler Tue Kae Me."

179
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:06,806
You want to know what that means?

180
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,886
"One string of yarn can't make a shirt."

181
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,166
"One grain of rice can't make a meal."

182
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,006
This is what I learned from the mountains and wanted to tell you.

183
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:42,366
I know now

184
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,166
how we can never be alone.

185
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:51,126
My life was so good when I had you.

186
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,526
You and Karn

187
00:22:56,696 --> 00:22:58,966
made me know what family is.

188
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,406
I had a place to come home to like everyone else.

189
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:08,846
I'm such an idiot.

190
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,646
I couldn't even save you.

191
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:31,646
Hello, Mom.

192
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:37,606
I'm staying with Dad at the temple.

193
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:42,726
Don't worry. Korn is with me.

194
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:50,446
You can go to bed. I'll come home soon.

195
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:54,646
Yes.

196
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:06,997
Morning.

197
00:25:18,526 --> 00:25:20,966
I'm serving this to you as promised.

198
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,646
You don't have to eat clean anymore.

199
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,366
You can eat whatever you want.

200
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,846
How many of these pills do you need to take after breakfast?

201
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:46,566
Miss Rina didn't tell me.

202
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:48,206
I'll need to check the labels.

203
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,086
Dad.

204
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:59,526
You missed Uncle Chai's funeral because of the autopsy, didn't you?

205
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:03,766
He betrayed me.

206
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,406
That means he didn't want me there.

207
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:20,846
Why did the police conclude he committed suicide?

208
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,326
Do you really believe

209
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:26,406
that someone like Uncle Chai betrayed you?

210
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:30,046
He might have had second thoughts about that piece of land as I did.

211
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:32,206
He didn't take that money for himself.

212
00:26:33,998 --> 00:26:36,246
He took the money for the bribe as evidence

213
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,286
of my corruption!

214
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:43,286
I don't understand.

215
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,846
What did he do that for?

216
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:50,286
He wanted to remove me as the CEO.

217
00:26:51,422 --> 00:26:53,006
Chai was a double agent.

218
00:26:55,286 --> 00:26:56,446
Kamalas forced him

219
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:58,926
to betray me.

220
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,126
He knew I wouldn't let him get away.

221
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:06,766
He committed suicide to avoid punishment.

222
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,166
That's nonsense, Dad.

223
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:14,166
If it were anyone else, I'd understand. But this is Uncle Chai.

224
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:21,446
See for yourself.

225
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:24,206
He took 50 million out of our overseas account.

226
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:27,766
Maybe Kamalas was blackmailing him.

227
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,566
That's why he changed his mind,

228
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:31,486
and took the money for the bribe instead.

229
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:39,966
Your aunt wanted to take me down by any means necessary.

230
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,046
It's a good thing he died.

231
00:27:43,414 --> 00:27:44,766
Otherwise, I'd have

232
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:46,766
killed him myself.

233
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:57,926
Mr. Kiat specifically asked

234
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,425
that I make arrangement

235
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,846
surrounding Mr. Chai Paphawadee's death.

236
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:07,686
The local police concluded that Mr. Chai committed suicide.

237
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,366
Who committed suicide?

238
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:20,366
We found rodenticide in every of his pills.

239
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:22,446
We found no signs of violence or trespassing,

240
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:25,086
which would have suggested another person was there.

241
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:30,086
It's believed that he killed himself to avoid punishment for scamming.

242
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:34,086
It's not true.

243
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,246
It's impossible.

244
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:39,046
My dad didn't scam anyone.

245
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:42,206
Suicide?

246
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:43,886
There's no way.

247
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:47,046
I wasn't even informed of the autopsy result.

248
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,126
This is injustice.

249
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:54,326
I came to tell you there was harm to the firm, pressing charges or not...

250
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,366
I won't accept this. He was poisoned.

251
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:00,326
Don't you think it's murder?

252
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,166
Who killed my husband?

253
00:29:06,597 --> 00:29:10,446
It's impossible he swapped those pills himself.

254
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:12,246
I saw it with my own eyes.

255
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:14,406
When my dad took those pills,

256
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:17,006
we were on a video call.

257
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:21,166
He surely didn't know there was rodenticide in them.

258
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:23,566
My dad didn't kill himself.

259
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,526
He was killed.

260
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:28,686
Yet you're still saying he committed suicide?

261
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:32,166
We proved the truth with the evidence we have.

262
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,773
You don't know my father.

263
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,126
That's why you can say that.

264
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,574
My father was a good man.

265
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,006
Then you have to tell me where the missing 90 million went.

266
00:29:44,142 --> 00:29:47,206
If you don't believe that to be the reason he killed himself,

267
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:51,046
you have the right to request the case to be reopened with new evidence.

268
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:10,286
(We found rodenticide in every of his pills.)

269
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:12,369
(We found no signs of violence or trespassing,)

270
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:15,126
which would have suggested another person was there.

271
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:19,766
It's believed that he killed himself to avoid punishment for scamming.

272
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:21,366
Yes, deputy.

273
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:24,966
I'm Mr. Kiat's lawyer, sir.

274
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:26,886
He needs to discuss with you about something.

275
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:30,766
Why are they trying to twist it?

276
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:34,078
I think someone is trying to frame you.

277
00:30:34,404 --> 00:30:37,286
Uncle Kiat doesn't have the guts to show up.

278
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:39,566
I think someone intentionally framed you

279
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,806
to destroy your future.

280
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,674
(Missed Calls - Uncle Chai)

281
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,686
(What were you trying to tell me?)

282
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:04,541
Miss Rina? Mr. CEO. Miss Rina!

283
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,766
I need to talk to you, Uncle.

284
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:11,686
Are you aware of the autopsy result?

285
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:19,606
I have a meeting with my staff.

286
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:22,366
I think they're waiting for me.

287
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:24,046
I got to go.

288
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:38,606
My dad was poisoned.

289
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:43,166
Why does everyone say he killed himself?

290
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,126
I want to ask Chai

291
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:56,646
how he could do this to me.

292
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,646
So you didn't attend his funeral

293
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:04,446
because you're angry at him?

294
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:07,701
What did he do behind my back?

295
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:10,565
Should I be angry?

296
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:13,766
My dad never scammed anyone.

297
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:16,806
He wouldn't even have known what to do with that money.

298
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:22,206
He was falsely accused.

299
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:25,566
I know

300
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:29,686
Chai was a hero to you.

301
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,406
He was a good father.

302
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:44,326
He was a great friend to me.

303
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,566
That's why he was ashamed of himself.

304
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:52,006
He couldn't bear to face us.

305
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,966
My dad would never have run from the truth.

306
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,966
He might have done it out of passion.

307
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:07,246
If he had thought carefully,

308
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:10,686
he wouldn't have done that.

309
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:17,246
You believe my dad killed himself too, Karn?

310
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:21,766
I want the truth to be proven.

311
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:31,926
If you want to dig it up,

312
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:34,646
can you really cope with the truth

313
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:37,726
that your father wasn't the good man you think he was?

314
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:43,366
You judged my father, thinking it was his fault.

315
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,406
You don't even want to give him a chance.

316
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,166
Rina.

317
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:55,126
I have

318
00:33:57,712 --> 00:33:59,526
known your dad for more than half my life.

319
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,206
That's longer than your whole life.

320
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:12,806
You think this is easy for me?

321
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,526
If everything my dad did to protect you

322
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:20,846
failed to make you trust him,

323
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:25,526
my words would never mean anything to you.

324
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:28,486
If everything he did failed to win your heart,

325
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:32,006
my father and I are nothing to you.

326
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:39,166
One day you'll realize

327
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,406
that you're wrong.

328
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,046
I was wrong to think I know you well.

329
00:34:55,422 --> 00:34:58,766
It turns out I barely even know the real you.

330
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,006
I can't believe

331
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:08,846
you'd have done this to my dad.

332
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:38,486
Where are you taking his stuff to?

333
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:43,046
The company has to submit everything. All of it is evidence.

334
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:47,006
What about personal items?

335
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:50,686
The police returned his phone and wallet. Where are they?

336
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,646
They're still to be used as evidence for the scamming case.

337
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,286
We have to keep them.

338
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,566
Instead of trying to blame him,

339
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:03,966
you should find the real killer.

340
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:07,006
There's no killer.

341
00:36:07,685 --> 00:36:09,526
There was a cowardly thief,

342
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,846
who wouldn't admit what he did.

343
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,646
If it's proven that my father didn't take the money,

344
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:17,766
you will be the first one I sue.

345
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:26,566
Worry about yourself first.

346
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:53,726
(They'd surely appreciate you risking yourself like this.)

347
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,046
What did they give you

348
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,246
to make you so obedient?

349
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:12,446
Your name is Kiat.

350
00:37:15,157 --> 00:37:17,286
It means honor. You should honor others.

351
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:19,366
You're not just ignoring.

352
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:23,006
You're even adding insult to someone's injury.

353
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,566
Why do you have such a soft spot for Chai, Sister?

354
00:37:30,126 --> 00:37:32,686
That whole family has always been good to us.

355
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,606
We should respect them.

356
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:39,286
I wondered

357
00:37:39,886 --> 00:37:41,366
why Chai

358
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:43,726
was sucking up to you.

359
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:46,966
Maybe it's because

360
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:51,618
he took that 40 million bribe.

361
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:54,446
What bribe?

362
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,726
Don't even ask.

363
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,966
You know why Chai took the easy way out.

364
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:05,486
It's probably because you pressured him.

365
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:11,886
You're busy destroying someone else's life.

366
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,505
That's why you can't retire.

367
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:18,846
Do you want to enjoy a peaceful life like a nun

368
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:23,006
or do you want to take control of the CEO?

369
00:38:37,806 --> 00:38:40,366
It's late. No one else is coming.

370
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:42,966
Let's go inside. There are mosquitoes here.

371
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:44,726
Let's go.

372
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,646
We're here.

373
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:50,806
Sorry, we're late.

374
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:55,486
Mr. Kiat still can't make it?

375
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:00,286
He hasn't recovered from hypertension.

376
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,926
It's fine, Mom.

377
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,134
Just forget those who aren't here.

378
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:08,886
We'll welcome those who are willing to come.

379
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:24,526
Mr. Kiat sent you. I think he feels bad he can't come.

380
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:27,846
Maybe he's just afraid of people talking.

381
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:31,166
It's not like that, Rina.

382
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:32,926
My dad isn't angry.

383
00:39:33,477 --> 00:39:38,246
He wanted me to tell you he's not looking to press charge or blame him.

384
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:41,446
He even forgave Uncle Chai.

385
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:44,606
What right does your dad have to forgive mine?

386
00:39:44,957 --> 00:39:46,726
My dad didn't do anything wrong.

387
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:51,006
He didn't take that 90 million.

388
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:55,046
That money means nothing compared to what he did for the company. We know.

389
00:39:55,365 --> 00:40:00,846
We don't hold any grudges, and we act like it didn't even happen.

390
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:05,086
Where should I put this wreath?

391
00:40:07,926 --> 00:40:09,126
I'll take it.

392
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:26,686
Should we admire you slapping us in the face, then patting us on the back?

393
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,966
You say you're relieving his debt.

394
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,846
It's more like you're drowning us in debts of favor.

395
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:37,766
Don't pretend to love me.

396
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:40,931
Uncle Kiat still suspects my dad of backstabbing.

397
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:44,166
That means he never trusted my dad.

398
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:48,526
Otherwise, he'd be trying to find out who killed him.

399
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:51,437
He wouldn't be accusing my dad of betraying him.

400
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:54,326
My dad is not a service dog,

401
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,586
who can die for you for nothing.

402
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:58,526
- Rina.  - Mom.

403
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:01,566
They are the ones who owe Dad their lives.

404
00:41:01,966 --> 00:41:03,406
Calm down, Rina.

405
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:04,766
Karn.

406
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,246
It will not end this way.

407
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,206
I'm keeping Dad's body.

408
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,166
Take a video.

409
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:20,726
I'll send it to Uncle Kiat.

410
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:23,846
Start now.

411
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,726
In a hundred days,

412
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:33,446
I'll find out who killed my dad.

413
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:36,886
I'll prove he didn't kill himself.

414
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,646
If you have evidence

415
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,046
of my dad taking that 90 million,

416
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:44,566
I'll pay you back to the last dime.

417
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:47,846
However, if I can prove he didn't do it,

418
00:41:49,198 --> 00:41:51,006
the day we cremate him,

419
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:54,646
Uncle Kiat has to kneel before my dad and apologize right here.

420
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,646
- Rina, don't take it too...  - Mom!

421
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:03,486
Someone who already died

422
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:05,806
can't seek justice for himself.

423
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:08,286
We have our pride.

424
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:11,117
Don't accuse my dad of being evil.

425
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:13,726
My father was a good man. He didn't do anything wrong.

426
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:15,246
If you admit this,

427
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:17,526
it's the only way to make it up to him.

428
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:21,726
Good!

429
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:25,686
Good! That's more like it!

430
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:28,646
Stop associating yourself with these fakers.

431
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:30,614
I'll tell you something.

432
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:34,275
The fact you risked your life to help these guys means nothing,

433
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:36,446
it's worth nothing to them.

434
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:39,326
Give it to me.

435
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:41,966
This video,

436
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,286
I'll send it to my family's group chat myself.

437
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:46,006
I'll even put it on my Facebook.

438
00:42:46,126 --> 00:42:49,606
Dad and his siblings, who don't have the guts to show up,

439
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,526
can prepare their knees.

440
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,726
They will kneel before Uncle Chai to apologize.

441
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:58,286
I've always wanted to see old people get disrespected!

442
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,326
You sure are the daughter of a fighter like Uncle Chai.

443
00:43:05,446 --> 00:43:06,686
You're awesome.

444
00:43:14,738 --> 00:43:16,126
This is so satisfying.

445
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:20,726
Did my dad send this wreath?

446
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:22,966
He didn't.

447
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,861
Who did?

448
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:33,686
You can go inside.

449
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:45,326
Wait.

450
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,766
Are you so satisfied?

451
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:06,246
Why did you send this wreath?

452
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:10,206
I just want to see who Rina loves more

453
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,846
between Uncle Chai and our dad.

454
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:13,726
Dad already forgave Rina.

455
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,406
You ruined everything.

456
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:17,886
Does Dad know how to love someone?

457
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:22,046
His own son is treated like a dog. He was just his employee.

458
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:23,806
You think Dad actually loved him?

459
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:27,166
You're acting on your jealousy right now?

460
00:44:28,445 --> 00:44:31,566
I just want Rina and Dad to see each other for what they are.

461
00:44:31,726 --> 00:44:33,566
They're pretending with each other.

462
00:44:33,861 --> 00:44:37,006
They act kind, but secretly they're at each other's throats.

463
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:39,926
Are you satisfied now? Rina's head is all over the place!

464
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:43,413
Stop causing more trouble for Rina.

465
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:45,606
Her father just died.

466
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:08,966
You didn't have to take it this far to make Rina and Kiat fight.

467
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:14,926
This is a step to make her your niece-in-law.

468
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:17,806
It's like how you made Uncle Chai take your side.

469
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,566
My method is to make them realize.

470
00:45:21,814 --> 00:45:24,486
I don't go hardcore as you do.

471
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:28,205
What about buying out my company?

472
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:31,206
You made me fall out with my partners. Is that "softcore"?

473
00:45:32,206 --> 00:45:33,806
Uncle Chai told me everything.

474
00:45:35,404 --> 00:45:38,206
You want to take down my dad but don't want to show your face.

475
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:42,766
That's why you used someone else and made Dad thinks Chai betrayed him.

476
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:46,798
Are you accusing me of pressuring Chai to kill himself?

477
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:50,806
I have no faith in anyone who values money.

478
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:55,064
Why don't you think

479
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:58,486
your dad lied about that 90 million

480
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,206
and told everyone it was missing?

481
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:05,046
He's scared of me replacing him with Chai as CEO.

482
00:46:05,302 --> 00:46:08,806
He set up Chai to discredit him, accusing him of scamming.

483
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:13,446
That poison might have even come from your father.

484
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,166
But his plan backfired

485
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,526
because you're now a suspect.

486
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,166
You don't have to manipulate me.

487
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:27,566
I'll take their masks off

488
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,646
and find out who all of you really are.

489
00:46:39,606 --> 00:46:42,606
Miss Rina handed in her resignation letter this morning.

490
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:45,246
Here it is.

491
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:55,406
(Resignation Letter)

492
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,326
It's fine.

493
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:08,886
I really can't keep someone obedient.

494
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:11,486
Sir.

495
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,366
We're now missing a marketing communication staff

496
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:16,606
and an operational staff.

497
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:21,206
I think we need someone to fill in the vacant COO position.

498
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:24,486
At least, put someone as acting COO,

499
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:27,486
so our work can proceed.

500
00:47:29,206 --> 00:47:30,366
There's no need.

501
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,492
Rina.

502
00:47:38,717 --> 00:47:40,046
Where are you?

503
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,806
Why did you quit without telling me?

504
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,806
I'm in Phuket, Karn.

505
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,206
What are you doing in Phuket?

506
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:50,046
I'm here to find out about my dad.

507
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:52,382
(I'll try to reopen the case.)

508
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:54,534
I gave myself a hundred days.

509
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:56,966
I won't be able to come to work for a while.

510
00:47:57,557 --> 00:47:59,557
My dad is the most important right now.

511
00:47:59,926 --> 00:48:01,486
Who are you with?

512
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:03,366
Are you safe?

513
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:05,286
I'm perfectly safe.

514
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:07,406
(I've arrived at the hotel.)

515
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:10,526
I want to see where it happened for myself.

516
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,446
I'll tell you what I find out.

517
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:14,726
Goodbye.

518
00:48:15,797 --> 00:48:17,726
Wait, Rina...

519
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:44,686
Give me my dad's usual room.

520
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:46,982
That room is...

521
00:48:49,822 --> 00:48:51,246
Yes.

522
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,726
Yes.

523
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,686
The company has reserved that room.

524
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,526
It's only for staff and family.

525
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:05,766
You've resigned. You're no longer our staff.

526
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:10,006
- Thank you.  - I'm sorry.

527
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:19,886
Fine! Is this how you want it? You're on.

528
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:26,366
(I'll find out who killed my dad.)

529
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:28,006
(I'll prove)

530
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,646
(he didn't kill himself.)

531
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:31,646
(If you have evidence)

532
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:33,798
(of my dad taking that 90 million,)

533
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:35,886
(I'll pay you back to the last dime.)

534
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,126
(However, if I can prove he didn't do it,)

535
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:40,206
(the day we cremate him,)

536
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:43,606
(Uncle Kiat has to kneel before my dad and apologize right here.)

537
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:48,446
I've been letting her off.

538
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:50,926
Instead of appreciating it,

539
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,326
she got even more carried away.

540
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,910
She's trying to twist it

541
00:49:56,372 --> 00:49:58,086
as a murderer, sir.

542
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,846
She wants to cover up for her dad

543
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:03,366
stealing the company's money.

544
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,366
I think what she's doing

545
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:08,886
is not cool at all.

546
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,326
Mister.

547
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:20,286
I want to ask you something.

548
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:22,726
Before my dad died, he came to Phuket.

549
00:50:22,926 --> 00:50:24,206
He said it was urgent.

550
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,886
Do you know what it was about?

551
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:29,086
Boss came to see Dit.

552
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:31,526
Dit, who?

553
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:34,366
Dit was a manager here.

554
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,086
I don't know what their problem was.

555
00:50:37,973 --> 00:50:40,606
Boss fired Dit as soon as he got here.

556
00:50:41,453 --> 00:50:42,846
He fired him?

557
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:45,966
If this is what you do, you're fired!

558
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:48,286
Fine! I'm leaving!

559
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:54,126
Don't even think firing me will solve this.

560
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:57,886
Your mistake is gravely serious.

561
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:59,766
How many times have you gone against my orders?

562
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:03,646
Fine! We'll see who survives between us.

563
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:07,006
You won't live to retire, stupid idiot!

564
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:12,566
You guys too! You better watch out!

565
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:14,326
I'll be back for revenge.

566
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:27,846
- Where did Dit go?  - Yes? Well...

567
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:30,006
He just left.

568
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,590
If their argument escalated that much,

569
00:51:49,886 --> 00:51:51,686
Dit is also suspicious.

570
00:51:55,014 --> 00:51:56,126
Is it possible

571
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:59,366
that he was so angry with my dad that he poisoned him?

572
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:04,566
You sent him the pills the day after that.

573
00:52:05,446 --> 00:52:09,966
Maybe he came back to poison the pills without my dad knowing.

574
00:52:10,242 --> 00:52:13,286
I don't think that's the case, miss.

575
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:16,086
I don't know for sure.

576
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:21,846
If he's that angry with my dad,

577
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:26,286
he's one of those with motivation.

578
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:32,766
(Where can I find him?)

579
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:36,526
Mr. Dit?

580
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:39,366
Mr. Dit?

581
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:41,133
Mr. Dit, are you home?

582
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,446
Mr. Dit, are you home?

583
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:47,006
- Mr. Dit?  - Are you here to see Dit?

584
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,526
He's not here. I haven't seen his car in days.

585
00:52:50,677 --> 00:52:52,366
I think he hasn't come home.

586
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:56,966
I tried calling him. Nobody answered.

587
00:52:57,245 --> 00:53:01,206
I'm from the company he worked at. There's something urgent.

588
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:03,377
Try calling Rampha.

589
00:53:03,677 --> 00:53:06,406
She's his girlfriend. I'll give you her number.

590
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:07,846
Okay.

591
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,566
- Try calling her.  - Okay.

592
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:30,726
Are you Detective Conan?

593
00:53:31,726 --> 00:53:34,246
Korn, why are you here?

594
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:39,566
Let me go! Korn, let me go!

595
00:53:43,126 --> 00:53:46,406
Don't you have a job? Don't tell me you got fired.

596
00:53:47,086 --> 00:53:49,926
Give me back my phone. I found the killer.

597
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:52,006
You mean Dit?

598
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:57,326
You know him, but you didn't tell me?

599
00:53:58,814 --> 00:54:00,166
You didn't ask.

600
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:03,926
Don't tell me it's you.

601
00:54:04,486 --> 00:54:06,846
You accidentally told him that you had my dad's pills.

602
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:08,446
That's how he got poisoned.

603
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:12,926
You've been suspecting him since day one and haven't told me?

604
00:54:13,406 --> 00:54:15,766
- You're delusional.  - You're the one delusional.

605
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:18,086
You tell me nonsense stuff without me asking.

606
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:24,286
Hi, Somchai.

607
00:54:24,686 --> 00:54:26,886
- Bring her to a restaurant. She needs lunch.  - Yes, sir.

608
00:54:27,406 --> 00:54:29,286
Don't be ridiculous, Korn.

609
00:54:29,606 --> 00:54:31,206
- Get out.  - No.

610
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,126
This is the company's car, isn't it?

611
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:35,846
This is office hours. You can't use it for personal reasons.

612
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,046
Eat it.

613
00:54:46,687 --> 00:54:48,246
I don't understand.

614
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:50,952
Korn, this is life and death for me.

615
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:54,126
If you don't eat, you'll die.

616
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:55,886
How many days have you not eaten?

617
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:58,246
I heard you haven't been eating well.

618
00:54:58,526 --> 00:55:00,326
You've only been drinking your tears.

619
00:55:04,622 --> 00:55:07,926
- What?  - Where's my phone? Give it back.

620
00:55:08,865 --> 00:55:12,286
Finish this meal and I'll give it back.

621
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:14,806
What are you playing at?

622
00:55:15,006 --> 00:55:18,126
Did Uncle Kiat send you to stop me?

623
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:21,766
Have you ever looked at someone positively?

624
00:55:23,374 --> 00:55:26,246
The old "Optimist Rina" is now gone.

625
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,006
I think she died along with her father.

626
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:48,846
If you won't eat, I will.

627
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:52,006
You will regret it. The food here is really good.

628
00:55:54,974 --> 00:55:56,166
What a waste of time.

629
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:14,406
(Where are you? Have you got your hotel?)

630
00:56:14,526 --> 00:56:16,202
(Should I fly to you today?)

631
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:17,846
(Don't keep me worried.)

632
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,759
(I can't focus on my job.)

633
00:56:19,862 --> 00:56:21,486
Is this really you, Karn?

634
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:29,006
"Please come here soon."

635
00:56:29,118 --> 00:56:33,126
"I miss you so much."

636
00:56:35,662 --> 00:56:36,766
I should not.

637
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,006
- I'm sorry.  - It's okay.

638
00:56:43,446 --> 00:56:44,686
Oh no!

639
00:56:46,646 --> 00:56:48,046
It got sent!

640
00:57:18,944 --> 00:57:20,486
I think I have a digestive problem.

641
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:24,486
Somchai, stop at the next hospital.

642
00:57:26,468 --> 00:57:28,966
You can take your van when we arrive at the hospital.

643
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:30,766
I'll be on my own way.

644
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:32,966
It's just a minute.

645
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:36,366
Don't you know you killed my digestive system?

646
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:38,166
It's stressful being with you.

647
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:42,006
My stomach hurts!

648
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:44,206
It's all messed up in there.

649
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:47,966
Hey! Whoa!

650
00:57:49,006 --> 00:57:50,566
Stay away!

651
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:54,086
Somchai, turn here!

652
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,886
Pull over!

653
00:57:59,286 --> 00:58:02,846
Pull over right now. Open the door.

654
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,126
If you want it back, give me mine.

655
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,366
You can take it. I'll use yours.

656
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:19,926
I need to use that number.

657
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:21,442
If you want it, then wait.

658
00:58:21,584 --> 00:58:23,966
- Hey, Korn.  - My stomach hurts.

659
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:26,366
Korn, give it back now.

660
00:58:26,605 --> 00:58:27,926
My stomach hurts.

661
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,646
Rampha?

662
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:32,966
(Rampha)

663
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,806
Lady luck is favoring me.

664
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:39,726
Mr. Korn?

665
00:58:39,886 --> 00:58:43,686
I want to let you know that the doctor allowed us to visit him now.

666
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:46,726
Mr. Korn?

667
00:58:47,126 --> 00:58:48,606
When did you get here?

668
00:58:49,614 --> 00:58:51,926
Miss Rampha, you're Dit's girlfriend, aren't you?

669
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:54,726
I'm from Isara Company.

670
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:56,806
- I'm...  - She's my girlfriend.

671
00:58:59,582 --> 00:59:02,366
She's worried. She wants to see how Mr. Dit is doing.

672
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,366
We're visiting?

673
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:09,241
Then this way, please. It's visiting time.

674
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,086
He didn't kill Uncle Chai, Rina.

675
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:46,286
That day after he got fired,

676
00:59:46,886 --> 00:59:49,246
he drove to Phang-nga to see his mom.

677
00:59:49,582 --> 00:59:50,966
He was in an accident.

678
00:59:51,246 --> 00:59:53,286
His car slid into a reservoir.

679
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:56,406
He has been unconscious since.

680
00:59:56,598 --> 00:59:58,246
You see how he is doing.

681
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,206
There's no sign of him waking up.

682
01:00:02,077 --> 01:00:05,166
So, he couldn't have swapped my dad's pills.

683
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:07,646
That's right.

684
01:00:08,165 --> 01:00:10,926
You can't go around blaming people.

685
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:13,406
What got him fired?

686
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,406
Is it about money?

687
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:22,486
Rina.

688
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,606
You lost your dad.

689
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:28,606
They are about to lose the one who provides for their family.

690
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:32,686
She blamed Uncle Chai

691
01:00:33,101 --> 01:00:36,886
for putting her husband out of his job until he can't afford treatment.

692
01:00:38,086 --> 01:00:39,966
She threatened to sue Uncle Chai.

693
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:45,726
This is why I can't tell them you're his daughter.

694
01:00:48,893 --> 01:00:50,326
You're a victim.

695
01:00:50,622 --> 01:00:52,966
They think they're your victims.

696
01:00:57,766 --> 01:00:59,326
You're smart, Rina.

697
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:02,046
You've been everyone's brain,

698
01:01:02,582 --> 01:01:04,486
but you need reasons sometimes.

699
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:06,326
If you use your emotions,

700
01:01:06,613 --> 01:01:10,006
you'll be a desperate dog running in a circle.

701
01:01:19,086 --> 01:01:20,326
Take it.

702
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:53,726
I'm really throwing up. Pull over!

703
01:02:02,126 --> 01:02:04,926
Hey? You're really throwing up?

704
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:08,966
My stomach hurts.

705
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,926
You have nothing to throw up.

706
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:14,926
You haven't eaten.

707
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:17,846
If there's something, it's the baby in there.

708
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:20,366
I'm not pregnant!

709
01:02:21,534 --> 01:02:22,886
Let me warn you.

710
01:02:23,062 --> 01:02:26,046
You have bad luck. Your kid will have bad luck as I do.

711
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:28,429
We've both been kicked out.

712
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:32,686
Don't use a baby to marry someone in my family, understand?

713
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:38,886
Welcome to, what club is it?

714
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,742
Outcast Club.

715
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,726
The club for the black sheep,

716
01:02:42,886 --> 01:02:46,086
where outcasts get together.

717
01:02:46,574 --> 01:02:51,006
There's me, Ka, and then you.

718
01:02:54,126 --> 01:02:55,726
You have fallen from grace, Rina.

719
01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:57,766
You're not an Avenger anymore.

720
01:02:57,966 --> 01:02:59,102
Therefore,

721
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:00,846
your degree,

722
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,446
your father,

723
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:05,486
your prince can't protect you anymore.

724
01:03:06,718 --> 01:03:08,086
That's why

725
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,966
if you don't want to lose,

726
01:03:10,397 --> 01:03:11,846
you need to get up.

727
01:03:12,773 --> 01:03:15,086
There's a place I want you to see.

728
01:03:36,286 --> 01:03:38,486
That's it. That's where his car slid into.

729
01:03:39,878 --> 01:03:41,806
Dit has been unconscious since it happened.

730
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:45,126
Uncle Chai was the one who identified him

731
01:03:45,366 --> 01:03:47,606
after they recovered the wreckage.

732
01:03:49,022 --> 01:03:51,486
It's impossible for Dit

733
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:53,486
to poison Uncle Chai.

734
01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:58,317
Even if he was murdered,

735
01:03:58,486 --> 01:04:01,366
this Dit guy couldn't have been the murderer.

736
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:06,726
At least,

737
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:08,846
if we have dashcam footage,

738
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,486
it might help.

739
01:04:12,021 --> 01:04:13,326
There's a dashcam.

740
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:15,726
It's missing the SD card.

741
01:04:16,782 --> 01:04:19,246
I think it fell off during the accident.

742
01:04:21,766 --> 01:04:23,126
It fell off?

743
01:04:26,126 --> 01:04:27,566
So it's in there.

744
01:04:28,254 --> 01:04:29,486
Rina, what are you doing?

745
01:04:29,806 --> 01:04:30,926
Rina!

746
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,686
Rina.

747
01:04:36,311 --> 01:04:37,766
You think you can find it?

748
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:40,006
If you drown, I won't save you.

749
01:04:40,862 --> 01:04:44,486
Rina! If you drown, I won't save you. Rina!

750
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:49,846
Rina, stop! Use your head.

751
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,006
You can't find it like this.

752
01:04:53,366 --> 01:04:56,086
Right now, anything can be evidence.

753
01:05:01,141 --> 01:05:03,366
- Let me go!  - Stop!

754
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:09,566
Why are you stopping me?

755
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,126
I have to find out

756
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:15,166
who did this to my father.

757
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,886
My dad must die for nothing.

758
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:21,766
You think this will help?

759
01:05:34,094 --> 01:05:37,126
How would Uncle Chai feel if he saw his daughter like this?

760
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:45,406
I never kept anything secret from my dad.

761
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:48,646
Yet all this time,

762
01:05:49,286 --> 01:05:51,846
I've never known what my dad went through.

763
01:06:07,984 --> 01:06:09,984
The secrets my dad was hiding,

764
01:06:10,589 --> 01:06:12,526
why have I never known?

765
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:18,246
At least he should have told me.

766
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:23,126
I want a chance to defend him.

767
01:06:36,653 --> 01:06:40,926
Right now, I really don't know what I can do for him.

768
01:07:35,726 --> 01:07:38,236
I'll take you to where it happened, but you have to promise me

769
01:07:38,317 --> 01:07:40,126
that you won't risk yourself doing anything crazy.

770
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:42,046
Honey...

771
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:44,526
Korn.

772
01:07:45,213 --> 01:07:49,526
There's an ancient saying. "The more you hate it, the more you get it."

773
01:07:49,646 --> 01:07:51,086
I care about how Rina feels.

774
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:55,366
Rina isn't wrong. She's forced to choose between her dad and justice.

775
01:07:55,517 --> 01:07:58,966
If you want to help Rina, just be honest with her.

776
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:01,026
You're the one she trusts the most.
