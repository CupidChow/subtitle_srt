1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,631
Come on, guys!

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,384
Oh yeah, I still got game.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,343
Hang on...

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:14,723
We already have 800 live viewers!

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,599
Thank you so much, guys!

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,727
If we reach a thousand,

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,729
I'll give you some freebies. Promise!

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:25,442
So, don't be shy to give me some stars.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,236
Support my gaming channel, please!

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,821
What the...

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,656
What a pro move!

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,159
Looks like I'm going to lose...

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,829
Baby, put on your shirt!

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,081
Why, baby? Do I look terrible?

15
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,918
Shut up! I'm on live stream!

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,503
OK.

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,380
Baby…

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,757
Baby...

19
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:54,095
- Go away, baby...
- But I can't get enough of you!

20
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:55,805
Crazy!

21
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,059
My viewers might get turned off!

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,061
Look, baby!

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,939
- I already have a thousand live viewers!
- See! I told you!

24
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,067
Hi, guys!

25
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,110
CaiReel Nation, how are you doing?

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,821
CaiReel Nation? What's that?

27
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,907
They're our supporters, baby!

28
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,742
- You mean 'my' supporters?
- Go ahead.

29
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,203
- Ask them if they don't want me here.
- They don't care. They're only loyal to me.

30
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,662
Am I right, guys?

31
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,872
- Seriously?
- Yes!

32
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,123
- For real?
- Yes!

33
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,418
OK, CaiReel Nation,

34
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,630
if you want me to leave already, click the 'angry' emoji.

35
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,965
You know the drill, guys!

36
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,842
- Click 'angry'
- Click 'angry'! Go!

37
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,428
If you want me to kiss my baby, click the 'heart' emoji.

38
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,055
- Hey!
- What?

39
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,474
Go, go!

40
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,690
Do you see those emojis, baby?

41
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,150
That's a lot of hearts!

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,320
- The angry emojis are just about to appear!
- But it's nothing compared to my love for you.

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,072
Wait for the angry emojis!

44
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:59,119
Come on! Your viewers might think that you can't keep your word.

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,954
Think about your 1,200 viewers.

46
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,206
What now?

47
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,917
Fine! Just a smack on the cheek, OK?

48
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,045
Sure, let's have the main event later.

49
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,840
You're such a jerk!

50
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,720
There you go!

51
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,597
Baby!

52
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,641
Baby! Yes!

53
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,020
Baby!

54
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,274
I told you so!

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,000
(Gameboys The Movie)

56
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,410
Do that again and you're dead!

57
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,079
Stop it, baby!

58
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,456
What are you doing?

59
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:50,461
I'm sorting whites and coloreds before washing them.

60
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,796
Is that how it should be?

61
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,000
JUST IN: IATF to announce new quarantine regulations
as the numbers of COVID-19 positive cases rise.

62
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,727
You're being a pest, baby!

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,200
I could get used to waking up with this view.

64
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,733
Really?!

65
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,572
Baby!

66
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,866
That's disgusting!

67
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,535
I'm in the middle of a game!

68
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,038
Is this yours?

69
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,331
Yes.

70
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,249
Hey! You're such a perv!

71
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,417
Why? I was just checking!

72
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,085
It's my used boxers!

73
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:31,878
So it's yours?

74
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,171
Yes! You bugger!

75
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,216
Hey, baby! Give it back to me!

76
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,968
That's mine!

77
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,346
You're so nasty!

78
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,973
Will you help me do the laundry?

79
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:55,193
Yuck! You're so gross!

80
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,527
Let me wipe it.

81
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,987
It smells so bad!

82
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,239
Do you even brush your teeth?

83
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,869
Nice, you're doing good.

84
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,829
What happened?

85
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,752
Here, wear this.

86
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,170
Go.

87
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,129
Silly.

88
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,800
Business operations allowed in ECQ, MECQ and GCQ areas
but public encouraged to stay at home.

89
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,766
Stop smelling it!

90
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,895
- I don't want to, baby!
- Fine! Ouch!

91
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,064
Give me a kiss!

92
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,026
Give it to me, baby!

93
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,736
Let's stop this!

94
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,238
I've had enough.

95
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,489
OK.

96
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,702
Ouch!

97
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,662
You spank so well, baby.

98
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,172
- Hanging our clothes but my baby left me hanging.
- Baby?

99
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,632
- Hanging our clothes but my baby left me hanging.
- What the?!

100
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,718
You know what, I'm done with this!

101
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,969
Hold on, baby!

102
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,928
Baby!

103
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,895
Are you tired, baby?

104
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,858
Yes, but not too tired.

105
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,528
Do you do this everyday?

106
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,364
Yes, but not in one day.

107
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,491
I only do the laundry once a week.

108
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,410
Did you like it, baby?

109
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,162
Am I now fit to be a husband?

110
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,582
It's not even a requirement.

111
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,752
I know.

112
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,506
Baby, I'll give you my share for groceries, OK?

113
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,924
No need, baby.

114
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,719
Just save it up for a new computer.

115
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,846
I'll take care of our expenses.

116
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,598
I'm embarrassed.

117
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,684
Let me share the expenses with you.

118
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:56,481
We'll do that once we start living together.

119
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:02,987
But for now, let me take care of you.

120
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,449
I want to take care of you.

121
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,294
If you insist. I can't change your mind anyway.

122
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,380
OK.

123
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,257
But the day isn't over yet.

124
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,386
What else do we need to do?

125
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,393
You're not yet tired, right?

126
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,728
You're being annoying again, baby.

127
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,689
Why? What's on your mind?

128
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,691
Stop it, Gavreel.

129
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:46,114
I'll just do some push-ups. Count with me, OK?

130
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,408
One… Two…

131
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,283
Baby!

132
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,494
Three… Four…

133
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,286
Stop it, baby!

134
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,496
- Five…
- Silly!

135
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,288
Sex!

136
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,373
I mean, six! Six!

137
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,374
Six… Seven…

138
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,126
Idiot! You're an idiot!

139
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,175
I will miss you.

140
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:10,221
What's with the drama?

141
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,475
I'm just glad that we have this time together.

142
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,772
Good thing your mom allowed you to stay with me.

143
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,567
Fine.

144
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,405
Are you ready?

145
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,490
Ready for what?

146
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,534
I said I'm fine with cuddling…

147
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,204
and a bit of kissing.

148
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,540
OK.

149
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,417
Oops!

150
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,752
Take a bath first.

151
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,588
Take a bath first!

152
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,258
But baby...
Am I smelly already?

153
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,928
Baby, we're both sweaty.

154
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,597
Go and take a bath first!

155
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,974
Fine, let's take a bath together.

156
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,559
No way!

157
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,062
We might end up doing something else.

158
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,608
Well, you have a point.

159
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,777
OK, I'll go first. I'll be quick, OK?

160
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,885
Baby…

161
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,222
It's your turn.

162
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,200
If I could have a s superpower,
I want to have the power to disappear.

163
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,500
The worst thing about this pandemic is that it traps
us in the very situation we tried so hard to avoid.

164
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,459
Is he going through something?

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Thinking what would be my next step.

166
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,133
What is he up to this time?

167
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,267
Hi, baby boy!

168
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,436
Hi, your highness! How are you?

169
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,896
Still pretty, as always!

170
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,356
Where is your baby?

171
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,609
Wait, I'll call him.

172
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:14,322
Baby, our girl is here! Come over here!

173
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,531
Faster!

174
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,993
Hello, your highness!

175
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,997
Wow, too busy to join our call?

176
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,249
Drop the call and come over here!

177
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:31,839
No way! I don't want to stand in the way of your love-making.

178
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,883
You're too much, Pearl!

179
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,054
Look, I understand if you're doing it every hour!

180
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,181
You haven't seen each other for a long time

181
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,974
and baby boy will have to go home soon.

182
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:47,563
Just remember this: Safety first before you thirst.

183
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,774
You're talking too much, girl!

184
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,984
What's wrong?!

185
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,654
It's just normal to...

186
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,161
Wait, don't tell me…

187
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:08,042
Well, I mean, it's OK if you're not yet ready, right?

188
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,920
Love's not all about sex, anyway.

189
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,422
Of course. And I am always willing to wait.

190
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,424
How about you? How are you?

191
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,801
You're going to tell us something, right?

192
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,928
Hold on, we're still waiting for another guest.

193
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,514
Who's that guest? Are we going to be in trouble again?

194
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,307
Of course not!

195
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,725
He's in the waiting room now.

196
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,061
I'll let him in.

197
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,562
Hi!

198
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,233
Hi, girl! Hi, Gav!

199
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,611
Who is that baby boy?

200
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,737
Such a cutie!

201
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,906
Yes, he is. He's my baby.

202
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,990
He's Cairo.

203
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,534
Hello!

204
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,995
Hi! In fairness, you look good together.

205
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,332
Such cuties. I wish I also have my own guy.

206
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,836
By the way, let me introduce myself.

207
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,423
My name is Achilles, but you can call me Chill,

208
00:11:55,423 --> 00:12:00,094
spelled as C-H-I-L-L, but pronounced as 'kill, '

209
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,470
like 'Kill This Love.'

210
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,430
Kidding!

211
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,557
Since when did you call yourself Chill?

212
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,309
Just now! You've got a problem with that?!

213
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,103
That's a gorgeous name.

214
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,733
I'm already liking your new baby boy, Gav.

215
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,195
He's way better than your ex, that jerk and manipulative guy.

216
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,280
Kidding!

217
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,286
Girl, why are you so bitter? Tell us the story! Spill the tea!

218
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,206
No, I'm just kidding. I just got carried away.

219
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:33,252
So what now, Pearl? Have you informed them already?

220
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,587
Not yet.

221
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,130
What is this all about?

222
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,259
Pearl and I are planning to work on a project,

223
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,512
a raunchy one.

224
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,221
Kidding!

225
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,892
Basically, we plan to donate tablets to students.

226
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,102
Wow, that's a good project!

227
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,522
I agree. What can we help you with?

228
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,816
We already have sponsors,

229
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,027
and we just need help distributing the tablets

230
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,488
to deserving students.

231
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,115
Count me in! How about you, baby?

232
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,076
Game!

233
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,997
All right! We'll just inform you of the details soon.

234
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:10,956
Game.

235
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,335
Hold on, I'll just take this call.

236
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,544
OK.

237
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,175
Baby boy, what's up with you and Gav?

238
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
The Collab that nobody asked for. Charot!

239
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:33,479
I'll wait. I always wait, anyway. Kidding!

240
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,276
The sun is already up. Did you forget about me?

241
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,444
Kidding!

242
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,031
I'm sorry. I was in another call.

243
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,492
With whom? Your new boyfriend?

244
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,328
Achi… I'm sorry.

245
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,166
Looks like everyone has already moved on. I need to move on as well.

246
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,861
(Confirm Block)
And this is how I move on.

247
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,720
(You've blocked Terrence Carreon.
We're sorry that you've had this experience.)

248
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,757
Be careful, baby.

249
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,761
Ready?

250
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,804
Hang on.

251
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,473
- What's this?
- Hang on.

252
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,684
Make sure that I won't fall or else...

253
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,520
You already did, baby, and you fell right in my arms!

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,772
- You're so corny.
- Don't look!

255
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,316
Hang on.

256
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,113
Walk slowly, baby.

257
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,701
OK…

258
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,955
Slowly, baby.

259
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,957
Are you excited, baby?

260
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,458
What's this for?

261
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,918
We're here.

262
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,170
Surprise!

263
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,550
Wow! It looks nice.

264
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,099
Why aren't you surprised, baby?

265
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,646
Because I already saw you working on that a while ago.

266
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,649
We live in the same house, remember?

267
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,443
I was looking for you earlier.

268
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,447
Why didn't you tell me?

269
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,825
I didn't want to ruin your surprise.

270
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,204
My baby doesn't want me to get disappointed.

271
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,708
Of course! What is this for, anyway?

272
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:25,716
I promised that I'd date you after the pandemic, right?

273
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,928
But I couldn't wait any longer.

274
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:33,057
And besides, I know that you won't be here for long,

275
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,144
that's why I wanted our movie date to be special.

276
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:41,941
I wanted this moment to be special, baby.

277
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,824
Thank you, baby, for always making me feel special.

278
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:56,163
It makes me feel guilty that I am not as affectionate as you.

279
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:02,461
Baby, you're special to me.

280
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,380
OK?

281
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,300
In your short stay here,

282
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,970
you made me feel special too.

283
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,931
Of course, because I love you.

284
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,517
My baby is crushing on me.

285
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,020
Stop it! You're annoying!

286
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,941
How much did you spend for all these?

287
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,528
Not much. I bought that popcorn a month ago.

288
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,863
All right. What are we going to watch?

289
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,782
Choose what you want, baby.

290
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,368
Perhaps a horror movie

291
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,246
so you could hug me when you get scared?

292
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,791
You're being silly again! Let's just watch a rom-com.

293
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,043
So you could fall deeply for me, baby?

294
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,253
OK, how about a family movie?

295
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,505
So you could start a family with me?

296
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,632
Fine! Let's just watch a series or animé!

297
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,384
It's up to you, baby.

298
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,011
What's wrong with you!

299
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,640
Hold on.

300
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,435
Hold on, baby.

301
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,729
Pick a movie first. I'll just take this call.

302
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,815
Sure, go ahead.

303
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,824
I'm sorry, Aunt Myra. I'm in the middle of something.

304
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,119
I'll just call you back.

305
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,732
Baby…

306
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,026
Baby…

307
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,403
Baby! Let's focus on the movie.

308
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,740
I can multitask, baby.

309
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,369
We're outside, someone might see us.

310
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,155
Let's give them a show.

311
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,070
Baby…

312
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,698
- Someone's at the door.
- What?

313
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,616
Don't mind it.

314
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,703
I'm serious, baby. The doorbell is ringing!

315
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,371
I didn't hear anything.

316
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,707
Baby, let me check it first.

317
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,334
- Maybe that's just Pearl.
- Hang on, OK?

318
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,835
That girl is so annoying!

319
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,378
Baby!

320
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,715
Just a second!

321
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,301
Pearl, is that you?

322
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,388
Baby!

323
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,641
Don't open it yet.

324
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,018
Wait for me.

325
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,519
Baby!

326
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,357
Terrence…

327
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,942
Hi, love birds.

328
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,155
What are you doing here? You're not even wearing a face mask...

329
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,118
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,829
Baby, I'll just lay him down.

331
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,873
What's wrong with you, Terrence?!

332
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,627
Right here!

333
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,738
Dad! I'm sorry, dad!

334
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,116
Sorry if I like boys.

335
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,534
Dad!

336
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,829
Mom, please...

337
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,832
- Don't send me away, mom, please.
- Terrence...

338
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,751
- Dad!
- You're having nightmares, Terrence.

339
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,004
- Dad!
- Terrence!

340
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,676
Are you OK?

341
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,221
I'll get him a glass of water.

342
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,653
Look...

343
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,533
I know…

344
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:12,456
I know that what you're going through is difficult.

345
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,210
Gav and I are just here for you, OK?

346
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,005
OK?

347
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,700
Thank you Gavreel and Cairo for saving me.

348
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,294
Gav, where are you?

349
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,173
I already started jogging since you were both still asleep.

350
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,552
All right. Cai and I will follow since he's already up.

351
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,346
OK.

352
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,700
FITNESS FIRST B4 YOU THIRST

353
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,500
ESTE SAFETY FIRST B4 YOU THIRST

354
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,453
Is this…

355
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,582
Hey.

356
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,168
Gav?

357
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,922
I thought I was already lost!

358
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,550
What are you doing here?

359
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,724
Hey, where have you been?

360
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,643
I wish I didn't run too far.

361
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,769
What's wrong, baby?

362
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,312
I bumped into this clown.

363
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,355
What?

364
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,648
I mean, we have a visitor.

365
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,900
Hi, boss!

366
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,694
Master! What are you doing here?

367
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,737
Oh god, it's a long story!

368
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,031
Hey, hello!

369
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:10,991
Hi.

370
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,704
You know each other, right?

371
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,414
- Yes.
- No.

372
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,040
Which is which?

373
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,628
How did you know my address?

374
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,255
His brother London gave it to me.

375
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,423
But why are you here?

376
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,632
How did you get here?

377
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,634
And no offense, but I think you should quarantine first.

378
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,386
Stay away from him, baby.

379
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,221
Hold on, calm down!

380
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,308
OK, we were quarantined after I got to the airport.

381
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,686
I got my test results and it's negative, so I was allowed to go.

382
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,398
OK, I'm sorry, but what brings you here?

383
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,112
Let me get some rest. I'm tired. I want to fix my things first.

384
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,698
So where's my bedroom?

385
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,997
I already gave the vacant room to Terrence.

386
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,124
Unless you're OK to be roommates with him?

387
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,001
- No!
- Sure!

388
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,087
Looks like he doesn't want to, Master.

389
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,634
So I'll be sleeping on the sidewalk then.

390
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,595
Well, it's not like I'm paying rent.

391
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,847
Go ahead, use the room. I'll just sleep on the couch.

392
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,643
Come on, I just told you that I am Covid-negative.

393
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,895
Here's the result. Look!

394
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,316
It's up to you, guys. Just figure it out.

395
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,951
Hi, baby boys!

396
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,703
- Hi, Achilles!
- What's up?

397
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:43,708
So Cai, Gav, are you available to join our event?

398
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:48,171
Pearl told me that you do video coverage, Cai.

399
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,174
- Is it OK if I assign you that task?
- Yes, of course.

400
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:55,303
You, too, Gav! Join us, OK?

401
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:59,057
Pearl and I need more help.

402
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,978
Sure, even if my task is to just babysit my baby.

403
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:09,693
Seriously?! Right in front of my salad?!

404
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,362
- Sorry.
- Why are you laughing?

405
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,489
You've seen the video, too?

406
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,241
I knew it!

407
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,742
It's just a meme, right?

408
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,538
But it's fine, there's nothing wrong if you've seen it.

409
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,334
Anyway, I should hang up, you guys are making me envious.

410
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,129
Bye, guys.

411
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,381
Bye, Achilles! See you!

412
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,550
Bye! See you!

413
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,930
I'll give you one star.

414
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,266
Reason? Happy couple!

415
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,060
Not that I'm bitter, I'm just after self-care.

416
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,270
Kidding!

417
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,800
(Terrence Carreon)

418
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,355
(User Blocked)

419
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,905
Should I unblock this jerk?

420
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,993
No! Chill! Don't be a hopeless romantic.

421
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:13,840
Before you go, can I say something?

422
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,802
What is it this time, Terrence?

423
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,722
Anybody can fall for you.

424
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,310
Maybe the timing wasn't right for us.

425
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,939
Whatever!

426
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,889
Will you stop getting near me? There's so much space around!

427
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:08,269
I just want to be close to you, isn't it obvious?

428
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,106
Isn't it obvious? I don't want to do anything with you.

429
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,694
Come on, I'm making an effort here.

430
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,070
That's what you're good at.

431
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,700
Why does it sound like a bad thing?

432
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,786
Do you think what you did was good?

433
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:32,252
Let me make it up to you.
I can't stand seeing us like this.

434
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,047
I don't hear an apology.

435
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,262
You want me to apologize for being honest?

436
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,389
No! For leading me on!

437
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,391
You flirted with me like you really cared.

438
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,060
But when I entertained you, you told me you weren't ready yet?

439
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,229
And then you just disappeared.

440
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,816
Now you'd show up like nothing happened?

441
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,739
- OK, I'm sorry, I messed up.
- You led me on!

442
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,242
Can we just forget about it and be real friends this time?

443
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,119
I can't believe you.

444
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,583
This is me saying sorry. I really want us to be OK.

445
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,668
You're so stupid for a genius.

446
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,963
You look so sexy when you're mad.

447
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,132
I'm not playing this game with you again.

448
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,759
Calm down, Mr. Boredom.

449
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,261
What do you want?

450
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,476
What are you doing?

451
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,394
Is this what you want?

452
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,730
What?

453
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,530
Let's go upstairs.

454
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,825
Silly!

455
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
(Tita Myra Calling)

456
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,589
Good evening, Sir Vic.

457
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,759
I'd just like to follow up on your rent.

458
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,802
Thanks.

459
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,999
I'm coming, hang on!

460
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,922
Aunt Susan?

461
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,007
Who else would it be?

462
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:50,014
No need! We're in a pandemic, we need to observe social distancing.

463
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,309
Baby, is that the item that I ordered?

464
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,397
Who is he?

465
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,234
Why are you letting strangers inside the house?

466
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,530
He's Cairo.

467
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,073
Hello.

468
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,077
He's my friend.

469
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:19,377
Oh… your friend.

470
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,715
You've chosen your friends well.

471
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,677
You kinda look alike.

472
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:34,392
By the way, can you help carry my stuff?

473
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,269
I really have to pee.

474
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,688
Excuse me.

475
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,984
Please be careful with the eggs.

476
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,612
Don't break them, OK?

477
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,910
Baby…

478
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,996
Baby? I thought I was just a friend.

479
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,750
I'll explain myself later.

480
00:31:59,042 --> 00:31:59,751
OK.

481
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:00,960
Friend!

482
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,297
Come on, baby. Baby, don't get mad!

483
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,174
Why did you lie?

484
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,802
Last I checked, you were proud that I'm your baby.

485
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,307
But when it comes to your folks, I'm just your friend?

486
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,017
I'm proud of you,

487
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,685
and you know that.

488
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:23,191
It's just that Aunt Susan can be difficult. I don't think she'd understand.

489
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,318
And besides, she won't be here for long.

490
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,153
I don't want us to get in trouble.

491
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,821
OK?

492
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,156
Baby…

493
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:30,907
Baby…

494
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,325
OK, fine!

495
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,370
I still don't get it, but fine!

496
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,706
Thank you, baby.

497
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,500
You're welcome…

498
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,085
Friend!

499
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,212
Come on, baby.

500
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,838
Baby!

501
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,262
What's wrong?

502
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,849
Don't worry.

503
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:03,898
I came from our church's conference and they swabbed us twice.

504
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,401
That's why I thought of dropping by.

505
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,237
Is that so?

506
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,656
What brings you here?

507
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,701
Your Aunt Myra asked me to.

508
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,079
I also brought your favorite coconut pie.

509
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,206
Hand it to me.

510
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,083
Here you go.

511
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,793
For you.

512
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,045
Thank you.

513
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,133
Gav,

514
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,470
I heard you weren't answering your Aunt Myra's calls.

515
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,558
She's worried about you, especially during this pandemic.

516
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,560
I kept on missing her calls.

517
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,020
I'll just call her later.

518
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,105
Yes, you should.

519
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:49,444
Also, I dropped by your apartment units.

520
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,404
Why is Vic still there?

521
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,199
He always forgets to pay the rent, right?

522
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,161
Your Grandma Cora had a hard time dealing with him.

523
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,622
He does pay when he is able.

524
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,791
It's just hard for him to comply because of the pandemic.

525
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,004
That won't cut it, Gav.

526
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,132
We are all hit hard by this pandemic.

527
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,051
OK.

528
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,387
By the way, do we have rice already?

529
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,597
I'll cook.

530
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,806
Let me do it, baby...

531
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:19,974
Bro…

532
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,810
Let me do it, bro.

533
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,980
He'll do it.

534
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,567
You got a good friend.

535
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:35,114
Wait, do you let girls inside this house?

536
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,868
No, that's never going to happen.

537
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,328
Why do you say so?

538
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:48,628
Because of the pandemic. We're after our safety.

539
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:52,965
Right.

540
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,344
You have a point.

541
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,357
Wait up, Terrence!

542
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,109
Why do you keep on chasing me?

543
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,985
Because I might get lost!

544
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,824
- Hey, Mr. Boredom!
- Stop calling me that!

545
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,162
OK, but you can call me Seven-Incher anytime.

546
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,164
You think you're funny?

547
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,958
OK, just let me catch my breath first.

548
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,167
You know what, I don't get you.

549
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,128
Why are you such a flirt?

550
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,465
Ouch!

551
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,760
I said I just wanted to breathe first.

552
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,429
I admit I have a bad reputation.

553
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:45,309
But I've never flirted with anyone here,

554
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,686
except with you.

555
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,313
And that's because I...

556
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,648
Because?

557
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,360
Maybe because I...

558
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,778
I like you.

559
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,821
Déjà vu.

560
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,242
What?

561
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,537
I heard those words before.

562
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,331
You already told me that and yet here we are.

563
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,505
I'm sorry for being an asshole.

564
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,260
I deserve this kind of treatment because of what I did to you.

565
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,222
But don't I deserve a second chance?

566
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,852
OK, but you're not ready to commit, right?

567
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,812
That's why you have an alter account,

568
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,981
so you can flirt with anyone!

569
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:42,408
I have an alter account because
I can't be my true self in the real world!

570
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,999
You know what I'm talking about.

571
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,253
Alter guys don't expect anything from me.

572
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,426
You know that I don't want to be a doctor, right?

573
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,928
Yes, I do.

574
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,055
But you also don't know what you want, right?

575
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,057
I know I like you,

576
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,228
but I don't get the things that I like just because I like them.

577
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,315
Everything that I have, all the things that I do

578
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,442
are my parents' choices.

579
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,569
And that's because of what?

580
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,072
I have an IQ of over 140?

581
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,409
I'm sorry.

582
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,954
I didn't know what you're going through.

583
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,467
Gav, why did you set up for five?

584
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,011
Do we have guests for today?

585
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,389
Those are for my boarders, Aunt Susan.

586
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,598
Who are they?

587
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,059
And why are they joining us for lunch?

588
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,229
They are staying here,
and they're my friends, too.

589
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,065
Oh, OK.

590
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,112
Go ahead.

591
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,863
Thank you.

592
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,574
Here they are.

593
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,619
Good afternoon, ma'am.

594
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,204
Good afternoon, ma'am.

595
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,539
Good afternoon.

596
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,331
Hello, ma'am.

597
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,333
This is my Aunt Susan.

598
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,794
- Aunt Susan, meet Terrence and Wesley.
- Hello, ma'am.

599
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,672
Take a seat and join us.

600
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,093
So, you two are…?

601
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,678
Come again?

602
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,805
How are you related to each other?

603
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,225
We are...

604
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,019
Brothers?

605
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,021
Because you kinda look alike.

606
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,231
No, we're not.

607
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,482
We are…

608
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,525
friends!

609
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,234
And classmates!

610
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,570
- Am I right, bro?
- Yes, bro!

611
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:47,408
But you and Gav, you don't look alike.

612
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,578
I know, because he's a distant relative.

613
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,621
His mom was my cousin.

614
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,540
But I am close with them.

615
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,042
Oh, that's why.

616
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,753
This tastes good!

617
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,344
Had I known that your friends are here, I would have cooked more.

618
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,428
Wait a minute,

619
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,055
where is your girlfriend?

620
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,933
Hey, easy with the food.

621
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,226
Don't eat too fast.

622
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,734
What's wrong?
Is there something wrong with the food?

623
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,402
Did I put too much pepper?

624
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,530
It's delicious,

625
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,824
that's why we were taking large bites.

626
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,869
- They're just famished.
- Good to know!

627
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:36,874
As I was saying, where is your girlfriend? What's her name again?

628
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,877
Oh, Pearl? It's been a long time since we broke up.

629
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,839
I'm sorry to hear that. That girl is beautiful.

630
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,174
That's just how it is.

631
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,967
But we're still friends.

632
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,386
Best friends, actually.

633
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,513
That's good to hear!

634
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,848
Do you know what that means?

635
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,975
You still have a chance to get back together!

636
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,315
When I heard that Gav already has a girlfriend,

637
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,276
I felt so relieved!

638
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,238
Why?

639
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,576
You see, when he was a kid, he was such a softie.

640
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,038
We thought he was going to grow up gay.

641
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,667
- Please have more, Aunt Susan.
- And what if he grew up as one?

642
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,169
What do you mean?

643
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,464
If he grew up gay,

644
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,216
then it would be a disappointment!

645
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:32,346
I remember telling his grandma, “You know what, that's just a phase.”

646
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,225
Because Gav grew up with girls as his playmates.

647
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,895
But at least I was proven wrong when he decided to have a girlfriend.

648
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:44,275
Why feel disappointed? There's nothing wrong with being gay.

649
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,194
I didn't mean it that way.

650
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:51,198
In fact, I have a lot of gay friends in our church.

651
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,243
They are fun to be with!

652
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:59,165
They are good performers in our church activities.

653
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:05,921
When I need to get my makeup done, I run to them for help.

654
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,968
By the way, Gav, where will I sleep?

655
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,191
Are you going to stay the night?

656
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,568
Yes, and for a couple of days.

657
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,967
Here's your pillow.

658
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:59,099
Why did you have to rent out your grandma's room?

659
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,854
Aren't you earning enough from your other tenants?

660
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,941
They begged me to allow them, but it's only temporary.

661
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,776
They're already looking for a new apartment.

662
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,028
That's good to know.

663
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,241
Have you thought about your Aunt Myra's request?

664
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,994
She has been convincing you for so long, Gav.

665
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,455
Yes, we've talked about it before.

666
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:26,961
I want you to be near your family.

667
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,715
I don't know what's keeping you from leaving.

668
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:40,349
If you are worrying about who's going to take care of this house

669
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,269
and the other apartments, then I'll take charge.

670
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,689
My son Enzo can help me.

671
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,860
I think our apartments need better supervision.

672
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,993
All right.

673
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,096
How's Enzo, by the way?

674
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,850
Does he still see his child from his ex-girlfriend?

675
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,226
Why did you ask?

676
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,063
Nothing. I just thought about it.

677
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,822
I'll go ahead.

678
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,998
Note to self:

679
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,501
Don't apologize for being who you are.

680
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,300
Hey, baby boy! What happened?

681
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,200
(Terrence Carreon)

682
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,765
Where are you, Cai? I saw your post.

683
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,350
Just getting some fresh air.

684
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,226
Relax, OK?

685
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,479
I get you, boss. It's so frustrating.

686
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,522
I don't want to go out of our room

687
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,734
because I feel like she's watching our every move.

688
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,862
That's what I don't understand.

689
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,074
Why does Gav have to pretend in front of her?

690
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,909
I get where Gav is coming from,

691
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,954
but that doesn't mean that I'll allow his aunt to insult us.

692
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,749
Calm down, OK? Let's just give this one to Gav.

693
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,503
But why? I also know the feeling of being in the closet.

694
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,673
I just didn't expect this kind of reaction from Gav.

695
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,883
Why is he putting up with her?

696
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,345
He was the reason why I came out!

697
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,139
And his aunt is going to stay here for days!

698
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,849
I support you and Gav,

699
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,813
but I'm not leaving this room while she's here.

700
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,690
You're being supportive by doing that?

701
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,941
Yes!

702
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,903
I might not be able control my temper. That would be a bigger problem.

703
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,698
You have a point.

704
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,788
OK.

705
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:15,254
Gav, we can't sleep together.

706
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,215
But why, baby?

707
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:24,471
Your aunt might see us.

708
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,808
You're right, baby.

709
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:32,980
Thank you for being so understanding.

710
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,194
You can always talk to me about it, baby.

711
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:47,995
I don't know why I reacted that way.

712
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:52,166
I got so scared.

713
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,293
What happened, baby?

714
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:04,344
When I was a kid, Aunt Susan paid us a visit.

715
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,389
She told grandma that she'd bring me to church.

716
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,516
Grandma said yes.

717
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,643
When we got to the church, do you know what happened?

718
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,227
What?

719
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,938
They prayed me over like I was possessed by a bad spirit.

720
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,940
- What?!
- I was so young then.

721
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,905
I heard them say that I'd go to hell just because I'm gay,

722
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,449
and that made me hate myself.

723
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,787
I'm sorry, baby.

724
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,457
I didn't know you went through that.

725
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,253
Baby...

726
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,590
You know what,

727
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,052
I thought I was past it.

728
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,432
My grandma showered me with love.

729
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,646
She made me feel that there is nothing wrong with me.

730
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,982
And there's nothing wrong with being gay.

731
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,738
I was happy then.

732
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:12,204
My grandma allowed me to be who I am.

733
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:20,087
But when I saw Aunt Susan again,

734
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,216
the bad memories came rushing back.

735
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,181
Baby, I'm so sorry.

736
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,478
Don't worry,

737
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,108
we'll get rid of your bad memories.

738
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:48,240
All of them, and then we'll replace them with happy and gay memories.

739
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,617
For real, baby?

740
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,289
Baby!

741
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,374
Let's start making new memories, baby!

742
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,751
Aunt Susan might see us!

743
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,504
Just kidding, baby.

744
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,678
Babes!

745
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,556
Yes, your highness?

746
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,892
Excited much?

747
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,438
No, it's just that…

748
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,441
What?

749
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:28,196
My dad doesn't want to hold the fundraising event in our house.

750
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,490
Can we just do it at your place?

751
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,369
My dad will just sponsor our swab tests.

752
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,246
Sure!

753
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,750
Yay! Thanks!

754
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,712
That's better. We'll get a lot of help.

755
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,006
What do you mean?

756
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:51,094
Terrence and Wesley are also staying with us.

757
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,848
What?! Since when?

758
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,433
Why? How?

759
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,978
I have no idea.

760
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:06,276
Awesome! Didn't know you're running an orphanage now.

761
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,404
Are you the Mother Superior, Gav?

762
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,240
Do you want to find another venue?

763
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,451
I was just kidding!

764
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,622
Come over here so we can have fun!

765
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,625
Oh, yes! Definitely!

766
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,710
I'm excited to hear some juicy stories...

767
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,381
I mean, to catch up with you, guys!

768
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,887
Stop it!

769
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,350
Stop it!

770
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,727
Baby!

771
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,164
Ouch!

772
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:18,598
Where are your boarders? Won't they be joining us for dinner?

773
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,268
No, they won't. They ordered take-out.

774
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,980
Such rich kids!

775
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,942
You know what, I smell something fishy.

776
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,736
What do you mean?

777
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,363
I think they are not really friends.

778
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,906
I think they are something else...

779
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,451
Your food tastes so good, Aunt Susan!

780
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,454
- Always a hearty meal!
- Really?

781
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,414
I'll give you my recipe.

782
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,623
Yes, please.

783
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,751
But don't change the topic.

784
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,587
I'm really suspicious of those two.

785
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,423
I think they're doing something horrifying in their room.

786
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,426
Horrifying…

787
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,470
Like what? Spirit of the Glass?

788
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,766
- More horrifying than that.
- Horrifying indeed!

789
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,350
Charot!

790
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,935
What?

791
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,521
What kind of word is that?

792
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,815
Stop using that word, Gavreel,

793
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:12,277
others might think that you're...

794
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:16,448
What's wrong? It only means 'joke.'

795
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,449
It's not a swear word.

796
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,619
Just don't use that word.

797
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,537
And stop changing the topic!

798
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:26,458
I know those two are doing inappropriate things in their room.

799
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,711
Well, it's none of our business.

800
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,171
Why not?

801
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,799
What if they are doing disgusting things?

802
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,717
That's too mean.

803
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:39,805
This is your grandma's house.

804
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:44,434
Shouldn't we respect her memory, Gav?

805
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,813
And Gav, please be mindful next time.

806
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,857
Choose your friends wisely,

807
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,111
because you might end up like them!

808
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,654
End up like what?

809
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,489
Why do you keep butting in?!

810
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,241
I just like asking questions.

811
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,742
- I've noticed that, too!
- Let's just eat.

812
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,954
The food is getting cold. Come on, let's eat.

813
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,583
You know what, Gav, I only say what's best for you.

814
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,294
What if you become gay again?

815
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,550
Listen to me. I'll take you both to church

816
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,136
and have you talk to Pastor Eddie.

817
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,096
I can't take this anymore.

818
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,848
- Why?
- Please, Cairo…

819
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,932
What's happening?

820
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,724
What now, Gav?

821
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,143
Are you just going to tolerate her?

822
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:31,690
She is insulting you and you just want us to keep quiet?!

823
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,693
I'm not insulting you!

824
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,237
I just want to help you!

825
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,573
With all due respect, Aunt Susan,

826
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,533
we don't need your help.

827
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,909
There's nothing wrong with us.

828
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,245
Look how rude you are!

829
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,998
You don't know how to respect people!

830
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,084
I respect those who respect me.

831
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,588
I tried to respect you because you're older than me,

832
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,840
and you're Gav's aunt.

833
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,717
But I've had enough of your insults.

834
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,179
I only care about Gavreel's welfare!

835
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,139
Is there something wrong with that?

836
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,891
Gav…

837
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:12,105
If you don't want to be lectured, then fix yourselves!

838
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,441
We're doing just fine.

839
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,234
I'm not sure about you.

840
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:21,072
How dare you answer back! You're so rude!

841
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,908
What now, Gav?

842
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:27,412
Are you just going to let your friend disrespect me?

843
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,248
- He is not my friend!
- Good for you!

844
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,223
He is my boyfriend.

845
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,976
What did you say?

846
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,603
I said

847
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,605
he is my boyfriend!

848
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,107
What?!

849
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,696
You don't know what you're talking about, Gav.

850
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,158
You're the one who is clueless about me, about us!

851
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,870
Grandma Cora raised me well, that's why I always respect you.

852
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,624
I put up with your insults even though it hurts.

853
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,836
But I won't let you do the same to my baby.

854
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,463
Did you just call him baby?

855
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,298
Yes, I did! He's my baby!

856
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:26,721
You don't know what you're talking about, Gavreel.

857
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,392
Aren't you afraid of God?

858
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:35,480
Please don't use God's name to perpetuate your hate.

859
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,774
You will regret this,

860
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,152
that you refused to listen to me.

861
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,238
Now answer me,

862
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,616
what's really the point of your relationship?

863
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,869
You're just playing house!

864
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:56,418
You both know that your relationship is going nowhere

865
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,256
because you cannot get married!

866
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,009
But what about your husband, Uncle Rody? He slept with another woman, right?

867
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,594
Your son Enzo knocked up a girl and abandoned her.

868
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,596
Did you hear anything from me? Nothing!

869
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,433
- I never said a word!
- Gavreel!

870
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,685
Don't you dare drag them into this.

871
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:17,314
You don't know what my family went through!

872
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:23,403
Why are you fighting for him? What's the point?

873
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,446
You're going to leave soon

874
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:28,325
to be with your Aunt Myra, right?

875
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,454
You're leaving, baby?

876
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,331
Why didn't you tell me?

877
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,876
It's not for you to decide!

878
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:44,466
You're so selfish.

879
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,512
Your Aunt Myra is sick, Gavreel.

880
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,891
Her husband left her alone.

881
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:58,521
Can't you understand how miserable she is?

882
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,693
Aunt Myra is sick?

883
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,282
She doesn't want you to know.

884
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:16,664
But I had to say it, after what happened tonight.

885
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,584
Gavreel,

886
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,256
she has stage 3 cancer.

887
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,560
Think about what's important to you.

888
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,860
Baby…

889
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,246
Baby...

890
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,376
Baby…

891
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,879
Baby…

892
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,699
Baby,

893
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,246
Baby,

894
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,832
here's your coffee.

895
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,622
Good morning.

896
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,008
What a beautiful day.

897
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,177
That's really random.

898
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,471
No, it's not.

899
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,516
It's a beautiful day because

900
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,393
I'm with you,

901
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,396
and finally, Aunt Susan is gone!

902
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,898
But mostly because I'm with you.

903
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,818
Do you think that's a compliment?

904
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:37,824
Well, I just know that this day will be great.

905
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,372
So…

906
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,667
So…

907
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,380
This coffee tastes good.

908
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,758
This coffee tastes good.

909
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,136
Why are you copying me?

910
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,890
Because you don't say what you really want to say.

911
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,687
What do I want to say?

912
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,235
Fine!

913
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,530
I'll say it for both of us.

914
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,117
We're mutually attracted to each other.

915
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,955
And you want to find out the next step.

916
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,335
OK, fine!

917
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,129
That's all I have to say.

918
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,923
How about you? What do you want to say?

919
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,304
You know what, you're such a tease!

920
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:57,987
♪ Speak your heart out ♪

921
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,949
♪ and what it truly desires ♪

922
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:07,372
♪ Because if you won't, ♪

923
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:12,168
♪ you might miss your chance on me ♪

924
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,464
Hi! Good morning!

925
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,465
Hi!

926
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,179
Oh! What do we have here?

927
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,393
Speaking of beautiful…

928
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,480
Oh, you're talking about me?

929
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,982
Who else would it be?

930
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,525
Don't mention it!

931
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,777
Thank you, I appreciate your compliment,

932
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:23,906
but I'll appreciate you more if you'll help me carry my stuff.

933
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,742
- OK.
- Sure.

934
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,161
So, where are my babes?

935
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,580
They're inside.

936
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,918
Let's do this.

937
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,130
Ouch!

938
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,845
We have muscles, but we still lack creativity.

939
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,930
I think we need help.

940
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,810
Your balloons are so expensive. The seller should have inflated these already.

941
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,313
They are eco-friendly, so that will do.

942
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,816
Girl.

943
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,903
Girl, SOS!!!

944
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:05,615
What's up? Seems like you want to tell me something.

945
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,206
I'm worried about Gav.

946
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,125
Look at him, he looks so happy.

947
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:20,713
How much more if he's sad?! You might have a heart attack.

948
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,257
Girl, I'm serious.

949
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:27,303
Oh, I'm sorry. OK, tell me what happened.

950
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,227
Aunt Susan visited us.

951
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,855
I get it! I don't like her too!

952
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,316
She's bad news!

953
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,818
Yes!

954
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:45,154
But do you know that Gav is leaving for the States?

955
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,616
Will he push through with it? Last I heard, he didn't want to.

956
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,955
So it's been his plan all along?

957
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,085
Yes, ever since his grandma died,

958
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,631
his Aunt Myra has always wanted to fly him to New York.

959
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,634
I heard about Aunt Myra

960
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,262
but he never told me that he's leaving.

961
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,848
That's because he doesn't want to.

962
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,976
Aunt Myra has been convincing Gav

963
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,228
because she feels responsible for him.

964
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,105
She never got the chance to return here.

965
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,900
But before the pandemic,

966
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,113
Gav already prepared everything.

967
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,907
He only needed a plane ticket and he was good to go.

968
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,619
But the pandemic happened?

969
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:37,915
No.

970
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,418
You happened.

971
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:12,241
But that's not the bad news.

972
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,538
Aunt Susan told us that Aunt Myra is sick.

973
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,375
Oh my god!

974
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:27,506
That's not how he copes. He hides it's when he's stressed.

975
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,217
Just like when his grandma died.

976
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,637
That's why I'm worried!

977
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,640
How about you?

978
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:40,645
How do you feel about the whole situation?

979
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:03,542
Hi! It's your girl, Pearl! Welcome to my VG live!

980
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:07,421
As you can see, this is the mini stage for our fundraising event

981
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,799
for the benefit of our online learners.

982
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,133
Awesome, right?!

983
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,428
So guys, open your purse. You'll be entertained,

984
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,972
and you can help as well!

985
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,516
Are you ready to hear me sing?

986
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,558
No!

987
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,144
Really? I already have bashers?

988
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,438
You're giving me vertigo! Stop it!

989
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,940
- Hello!
- Hello!

990
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,984
It's not your turn yet! Wait for me to call you!

991
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,945
This isn't a talent show!

992
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:31,946
We're just excited.

993
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,197
It isn't obvious!

994
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,699
Sorry, Pearl.

995
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,658
Apology accepted!

996
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,243
Wait, let's read the comments.

997
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,869
Here, let's read this one:

998
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:42,915
“Wow, CaiReel! Thanks, your highness!” You're welcome!

999
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,750
Of course, it's my responsibility

1000
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:49,505
since I'm the president of CaiReel Nation... Cavite chapter!

1001
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,049
Don't worry, we all got negative swab test results,

1002
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:54,218
and we're just at home.

1003
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:58,806
Wait, someone is wondering why you're here.

1004
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,516
Because this is my house?

1005
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:05,438
Silly! I mean, invite our viewers to our event!

1006
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,066
Guys, watch out for our surprise for all of you!

1007
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,484
What surprise are you talking about, baby?

1008
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:11,527
It's a surprise!

1009
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,903
And what's all this commotion about?

1010
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,948
Oh my god, Chill!

1011
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,701
Wait, wait, wait, say hi!

1012
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,535
Hello!

1013
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,829
Our special guest has arrived!

1014
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:26,042
Actually, we still have a lot of surprises for you on Saturday, so watch out!

1015
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,961
Bye!

1016
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,967
What took you so long? We've been waiting for you!

1017
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,596
I waited for my swab test result! Good thing it was negative.

1018
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,975
Pearl told us that you'll help us improve our set?

1019
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,856
I think all of you need to take another swab test

1020
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,525
because you've lost your taste.

1021
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,985
Kidding!

1022
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,780
What you did was OK,

1023
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,074
we just need to redo everything.

1024
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,202
Just kidding!

1025
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,246
What do we need to do?

1026
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,498
I'll do whatever you want.

1027
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,375
In fairness to you, you're such a trouper.

1028
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,961
I just need to be busy.

1029
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,880
Oh, we still have other...

1030
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,852
Pearl, did you set me up?

1031
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,231
What set up are you talking about?

1032
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,857
What is Terrence doing here?

1033
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,110
You didn't know? I thought you're friends on Screentime?

1034
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,445
Didn't you see his posts?

1035
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,364
No, because I blocked him.

1036
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:43,702
What? I didn't know, I'm sorry.
You never told me about it.

1037
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,538
I'm sorry, Pearl, but I have to go.

1038
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:47,081
What?

1039
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:47,998
Wait…

1040
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,084
OK, I understand.

1041
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,002
Baby, what's happening?

1042
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,629
I have no idea.

1043
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,463
Don't touch me!

1044
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,715
Stop it, guys! You might hurt each other!

1045
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:57,675
Can you just talk calmly...

1046
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:58,551
I got this!

1047
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,553
OK, fine.

1048
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,764
- Achilles, talk to me, please!
- We don't have anything to talk about, Terrence.

1049
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,933
- Achilles!
- Terrence, I get it, OK?!

1050
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,727
It's just that I am not emotionally prepared for this encounter.

1051
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:09,895
I just want to explain.

1052
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,815
And what? Make me feel pathetic again?

1053
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:22,825
Terrence!

1054
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:23,826
Gavreel!

1055
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,787
I'm talking to Terrence.

1056
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,747
Just let him be.

1057
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,999
Let me be?!

1058
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,209
Calm down, guys!

1059
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,128
What a way to invalidate my feelings, Terrence!

1060
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,921
Gavreel, she has stage 3 cancer.

1061
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,382
Think about what's important to you.

1062
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:42,887
- Aren't you afraid of God?
- What's really the point of your relationship?

1063
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,848
You're going to leave soon
to be with your Aunt Myra, right?

1064
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,479
- Oh my god, Gav!
- Baby!

1065
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:53,439
Baby!

1066
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,690
- Gav!
- Baby!

1067
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,113
Baby!

1068
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,629
Gav!

1069
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:17,963
What's wrong?

1070
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,965
- Hey, Gav!
- Where are you going?

1071
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,842
Baby!

1072
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,972
Hold on, baby!

1073
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:29,058
Where are you going?

1074
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,517
Baby!

1075
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:34,855
I don't know!

1076
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,149
I'll join you!

1077
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,945
Baby, please just let me be.

1078
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,196
No, I won't!

1079
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,201
Baby…

1080
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,118
No!

1081
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:51,830
You can ignore me all you want,

1082
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,625
but I just want to be with you.

1083
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,626
OK?

1084
01:10:56,043 --> 01:11:00,339
I won't let you go through your struggles alone.

1085
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,967
Baby, please?

1086
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,139
Baby…

1087
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,979
Girl, are you OK?

1088
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,898
I just need some space to breathe.

1089
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,609
OK. I'll just get something. Stay here.

1090
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,026
OK.

1091
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:44,902
OK.

1092
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,171
Achilles, can we talk?

1093
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:06,256
And what? You'll apologize again?

1094
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:07,966
That's the right thing to do.

1095
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:12,012
Why do I feel like you're only saying sorry
just to feel good about yourself?

1096
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,600
That's unfair. I'm saying sorry because I want us to be OK.

1097
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,937
What if I don't want to make peace with you,
would you still apologize?

1098
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,940
Yes, I will always apologize to you.

1099
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,193
Can you tell me why I'm mad at you?

1100
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,362
What do you think?

1101
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,448
I'm sorry, I stood you up.

1102
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,909
I know I was an asshole.

1103
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,498
"Anybody can fall for you."

1104
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,334
"Maybe the timing wasn't right for us."

1105
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,503
What?

1106
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,088
Those were your words, Terrence!

1107
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,925
You know, I was ready to move on.
I was ready to become your friend again.

1108
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,761
But why did you have to say those words?

1109
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:56,348
I was stupid to believe what you said.

1110
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:57,724
But I meant it.

1111
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:00,352
You were just bored and had no one to talk to

1112
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,896
that's why you thought of flirting with me.

1113
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,108
I meant every word I said that night.

1114
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:06,984
Maybe if...

1115
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,862
If you had not met that other guy,

1116
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,406
you would have fallen for me?

1117
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,366
You know what, Terrence,

1118
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:16,368
I don't want to be your plan B,

1119
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,327
OK?

1120
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:21,498
Maybe I'd be happier for you in the future, but for now,

1121
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,626
I'll have to think about it.

1122
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,797
I'm sorry.

1123
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,800
OK.

1124
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,023
Are you OK, sis?

1125
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,400
- Yes, of course!
- Are you sure?

1126
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,028
You want me to drive you home?

1127
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,947
No need, girl! We're professionals here.

1128
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:58,869
I won't be wasting my swab test nor my time for a guy.

1129
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,372
- Fierce!
- You know me!

1130
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,528
Baby…

1131
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,572
Baby, look…

1132
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:37,157
Look at the view. Wake up, baby.

1133
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:38,784
Baby...

1134
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:42,037
- What's wrong, baby?
- Take a look.

1135
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,872

Come on, stop fooling around.

1151
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,418
Stop it!

1152
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,532
Thank you, baby.

1153
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:28,954
For what, baby?

1154
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,624
You insisted on coming here with me.

1155
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,962
Who taught me to be insistent?

1156
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:46,722
I get so sad at home because it's so quiet and I'm all alone.

1157
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:53,061
Now it's rowdy back there.

1158
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:58,775
That's why I ran away

1159
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:01,820
because I want to process what's happening.

1160
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,741
Don't think about it for now, baby.

1161
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:10,162
I'll accept whatever your decision is.

1162
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,705
OK?

1163
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:17,794
But we're partners, baby.
I always have to consider what you feel.

1164
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:25,677
Your Aunt Myra needs you, baby.

1165
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:32,851
We don't even know if Aunt Susan was telling the truth.

1166
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:36,980
She just wants to take over our business.

1167
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:41,985
Aunt Myra never told me anything about her condition.

1168
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:50,202
Maybe you need to talk to Aunt Myra first.

1169
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:53,288
What do you think?

1170
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,377
It's best to hear it straight from her.

1171
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,591
Why do I feel like you want me to leave?

1172
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,802
I didn't mean it that way.

1173
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,429
I just want to let you know

1174
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,183
that I would understand

1175
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:16,019
if you really have to leave.

1176
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:20,148
I'm also leaving, right?

1177
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,900
I'm going back to our province.

1178
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,944
It's not the same, baby.

1179
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,947
We already have a plan, right?

1180
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,991
I'll visit you in your province every month.

1181
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:35,789
You'll just finish college and then
you'll ask for your mom's permission

1182
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:40,877
so you can go back here, and we can be together, finally.

1183
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:42,796
How will that happen if I'm in New York...

1184
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:46,132
We can still make a new plan.

1185
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,930
Easy for you to say.

1186
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:53,723
What?

1187
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:58,353
Of course not, baby.

1188
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:05,026
I knew from the start that this is just temporary.

1189
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:12,367
In the morning when I wake up and see your face,

1190
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:17,414
it just makes me so happy.

1191
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,167
My favorite time of the day is when we eat together.

1192
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:24,296
I don't like sleeping next to someone.

1193
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:29,342
But I'll miss your loud snores, for sure.

1194
01:21:29,342 --> 01:21:32,637
This isn't easy for me, baby,
I don't want you to have a hard time...

1195
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:46,443
That was so sweet, baby.

1196
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:50,238
I am madly in love with you, baby.

1197
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,116
You sure are.

1198
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:55,869
How about you?

1199
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:06,963
Let's talk about our plans after I make a call to Aunt Myra.

1200
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:24,900
(GAVREEL & CAIRO
NO MATTER WHAT)

1201
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:52,342
Nice parking, baby.

1202
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:31,840
Baby, I'll be outside. Just call me if you need me.

1203
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,134
This won't take long.

1204
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,802
I know.

1205
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:41,933
Hi, Gavreel!

1206
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:43,768
Hi, Aunt Myra.

1207
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:48,106
What's with the face?

1208
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:50,358
Aunt Myra...

1209
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,117
That's why I didn't want to let you know.

1210
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:03,121
Look at you.

1211
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:08,251
So handsome and yet, you can't even smile at me.

1212
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:11,171
Why didn't you tell me?

1213
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,971
Because I don't want you to worry about me.

1214
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:24,267
I don't want you to go here just because you feel sorry for me.

1215
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:28,063
I don't want to play the pity card. No way.

1216
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:35,612
I want you to decide on your own.

1217
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,366
I'm not aware

1218
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:43,495
because I always missed your calls.

1219
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:48,291
I know the reason why.

1220
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:55,840
But I'm not asking you to come here

1221
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:59,469
to take care of me.

1222
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,679
In fact,

1223
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,433
I want to take care of you while I still can.

1224
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:10,230
I owe your parents a lot,

1225
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,940
and I haven't been with you for a long time,

1226
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,983
so I want to make it up to you.

1227
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,862
You always take care of me.

1228
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:21,950
But I can still do more if you'll let me.

1229
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:27,956
I hope I'm not asking too much, sweetie pie.

1230
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:30,333
But please...

1231
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:35,338
Can you come and live with me here in New York?

1232
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:45,306
Rain or shine, nothing can stop us! So let's do this!

1233
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:49,936
Your donation of any amount can help a lot of students.

1234
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:53,565
Again, check the details below. Thank you!

1235
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:58,570

Can't we just e-mail it? Or post it on Screentime.

1257
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:39,796
No, baby. We need to put it in a time capsule.

1258
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:46,135
My baby is so romantic.
So we're not going to read it yet?

Guys, sorry for disturbing your alone time together.

Sorry for intruding your space and eating some of your food.

1313
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:36,147
But thank you for being so accommodating.

1314
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:41,944
No worries, it was a lot of fun! There were no boring days, right?

1315
01:35:41,944 --> 01:35:44,071
If you're worrying about their honeymoon,

1316
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:47,950
then worry not because girl, it was really mind-blowing!

1317
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:50,411
How did you know?

1318
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,037
Weren't you able to hear them?

1319
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:53,789
I thought there was a dog fight!

1320
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:01,297
That's why you snuck out of your room!

1321
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:04,550
You guys are just envious! Right, baby?

1322
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:07,261
I admit, I've been stuck in dry season for so long.

1323
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:10,473
Seriously? That bad? That's crazy!

1324
01:36:10,473 --> 01:36:12,266
You may leave now so we can continue.

1325
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:13,517
Jerk!

1326
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:21,609
Thank you, Cai.

1327
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:28,532
- Master!
- Boss!

1328
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:29,992
Thank you.

1329
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:46,133
Thank you.

1330
01:36:55,392 --> 01:37:00,231
Look, baby, he's so dramatic!

1331
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:03,526
Don't worry about it.

1332
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,674
Your highness.

1333
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:31,762
I love you, babes!

1334
01:37:31,762 --> 01:37:33,597
I love you!

1335
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:55,953
Come on, guys!

1336
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,642
Wait!

1337
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:21,103
- Let's take a selfie!
- Game!

1338
01:38:21,103 --> 01:38:23,689
One… two… three!

1339
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:25,107
Smile!

1340
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,223
Baby, if you'll stop me from leaving, better do it now.

1341
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:40,557
Silly!

1342
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,769
We've already talked about this, right?

1343
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:46,438
You'll go straight to the international airport,

1344
01:39:46,438 --> 01:39:48,941
while I'll take the domestic flight.

1345
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,445
Did you tell the driver to pass through the back gate?

1346
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:56,198
Yes, so you can take the front gate.

1347
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,283
OK.

1348
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:01,578
Don't look back, OK?

1349
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:04,873
Even if I'll just give you a flying kiss?

1350
01:40:04,873 --> 01:40:06,542
Yes.

1351
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:11,005
You might not be able to keep yourself from running after me.

1352
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:13,632
I'm sure you'll do the same.

1353
01:40:13,632 --> 01:40:16,593
Definitely.

1354
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:20,139
That's why we have to do this, baby.

1355
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:26,186
Can I hug you?

1356
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:39,033
Ouch.

1357
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,576
Baby!

1358
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,077
Ouch!

1359
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:48,417
- Ouch. Enough, baby!
- I won't let you go!

1360
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,336
Wait, baby. Enough.

1361
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:02,890

I said...

1384
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:30,102
