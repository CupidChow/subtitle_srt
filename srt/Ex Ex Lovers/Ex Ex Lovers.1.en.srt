1
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,109
Mr. C's special guest.

2
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,029
Follow me, ma'am.

3
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,156
- Thank you.
- You may take your seat now.

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,785
Is Ced coming?

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:21,915
Let me prepare your favorite, porchetta.

6
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,005
I have a date with my daughter, SC.

7
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,925
She's running late because

8
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,093
her boyfriend gave her a surprise.

9
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,222
I mean, what can I say?

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,474
I'm just her mom.

11
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,100
Joy, come on.

12
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,520
Like you've never had

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,816
a love that defies all odds.

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,653
I've experienced that, haven't I?

15
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,029
I'm past that now.

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,823
Mom!

17
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,740
SC!

18
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,492
SC…

19
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,662
Been waiting long?

20
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,955
Why are you here?

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,623
What do you mean?

22
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,709
I mean…

23
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,629
I thought it was just me and my daughter.

24
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,590
And besides, it's only a table for two…

25
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,429
- Thank you, Mr. C.
- You…

26
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,306
<i>Have you been here long?</i>

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>- Pretty much, dear.</i>
<i>- Ma'am.</i>

28
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,896
Sorry for the hassle. Plans changed a bit.

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,440
- I… I just want…
- Joey, it's fine.

30
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,484
You're already here.

31
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,572
Mom, Happy Valentine's Day.
Give us a smile.

32
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>Sweetie, can we skip the videos?</i>

33
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:44,539
<i>I better not see my face on your</i>
<i>business's Facebook page again.</i>

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,293
Mom, the business is mine and Joey's.

35
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,294
It's ours.

36
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,885
Love, it's our song.

37
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,680
Why did you stop them?

38
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,806
I just…

39
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,225
Are you hungry?

40
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,810
- Um…
- Shall we order?

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,937
Joy, shall we eat now?

42
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,523
Let's get the… the menu.

43
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,609
All right. Sir…

44
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,572
- For my mom?
- For me?

45
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,573
Sir…

46
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,659
- From whom?
- Do you love me?

47
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,036
Mom, from whom?

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,709
Love…

49
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,463
- He's proposing!
- Love…

50
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,813
Ma'am. Please, may I?

51
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,525
Ma'am…

52
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,403
Mom.

53
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,739
Ma'am?

54
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,116
Ma'am.

55
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,493
Mom.

56
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,374
Mom!

57
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,375
Ma'am…

58
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,336
- Mom.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,387
Love.

60
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,894
Best friend again?

61
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,229
Been there, done that.

62
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,146
That's not…

63
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,619
- Yes, Love.
- No.

64
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,092
Ouch.

65
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,975
Gosh, what's with Joey?

66
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,395
Whatever happened to
asking for a parent's blessing

67
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,730
before proposing?

68
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,691
Mom, he did try to call you.

69
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,944
You were just so busy
with work at the bank.

70
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:24,449
Ah… So, it's my fault

71
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,244
that I'm a single mom
who's working hard to support us?

72
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,747
You're still young.

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,373
Why the rush?

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,667
Let me see.

75
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,210
You're pregnant?

76
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,547
Mom, come on.
Just because I'm getting married young

77
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,257
doesn't mean I'm pregnant.

78
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,676
Then why are you so eager to get married?

79
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,971
Because it's more practical.

80
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,641
We'll save more with both of us earning.

81
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,229
And Mom, I love Joey.

82
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,774
I love him so much.

83
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,203
Sweetie, I've heard that before.

84
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,247
And it didn't end well.

85
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,085
Your dad and I were just 23,
like you, when we got married.

86
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,586
And then?

87
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,630
Nothing, right?

88
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,882
Nothing, no happily ever after.

89
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,258
Not even a miracle.

90
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,469
And to top it off, no divorce!

91
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,472
Joey and I aren't like you two.

92
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,852
Mom, it's finally sinking in
that I'm engaged.

93
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,899
There's just one thing I'd like to ask.

94
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,901
Anything for you, sweetie.

95
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,779
I know

96
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,574
we haven't seen him
for more than a decade.

97
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,204
Mom, can Dad walk me down the aisle?

98
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,544
Is that a yes?

99
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,796
Mom…

100
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,845
I planted the seeds, prepared the grain.

101
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,638
All on my own.

102
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,975
Now that good-for-nothing man
reaps the harvest?

103
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,061
She even wants her dad
to walk her down the aisle.

104
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,563
Unbelievable.

105
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,692
That must really sting.

106
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,319
Come on.

107
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,740
Why didn't you tell SC about all the crap…

108
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,619
about her dad?

109
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,498
You cried buckets of tears, remember?

110
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,876
Mimi, come on.

111
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,130
Ced is still SC's dad, after all.

112
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,549
I can't let my kid get hurt.

113
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,136
So I called for backup.

114
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,596
Who?

115
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,141
You know, the friend you always listen to.

116
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,147
Our friend who's always
too busy to stick around?

117
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,693
Yes, the one who shares recipes
and sends us food.

118
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,820
Seriously? That's impossible!

119
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,781
She's so busy, we can barely contact her!

120
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,035
That's so sweet. I'm so touched!

121
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,287
I'm here.

122
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,081
Oh! It's an honor.

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,667
Glad you could fit us in.

124
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,880
It's all because of our ex-friend,
who not only mistreated you

125
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,508
but also owes you a lot of money.

126
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,344
And now he gets to walk
my goddaughter down the aisle?

127
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,180
That can't happen.
Where is he? Still in Saudi?

128
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,891
I'll talk to him myself.

129
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,184
This can't be.

130
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,687
He's only been there for two years.
He fled from his employer.

131
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,315
Then he moved to Italy,
but he didn't stick around.

132
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,441
How do you know?

133
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,776
Are you two talking?

134
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,490
Since he can't borrow from you anymore.

135
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,993
I lent him money for Malta.

136
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,286
Give me a break!

137
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,538
You lent him money?

138
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,622
Malta?

139
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,918
He's now in Valletta.

140
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,881
So he's in Malta.

141
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,800
Getting him home won't be easy!

142
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
He's got another family?

143
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,854
I don't care about him.

144
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,607
That's how it should be,
because seriously,

145
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,443
- after abandoning you like that…
- Yes.

146
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,405
…he thinks he can come back anytime?

147
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,074
- That's not how it works.
- Well, here I am.

148
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,368
I fell in love, got hurt,

149
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,494
and fell.

150
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,621
But I stood up again.

151
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,665
And… all on my own!

152
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,960
Then I kept going
and faced life with a smile.

153
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,504
And now he'll show up
like nothing happened?

154
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,006
He expects me to forgive him?

155
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,133
And it's on you if you don't forgive.

156
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,050
Exactly.

157
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,970
All your sacrifices as a mother
are just ignored,

158
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,139
but his wrongdoings get brushed aside

159
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,141
just because he decides to come back.

160
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,519
It's so unfair being a woman
with these double standards.

161
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,104
Here's an idea.

162
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:09,150
I'll have a word with SC
about keeping Cedric out of this.

163
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:15,281
The question is, can she resist
our goddaughter's request?

164
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,199
Tell me about it.

165
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,568
<i>Dad!</i>

166
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,695
<i>Wow!</i>

167
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:59,116
<i>There's nothing a hot soup can't fix.</i>

168
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,786
<i>Dad, stay here, okay?</i>

169
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>Of course.</i>

170
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,875
<i>I'll stay here with you forever</i>
<i>if that's what you want.</i>

171
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,918
<i>Here, have some.</i>

172
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,173
<i>Smell it first.</i>

173
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,511
<i>Careful, it's hot.</i>

174
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,602
You've got to be kidding me.

175
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,089
There you go, Mom. You're ready to fly.

176
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,549
Good grief.

177
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,053
Are you running a travel agency now?

178
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,888
I mean, you arranged everything.

179
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,938
I've also done your packing.

180
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,523
I don't want you exhausted.

181
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,026
Sweetie, you're not coming with me?

182
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,864
Mom, I need to help Joey
with the wedding preparation.

183
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,032
Can't he do it on his own?

184
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,202
Mom, he's under a lot of pressure.

185
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,539
Plus, his dad Andres
is flying in from the States

186
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,125
and he wants us to meet him right away.

187
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,169
Seriously?

188
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,673
So their family comes first over me.

189
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,550
Oh, no, Mom.

190
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,011
- So dramatic.
- So dramatic.

191
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,431
Mom.

192
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,809
Here you go. Don't forget this.

193
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,311
This is too big.

194
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,937
It fits in your luggage.

195
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,691
So he knows what's going on with us.

196
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,402
Sweetie,

197
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,240
just know that I'm doing this for you.

198
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,621
That's why I'm thankful
for you doing this.

199
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,208
Having you and Dad on my wedding day

200
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,294
would make it the happiest day of my life.

201
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,133
<i>Traffic's insane!</i>

202
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,843
<i>I've only had one ride so far,</i>

203
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,387
<i>and these bikers are making it worse!</i>

204
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,325
<i>Actually, it's really beautiful.</i>

205
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,120
<i>As beautiful as the past may be,</i>

206
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,206
<i>we have to move on.</i>

207
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,295
<i>Maybe I can ask around. Wait.</i>

208
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,172
<i>Wait. I mean, stop the car.</i>

209
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,883
- Hello.
- Hello.

210
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,646
Thank you.

211
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,484
Lady, can I help you?

212
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,520
He owes me a lot of money.

213
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,272
And doesn't pay me back.

214
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,566
- And I could go on and on.
- Okay, lady.

215
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,611
I told him I loved him.
He said, "Thank you"?

216
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,825
- Bites off more than he can chew,
- Okay…

217
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,244
and I'm always the one
cleaning up the mess.

218
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,830
Gosh, exhausting!

219
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,098
Isn't your friend supposed to
handle the flowers?

220
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,977
<i>But his mom Sophia</i>
<i>is allergic to certain flowers.</i>

221
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,605
<i>So they're sticking with their florist.</i>

222
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,316
Seriously, I don't get it.

223
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,276
Why are you just going along with this?

224
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,486
Hold on.

225
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,489
Joey's not pressuring you, right?

226
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,573
<i>Mom, relax.</i>

227
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,284
<i>Just make sure you find Dad there, okay?</i>

228
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,494
<i>- Take care.</i>
- Sweetie…

229
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,371
<i>I'll go see Joey first.</i>

230
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,331
Oh my, SC…

231
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,797
Yes, ma'am?

232
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,923
My love?

233
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,553
My love?

234
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,097
Best friend?

235
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,893
Uh… How do you know that?

236
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,771
Do you know Ced?

237
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,317
You know Ced?

238
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:32,366
Tell me where that bastard is.

239
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,787
Or else, this restaurant will go down!

240
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,873
- We'll tell you where he is.
- My love, calm down.

241
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,542
Still not yet here.

242
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,752
Yes, I've been waiting.

243
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,424
I told my friends over there
to share my location.

244
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,968
Yeah.

245
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,887
All right.

246
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,305
I'll update you later.

247
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,516
I love you, sweetheart.

248
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,331
Mi!

249
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,625
<i>- Sis!</i>
- Oh, my God.

250
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,503
Look at this!

251
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,880
It's massive.

252
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,881
Look.

253
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,215
So beautiful.

254
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,800
Beautiful, right?

255
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,719
Look at this.

256
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,557
Was I completely wrong about him?

257
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,685
<i>He's no longer a bum?</i>

258
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,314
<i>Has he actually changed his life?</i>

259
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,694
Fine, let's say he's changed.

260
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,613
Let me remind you,

261
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,866
he left you and SC.

262
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,368
What if he has another family?

263
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,247
No, that's impossible
because we're still married.

264
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,125
Maybe this is all…

265
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,544
some kind of catfishing.

266
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,962
And…

267
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,633
the real Ced might've been kidnapped.

268
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,635
You're so dramatic!

269
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,931
But I feel like that's his house.

270
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,265
No way.

271
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
This looks haunted.

272
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,521
<i>He probably got it dirt cheap.</i>

273
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,525
<i>Eyes on the prize, girl.</i>

274
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,903
You're there to find Ced for SC.

275
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,221
I think this is the one.

276
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,300
Ced is the most… horrible!

277
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,888
Haughty, high-on-his-horse
Filipino I know.

278
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,557
And if you think this is funny,

279
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,937
- then you are not…
- My love! You're so loud.

280
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,022
You'll disturb the neighbors.

281
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,857
They'll think you're crazy!

282
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,360
Let go of me! Let me go!

283
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,569
Okay!

284
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,906
- Ouch!
- Careful, you're past your prime.

285
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,158
You're still such a jerk.

286
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,368
That hurts, Ced.

287
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,245
Give me a break!

288
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,412
Don't.

289
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,084
Perfect timing, my love.

290
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,921
I'm cooking your favorite <i>adobo,</i>
my special <i>adobo.</i>

291
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,256
Wow.

292
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,424
You're cooking now?

293
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,509
Yeah.

294
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,971
Back then, you'd only cook
when you felt guilty.

295
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,348
Whose house is this anyway?

296
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,349
This isn't yours.

297
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,435
If it were, you'd at least have a cleaner.

298
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,105
Well, I'm disciplined with my money.

299
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,481
Disciplined?

300
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,819
Weren't you drowning in debt before?

301
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,487
Hey, I've changed.

302
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,407
It's expensive to hire
a cleaner here in Malta.

303
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,742
Besides, you're being too harsh.

304
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,495
Do you still think so little of me?

305
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,165
Like I still can't provide for you and SC?

306
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,003
Like I'm still stuck in a band in Baguio?

307
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,921
Is that how you still see me?

308
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,466
How about this?

309
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,384
What?

310
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,510
These photos.

311
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,720
Oh, those?

312
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,096
Who are these people?

313
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,682
- Um…
- Tell me.

314
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,143
My love.

315
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,854
- Why? What happened?
- Hide for now. Come on!

316
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,564
- Come here.
- Let me go!

317
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,815
- Go hide.
- Don't hurt me!

318
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,235
- Hide here, my love.
- Ouch.

319
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,737
That hurts!

320
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,904
You bastard!

321
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,703
Why are you back so soon?

322
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,461
You have no right to be part of
my daughter's wedding.

323
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,899
My special <i>adobo.</i>

324
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,368
I'm sorry, Ced.

325
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,370
Just do your job well.

326
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,081
I'll take care of the rest.

327
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,166
Why don't you take a stroll?

328
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,768
Clean the living room.

329
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,186
I'll do the kitchen.

330
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,238
Those guys are assholes.

331
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,156
Just because they're rich,

332
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,408
that doesn't mean they own you.

333
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,163
Here. You can still get up?

334
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:39,960
Ouch.

335
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,671
My love, are you all right?

336
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,009
Nice!

337
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,061
Hey, they tipped well.

338
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,938
Don't forget my share.

339
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,650
Joy, thank you.

340
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,490
- Hey.
- Hm?

341
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,368
I helped you clean.
I did not forgive you.

342
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,620
Oh, my love.

343
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,999
It's been years, and you're still mad?

344
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:24,588
'Cause it's been 10 years,
and you're still lying.

345
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,884
What brought you here?

346
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,927
You missed me, didn't you?

347
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,470
Hey.

348
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,765
After all the support I gave you,

349
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,267
what happened?

350
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,271
You blew all my savings
to apply for work in Saudi.

351
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,066
Didn't I do that for the both of us?

352
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:49,321
Ah… For the both of us?

353
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,699
Then why did you decide on your own?

354
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,951
And then what? What did you do?

355
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,453
You left the Philippines.

356
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,038
You left me alone.

357
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:01,374
I had to tell each person
that we're not together anymore.

358
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,876
And the worst part?

359
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,630
After a decade,
I'm still stuck with your surname.

360
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,633
When do I finally get to be Joy San Pedro?

361
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,509
I'm still stuck with you.

362
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,608
Another call for work?

363
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,027
I need to go. I can't mess this up.

364
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,029
Hey.

365
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,572
You're running from me again.

366
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,658
I know you too well, Cedric.

367
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,243
- Hey, Cedric!
- Come on!

368
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,036
- Ced!
- Come!

369
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,956
Ced…

370
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,543
Here's that super yummy
chocolate cake I made just for you.

371
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,045
Ced, sing for us!

372
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,756
- Yeah, let's give it up for Ced.
- I cooked for you,

373
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,092
and now you want me to sing too?

374
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,887
The cooking's paid for,
but the singing is on you.

375
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,889
Come on, it's my birthday anyway.

376
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,101
Gosh. I know you're loving my food,

377
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,271
but are you guys also
that into my singing?

378
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,398
I guess this song works.

379
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,526
We still have to talk.

380
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,404
This song is special not only to you,

381
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,365
but also to my duet partner.

382
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,449
Here's Joy!

383
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,575
You mean "My Love"?

384
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,828
No, it's impossible.
She's in the Philippines.

385
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,746
No, she's here. I invited her.

386
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,914
Joy!

387
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,873
Come here.

388
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,709
- It's really her!
- It's My Love!

389
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,546
She personally requested to sing.

390
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,755
Joy!

391
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,758
Good grief. Why'd you bring me here?

392
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,510
You'll like this for sure.

393
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,887
A round of applause!

394
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,888
Sing!

395
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,807
Dumbfounded

396
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,017
Sing!

397
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:48,398
<i>I'm feeling giddy over this shy guy</i>

398
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,775
<i>Keeps sneaking glances</i>

399
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,487
<i>If you leave him, he'll be devastated</i>

400
00:26:55,447 --> 00:27:01,536
<i>But you are too much</i>
<i>Can't be won by tenderness</i>

401
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,833
<i>Even a cute girl like me might get tired</i>

402
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,755
<i>Could you tell me?</i>

403
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,673
<i>If you're feeling it</i>

404
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,633
Thank God this reunion happened!

405
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,969
<i>Just say it for my heart wants you</i>

406
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,263
What a great time to be alive!

407
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:28,313
<i>If you're staying quiet</i>
<i>I'll be the one to make the move</i>

408
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:31,483
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
- I don't want to! Kiss, you say?

409
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,234
- This is crazy!
- I'm so shy.

410
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,111
I'm super shy, you know.

411
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,571
- Kiss!
- Come on, guys.

412
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,574
All right, fine.
Let's give them what they want.

413
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,201
- Just one kiss!
- Gosh!

414
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,160
Just a peck.

415
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,204
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

416
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,206
- No!
- A quick peck, okay?

417
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,832
Don't get carried away.

418
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,627
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

419
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,713
Ouch!

420
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,424
- You're driving me nuts!
- Ouch! That hurts.

421
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,218
- Hold on.
- Let's get some ice.

422
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,553
I got knocked over, but I'm all right.

423
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,222
Give Joy a seat.

424
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,015
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Ced…

425
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,518
Joy, Ced is right.

426
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,144
You're the best singer.

427
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,147
And the best mother, best friend,

428
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,691
best character, best everything!

429
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,444
Ced's got a ton of stories about you.

430
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,529
True!

431
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:21,658
This guy's not just hardworking,
but super kind, too.

432
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,284
Shush, come on. Stop it.

433
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,412
When you're down to nothing,

434
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,914
he'll even give you his own job.

435
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,916
Then he'll help you find another.

436
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,836
He's done so much for all of us here.

437
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,963
That's why we're so glad you're here.

438
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,299
Because it makes him happy.

439
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,594
Shush!

440
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,055
All right, that's enough.

441
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,390
But thank you.

442
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,857
Oh, that hurts.

443
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,736
Why didn't you answer it?

444
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,073
Your sweetheart might get upset.

445
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,035
Joy…

446
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,913
Are you jealous?

447
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,461
Hush!

448
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,259
I'm here because of your daughter.

449
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,635
Not for you.

450
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,139
I smell trouble. I'd rather not be here.
Excuse me.

451
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,184
Cut it out. Enough.

452
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
Your daughter's getting married.

453
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,611
You must've forgotten we have a daughter.

454
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,114
And she wants you

455
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,909
to walk her down the aisle.

456
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,204
Isn't it unfair?

457
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,916
I'm the one who raised her.

458
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,167
All by myself.

459
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,297
But on the most important day of her life,

460
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,592
I'm the one being pushed aside.

461
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,183
I've tried so many times
to reach out to you, Joy.

462
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,352
You know that.

463
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,939
But…

464
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,984
I'll come home for our daughter.

465
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:29,494
Especially now that I know
you're still full of lies.

466
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,498
And you still have so many secrets.

467
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,460
Secret? Seriously?

468
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,963
Fine, if you want proof,
I have nothing to hide.

469
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,631
Come with me tomorrow.

470
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,715
Are you serious?

471
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,260
You're hurt, and you still want to work?

472
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,304
There's no such thing as being sick here.

473
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,979
Hey, stop acting jealous.

474
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,230
I'm not jealous!

475
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,857
You're getting all worked up.

476
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,486
If you're really not jealous,
then join me in my work tomorrow.

477
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,824
I mean, whatever!

478
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,951
Give me a break.

479
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,207
Dear, did you get a haircut?

480
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,043
<i>It gets way too hot covering events.</i>

481
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,087
<i>So I cut my hair short.</i>

482
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,507
<i>Mommy Sophia doesn't like it,</i>
<i>which is kinda a red flag.</i>

483
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,260
<i>She's insisting I wear</i>
<i>hair extensions for the wedding.</i>

484
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,678
She really said that?

485
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,888
<i>Yes, Mom.</i>

486
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,473
<i>Joey says it's just</i>
<i>her being a perfectionist.</i>

487
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,435
But they shouldn't treat
you like that, sweetie.

488
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
Should I just head home?

489
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,733
Hey, yeah?

490
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,109
Yes, what is it?

491
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,236
Do you have ants in your pants?

492
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,030
Nothing. Let's go.

493
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,448
We have a lot to do.

494
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,699
Let me help you.

495
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,577
- You all right? Sure?
- Let's go. Yeah, hurry.

496
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,257
What's that?

497
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,846
You a snake or something?

498
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,434
What now?

499
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,311
- For me?
- Yes.

500
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,521
Fine, I'll accept it.

501
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,154
I can't.

502
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,329
One more cleaning to go after this.

503
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,041
You can't be serious.

504
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:45,797
Am I really doing your assignments again?

505
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,715
What's going on?

506
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,678
- Here.
- Oh.

507
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,013
My goodness.

508
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:58,559
It feels like I was just
holding our little one yesterday.

509
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,896
Now, she's stubborn

510
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,148
and rushing into marriage.

511
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,359
Why are you so against it?

512
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,404
Is he a jerk?

513
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,738
Should I beat him up?

514
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,951
For me, our SC is still pretty young.

515
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,787
I want her to enjoy her 20s.

516
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,542
And by the way,
she got accepted for a job in Singapore.

517
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,878
Isn't my daughter just amazing?

518
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,214
- She got it from me.
- From me. From me!

519
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,010
Yeah, about that job,

520
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,470
she's giving it up for Joey.

521
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,433
Isn't that just how love works?

522
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,102
Like we used to be.

523
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,315
And to think, we were
best friends back then.

524
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,695
They say, marry your best friend.

525
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,282
What happened to us?

526
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,575
All I'm saying is,

527
00:33:55,658 --> 00:34:00,246
I don't want SC trapped
in a marriage she's not ready for.

528
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,920
What?

529
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,672
I have an idea.

530
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,344
I know it sounds wrong, but

531
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,098
can you help me break them apart?

532
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,852
Or push back the wedding at least.

533
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,772
Hey, come on.

534
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,107
I'm finally seeing our daughter,

535
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,485
and now I'm supposed to stop her wedding?

536
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,988
Guess I'm excelling
at being an awful father.

537
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,825
Will you put her feelings first?

538
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,496
Or will you let her end up like we did?

539
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,544
Fine, it's a deal.

540
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,755
Just a request,

541
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,049
for our daughter's sake,

542
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,053
can we be friends again?

543
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,139
Just friends.

544
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,645
Just friends for now.

545
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,522
Okay, deal?

546
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,608
Come on, just go for it.

547
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,820
Oh, right, I was cooking!

548
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,365
Just friends, all right?

549
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,368
- Act up all you want.
- All right.

550
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,246
Then push Joey's patience to the limit.

551
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,500
He won't be able to hide
his real attitude with SC, okay?

552
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,088
Cum laude, doing outreach programs.

553
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,634
Always looking fresh,
a rich kid, just like me!

554
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,928
Joey seems like a decent guy.

555
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,639
Whose side are you on? Who's your team?

556
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,557
Hers!

557
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:43,933
Hey!

558
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,227
My love, you look so pretty.

559
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,937
- Really?
- So pretty.

560
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,605
Thank the filter for that.

561
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,525
There you go again. Give it back!

562
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,455
Beautiful.

563
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:10,918
Wow!

564
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,420
- What?
- I know you.

565
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,339
Why are you working so hard?

566
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,759
I see, it's for Sweetheart.

567
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,845
Oh, no!

568
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,014
You're jealous?

569
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,098
Whatever.

570
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,269
Guess you only know the old me.

571
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:33,316
You're welcome to meet the new me.

572
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,233
Let's go.

573
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,444
Move, come on.

574
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,404
Tomorrow, we have some cleaning to do.

575
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,322
Hey!

576
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,865
- Massive.
- More cleaning?

577
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,366
- Of course!
- I'm not coming!

578
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,701
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

579
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,619
Ouch.

580
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,083
- Ced.
- Yeah?

581
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,545
I can't clean all of this.

582
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,631
You're crazy.

583
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,299
You'll count the rocks.

584
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,929
But seriously, you don't
remember the date today?

585
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,847
Oh, my!

586
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,058
Is it your birthday?

587
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,311
Or mine?

588
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,316
Idiot! Today is our anniversary.

589
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,906
I come here every year.

590
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:28,454
One bottle to honor
one of the happiest days of my life.

591
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,540
I want to remind myself that

592
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,086
fate wasn't that cruel to me

593
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,797
and gave me the day of our wedding.

594
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:43,344
Even though a dove
pooped on you at the reception?

595
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,930
Hey, they call it a blessing.

596
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:51,394
Well, your shoes snapped
from all that dancing.

597
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,063
It's all right, you carried me after all.

598
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,148
Wait a sec, can I still do that?

599
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,525
- Come here!
- No, you can't!

600
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,194
Oh, my God!

601
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,701
I gripped hard. I knew that would happen.

602
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,899
Joy.

603
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,653
Is it really impossible?

604
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,906
We have no chance at all?

605
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,828
None.

606
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,087
Not even for our daughter?

607
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,636
It's one thing to be a good spouse,

608
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,640
and another to be a good parent.

609
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,578
Here, for SC's wedding.

610
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,704
Hey.

611
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,623
We had a deal.

612
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,459
We're breaking them apart.

613
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,710
Oh, yeah, right.

614
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,129
Then it's for the two of you.

615
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,011
You're right, Joy.

616
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,557
I still avoid the hassle. Who wouldn't?

617
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,353
But the thing is…

618
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,564
I'm doing this…

619
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,527
to make it up to our daughter.

620
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,032
I may have been a bad husband…

621
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,997
but I will do everything…

622
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,836
to be the best father.

623
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,173
So here.

624
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,846
I'll start with this.

625
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,851
Joy, I'm sorry.

626
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,940
For everything I did and didn't do.

627
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,861
I'll prove myself to both of you.

628
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,700
<i>Chuva choo choo?</i>

629
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,707
Thanks, Ced, for showing up
for our daughter.

630
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,470
Well, there goes the moment.

631
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,263
Ever heard of silent mode?

632
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,389
SC, sweetie!

633
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,016
<i>Mom, how's it going?</i>

634
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,059
<i>Have you found Dad?</i>

635
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,519
Sweetie!

636
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,981
Your Dad and I are coming home!

637
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,359
<i>Dad!</i>

638
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,652
<i>Dad!</i>

639
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,738
<i>Dad, you're still handsome as ever!</i>

640
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,698
- Hey, that's too much!
- Oh, sorry.

641
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,533
<i>Can't wait for you to come home!</i>

642
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,123
Remember…

643
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,416
WELCOME HOME
DAD!

644
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,335
…when you see SC,

645
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,004
hug her for only two seconds, all right?

646
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:51,050
<i>- Welcome home, Dad!</i>
<i>- Sweetie!</i>

647
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,136
- Dad!
- Sweetie!

648
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,766
Wow! Wow!

649
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,476
Wow!

650
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,936
You're hugging already?

651
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,314
No anger at all, sweetie?

652
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,815
It's been years.

653
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,568
Mom, let's just focus on being happy.
Right, Dad?

654
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,947
What matters is that
Dad is here on my wedding day.

655
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,490
- You went all out…
- Hi, Ma'am.

656
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,033
…welcoming me back.

657
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,034
Hi there.

658
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,118
- Wow!
- Sir.

659
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,453
Oh, you have a helper!

660
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,538
- No, Dad.
- I'm Joey.

661
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,580
You're Joey?

662
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,793
Oh, Joey…

663
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,755
- I'm watching you, all right?
- Yes, sir.

664
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,923
Let's go inside.

665
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:31,840
Hold on, Mom.

666
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,884
Could you bring up Mom's things upstairs?

667
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,135
- Because…
- Where are we…

668
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,512
We're headed somewhere.

669
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,681
- Oh, this too.
- Where to?

670
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,100
Joey, be careful with my bag.
That's high-end.

671
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,268
It's my surprise.

672
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,019
- Let's go, Dad.
- Let's go!

673
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,981
<i>Mom, Dad.</i>

674
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,566
<i>Hi!</i>

675
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,942
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

676
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,694
Hi, video!

677
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,031
Wow, the Philippines has changed so much!

678
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,367
So many new buildings.

679
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,077
Oh! I'm sorry.

680
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,120
- I'm sorry.
- Mom.

681
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,037
What the heck?

682
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,498
Can't wait until we're home, my love?

683
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,458
It's embarrassing in front of the kids.

684
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,543
Stop it.

685
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,711
Whatever!

686
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,713
Seriously, SC.

687
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,007
He's kind of a reckless driver.

688
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,219
Humps! Humps!

689
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,512
Are there humps?

690
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,430
Yeah.

691
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,307
I told you to stop it.

692
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,516
Sorry!

693
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,560
How many more humps?

694
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,145
Yeah, plenty more.

695
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,229
- Plenty more?
- Yep.

696
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,231
We should be careful.

697
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,858
Want me to hold you?

698
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:31,775
No!

699
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,402
Don't touch me.

700
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,195
Mr. C!

701
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,156
- Hey, Mr. C!
- Joy!

702
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,199
Joy!

703
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,951
Mr. C!

704
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,536
Ced.

705
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,165
Mr. C, I missed your food so much.

706
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,666
Oh, Ced.

707
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,669
You're still a smooth talker.

708
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,587
Hey.

709
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,589
- Come, take a seat.
- That's so true.

710
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,715
Take your seat.

711
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,883
- Joy.
- Have a seat.

712
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,967
I can manage.

713
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,927
You might fall.

714
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,679
Sweetie…

715
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,930
Dad, here.

716
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,267
Uh, Joy. Uh, Ced.

717
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,019
Back together?

718
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,480
Ah, Mr. C.

719
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,731
Here's the thing.

720
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,483
It all depends on Joy.

721
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,653
Mr. C.

722
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,987
I'm hungry.

723
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,947
- Let's eat, come on.
- Sure.

724
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,408
Felix, look after them, okay?

725
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,119
Joy.

726
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,332
Ced.

727
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,169
Get it together, all right?

728
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,712
Don't mess this up.

729
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,674
You're unbelievable, Mr. C.

730
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,094
Oh, thank you.

731
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,765
Sweetie, your mom and I have
so many great memories here.

732
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,975
That's been ruined, sweetie.

733
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,143
Seriously?

734
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:52,231
That's the one memory you had to bring up?

735
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,816
What do you expect?

736
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,943
That I'd hold onto those memories

737
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,695
over all the broken promises?

738
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,240
Mom, Dad, come on. Joey's here.

739
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,410
- Sorry, sweetie.
- Sorry.

740
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,996
Just wanted to share that, sweetie.
Sorry for that.

741
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,751
Your dad and I also want to share that

742
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,713
making impulsive decisions
isn't always a good idea.

743
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,340
Right?

744
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,427
So, Dad, are you still cooking?

745
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,679
I miss your special <i>adobo.</i>

746
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,264
Of course, sweetie.

747
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:30,102
If your mom had my <i>adobo</i> in Malta,

748
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:33,522
she'd be three times more into me!

749
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,237
What's so funny?

750
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,702
We'll have the…

751
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,164
Thank you.

752
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,499
What's good here?

753
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,667
The regular, Dad.

754
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,585
Regular?

755
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,171
- The one we always get.
- That's what you meant.

756
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,632
Oh, listen! Listen, sweetie.

757
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,717
Remember this?

758
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,677
It's our song, your mom and mine.

759
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:13,937
Ced, Joy, may I have dance
with your daughter?

760
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,898
Why?

761
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,858
Sure, no biggie.

762
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,320
All right, fine.

763
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,114
Guess a dance is all you
needed my blessing for.

764
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,658
- Mom--
- Dance.

765
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,828
Dance, that's what we're good at.

766
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:34,958
Come here.

767
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,418
What's wrong?

768
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,503
Will you stop…

769
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,047
Could you…

770
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,757
What did I do?

771
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,717
Why do you keep saying yes?

772
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,469
Dad, join us.

773
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,512
Bring Mom with you.

774
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,138
No, we're good!

775
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,890
Don't you dare.

776
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,725
Bring Mom and let's dance.

777
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,770
Don't we have a plan?

778
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,812
Right?

779
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,108
She's so thrilled to dance.

780
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,362
Come on.

781
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,044
What's with you?

782
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,005
Where's that whole act
we talked about in Malta

783
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,551
where we scare them
and pretend to be angry?

784
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,303
Joy, you know we can't just dive right in.

785
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,888
Got to take it step by step.

786
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,099
Goodness gracious.

787
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,143
Dad.

788
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,604
Dad, we'll drop you off at Mom's later.

789
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,314
- Oh.
- Hold on.

790
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,900
What about my house? What's going on?

791
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:48,532
Mom, it would be a waste
if Dad stays at a hotel.

792
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,952
Sweetie, come on. My goodness.

793
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,162
Do we really have to live together?

794
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,873
I mean, we're only married on paper.

795
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,834
That paper should've been ripped up.

796
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,961
Mom, come on.

797
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,962
Could you please?

798
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,755
So you won't feel awkward.

799
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,673
- My God.
- Mom.

800
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,676
My daughter's really smart.

801
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,098
Don't bother going to the house.

802
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,142
Knock it off.

803
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,768
I swear, you… What now?

804
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,106
Get me up. My goodness.

805
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,612
Why didn't you insist to stay in a hotel?

806
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:32,326
- Cutting back for Sweetheart, huh?
- Well, you agreed right away too.

807
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,746
It's not like you can be all kind with SC

808
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,581
and leave me as the bad one.

809
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,918
And by the way,

810
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,422
I brought you with me to the Philippines

811
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:49,593
to help me convince SC
that they're rushing things.

812
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,178
Exactly.

813
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,223
So we need to stick together
to make it work.

814
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,644
Hold on. Don't move, stay right there.

815
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,646
Joy.

816
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:01,897
What now?

817
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:03,815
Hey!

818
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,526
Hey, Joy! What's that for?

819
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,572
Joy, come on.

820
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,490
Hey.

821
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,034
You're a guest, not a husband.

822
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,952
And listen, keep this in mind.

823
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,415
Don't even try knocking later,
I'm definitely not letting you in.

824
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,586
Joy, let me sleep there, please!

825
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,672
Joy, come on.

826
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,721
Oh, yes, I'm your friend.

827
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,810
But are you sure I'm just a friend?

828
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,425
Tough luck.

829
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,807
Deal with it.

830
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,311
You're old enough to handle it yourself.

831
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,538
That was loud. Still alive?

832
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,166
So dramatic.

833
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,212
So dramatic!

834
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,715
That fall could've been the end of you.

835
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,429
Guess we both fell!

836
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,393
You're still so lame!

837
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,857
Well, look who's smiling.

838
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,112
Want some water?

839
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,866
We can't visit each other, remember?

840
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:08,959
I'll bring it over!

841
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,171
Just like how…

842
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:18,176
Just like how I handed you
the towel back then…

843
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,722
because you always forget it
when you shower.

844
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,890
Exactly.

845
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:33,149
When you hand it over,
I'll pull you into the bathroom and…

846
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,317
Hey!

847
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,197
Hey! That's R-rated!

848
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,909
All right, get some rest.

849
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,161
I'll be here
watching over you like before.

850
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,789
Like before?

851
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:52,961
Like before?
You were barely ever home on time.

852
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:58,091
Just place a pillow under your left thigh
so you don't get cramps. Good night.

853
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,213
Ouch.

854
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,342
Oh, that hurts.

855
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,513
<i>Oh that's like… Look how pretty.</i>

856
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,933
Give that a try,
it's one of our bestsellers.

857
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,394
There you go.
You've got lots of choices, sweetie.

858
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,272
Go ahead.

859
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,816
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

860
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:00,987
Dad!

861
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,906
One more of this!

862
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,032
Dad, this is it.

863
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,825
So good, Dad!

864
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,787
You're so dramatic, just like your dad.

865
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,704
Sweetie.

866
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,622
Don't you agree?

867
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,415
Yeah, the icing's great.

868
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,627
But check out the inside
and taste it for yourself.

869
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,505
See? Isn't it dry?

870
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,508
It can't just look good on the outside.

871
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,052
It can't just be
all about the first impression.

872
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,847
One has to stay consistent
all the way through.

873
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,266
Because, sweetie, if you slack off,

874
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,229
if you don't put in the effort
until the end, it's a fail.

875
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,609
So sweetheart,
don't act impulsively, okay?

876
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,447
Dad's really in a serious mood.

877
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,324
My dad's so serious.

878
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:50,745
Sweetie, I'm not that serious.

879
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,622
Look at you.

880
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,623
Dad!

881
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,043
Sweetie, is that the cake
you're going for?

882
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,047
Thanks for the lift.

883
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,177
Just drop me off
when we get to the grocery store.

884
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:10,473
I might take longer if I'm with you.

885
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,021
Can you do the groceries?

886
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:17,939
Tell me.

887
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:22,235
How much is a kilo of rice these days?

888
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,488
I'm sorry, I don't have an idea.

889
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,116
Our maid does the grocery for us.

890
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,243
But I'll come with you.

891
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,871
I'll carry the groceries.

892
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:36,541
So you think I'm weak,
that's why you want to help me?

893
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,792
No…

894
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,795
Just so you don't get tired, that's all.

895
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:46,718
So you think I'm old,
and that's why I get tired so fast?

896
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,472
- I'm sorry…
- Never mind.

897
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,433
It's okay. Just leave me there

898
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,519
and I'll have SC come pick me up.

899
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,149
Thanks a lot for the cakes.

900
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,233
So good! Thanks!

901
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,694
So Dad,

902
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:09,115
does the greatest love team
of the century get a second chance?

903
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,079
I'm not sure I deserve
a second chance, sweetie.

904
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,163
Dad, come on.

905
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,292
We even planned Mom's trip to Malta.

906
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,461
Why give up now?

907
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:23,713
Makes sense.

908
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,550
Thanks for getting back to me, sweetie,

909
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,470
when I reached out from Malta.

910
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:35,934
Also, I'm sorry
I had to leave you back then.

911
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,521
It's not like I can do anything.

912
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,943
But… But you could've told me.

913
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,154
Because honestly…

914
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,326
that really got to me.

915
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,039
Your goodbye still sticks with me.

916
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,084
You said you'd come back.

917
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:09,175
That's why I'll never stop
asking for your forgiveness.

918
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,511
Sorry it took me so long to get back.

919
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:16,099
Now that I'm here, I'll make it up to you.

920
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,476
Thank you, Dad.

921
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,938
Thanks for keeping your promise

922
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,482
to have our family together
on my wedding day.

923
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,079
Let me.

924
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,164
Oh, thank you…

925
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,500
It's you again? Why are you here?

926
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,296
They're not finished yet,
so we'll head over there.

927
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,675
I could do this alone.

928
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,552
Let me do that.

929
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,595
I can handle it.

930
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,229
Oh, you can't place it over there.

931
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,647
It'll get crushed.

932
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,192
Ah, I'll just move it then.

933
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,277
Not there either.

934
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,155
It'll fall if you leave it there.

935
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,327
All right, I'll just carry it on my lap.

936
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:18,870
All right.

937
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,173
Flowers for you from Uncle Ced.

938
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,932
You're bringing us together
because SC said so, right?

939
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,269
Well, that won't happen.

940
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,487
If you tell SC, you'll see…

941
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,407
Let's go! The eggs!

942
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,702
Thank you.

943
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,539
What do you think, Love?

944
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,916
Chicken, fish, beef, or pork?

945
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,501
Love, anything will do.

946
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:10,672
As long as it's grilled, it's good
for Dad. It's healthier that way.

947
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,674
All right.

948
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:20,640
Also, Daddy suggested adding
a carving station with pastries

949
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,725
to give our guests more options.

950
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,605
Pastries?
But isn't the reception at night?

951
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,108
They might just go to waste.

952
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,235
Actually…

953
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:38,032
Let's just discuss it with Daddy
during the Pamamanhikan

954
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,326
so we're all present at home.

955
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,870
Wait a sec.

956
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,623
I thought it's Pamamanhikan.

957
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,876
How come it's at your house?

958
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,632
Mommy thought having it at our home
would be less trouble for you.

959
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,931
SC, will that work for you?

960
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,224
Pretty much.

961
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,853
Mommy Sophia has a valid point.

962
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:14,360
Joey, what about your
personal opinion as a groom?

963
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:19,699
I mean, your own preferences,
not your mommy's or daddy's.

964
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,537
Anything goes.

965
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:28,082
But who gets to decide on your wedding?

966
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:31,836
Honestly, it's SC and Mommy.

967
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,921
You see, I let the queens do their job.

968
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,092
They might as well marry.

969
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,471
Exactly, that's what I told him, Mom.

970
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,849
I just want you to enjoy your wedding.

971
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,684
My wedding?

972
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,686
It's <i>our</i> wedding!

973
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,272
You have nothing to say about our wedding?

974
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,524
Please don't raise your voice.

975
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,694
Hep, hep, hooray.

976
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,822
Joey has a point too.

977
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,159
There's no need to nitpick the details.

978
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,912
If the in-laws want it, then so be it.

979
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,832
In-laws are hard to argue with,
right, Joy, my love?

980
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,961
Yeah.

981
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,678
Are you with me or against me?

982
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:25,264
We don't want SC to have
a hard time with her in-laws, do we?

983
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,393
Is something itchy?

984
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,145
- Oh, nothing.
- Nothing at all.

985
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,191
No, it's nothing. We're fine.

986
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,026
You're being dramatic too now.

987
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,113
You really think we're having
an allergic reaction?

988
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:46,369
Look who's cooking! What's the catch?

989
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:49,205
Smells so good.

990
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,166
I told you, I'm making it up to you.

991
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,252
Go on, have some.

992
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,471
Coffee.

993
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:06,973
Want some coffee?

994
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:07,890
Sure.

995
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,309
To get those nerves going.

996
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,062
Pretty bold to wear sleeveless
while crashing here.

997
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,648
Got a problem?

998
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,568
Isn't it odd?

999
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,987
Same ingredients,

1000
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,865
same way of cooking,

1001
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,367
but my <i>adobo</i> never tastes like yours.

1002
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,995
Isn't it obvious?

1003
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,997
It's the cook that makes the difference!

1004
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,082
You missed me, didn't you?

1005
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,375
Just your cooking.

1006
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,630
If I'd just opened that café in Baguio…

1007
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,382
Such a shame.

1008
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,092
Why didn't you?

1009
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,303
Because you had no cook?

1010
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,681
I couldn't turn down
the offer here in Manila.

1011
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,101
That's to cover SC's tuition.

1012
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,452
Who would've thought.

1013
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:55,706
You never lifted a finger before!

1014
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,127
Still out like a light, huh?

1015
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,552
Must've really messed up if you cleaned.

1016
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,638
Neat.

1017
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,525
Joy…

1018
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,902
You know, it's hard to…

1019
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:29,240
- Thank you.
- There's juice. Thanks.

1020
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,992
- Gotta hand it to them.
- Fancy.

1021
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,994
- Straight out of a soap opera.
- Yeah.

1022
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,579
Where are the newlyweds?

1023
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,081
- Hey!
- Right, there's no wedding.

1024
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,337
- Mom, Dad, been waiting long?
- Hi, hello.

1025
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,132
Let's eat.

1026
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,383
Here's some rice.

1027
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,469
- Want some of this?
- Sure.

1028
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,431
Oh, no, Joey. I haven't gotten rice yet.

1029
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:56,100
- Aren't we the guests here?
- Oh, sorry.

1030
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,394
You've got quite the spread!

1031
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,813
Are the neighbors dining here too?

1032
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,400
Tonight's special because
we have an announcement to make.

1033
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,697
Announcement?

1034
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,033
So how do you find the <i>adobo?</i>

1035
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,577
Good enough?

1036
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,204
It's good.

1037
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,750
SC cooked that.

1038
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,210
You did, sweetie? No wonder it's so good.

1039
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,838
You're all set for marriage!

1040
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,137
So if I'm not good at cooking,
I'm not wife material?

1041
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,764
- Precisely.
- No.

1042
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,808
Why do women always
get singled out like this?

1043
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,771
Were you ever told you couldn't marry

1044
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,397
just because you can't cook?

1045
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,901
Hold on. Instead of arguing,

1046
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,654
what's the special announcement?

1047
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,864
You've got us on edge, Joey.

1048
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:52,907
I knew it.

1049
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,660
You're pregnant.

1050
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,119
Mom, again?

1051
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,580
I told you I'm not pregnant.

1052
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,166
We just want to let you know that

1053
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:06,629
after the wedding, we'll move
to the US with his family.

1054
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,423
So, you're not pregnant.

1055
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,218
Neither in deep debt. That's all?

1056
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,720
Yes, Mom. That's all.

1057
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,806
So, you're on board?

1058
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,183
No.

1059
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:23,521
Didn't you say you wanted
to focus on your business here?

1060
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,356
Now you're moving to the US?

1061
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:29,568
You're all over the place.
What exactly is your plan?

1062
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:33,155
His dad made a good point, Mom.

1063
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,074
Moving to the US seems…

1064
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,492
Hold on, wait a sec.

1065
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:38,452
SC.

1066
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:44,041
Looks like you're giving up
too much of your life for his family.

1067
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,755
Sweetie, actually…

1068
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:54,135
it's tough to live with another family.

1069
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,012
We've been through that.

1070
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,556
To think, you're planning to go that far.

1071
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,017
Mom, Dad, I can manage.

1072
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,521
Right, Joey?
Well, how's your signal there?

1073
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,064
Come on, speak up.

1074
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,860
I… I got…

1075
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,199
It sounds like…

1076
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,326
my parents are bad people.

1077
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,079
Your parents, still?

1078
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,456
SC, what do you mean?

1079
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,541
All I'm asking is

1080
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,879
for you to help me explain
why we want to settle in the US.

1081
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,922
Love, what do you want me to say?

1082
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,549
I'll think of that too?

1083
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,718
Could you not?

1084
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,928
Hang on.

1085
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,388
SC, Joey.

1086
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,476
You can talk without
raising your voices, all right?

1087
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,940
You know what, maybe we should end this.

1088
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,194
Maybe we should break up.

1089
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:10,753
Joey.

1090
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,142
SC, sweetie.

1091
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,396
Mom, I'd like to be alone.

1092
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,108
No, sweetie. I'll stay with you.

1093
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,068
For what?

1094
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:42,493
Do you really think I haven't noticed
you're not happy with my engagement?

1095
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:48,457
Of course Joey told me
you got mad at him.

1096
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:51,836
Why, Mom?

1097
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,797
Is that why…

1098
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,553
Is that why you keep
bringing up your failed marriage…

1099
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,307
so I'd call this off?

1100
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,103
Well, there you go.

1101
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,317
Congrats. I hope you're happy now.

1102
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,529
Sweetie…

1103
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,115
I want to live in the US with you.

1104
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,204
Is that what you want?

1105
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,414
Or what your dad wants?

1106
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,339
Love, when we're married,

1107
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:22,009
will your parents
still have the final say?

1108
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:24,762
I should've just married them instead.

1109
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,681
Love, come on.

1110
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,308
Just kidding.

1111
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:33,312
I'll fix this.

1112
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,709
But why do I feel like

1113
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,213
I ended up hurting her more?

1114
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:09,431
Joy, I know how much you love SC.

1115
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:16,438
But she's her own person.

1116
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,609
You raised her right, Joy.

1117
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,956
Did I actually raise her right?

1118
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:39,128
I feel like I failed her.

1119
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,551
Really tough to be a parent, right?

1120
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,054
No manual for that.

1121
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:04,570
No matter how much we argue,

1122
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,449
we agree on one thing.

1123
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:12,119
We both want our child to be happy.

1124
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,628
Stop crying.

1125
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:29,678
That's enough.
My shirt's probably all snot now.

1126
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,889
Give me a break.

1127
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,476
Thank you.

1128
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:20,479
I'm sorry for what I did earlier.

1129
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,483
Sweetie, we're on your side.

1130
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,736
We love you very much.
You know that, right?

1131
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:29,863
Come here.

1132
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,381
Dad, thanks for everything.

1133
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,135
For trying to make things right with Mom.

1134
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:56,140
From Malta to the Philippines,
I really appreciate it.

1135
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,434
That's because I still love your mom.

1136
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,561
I always have.

1137
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,688
I'm doing this

1138
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,773
because I want to.

1139
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,410
Sweetheart?

1140
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:21,373
Mom.

1141
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,293
You guys are still talking?

1142
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:32,092
That's why you're so set on having
your father at the wedding.

1143
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,679
Because you two are still close.

1144
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,892
And because you're so close,

1145
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:43,479
you teamed up to make a fool out of me.

1146
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,064
Mom, it's not like that.

1147
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,691
Then what's this?

1148
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,863
You both lied to me.

1149
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,324
- Joy.
- Especially you!

1150
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,078
You even taught our daughter
to lie to get closer to me.

1151
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,121
Ced.

1152
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:05,125
I was close to believing that

1153
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,461
we still had a second chance.

1154
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,546
But you still haven't changed.

1155
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,466
You know, you still haven't changed.

1156
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,176
You're still a liar.

1157
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,387
Joy, I did it because
I want us back together.

1158
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:18,847
Back together again?

1159
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,434
At the cost of my relationship
with my daughter?

1160
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:25,312
At the cost of losing my trust in you?

1161
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,775
Our breakup…

1162
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:33,487
made me whole again.

1163
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,449
Because when we were together…

1164
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,995
it hurts to admit that…

1165
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:49,044
I ended up losing faith in myself
because of how you treated me.

1166
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:55,050
I lost respect for myself.

1167
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,720
I felt like I was nothing more than…

1168
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,475
someone who took care of you,

1169
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,270
who provided financial support,

1170
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,314
and who fixed your problems.

1171
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:12,359
I wasn't even your wife.

1172
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,152
Nor was I a mother.

1173
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,326
Mom, I'm sorry.

1174
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,423
Dad.

1175
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,512
It's all right.

1176
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:36,735
MY LOVE

1177
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:45,285
Love, your sweetheart

1178
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:03,261
I miss you Dad, but don't worry,
I will take care of Mom.

1179
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:11,770
Oh, wow, sweetheart.

1180
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,606
- What a house. Hi.
- Oh, you're here.

1181
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,316
- What's up?
- Good evening.

1182
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,654
What a lovely house.

1183
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,615
- Thank you.
- Do you use Google Maps here?

1184
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,741
Pretty massive.

1185
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,953
Joey, aren't we a bit too early?

1186
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,162
Should we just return?

1187
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,748
- No, it's all right.
- No.

1188
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:45,804
Because it looks like
you're really hungry.

1189
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:50,267
How did you figure out I was so hungry?

1190
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,018
You're pretty good.

1191
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:53,437
He's so good.

1192
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,364
Shoes off, please.

1193
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:08,326
It's Joy.

1194
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:13,999
Mom, leave it there.

1195
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,460
You're here.

1196
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,087
Thank you, Joy.

1197
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,383
What's that?

1198
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,971
- Is someone knocking?
- I think so too.

1199
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,806
<i>- Someone's knocking.</i>
- Another guest?

1200
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,857
And she's not here, such support.

1201
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,734
This is my mom.

1202
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,475
The rice might be special too.

1203
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,353
Where's the fried rice?

1204
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,028
None.

1205
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:37,791
No, it's okay.

1206
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:40,585
I just set the leaves aside.
They were on top.

1207
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,388
But the salmon is delicious. Thank you.

1208
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,782
He kills it every time.

1209
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,501
Why don't we do it in Manila Cathedral?

1210
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:25,338
Baguio has a '90s feel to it, right?

1211
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:29,009
The '90s vibe works for me.

1212
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:30,844
Old school is cool, right?

1213
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:36,099
Actually, Malta excels
at preserving its past.

1214
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:42,939
SC and I chose Malta as our
first choice for our wedding venue.

1215
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:46,401
That's great.

1216
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:50,739
But our business partners won't make it
if the wedding is in Malta.

1217
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,829
Are they officiating the wedding?

1218
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,668
Maybe we can be business partners.

1219
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:06,296
Oh, business partners!

1220
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:17,557
Sometimes, I sing
at weddings and birthdays.

1221
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,017
- Singing?
- Yes.

1222
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:19,976
Dancing?

1223
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,062
Wow!

1224
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:32,697
Dad's not joking around.

1225
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:33,990
- Huh?
- It's true.

1226
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:48,463
SC told me that Malta,
even though it's a Catholic country,

1227
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,840
they're actually so progressive.

1228
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:09,567
Yeah.

1229
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:12,237
It's obvious you're still just a kid.

1230
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,660
I mean, people don't have the time
to talk about those things,

1231
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:20,370
especially the lower class.

1232
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,708
Especially those…

1233
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,254
those just doing side hustles.

1234
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,596
How can my grandchild learn good values

1235
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,850
when raised by someone with
such a mindset?

1236
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:46,062
Actually, if that's the kind
of values you have, SC,

1237
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:49,149
you might have a problem
with Joey in the future.

1238
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:51,568
Perhaps your only solution is to separate.

1239
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,369
Is there a problem?

1240
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:04,122
That's why this country
isn't getting anywhere.

1241
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,249
Because of people like you.

1242
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,542
Actually…

1243
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,170
I'm concerned for my daughter

1244
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:12,338
because she might end up with this family.

1245
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:14,632
Yeah, exactly.

1246
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,593
This is not a family.

1247
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:18,636
This is a prison.

1248
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:21,681
We're out of here.

1249
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,350
Enjoy your bland meal.

1250
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,144
Mom, Dad.

1251
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,188
- Come on, SC.
- Come on.

1252
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:29,689
Dad, hold on.

1253
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:30,857
SC.

1254
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:36,321
It's fortunate that you and
Joey's dad are still together.

1255
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,240
Not everyone is in the same situation.

1256
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:43,036
My parents may have separated,
but they're not criminals.

1257
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,082
Their separation doesn't define who I am.

1258
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,211
So, Joey,

1259
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,298
get a bride who'll just
agree with your parents.

1260
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:57,634
That's not me. The wedding's off.

1261
01:24:57,717 --> 01:24:59,928
You're really my daughter.

1262
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,397
Remember this?

1263
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:16,861
There's nothing a hot soup can't fix.

1264
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:25,495
Sweetie, you're really all grown up now.

1265
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:30,208
You can manage just fine without us.

1266
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,336
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

1267
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,591
Delicious, right?

1268
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,146
Mom…

1269
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:57,402
I'll get that.

1270
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,241
Hi.

1271
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,411
Can I talk to SC?

1272
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,081
Sit down, Joey.

1273
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:20,550
Joey,

1274
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,803
when Joy and I got separated,

1275
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:29,184
it was incredibly painful
to know I hurt SC too.

1276
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:35,481
That's why I always pray
that she'll find a man

1277
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,942
who's different from me.

1278
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:41,988
Who won't hurt her.
Who won't leave her.

1279
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,325
And who'll fight for her.

1280
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,495
But by repeatedly choosing your parents

1281
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:52,373
and not defending her earlier…

1282
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,086
you've hurt her.

1283
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,088
You've left my daughter.

1284
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,176
Do you think this is
the right time to get married?

1285
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:08,306
Once you're married,
the two of you should make the decisions.

1286
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:11,935
Not us.

1287
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:16,439
And definitely not your parents
who run their mouths.

1288
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:23,112
Joey, marriage isn't as easy
as spitting out hot rice.

1289
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,989
It's true.

1290
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,825
Especially here where there's no divorce.

1291
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:34,165
If your parents are always going to
have a say in your marriage,

1292
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,792
leave my daughter out of it.

1293
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,627
We're not perfect parents.

1294
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:40,255
But Joy…

1295
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:45,468
she did her best to raise her
to be responsible and independent.

1296
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:49,389
Not to end up with a man who's all height

1297
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,641
but no backbone.

1298
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,693
Don't be in a rush.

1299
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:05,905
You know, we realized that

1300
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:09,117
we're not compatible as husband and wife.

1301
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:17,250
But we decided to be
the best mom and dad for SC.

1302
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:30,888
Thank you.

1303
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:46,612
We'll just be inside.

1304
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,072
Okay, Dad.

1305
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,282
Thanks, Dad.

1306
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:15,475
Joey, I'm sorry too.

1307
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:20,396
So…

1308
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:23,441
what now?

1309
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,907
We're both not ready for this.

1310
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:01,687
Ced, I realized that

1311
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:07,860
I've been mad at you for so many years.

1312
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:11,697
But I had to be,

1313
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,325
so I wouldn't keep hoping you'd come back.

1314
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,497
Because you hurt me.

1315
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,876
If I let myself hope again,

1316
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:28,923
then it's on me because
I'm choosing to hurt myself

1317
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,760
by holding on to nothing.

1318
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,151
I forgive you, Ced.

1319
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:52,780
I hope you'll forgive yourself too.

1320
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,493
Thank you.

1321
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:07,628
Ced…

1322
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,007
This isn't a proposal.

1323
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,509
Don't get ahead of yourself.

1324
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:17,930
You keep the ring.

1325
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,808
You can have your half back.

1326
01:31:50,546 --> 01:31:51,672
Thanks.

1327
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:58,095
Joy…

1328
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,099
if we never became a couple,

1329
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,019
would we still be best friends?

1330
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:06,520
Maybe.

1331
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,314
Maybe not.

1332
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:11,859
Remember…

1333
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:14,862
no more regrets.

1334
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,740
Only gratitude.

1335
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,202
Thank you, my love.

1336
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:17,008
I'm sorry, Mom.

1337
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:21,012
What for?

1338
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,222
Is there a problem?

1339
01:33:24,598 --> 01:33:25,725
Look, Mom.

1340
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:29,520
Your smile was so much brighter

1341
01:33:29,603 --> 01:33:31,731
when it was just the two of us.

1342
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:38,779
I'm sorry for pushing you
to get back together with Dad.

1343
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:42,700
Maybe I just miss the old days.

1344
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:48,497
I thought, if I start my own family,

1345
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:51,959
who will be with you?

1346
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,838
Sweetie…

1347
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,841
I'm also sorry.

1348
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:06,307
We failed to give you a complete family.

1349
01:34:08,642 --> 01:34:11,187
As much as I want a complete family,

1350
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:16,192
I'd rather have parents
who feel complete in themselves.

1351
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:28,913
- Because…
- I thought…

1352
01:34:28,996 --> 01:34:30,664
Sissies!

1353
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:31,791
She's so loud!

1354
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,294
As loud as her e-bike!

1355
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:36,545
Hello!

1356
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:37,922
What's up?

1357
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:41,175
Sorry, I had to work overtime.

1358
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:43,094
The extra pay is hard to pass up.

1359
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:45,763
So, where's SC?
You said she'd be here today.

1360
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:47,473
She's busy with her business.

1361
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:49,350
She handles the business, remember?

1362
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:52,186
I'm so proud of our goddaughter.

1363
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:56,023
Of course, raised by a strong,
independent woman.

1364
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,651
Thanks. What do you want?

1365
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:00,986
Hello, attorney.

1366
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:15,709
Okay.

1367
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:23,300
Thank you.

1368
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:24,844
- Why?
- Thank you, attorney.

1369
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,888
What happened?

1370
01:35:29,932 --> 01:35:31,016
What's up?

1371
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,061
What?

1372
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:37,690
Finally.

1373
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:42,987
We're annulled.

1374
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:48,033
Joy…

1375
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:52,621
- Finally! Congratulations!
- Should we be saying congratulations?

1376
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,833
I'm a San Pedro again.

1377
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,293
We have to celebrate.

1378
01:35:57,376 --> 01:35:58,544
Wait!

1379
01:35:58,627 --> 01:36:00,504
I'm finally free.

1380
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,298
One bottle of what? What?

1381
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:03,966
A bottle of…

1382
01:36:04,049 --> 01:36:06,302
A bottle of champagne!

1383
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:08,012
Thank goodness!

1384
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:11,265
You have to sort everything.

1385
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:15,603
You have to replace your credit cards,
everything, your license.

1386
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:18,439
- Help me, all right?
- Even the passport, right?

1387
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:21,692
Passport, license, what else?

1388
01:36:21,775 --> 01:36:23,903
Billing address?

1389
01:36:23,986 --> 01:36:24,820
It's Ced.

1390
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:33,662
Ced.

1391
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:24,713
Cedric Hermoso!

1392
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:27,258
Cedric Hermoso.

1393
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:38,686
Ced!

1394
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,706
Joy San Pedro.

1395
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:25,733
To the friendship that
I'd never trade for the world.

1396
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:29,278
Not just a best friend.

1397
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:34,783
Best friend for a lifetime.

1398
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,244
That outweighs love.

1399
01:38:38,912 --> 01:38:41,665
That outweighs family.

1400
01:38:44,209 --> 01:38:45,461
Soulmate.

1401
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:48,047
Soulmate.

1402
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:52,259
Joy, I love you.

1403
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:54,928
I love you too, Ced.

1404
01:39:19,995 --> 01:39:21,830
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1405
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:29,755
You can tell we're not used to drinking.

1406
01:39:29,838 --> 01:39:31,924
Just faking it. Cheers!
