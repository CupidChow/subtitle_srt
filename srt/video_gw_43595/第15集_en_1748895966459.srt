00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,320
Episode 18

2
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,540
A trusted master.

3
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,020
Giang Qi of Geng flourished against effort due to a champion of martial arts.

4
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,400
He had his name but we could not hide our while.

5
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,100
I will ask Meng Zhi to guarding us.

6
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,100
But no matter what the purpose is,

7
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
they still have the back of the emperor.

8
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
From the current situation,

9
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
the most possible purpose

10
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
is to break into the emperor's trust in the imperial army.

11
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Once he has entered the imperial army,

12
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,100
he will have the opportunity to control the city.

13
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
The one who wants to control the city the most

14
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
is the one who is the closest to the power center.

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
The crown prince and the prince?

16
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,100
That's right.

17
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,100
Liangzhe Ji Yi.

18
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
Liangzhe Ji Yi.

19
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
It's just that the prince is not in the military's control.

20
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Even if he pulls the prince down,

21
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
no one can take him down.

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
But the crown prince has someone in his control.

23
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Marquis Ning, Xie Yu.

24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Xie Yu is a military emperor.

25
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
He is always reluctant to fight.

26
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
He is favored by the emperor.

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Once the imperial army is under pressure,

28
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
will the prince be able to get off?

29
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
The imperial army's position is in his control.

30
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Naturally, he will fall into his hands.

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
But...

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
But what?

33
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
But the emperor is not confused.

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,100
He won't easily

35
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
move Brother Meng's position.

36
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
He is afraid that this matter

37
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
will be linked with the enemy.

38
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
This will be the emperor's chance.

39
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,100
No.

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
I want to go to the Prince Yu's Mansion.

41
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
I want to go to the Prince Yu's Mansion.

42
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
I want to go to the Prince Yu's Mansion.

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Brother.

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,100
Fei Liu, let's go.

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Get up.

47
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
The first day of the year,

48
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,100
I called your two brothers and sisters to the palace.

49
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,100
It was because last night,

50
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
I was in a case of an accident

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
that caused me to be in a bad state.

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,100
Probably,

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,100
you all have heard some rumors,

54
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
haven't you?

55
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,100
If Your Majesty

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
wants to kill the spy,

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
I have a question.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,100
Although this case happened outside the palace wall,

59
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,100
the dead person is the spy I sent.

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
The murderer's situation

61
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
is clearly a minor military danger.

62
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
He must not be released.

63
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
But under the palace wall,

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
the killer and the imperial guards

65
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
are really bold.

66
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
I called you here

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
to investigate this case

68
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
for you two.

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
But Your Majesty

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
has already handed this case to Commander Meng.

71
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Has he been released?

72
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Meng Zhi is in the palace.

73
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Besides this,

74
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
he is also very suspicious.

75
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Of course,

76
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
I will show him some colors.

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
But you all know that

78
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
he is very skilled in martial arts.

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
It is not his fault

80
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
to investigate such cases.

81
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
But I only show him

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
the evidence.

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
It is also convenient for you two

84
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
to investigate this case.

85
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Here is the stats.

86
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
There are multiple chances to recover.

87
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Make your entry to案均先铂经娱乐城 999 4466.

88
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Come, come.

89
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,280
After

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,100
you describe it in this case,

91
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,800
you'll have to decide

92
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,100
whether to investigate them in the hospital.

93
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
No matter who is behind the case,

94
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,100
you should investigate thoroughly.

95
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,700
Official,

96
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,100
I approve.

97
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Six Jin Army, one internal army.

98
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Who is the real target?

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
What is the motive behind his murder?

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,100
The Jin Army is just a guard.

101
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
The one he really wants to kill should be the internal army of His Majesty.

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,100
But the internal army has rarely left the palace.

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,600
Is it because of the hatred between the people?

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
When he left the palace, he was responsible for the murder.

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,100
No.

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
An ordinary internal army would be able to take down any hatred.

107
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
They must be killed in the year.

108
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Moreover, since he left the palace, he is still in the Jin Army.

109
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
He is not the one who will give the food to His Majesty.

110
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,600
He should not have any precious money.

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,100
So he will not be the one to take the money.

112
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
There is still a reason for killing the people in the lake.

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,100
It is to fight with the master and get a name.

114
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
But it is to kill people at night.

115
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
And he has no identity.

116
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Of course, it is not the reason.

117
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,100
Is it because he just wants to kill the internal army of His Majesty?

118
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,600
Which one is more important?

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,100
What Sister means is that he randomly chose a team among the twelve teams he left the palace.

120
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,100
It is just...

121
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Why did he kill the family?

122
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
He killed the family at night?

123
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,100
What kind of person would be so heartless?

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
It is said that His Majesty is very powerful.

125
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,100
He took over the commander of the Mongols for twenty times.

126
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Father is just a little bit angry.

127
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,100
He still believes in the loyalty of the commander of the Mongols.

128
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
That is natural.

129
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,100
But the situation in the commander of the Mongols is not good.

130
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
His Highness is not well.

131
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Isn't His Highness willing to take over the commander of the Mongols?

132
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Why not take this opportunity?

133
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
What do you mean?

134
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,100
His Majesty is angry and has taken over the commander of the Mongols.

135
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,100
But the later details will be known.

136
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
This case is not the responsibility of the commander of the Mongols.

137
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,100
If His Highness is not fair to the commander of the Mongols at this time,

138
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,100
and can't bear to offend His Majesty,

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,100
the commander of the Mongols will also be the one to take over this person.

140
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Indeed.

141
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
No matter what the reason behind this murder case,

142
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
the line of the Mongols cannot be put aside.

143
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
It cannot be let the Eastern Palace be humiliated.

144
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
I will do my best.

145
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Guards, get ready.

146
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
This person must be a swordsman.

147
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
There is not much of a master who can keep this wound.

148
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
The Xuan Yi Fei Tian of the Nanyu Xuan tribe,

149
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,100
the Talao of the Brother of the Jiang family in the East Sea,

150
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,100
and the Flying Bird Peach Forest in the Sky Mountain.

151
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
It is possible that this wound can be caused by this.

152
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,100
These three swordsmanship have never been seen by the two of us personally.

153
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Moreover, there are people outside the martial arts world.

154
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,100
This is not a matter of any conclusion.

155
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
I have found the evidence of this case.

156
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I cannot say anything in front of His Majesty.

157
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Can't you say who you suspect or not?

158
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Who is the junior sister?

159
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Who is the senior brother?

160
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
In the martial arts world,

161
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,100
who has ever been in the capital before?

162
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
But in the Prince of Yu's hands,

163
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,100
there are no other swordsmanship that can replace it.

164
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,100
If he is the one who killed the Alliance,

165
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,100
what good is there to fight him?

166
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
That's right.

167
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
So, you suspect that someone has swords in his hands?

168
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I just suspect that.

169
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,100
I'm afraid that some people in the capital

170
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,100
might not be able to replace the sword that he killed himself.

171
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Your Highness, you should not be in the palace for too long.

172
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
You must be on your way back home.

173
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Mr. Su, please sit down and have some tea.

174
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Mr. Su, you are not going out.

175
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,100
You came here for the past half a year.

176
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
You came back and you heard that you were coming?

177
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
What a coincidence.

178
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
I was waiting for you for a long time.

179
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
The case is over.

180
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Did His Highness take too much of your time?

181
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
What you mean is...

182
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,100
I came here to stop you from entering the palace.

183
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
It seems that you are still late.

184
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
I'm afraid that you have already taken a loss.

185
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,100
You went to the palace to beg for mercy for the Commander Meng.

186
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Is there anything wrong?

187
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Commander Meng is the only one who has been sent to the capital.

188
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
He is not loyal to the country.

189
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
To be honest, His Majesty's life is all in his hands.

190
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
He just went out for a few things.

191
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
His Highness is very anxious and wants to beg for mercy in the palace.

192
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
What will His Majesty think?

193
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Is His Highness going to be justice?

194
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Or is it that you and Commander Meng are both in the same boat?

195
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Obviously not.

196
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
His Majesty is suspicious of him.

197
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I'm afraid that he will think that His Highness wants to take this opportunity

198
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,100
to get close to Commander Meng

199
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
and then do what you want.

200
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
This is not a good thing.

201
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
This is really a surprise.

202
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Who would have thought that Prince Yu would beg His Majesty for Meng Zhi?

203
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
I heard that after His Majesty heard about it,

204
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,100
his face was very pale.

205
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Prince Yu has been in the imperial court for many years.

206
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Why is he so reckless?

207
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Think about it.

208
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
We took away his Duke of Qin

209
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
and we have finally taken away his only support in the army.

210
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,100
He needs Meng Zhi so much.

211
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,100
He needs Meng Zhi so much.

212
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
This marriage is also a gift from him.

213
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Since then,

214
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Brother Xie, you have thought a lot.

215
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
The dishes of Qilin.

216
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
The dishes of Qilin

217
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
have not stopped him from doing his best.

218
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
The internal palace was killed.

219
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,100
It seems that there is no effect on His Highness.

220
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Have you ever thought about it?

221
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Once the situation continues to develop,

222
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,100
it is a situation that cannot be controlled.

223
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
The palace continues to be in chaos.

224
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
But the imperial army is still in control.

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
What will the result be?

226
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
His Majesty will suspect that

227
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Meng Zhi can't control the situation.

228
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
He is unable to protect the palace.

229
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Commander Meng has always been uncoordinated.

230
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
He only filial piety to His Majesty.

231
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Once he is withdrawn,

232
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,100
His Highness's hands are completely useless.

233
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
He can take over his position.

234
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
But on the east side...

235
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
It's good for the country.

236
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
It's good for the country.

237
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
The loss of the imperial army

238
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
can be gradually improved.

239
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
The position of the imperial minister

240
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
is still in the right place.

241
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
But once the imperial army is in control,

242
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
the position is taken by the county.

243
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I'm afraid that His Highness

244
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
will not be so happy in the future.

245
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Please give me a lesson.

246
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
characteristics

247
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,920
Yeah.

248
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,720
Yeah.

249
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,300
Hey hey hey

250
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,160
Third expression.

251
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,760
Third expression?

252
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
This is the pigeon from young master Lin Chen.

253
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Maybe there is something important.

254
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
You should send it to the chief.

255
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
No.

256
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Last time, you hid the pigeon from the chief.

257
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
How did the chief punish you?

258
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I can't remember it all.

259
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Is it because you are kneeling in the dark room?

260
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Or is it because you are on the floor?

261
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
You are flying.

262
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
You let me down.

263
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
I need to talk to the chief.

264
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Let me down.

265
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Chief.

266
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Tell Tian Ji Hall in the dark room.

267
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Let them find out soon.

268
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
The new year of Tianquan Mountain.

269
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
And some senior officers.

270
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
As for the good men in the capital.

271
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
No matter what.

272
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Mr. Shi San is investigating their whereabouts.

273
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,760
The chief is in a critical situation.

274
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,760
The chief will report any news to me.

275
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Yes, I understand.

276
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
The truth is coming.

277
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
If Xie Yu dares to do the same thing.

278
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
He will not let it go.

279
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
That's the pigeon from young master Lin Chen.

280
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Don't be so impulsive.

281
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Don't talk about him.

282
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
He didn't hide the pigeon this time.

283
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
He is really good.

284
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Don't move.

285
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Good boy.

286
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Leave it to me.

287
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
If it is in the cage.

288
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
I will have to grill it.

289
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
You...

290
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Is everything going well over there?

291
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
What's the big deal?

292
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
There is nothing we can do.

293
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,760
How will you reply to young master Lin?

294
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Let him go to the capital before April 12.

295
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Then he can do the big deal.

296
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Yes.

297
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Fei Liu.

298
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,760
After brother Lin Chen did the south Chu thing.

299
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
He might come to the capital to visit you.

300
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Are you happy?

301
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Okay, Fei Liu. Don't be unhappy.

302
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Go out with brother Su, okay?

303
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Brother Su will take you to the one you can't beat.

304
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Okay.

305
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Get up.

306
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Get up.

307
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Get up.

308
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Get up.

309
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Get up.

310
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Fei Liu, don't do that.

311
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Brother Meng, you look good.

312
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
I am relieved.

313
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Don't you know me?

314
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,760
This little injury is nothing to me.

315
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
It's nothing at all.

316
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
I am just annoyed.

317
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
I have no interest in this.

318
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
I even gave you a deadline.

319
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
I am so worried.

320
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
What should I do?

321
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't worry about it.

322
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
You can't break it.

323
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
No.

324
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
That's what I said.

325
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Xie Yu is really a vicious man.

326
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,760
I have injured two powerful ministers

327
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
and a big sister in court.

328
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
If Xie Yu controls the Jin Army again,

329
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,760
it will be hard for me to fight against the Eastern Palace.

330
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,760
What are your plans next?

331
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
I have discussed with Mr. Su.

332
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Commander Meng is a father after all.

333
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
He can't do anything.

334
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
He must be confident in losing the Jin Army.

335
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Especially in the palace,

336
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
as long as something happens,

337
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
the Jin Army will not be responsible for it.

338
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
I can't help it.

339
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
I understand.

340
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Don't worry.

341
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I married into the royal family at the age of 16.

342
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
I have been in charge of the six palaces for years.

343
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,760
I know what to do to speed up the process.

344
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
I know.

345
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I am a martial artist.

346
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
I can't do anything.

347
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
You are the one who is responsible for it.

348
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I won't help you.

349
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
When the deadline is one month,

350
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
you will admit your mistake in front of His Majesty.

351
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
You can't break the case.

352
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
You can't let him withdraw the order of your commander

353
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
and go to the school.

354
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
No.

355
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
What do you want?

356
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
I will send someone to you later.

357
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
No.

358
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
You...

359
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Why?

360
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,760
You don't want to leave the commander?

361
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,760
I am not the one who is responsible for the war.

362
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
If I am the one who is responsible for it,

363
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
what will you do?

364
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Who will help you?

365
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
You just raised your butt and helped me.

366
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Since they dare to do something to you,

367
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
I won't let them go.

368
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
What do you mean?

369
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
You are suspecting me again?

370
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Although the capital is in a state of chaos,

371
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,760
the Black Hand behind us is just a few people.

372
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I have checked it.

373
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
I can confirm that the internal murder case

374
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
is going to be in Xie Yu's hands.

375
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
In the capital,

376
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
no one has the motive and the ability to do so.

377
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Then the case will be broken, right?

378
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
It will be broken, right?

379
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Knowing that it's Xie Yu

380
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,760
doesn't mean that it can break the case.

381
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Especially you.

382
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
His Majesty is suspicious now.

383
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
You and Prince Yu have a connection.

384
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
If Xie Yu is going to the court at this time,

385
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
it's more like he is involved in the fight.

386
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Find evidence?

387
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Let me ask you.

388
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
How much crime is the assassination of the Qing Dynasty?

389
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Will Xie Yu leave any evidence

390
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
that he wants to do?

391
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Even if you find the evidence,

392
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
you can't break the case.

393
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Why?

394
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
You just have to raise your hands.

395
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Since they want to use the martial arts of the martial arts world,

396
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
I will let them know.

397
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Who will be the one to decide this?

398
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Brother.

399
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
I've heard about it.

400
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
That case of the internal prison

401
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
was indeed handed to Xuan Jin Si secretly.

402
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
This is about the royal family's reputation.

403
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Even if His Majesty still believes in Brother Meng,

404
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
he won't give such a case

405
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
to a person who has never done anything

406
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
with experience before.

407
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Brother Meng,

408
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
I'm sorry.

416
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I'm sorry.

417
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Why are your hands so cold?

420
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
It's okay.

421
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I just had some cold water.

422
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Actually this case

423
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
was originally about the internal prison.

424
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
So Xie Yu has already known that

425
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
he didn't kill Brother Meng,

426
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
but Xia Chun or Xia Dong.

427
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
But the case of Xuan Jin Si and Leiting,

428
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,760
will Xie Yu really stop the case?

429
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
She should have prepared earlier.

430
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Even if Xuan Jin Si suspects her,

431
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I don't think she can find any evidence.

432
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Zhuo Ding Feng,

433
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
the fourth rank of the Langya High School.

434
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
It should be hard to find a break.

435
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Unless Dong Jie finds a chance to fight with her,

436
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
he will find a way

437
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
from his sword and his dead foot wounds.

438
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
But with Xia Dong's power,

439
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
it's not easy to find a break

440
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
with Zhuo Ding Feng.

441
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
And Brother Meng,

442
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
he's the first rank of the Langya High School.

443
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
The first rank of the Langya High School

444
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
is lying on the bed and getting injured.

445
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Even if he's recovered,

446
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
what if Zhuo Ding Feng comes?

447
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
He won't be able to fight with him.

448
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
If you say so,

449
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
even Xuan Jin Si can't break this case.

450
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,760
That's why I didn't help Brother Meng break the case.

451
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
How can you say that?

452
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Even Xuan Jin Si can't break the case.

453
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
But Brother Meng broke it.

454
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
What should His Majesty think?

455
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
It's not a shock.

456
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
It's a burden.

457
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Since this case,

458
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Brother Meng can't break it.

459
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Then let him investigate everything.

460
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
When the deadline is up,

461
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
he'll ask His Majesty to punish him.

462
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
It's not like that.

463
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,760
We should investigate this case.

464
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
If we can't,

465
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
we'll have to hurry.

466
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
It's just that there's no result.

467
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
No result?

468
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
I want the result without any result.

469
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Father!

470
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
Go out and relax.

471
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
You come from the mother's yard.

472
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Yes.

473
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Mother keeps talking to me.

474
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
I don't know if it's going to be that late.

475
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm going back to my room to rest.

476
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
You should go back earlier.

477
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Yes.

478
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Hurry up!

479
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
What are you doing?

480
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Hurry up!

481
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Hurry up!

482
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
What's going on outside?

483
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Your Majesty,

484
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
someone's been sent to the palace.

485
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Don't worry.

486
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
The imperial guards have killed him.

487
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Someone's been sent to the palace.

488
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Can this be a day of peace?

489
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Your Majesty, calm down.

490
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Although he's dead,

491
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,760
he's indeed the eunuch who's been in the palace for three years.

492
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
He's not out there.

493
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Tell me,

494
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,760
what's wrong with you?

495
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
I'm responsible for my loss.

496
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
I'll be the eunuch in the future.

497
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
I won't do this again.

498
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Your Majesty,

499
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
there are many people in the palace.

500
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
It's hard to avoid the small picture.

501
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Your Majesty,

502
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
it's not a big deal.

503
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Don't be angry.

504
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Thank goodness that you're here.

505
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
There's no big mess this time.

506
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm not guilty to you.

507
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
But you must understand

508
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
that the empress has the honor of having the empress.

509
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,760
And she should be responsible for the empress.

510
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,760
If you really can't manage the harem,

511
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
I can find someone to manage it for you.

512
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Your Majesty,

513
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
you're being too harsh.

514
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
There's nothing big going on.

515
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Your Highness,

516
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
you've already apologized.

517
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
What else do you want?

518
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
It's too hard for you.

519
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
What's the use of complaining?

520
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Your Majesty,

521
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
you're right.

522
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm the one who

523
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
made all the trouble in the harem.

524
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
The more expensive it is,

525
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
the more blame I have for it.

526
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
But Your Highness...

527
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
From now on,

528
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
we'll be doing the work.

529
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,760
We'll be doing the walk-in and the tea-making.

530
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
I've been in charge of the harem for years.

531
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,760
The empress is not a fool.

532
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I think it's someone who wants to be a fool.

533
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Your Highness,

534
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,760
these dishes have been in the harem for a few days.

535
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Two people are trying to put up with the impending disaster

536
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
in the imperial kitchen.

537
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,760
Two people are also searching for the firewood.

538
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Someone is hiding it.

539
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Someone is stealing the property.

540
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Someone is sending news from the private house.

541
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
They all found out the truth.

542
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Please punish them.

543
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
All of them are killed.

544
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Your Highness, Your Highness.

545
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Your Highness, Your Highness.

546
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
It's a very common thing to do.

547
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Brother Tong.

548
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Miss Gong Yu.

549
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Come in and talk.

550
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Why are you here?

551
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Is there something important

552
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
that you want to see the Sect Leader?

553
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
I...

554
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
I thought that

555
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
it's the third year of the year.

556
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
I haven't given the Sect Leader a year

557
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
to see him.

558
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
But the Sect Leader just fell asleep.

559
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
The doctor told me

560
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
to let him rest more.

561
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
He told us to wait for the afternoon

562
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
to wake him up.

563
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Because the family has been around for years

564
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
to disturb him.

565
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
It's really inappropriate.

566
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Why don't you wait here?

567
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
After the afternoon,

568
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
you can see him again.

569
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Forget it.

570
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
I was hiding it from Mr. San.

571
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I couldn't wait for so long.

572
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Brother Tong.

573
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Don't tell the Sect Leader that I came.

574
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
You came to see him, right?

575
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Why didn't you tell him?

576
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I thought

577
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,760
if I could see him again,

578
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
even if I was punished by him,

579
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
but now that I can't see him,

580
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
why must I make him angry?

581
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
The Sect Leader told me

582
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
that without his permission,

583
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
we can't come here without permission.

584
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
I'll leave now.

585
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Okay.

586
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Sister Qi.

587
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Be careful.

588
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Brother,

589
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
don't be so careful.

590
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
My stomach

591
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
hasn't been able to walk

592
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
well.

593
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
By the way,

594
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
where is Brother Qingyao?

595
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Why didn't he come with you?

596
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
We haven't been to the capital for almost a year.

597
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Qingyao needs to visit some good friends.

598
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
He's not here all day.

599
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Brother.

600
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
What do you want to ask me?

601
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
The second night,

602
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
did you two have a quarrel?

603
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Did you make a scene?

604
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
No.

605
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Why did you ask?

606
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Since you didn't,

607
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
why did you

608
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
say you were going out for a walk?

609
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
He didn't go out that night.

610
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
He said that father asked him to go to Xiaqi.

611
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
So he went back to his room late.

612
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Really?

613
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
Shen Zui.

614
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
The Ministry of Revenue said that

615
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Shen Zui...

616
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Shen Zui has been active everywhere recently.

617
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
He's been trying to get the old account of the Louzhi Mirror.

618
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
He's trying to create a fake case.

619
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
He's not good enough for Crown Prince.

620
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
But I heard that

621
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
this Minister Shen has a good personality.

622
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
And...

623
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
But he's a bit

624
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
more cautious.

625
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Don't worry.

626
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
I've checked it out.

627
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
He's indeed the one who's the Prince of Yu.

628
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Crown Prince has ordered that

629
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
no matter what Shen Zui has found out,

630
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
everything will be destroyed.

631
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,760
No one can stay until the time comes.

632
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Brother Su, you're almost there.

633
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
We should also go to the Louzhi Mirror

634
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
to have a talk.

635
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
In the past,

636
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
you went out to the Qing House

637
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
to have a talk, right?

638
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm not going.

639
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
You can take the flight.

640
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
Brother Su, you really want me to take the flight?

641
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Aren't you afraid that

642
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I'll take the flight

643
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
and take the flight back?

644
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
You really can take the flight back.

645
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
I think it's good

646
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
that you don't take the flight back.

647
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
You're really a fake prince.

648
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
When I first came to the Louzhi Mirror,

649
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
you thought it was the Qing House.

650
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Who on earth did we come here for?

651
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
I wanted to take Brother Su to listen to the music.

652
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Brother Su,

653
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
let's not talk about it.

654
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
The music in Miaoyin's house

655
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
is really amazing.

656
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
You're a great singer.

657
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,760
It's a pity that you don't go to see the music.

658
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
I think it's interesting

659
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
to say that.

660
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Then the month of the month is coming to an end.

661
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
We'll have a date

662
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
on the 15th of June.

663
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Let's have a date on the 15th of June.

664
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Let's have a date on the 15th of June.

665
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
The music in Miaoyin's house

666
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
is the latest song of Mr. Shan.

667
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
That day,

668
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
it's the perfect time to play with the toy.

669
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
You said you were happy

670
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
when you saw the music.

671
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Jingrui,

672
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
it's been a long time since I saw you dance.

673
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
It's hard to be a little bit more careful today.

674
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Let Brother Su see how you are doing.

675
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I got your address

676
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
in Langzhou in the past seven days.

677
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Jingrui has always felt that

678
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
I was too much of a burden.

679
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
Since Brother Su is interested today,

680
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
let's go to the hospital.

681
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
The top of the list.

682
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,800
The one who is more

683
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,760
rewarded will have more opportunities.

684
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Join us soon.

685
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,760
The first in the Aomansin Pujing Entertainment City 994466.

686
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Come.

687
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Prince Jing is so good at dancing.

688
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
It's not a luxury to meet people.

689
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Compared to other princes,

690
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
the atmosphere is really different.

691
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
The people of the Shen family are very precious.

692
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
How many people

693
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
have been waiting for you

694
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
for this year?

695
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
How can you run away

696
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
to the place where no one asks you about money?

697
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Although many people come here,

698
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,760
there are few people who know the truth.

699
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Prince Jing is so angry here.

700
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
You won't be unwilling to come, right?

701
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I have someone here.

702
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
I have a good chance.

703
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Please sit, Mr. Shen.

704
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
How did you find out

705
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
about the case of the private kitchen?

706
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
It's a very complicated case.

707
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
If it's too early,

708
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I'll go to the kitchen

709
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
when the emperor's seal is opened.

710
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
If it's too late,

711
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
it's not too late to go to the place.

712
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
How dare you run away?

713
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Don't think it's safe in the capital.

714
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
There are people

715
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
who are still killing people

716
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
at the construction site.

717
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Good idea.

718
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Jingrui,

719
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
do you think your posture is handsome?

720
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
You haven't moved for so long.

721
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
I've been waiting for you here.

722
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Just have a look.

723
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,360
I do know

724
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,760
how to use the holy will to be

725
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,160
to the使 in and 향까지.

726
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,060
The miracle of the holy will

727
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
is that you reach the temple

728
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,060
completely with your machine.

729
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,060
It is a question I can say.

730
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,360
Anyone who knows

731
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,860
about the task of the individual

732
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,940
or deserves blessed

733
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
is surely the god of justice.

734
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,080
Emptyurs.

735
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,900
F***.

736
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,100
Good!

737
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,960
It seems that Master Zhuoiu has no今回.

738
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,340
You've learned his truth from this Heavenly Power.

739
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,380
I guess you think yourloud eyed man's右兵 is no match to yours.

740
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Qingyang's brotherhood is naturally above me.

741
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
Just like this,

742
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
flying birds and birds are the best.

743
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
I can't practice it.

744
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,380
You're young.

745
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
You're naturally short of fire.

746
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,980
When I was in the Ming Dynasty of Zheqing Yao,

747
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,380
I heard a lot about it when I was in Langzhou.

748
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,780
I also taught it in the martial arts world.

749
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,580
After the Zhejiang family passed the war,

750
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
will they be able to go back to Tianquan?

751
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
I'm not in a hurry either.

752
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,980
From Fenzuo to the capital,

753
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,580
it's just a journey in ten days.

754
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,380
Everyone usually lives in the middle of April.

755
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
It's different this year.

756
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,980
My sister is pregnant.

757
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
She's going to be born in May.

758
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,780
By that time,

759
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,180
I'm going to be her uncle.

760
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,380
I'm going to be her uncle.

761
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,780
Congratulations.

762
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,580
I'm sure the eldest princess is worried.

763
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
So let the eldest lady

764
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,380
be born in the Niang family.

765
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,380
Exactly.

766
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,580
Jingrui,

767
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,580
why don't you tell Brother Su?

768
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,180
Why did the Zhuo family's parents

769
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,780
have to pass the middle of April?

770
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,380
Is there any important day in April?

771
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,580
Brother Su, guess it.

772
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
Jingrui's birthday.

773
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,380
April 12th.

774
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,180
Look at Jingrui's expression.

775
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,380
Besides,

776
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,780
this matter is related to me.

777
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,780
It's related to me.

778
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,580
You're so stubborn.

779
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,180
You've seen how expression can be.

780
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:40,980
Master,

781
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,380
please have some snacks.

782
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,980
Go in.

783
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
I'll cover your mouth.

784
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,380
You've only brought two pieces.

785
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,180
I'm worried.

786
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,580
I'll take you back.

787
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,580
I've been thinking about

788
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,180
not giving you any trouble.

789
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Don't be so polite.

790
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,380
The nurse was attacked by the wolf.

791
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,780
She's going to be punished.

792
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,780
The capital is a bit unstable.

793
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,780
Be careful.

794
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,580
That's right.

795
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,780
Although I disturbed you today,

796
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,980
I'm really sorry.

797
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,580
I'll visit you again someday.

798
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,180
I'm sorry.

799
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,980
I'm sorry.

800
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,780
Zhenyin.

801
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,980
Master Shen.

802
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,180
Please.

803
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,780
The soup is so good.

804
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,580
It must be very expensive.

805
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,180
Your tongue is so expensive.

806
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,380
You can eat it all.

807
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,780
Jingrui.

808
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,980
How's your birthday?

809
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,380
I'm just a kid.

810
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,980
I don't deserve to celebrate.

811
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Jingrui's birthday is a big one.

812
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,180
Yuqi.

813
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,780
Chengdui didn't say it.

814
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,780
Princess.

815
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
You're so good.

816
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm so proud of you.

817
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
I'm so proud of you.

818
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,580
I'm so proud of you.

819
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
I'm so proud of you.

820
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,780
I'm so proud of you.

821
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,780
I'm so proud of you.

822
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,780
I'm so proud of you.

823
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,780
I'm so proud of you.

824
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,380
Your Highness.

825
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,780
You're going to celebrate it every year.

826
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,380
Let him invite all the good friends

827
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,180
who he wants to invite to the house.

828
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,980
Let's celebrate it.

829
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,980
Jingrui's birthday is the 25th.

830
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
It's a half-court.

831
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,580
It should be more fun.

832
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,380
If you can come this year,

833
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,580
that's good.

834
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,780
Are you crazy?

835
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,780
I'm sure you'll come to the capital in April.

836
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,380
Don't you plan to invite him on your birthday?

837
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,380
Of course not.

838
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
When I was living in the snow house,

839
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,380
I couldn't take care of my family.

840
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,780
I don't know if you're willing to come.

841
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,380
You're asking me this.

842
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,780
You didn't invite me.

843
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
How can I come?

844
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,380
You're willing to come?

845
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
You and I are friends.

846
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,780
We're in the same boat.

847
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,380
We're not in the same boat.

848
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,380
I'm just a few years older.

849
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
I can't make a fuss.

850
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
Don't think about us.

851
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,580
Then let's make a deal.

852
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,980
I'll come to you as soon as possible.

853
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,180
You're so lucky.

854
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,580
If you come,

855
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,580
I won't let you go.

856
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:21,980
Brother Su,

857
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,780
my birthday is July 7th.

858
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,980
Don't forget it.

859
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,780
You're in the middle of your birthday.

860
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
It's better to be on July 15th.

861
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,780
You're on July 30th.

862
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,780
No matter how the boy looks,

863
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,780
he's full of love.

864
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,780
I believe that's how it is.

865
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,980
Speaking of love,

866
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,380
Yu Jin is really like that.

867
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,180
No.

868
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
Don't praise me.

869
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,580
I can't accept it.

870
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,980
Brother Su,

871
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,180
this year,

872
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,380
my dad and I broke up.

873
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,780
He drank a few more times.

874
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,580
He forgot to give me the money.

875
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,980
His hands are tight.

876
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,580
Don't give him such a good thing.

877
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,180
If it wasn't for him, I'd be so bad.

878
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,380
He's not good at the brand.

879
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,780
He doesn't need to give him such a good thing.

880
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,180
I heard it.

881
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,180
Jingrui, to be honest,

882
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,580
no matter what gift Brother Su gives you,

883
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,580
if Brother Su can attend the event,

884
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,180
it'll be a unforgettable birthday.

885
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,180
Right?

886
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,980
Brother Su.

887
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,580
Master.

888
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,780
In the capital,

889
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,380
there are still nine masters and Jue Dingfeng.

890
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
This is the list.

891
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,580
Okay.

892
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,180
Master,

893
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,580
should we inform Mr. Shi Zan

894
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,180
to send someone to watch?

895
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,580
Yes.

896
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,180
Master,

897
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,580
I think we should inform Mr. Shi Zan

898
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,380
to send someone to watch.

899
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,980
Are you sure?

900
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,580
What are you looking at?

901
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
According to the rules,

902
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,580
you don't need to be too ruthless.

903
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,780
Just let them leave the house.

904
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,580
The emperor's wife is a good girl.

905
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
She's a good girl.

906
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,180
She's a good girl.

907
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,580
She's a good girl.

908
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,780
She's a good girl.

909
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,180
She's a good girl.

910
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,580
She's a good girl.

911
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,780
She's a good girl.

912
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,180
She's a good girl.

913
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,580
She's a good girl.

914
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
She's a good girl.

915
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,980
She's a good girl.

916
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,380
She's a good girl.

917
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,580
She's a good girl.

918
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
She's a good girl.

919
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,980
She's a good girl.

920
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,180
She's a good girl.

921
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,380
She's a good girl.

922
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,580
She's a good girl.

923
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,780
She's a good girl.

924
