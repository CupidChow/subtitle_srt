1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
The King's Robe Knight

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,920
Qi Jun

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,240
We're making the arrangement

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
why are you working all the time?

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,680
We've been in the same queue

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,440
I've already decided.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,200
Say, Hao, I won't let you win today.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,880
Come on.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,280
Go on.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,640
About Zhang Hao Yang,

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,600
I heard that the team has taken him down.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,960
Is there a reason for that?

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,600
Don't be too harsh.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,560
If Lian Hai Ping says it's enough, it's definitely enough.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,040
Who else is more strict than him?

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,120
Lian Hai Ping applied to search Zhang Hao Yang's car.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,560
But his car

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,040
is in the name of his father.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,000
This situation is a bit sensitive.

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
What's sensitive?

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,240
Last time, Zhang Hao Yang said

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,520
that on the day of the crime,

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,920
he didn't tell the truth when he saw Shen Xiao Zhou.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,400
The actual situation is

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
there was a conflict between the two people.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,560
Zhang Hao Yang was very emotional.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,160
He might have followed Shen Xiao Zhou.

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,320
He's got a reason.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,520
He's sensitive.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,680
Go on.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,080
I'll win you right away.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,320
I'll go to the temple.

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,760
But it's not that bad. Come on.

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,640
The

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
The

36
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
The

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
The

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,640
The

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,640
The

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
The

41
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
The

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
The

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
The

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
The

45
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
The

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
The

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
The

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
The

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
The

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
The

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
The

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,160
The

53
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
The

54
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
The

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
The

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
The

57
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
The

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
The

59
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,560
The

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
The

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,720
The

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,520
Announcement to disassemble the car

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,100
Check this, here

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
I'm not sure if you have any anesthesia.

65
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Okay.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
What kind of medicine is this? It's all in English.

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
It's a medicine with one hundred million words.

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
You know this?

69
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm not sure.

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
He's still hesitating.

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
He's living in such a big house.

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
What's there to hesitate about?

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Give me the medicine.

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Open it.

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Open it.

77
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
There's not even a single fingerprint.

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
It's so clean.

79
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
There's no hair, no clothes, no fiber.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
I don't know.

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
I thought the train just left the factory.

82
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
This is a headband.

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
It looks like a name tag.

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Why is it in the pillow?

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Stick some water in it.

86
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Zhang Hao Yang saw him again.

87
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
This...

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
This is a proof.

89
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Give it to me.

90
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
It's a change.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
It's a blood test.

92
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,720
June 19, 3.23 pm.

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
After you and Shen Xiao Zhou

94
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
separated in the Southern Li Gong University campus,

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
have you seen him again?

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Think it over before you answer.

97
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
No.

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
I wish I had seen him.

99
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Where did you get this headband?

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Why do you have this scarf?

101
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I found it in your pillow.

102
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I thought you found his.

103
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
What do you mean? This isn't his.

104
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Just come here if you have something.

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
It's too late. The mood is different.

106
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I gave it to him.

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,720
He gave it back to me after he tried it on.

108
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
I know there's his hair in it.

109
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Don't lose it.

110
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
What about the headband?

111
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I bought it in the night market.

112
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
It was only 10 yuan.

113
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
He doesn't know the brand.

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
He likes that look.

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I bought him a real one.

116
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
He knew the price was over 2,000 yuan.

117
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
He refused to wear it and gave it back to me.

118
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
How long did it take to recover?

119
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
For two days.

120
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
And then?

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Around five days.

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Didn't I become aroninking group?

123
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
How long did that take?

125
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Maybe five or six days.

126
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
You want to lock me up in the prison?

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,200
You want to shoot me?

128
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,680
But even if I kill myself,

129
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,840
I can't hurt Xu Jiaozhu.

130
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,760
There are two ways.

131
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,880
Is it that coincidental?

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,680
Impossible.

133
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,320
His logic is completely self-evident.

134
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
There is no place for him to be confused.

135
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,360
Then how to do it?

136
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,800
Go to the river to check.

137
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,200
The corpse that Xu Jiaozhu brought

138
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
was not the body of Xu Jiaozhu.

139
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,480
Shen Xiaozhou brought more than two thousand yuan

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,800
or ten yuan?

141
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
Shen Xiaozhou loves saving money so much.

142
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,560
Will he be willing to return

143
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
the two thousand yuan?

144
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,680
Saving money is loving your own money.

145
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,640
It doesn't mean loving others' money.

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
Go ask his parents.

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,280
They can't tell.

148
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,480
Go ask Yue Chunxia.

149
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,560
Can't you wait for the result of the court?

150
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,560
Xue Ji should be Zhang Haoyang's own.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,560
If there is Shen Xiaozhou,

152
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
he just told me.

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,440
You're going?

154
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,960
Yes.

155
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,120
Boss. What do you want?

156
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,360
violence?

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,240
Okay.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Genonsiderate?

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
rell에서you back.

160
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

161
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,700
Don't fall for this prime matter anymore.

162
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,320
Badly wounded, seriously badly wounded.

163
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:53,040
I want to see how you're going to treat and eliminate that male caste's

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,760
rise in crimin Magistrate Xiao vocation.

165
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,960
Please believe me.

166
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,740
I believe you're a strong person.

167
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,920
Yang Xiao somewhat-

168
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm telling you.

169
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,960
The child is very weak.

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,920
He's dizzy.

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,680
Can you let him rest first?

172
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,880
We can change the day.

173
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,200
This is not Xiaozhou's.

174
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
This is real.

175
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,120
Xiaozhou bought it in the night market.

176
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Even the label was wrong.

177
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,520
Are you sure?

178
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,720
He really didn't wear it.

179
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,400
He said he was too worried.

180
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,000
Fool.

181
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,240
Come on, get inside for a while.

182
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Don't bother him anymore.

183
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,040
I can't stand it.

184
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,320
Sorry, I'll call him.

185
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,920
Take care.

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,200
Police.

187
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,120
Wait.

188
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
Did the landlady's boss catch him?

189
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,840
Who?

190
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,840
The illegal fund.

191
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,480
He ran all the money.

192
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,960
He cheated us all.

193
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,200
I heard he went to Australia.

194
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,360
Can he be caught back?

195
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,320
He's a criminal.

196
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,720
You're a criminal.

197
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Why do you want to ask?

198
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,440
Sorry for delaying your work.

199
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,080
Goodbye.

200
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,680
Mr. Yue.

201
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,840
June 19th was the night of the crime.

202
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,080
Did you go out?

203
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,640
Did you see anyone suspicious around here?

204
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:39,960
No.

205
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
I was at home that night.

206
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,160
I was watching TV.

207
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,720
Right?

208
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,720
I can't remember.

209
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,960
Who can remember?

210
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, I won't bother you.

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,760
Goodbye.

212
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,520
Goodbye.

213
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,560
What do you mean by

214
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,160
asking Yue Hongbin?

215
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,200
The day when Yue Hongbin

216
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,320
was injured by Guang Zi,

217
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,120
the question record says

218
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,080
he was washing his car at home.

219
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
You think

220
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,440
he used the car the night before?

221
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
He didn't have a motive.

222
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
Maybe I'm overthinking.

223
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,080
If don't have a motive,

224
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,640
I can understand someday.

225
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,960
If he knew he was STOPing on time,

226
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,280
maybe I'd take it from him.

227
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,000
Without your jacket,

228
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,600
I'd wear these Carlot Future Lectures

229
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
like a princess.

230
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
Is that a model?

231
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,040
One one, Two!

232
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
A model.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
You understand it from today.

234
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,840
toilets.

235
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,000
It's not worth it.

236
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
The previous factory manager

237
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,840
was the one who was the most efficient.

238
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,280
Look at you.

239
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,480
You were the most successful one.

240
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,600
You didn't do anything.

241
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,640
You're done for.

242
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,320
You're the one who's the boss.

243
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,400
You're still pretending to be low-key.

244
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,760
You don't even want to change the house.

245
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,400
Can you be more reasonable?

246
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,440
Who are you acting to?

247
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,880
I call you factory manager Yue.

248
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,720
What's the use of factory manager Yue?

249
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,040
What's the use?

250
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,320
I've made you suffer.

252
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,400
It's good that you know.

253
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,000
I've searched Zhang Haoyang's shop.

254
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,520
No one found it.

255
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
We did a second inspection of his car.

256
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
We didn't find any traces of Shen Xiaozhou.

257
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,960
Xue Ji's DNA result has also come out.

258
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
It's Zhang Haoyang's.

259
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,680
I think it's Zhang Haoyang.

260
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,640
He cleaned the car and the house so cleanly.

261
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,680
He's too abnormal.

262
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,000
He's a criminal.

263
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,520
His car was just washed.

264
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,960
It's a big maintenance done in time.

265
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,480
There's a record of it in the CS store.

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,080
Well, their house is clean

267
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,560
because they clean it every three days.

268
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,480
And it's always been like this.

269
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,480
They're used to it.

270
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,840
It's normal for a rich family like their house

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,960
to be like this.

272
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,080
In short, there's no leak and no evidence, right?

273
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,280
Even if the evidence can't be locked,

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
we can't rule out his suspicion.

275
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480
A witness said something false.

276
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,920
What's wrong with Zhang Haoyang's wound?

277
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,000
He got drunk and slipped the bottle.

278
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
Otherwise, he couldn't be discharged.

279
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,600
Actually, it's not.

280
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,440
They discussed it.

281
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,320
Why?

282
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,720
Yeah.

283
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,760
I think he's the most reliable one.

284
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,000
It seems that

285
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,160
the rich and the poor

286
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,720
might have done the false evidence.

287
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
How about catching them back

288
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,640
and beating them one by one?

289
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,240
Maybe they can open a new breakthrough.

290
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,800
They'll find another explanation right away.

291
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
For Zhang Haoyang's sake,

292
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
he can't remember it because he's drunk.

293
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,920
He can't ask for it.

294
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
Let him go.

295
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,720
If he gets the evidence,

296
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
he can be caught again.

297
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,080
Thank you. Thank you.

298
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,960
Can you give me the driver's license?

299
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,320
It's not Professor Shen's.

300
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,160
It's okay.

301
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,680
Where's the hair?

302
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Sorry.

303
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
It's for inspection.

304
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,880
Let's go.

305
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,520
Thank you.

306
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
Let's go back first.

307
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,240
diری

308
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,760
Right.

309
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,480
That day, Xiaozhou might have…

310
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,240
What?

311
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,120
After a little distinct myself,

312
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,720
maybe I don't know.

313
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,480
Let's go.

314
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,080
Isn't it embarrassing?

315
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
I picked up the car here.

317
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,800
I picked it up and checked it for a few days.

318
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,320
No one wanted it, so I drove away.

319
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Oh, right.

320
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,120
I found a bank card in the car.

321
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,080
This is a boat run.

322
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,200
The plane ticket is a bill.

323
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,800
Maybe he didn't go anywhere.

324
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,280
He's been killed.

325
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,040
The car is here.

326
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,680
It's the one who found us.

327
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,200
He's in charge. Who wants to kill him?

328
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Keep checking.

329
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,360
Are you alright?

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,440
Are you alright?

331
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,560
Uncle.

332
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,320
Look,

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,800
Wu Zhuang.

334
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,400
Er...

335
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,640
Wu Tu E is here.

336
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,000
Could you go and stop looking around?

337
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,480
I'm 보여줘.

338
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,920
Uncle is such a good girl.

339
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,200
She couldn't have working with you.

340
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,240
She didn't have a better idea.

341
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm really sorry.

342
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,560
If one day we meet again,

343
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,460
you need me to take care of that little drama Girl.

344
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,480
Come on.

345
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,340
Hurry.

346
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,740
Shoot Colorful Yaonan straight.

347
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
You go first.

348
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,260
I'll go up and scold him.

349
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,700
Let's go?

350
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,100
Hello, Uncle.

351
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,340
Are you here looking for Shu?

352
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,620
Yes.

353
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,580
If she doesn't gather,

354
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,660
I will look for her.

355
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,300
Uncle, bye.

356
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,520
But you need a driver,

357
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,480
but he's rich

358
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,800
You can't give her money

359
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,960
Didn't charge her

360
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,400
It's ok

361
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,240
You can buy her by yourself

362
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,840
All right

363
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:37,600
Good

364
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,020
Hello.

365
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,340
Hello.

366
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm your dad?

367
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,440
I hope you can help me find my parents.

368
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,300
Okay?

369
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,380
Hello, I'm the driver of Lin's kolok.

370
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,340
Yes?

371
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,140
Can I see your car?

372
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,340
I just want to have a look.

373
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,700
You said you were a police officer, right?

374
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,260
Did you bring the search warrant?

375
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,140
I didn't tell him clearly.

376
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,820
I didn't come here today

377
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,420
as a police officer.

378
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,300
Then there's nothing to see.

379
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,740
Have some tea.

380
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,940
Uncle.

381
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,820
My car is in the repair shop.

382
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,540
It's opposite the south gate of the community.

383
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:41,940
Thank you.

384
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,220
Uncle, can you

385
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,260
tell my dad

386
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,380
I'll go to see Uncle Lian Jiang?

387
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,540
Thank you, uncle.

388
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,860
There's nothing in the car, right?

389
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,500
No.

390
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,300
No repair needed.

391
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,500
What's wrong with the car?

392
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,620
Let me see.

393
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,660
Go ahead.

394
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,700
Okay.

395
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,700
Give him some more.

396
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,020
Okay.

397
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,220
Thank you.

398
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,340
You didn't drive the car.

399
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,700
Why did you admit it?

400
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,620
I drove it.

401
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,100
The car was driven by the owner's child.

402
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,980
Your classmate.

403
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,500
He has a wound on his shoulder.

404
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,940
The seat belt was torn.

405
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,100
He sat on the driver's seat.

406
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,180
There's a seat belt on the back seat.

407
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,780
I drove it.

408
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,580
You drove it?

409
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,500
Why is your fingerprint

410
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,420
on the back seat of the passenger seat?

411
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,780
You sat in the back row.

412
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,140
Fingerprint?

413
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,420
Why didn't you take it?

414
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,700
I just took it today.

415
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,340
How do you know it's my fingerprint?

416
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,300
You took it from home

417
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,940
to compete.

418
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,540
I had your fingerprint long ago.

419
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,900
When you were five years old,

420
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,820
I took all your fingerprints.

421
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,940
I also kept your DNA data a few years ago.

422
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,740
Why?

423
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,060
Do you think I'm a criminal?

424
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,620
I killed and let him go?

425
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,420
Of course not.

426
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,020
It's for safety.

427
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,860
Go.

428
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,820
Go now.

429
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,660
This is the money I sold to Polar.

430
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,340
I didn't steal it.

431
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
How should I pay it back?

432
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,260
It's too good to make a living.

433
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,140
What you didn't use up,

434
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,020
get out and eat it.

435
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,340
What?

436
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,140
When was the last time

437
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,500
we went out and eating together?

438
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,860
Both of us.

439
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,100
It's been a month, right?

440
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
Is this place okay?

441
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,500
The average consumption is 220 yuan.

442
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,260
It'll cost me half a month's food.

443
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,180
Forget it.

444
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,660
I've chosen several places.

445
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,820
How about you choose one?

446
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,860
Let's go to our old place.

447
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,260
Let's go.

448
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,780
You're eating it?

449
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,660
It's enough. I can't eat it.

450
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,700
Eat less tonight.

451
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,420
It's mainly about the form.

452
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
The content doesn't matter.

453
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,540
Eat fish.

454
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,540
You went to see Uncle again today?

455
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,540
My mom saw you.

456
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,580
What did you tell her?

457
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,500
She was so angry that she couldn't eat anything.

458
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,860
She didn't eat anything.

459
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,980
What did she say?

460
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,940
My son doesn't know you like I do.

461
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,420
You're just a rock.

462
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,100
If you don't tell her everything now,

463
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,620
she'll grow up.

464
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,860
She's as self-respecting as you.

465
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,380
She'll have nothing to say to you in the future.

466
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,980
Are you going to be a cow with her forever?

467
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,460
You and your dad are just like that.

468
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,460
Okay.

469
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,180
I'll try my best.

470
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,140
Why are you so free today?

471
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,980
What about the case?

472
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,300
The clue was broken.

473
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,940
There's no progress.

474
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,940
What case is it this time?

475
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,540
I think you're very tired this time.

476
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
It's okay.

477
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,180
It's all like this.

478
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,420
If you want to say it, just say it.

479
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,420
Don't worry.

480
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,620
It's nothing.

481
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,980
The case is over.

482
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,860
I'll tell you sooner or later.

483
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,420
It doesn't matter if you say it or not.

484
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
I'm just worried that you'll be too bored.

485
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,060
Do you want some soup?

486
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,180
Yes.

487
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,020
By the way,

488
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,460
Sister Guo's son is going to participate in a summer camp.

489
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,860
She said she was afraid that her son would be bullied.

490
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,300
She wanted to borrow a box

491
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,300
that looks like a box for the police.

492
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,580
Don't you have one?

493
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,540
A box for the police?

494
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,980
It's a prize for the police.

495
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,900
It says the police and Liu Nian on it.

496
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,500
It's all your old treasure.

497
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,100
Did you

498
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,180
lend that box to her?

499
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,580
No.

500
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,780
I'm just asking.

501
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,860
If you don't want to,

502
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,980
I won't lend it to you.

503
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,860
Go ahead.

504
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,540
I'll go back and get it for you.

505
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,420
It's so hot.

506
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,060
Don't get in the car.

507
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,300
Don't get in the car.

508
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,020
Do you need any help?

509
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,340
I'm no need.

510
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,780
Thank you.

511
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,580
Why do you need help from me,

512
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,540
you're definitely a Assemblyman.

513
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,780
Which is your job?

514
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,480
You can tell me.

515
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
I may be a little younger,

516
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,540
but I'm a Sichuan man,

517
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,340
I can choose how to stay in every room.

518
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,140
I can't help you with your wife and kids at home,

519
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,100
but can compare to you.

520
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,420
Forget it.

521
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,140
That's another concern.

522
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,540
the death of a female college student.

523
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,860
It's a big piece of crap

524
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,060
written in a living line.

525
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,420
It's stupid and ridiculous.

526
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,020
Besides the news

527
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,300
that has been spread in the society,

528
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,700
it also mentioned many details.

529
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,660
Only we should know

530
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,220
these details.

531
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,380
How did they know

532
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,460
about the name tag?

533
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,180
It's not Zhang Haoyang's own story.

534
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,540
Impossible.

535
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,900
Most of the news

536
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,820
is about Zhang Haoyang.

537
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,660
They all say that this rich second-generation

538
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,220
from elementary school to high school

539
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,140
has always been a problem boy.

540
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,900
He's usually not a big deal.

541
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,740
Once someone provokes him,

542
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,100
he'll hurt people.

543
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,900
Once, he even used a knife

544
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,380
to cut other students' fingers.

545
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,060
He didn't take any responsibility.

546
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,860
He just lost money and that's it.

547
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,900
How can the news

548
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,980
make him a hot guy?

549
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,620
The news made him

550
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,620
burn himself in the fire pit.

551
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,100
It also said that

552
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,420
as a suspect who killed Shen Xiaozhou,

553
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,580
he had many reasons.

554
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,740
But he just

555
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,380
left the Public Security Bureau without any damage.

556
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,540
In one night,

557
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,180
this incident was on the Internet.

558
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,140
You can read the comments.

559
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,460
Who was the one who scolded Zhang Haoyang the most?

560
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,260
The police

561
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,180
were badly scolded.

562
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,300
This guy

563
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,500
is the most responsible

564
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,620
for the case.

565
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,740
These things

566
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,340
are so detailed.

567
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,860
How do you know

568
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,060
his Weibo account?

569
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
Of course we don't know.

570
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,980
Actually, I'm angry too.

571
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,700
An important suspect

572
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,460
can only watch him leave.

573
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,740
Who can stop him

574
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,900
and who doesn't want to clean up?

575
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,020
Lin,

576
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,580
don't take your time.

577
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,540
How about this?

578
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,500
Let's open a list first.

579
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,180
Then,

580
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,900
you can talk about me first.

581
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,620
Brother,

582
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,300
how can I

583
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,700
be like you?

584
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,220
We've been friends for years.

585
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,700
We know each other well.

586
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,340
Let's dig into

587
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,540
Zhang Haoyang's background.

588
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,500
Is it because

589
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,220
he has a big personality problem?

590
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,020
Also, let's dig into

591
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,780
the information source of

592
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,460
the Feng Yun Headquarters.

593
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,180
By the way,

594
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,100
look at this information source.

595
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,140
Could it be from our internal affairs?

596
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,220
No.

597
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,980
There's another piece

598
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,220
behind this post

599
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,140
about the psychological research

600
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,220
of the pervert murderer.

601
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,180
Combined with the information

602
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,540
about Zhang Haoyang,

603
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,020
it seems to be guiding the public

604
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,780
that Zhang Haoyang

605
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,140
is the one who

606
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,980
is the real murderer of this series of cases.

607
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,300
What is the purpose

608
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,900
of this?

609
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,700
We're all police officers.

610
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,540
We should say

611
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,340
and we shouldn't say.

612
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,220
The rules of behavior

613
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,260
are clear.

614
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,380
Can't we understand it?

615
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,660
Yes.

616
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,740
But some people

617
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,260
may not have read

618
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,820
the rules of behavior.

619
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,980
Who are you talking about?

620
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,140
Hello.

621
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,500
I didn't say who he was.

622
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,900
Why do you recognize him?

623
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,700
Lin.

624
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,980
Have you found out

625
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,860
who is behind Feng Yun Headquarters?

626
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,980
Well, it's being investigated.

627
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,380
I'm angry.

628
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,180
Jia Beibei and Wang Yishan

629
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,340
are all perverts.

630
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,780
The old Sha of Feng Yun Headquarters

631
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,980
has disappeared.

632
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,580
I don't care if he's dead or alive.

633
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,300
Hey.

634
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,460
Ping.

635
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,460
Apologize to you.

636
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,140
I've been eating,

637
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,740
drinking and talking to you.

638
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,820
I'm not polite to you.

639
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,740
They also found me a few days ago.

640
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,140
They suspected that I framed you

641
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,900
for blackmailing money.

642
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,140
I thought you said something

643
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,980
and got angry.

644
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,100
You didn't look good.

645
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,780
Then I calmed down and thought about it.

646
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,420
You didn't suspect me for a second.

647
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,940
Are there any conflicts

648
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,820
between you and another candidate, Zhao Honggang?

649
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,740
It can't be Zhao Honggang.

650
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,380
He's not that kind of person.

651
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,340
He's my enemy.

652
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,500
How to say?

653
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,860
You know I'm from the army.

654
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,900
I've never been to the police station.

655
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,340
I learned to solve cases in the grassroots.

656
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,220
I used stupid skills.

657
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,500
I'm just so much.

658
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,220
You're a talented officer in the police station.

659
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,380
You have a good eye for cases.

660
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,060
You have a good understanding of culture and theory.

661
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,100
You can also be a good fighter.

662
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,780
In terms of business ability,

663
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,220
I admire you with all my heart.

664
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,180
It's been more than two years since we came back.

665
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,620
We've been going back and forth.

666
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,540
This is my fault.

667
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,980
I always feel that you're a little arrogant.

668
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,020
I'm afraid you don't like me.

669
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,540
Arrogant?

670
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,140
I'm not arrogant. I'm just...

671
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,100
You're just like this.

672
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
The police station has told me

673
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,580
that you're the same with everyone.

674
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,740
You don't like to say it on the surface.

675
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,260
You're hiding your skills.

676
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,540
I really don't know

677
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,100
how to deal with people like you.

678
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,220
How about

679
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
we have a drink some other day?

680
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,300
Can we drink?

681
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,820
I don't drink much.

682
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,260
It's okay.

683
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,060
That's what I mean.

684
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,100
Don't be polite to me in the future.

685
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,100
I'm a man of my word.

686
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,100
If you have something to say, just tell me.

687
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,820
We're all a special case team.

688
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,580
The child is a fight and a fart.

689
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,380
The parents don't have to care too much.

690
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,100
In the end, we're both factory workers.

691
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,420
One is an outsider and the other is an insider.

692
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,060
Okay.

693
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,420
I'm done talking.

694
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,340
Give me an attitude.

695
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,900
Okay.

696
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,700
Okay.

697
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,260
I'll ask you.

698
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,540
What do you think about

699
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,180
Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei's loan?

700
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,860
I just think

701
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,980
that the amount of money they borrow

702
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,620
is not low.

703
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,380
If it's for the sake of spending,

704
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
they won't borrow so much at once.

705
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,540
So I think

706
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,100
we should check

707
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,820
what they borrow

708
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,300
for.

709
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,420
These kids,

710
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,620
there are eight of them.

711
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,100
They borrow to buy a phone.

712
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,140
Not necessarily.

713
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,420
They can't use so much to buy a phone.

714
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,820
They borrow

715
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,300
for a clear purpose.

716
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,260
What else can they do?

717
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,220
To gamble?

718
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,100
To poison?

719
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,500
Or to buy shoes?

720
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,460
If all those rumors are true,

721
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,260
Zhang Haoyang is really like

722
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,500
a pervert murderer.

723
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,500
He looks soft and harmless,

724
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,100
but he's actually dark inside.

725
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,220
This can explain

726
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,500
why Shen Xiaozhou's death

727
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,700
is different from others.

728
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,940
He knows Shen Xiaozhou.

729
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,180
So

730
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,220
he treats her differently.

731
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,500
You don't suspect me again, do you?

732
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,380
I didn't expose him.

733
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
I didn't violate the law.

734
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,740
I never thought it was you.

735
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,660
Then...

736
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,820
What's your attitude?

737
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,220
You're almost frozen.

738
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,100
I'm a little tired.

739
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,420
I haven't slept for days.

740
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,660
Then you sleep for a while.

741
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,700
Why is the Fuyun Headquarters

742
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,740
in Ju Mingqu?

743
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,740
A遊戲公司啊 A Mlaughs Company.

744
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:49,940
Some people

745
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,820
are quite lively.

746
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,660
Let's have a deal.

747
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,660
jours et°ang��릴게요 thoughtful.

748
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Who is it?

749
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,260
You close your eyes and ears with your eyes closed

750
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Smiling, you change your clothes

751
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,260
All the darkness is looking at you

752
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:10,260
Looking at the light that scatters

753
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Looking at the truth that makes the world strange

754
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Truth

755
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:27,260
How many stars twinkle in the night sky

756
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Looking for hope in despair

757
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,260
Some stars are moving in the wind

758
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,260
In the silence, hiding their pain

759
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm crawling on the dark

760
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,260
I'm crawling on the dark

761
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,260
I'm crawling on the dark

762
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,260
I'm crawling on the dark

763
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,260
I see the soul standing by the night

764
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,260
Struggling to eat the sun

765
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:29,260
All the darkness is looking at the truth

766
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,260
How many stars twinkle in the night sky

767
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Looking for hope in despair

768
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Some stars are moving in the wind

769
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,260
In the silence, hiding their pain

770
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,260
I'm crawling on the dark

771
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:06,260
I'm crawling on the dark

772
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:13,260
I'm crawling on the dark

773
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I'm crawling on the dark
