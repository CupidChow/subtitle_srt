00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Lin Mo.

100
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,580
I want to ask you a question.

101
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,480
Can I ask a more embarrassing factory?

102
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,480
minor ski

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
I'll answer you

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
Is Yang Tao your son?

105
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
My son

106
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,440
Yang Tao's father is Yang Baoge

107
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
How did it come to me?

108
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,960
Because Ding Shulan

109
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
impossible

110
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,480
How could Yang Tao be my son?

111
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,480
You think about it again

112
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
Is there such a possibility

113
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
impossible

114
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,200
When Yang Tao was born, I was married

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I have already separated from Ding Shulan

116
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
I forgot

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,040
You are so careless

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Why are you asking this?

119
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,000
Because someone has reflected some new situations

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
We must be timely

121
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,960
You just

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Why are you asking Yang Baoge?

123
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
You doubt him

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
You mean it might be Yang Baoge

125
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
It's him

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I mean

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,320
I hurt Xiaozhou

128
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,000
Brother Shen, we just ask

129
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
Don't think too much

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
Besides, if Yang Tao is not your son

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Isn't there any possibility?

132
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Come and drink a glass of water

133
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,880
Contact Ding Shulan

134
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm sorry

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,000
Or you avoid it

136
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
Hello, Sister Ding

137
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Shen Xiaozhou's case

138
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,320
There are some new situations that need to be understood

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
There is a question that is not easy to ask

140
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
but

141
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Sister Ding

142
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Yang Tao

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
Is Shen Huazhang's son?

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,160
How can you ask such a question?

145
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm sorry

146
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,920
Please tell the truth

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
No

148
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,640
No

149
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
No

150
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
If you don't believe it, you can write it down

151
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,600
Yang Baoge

152
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,160
Is your temper very angry?

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,840
Did he ever do violence to you?

154
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
what

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
Is he usually

156
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,720
Have you ever hit you?

157
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
No

158
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
He doesn't hit his wife

159
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
But he hit his son

160
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,160
Did Yang Tao get hit?

161
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
No

162
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,440
Why are you asking this?

163
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,760
Who do you doubt

164
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,280
Sister Ding

165
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,280
We are just asking

166
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,360
Don't think too much

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
This case

168
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
It's related

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Have to check

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,160
These questions

171
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
To Yang Baoge

172
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Yang Tao

173
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Keep it secret

174
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Ok?

175
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Liu Yiba

176
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Who is this?

177
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,720
Why are you following us?

178
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,640
Are you

179
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,120
Just investigating my dad

180
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Correct

181
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,560
You suspect my dad killed Xiaozhou

182
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,400
What's your situation

183
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,720
Can you provide

184
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
No

185
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,360
The night when Shen Xiaozhou was in trouble

186
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,000
What is Yang Baoge doing?

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,480
What is Shen Xiaozhou doing?

188
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,880
What is Shen Xiaozhou doing?

189
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,840
What is Yang Baoge doing?

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Drunk

191
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Goodbye

192
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,960
Bring people every day

193
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,760
Can't hold it for a day

194
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Not going home

195
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Where are you going?

196
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Followed the police

197
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520

198
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,720
You have more

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
You were so sharp

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Teach me

201
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
You try

202
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,680
Ok

203
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,520
takes

204
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,360
You are so good

205
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,520
This year's También

206
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
This should be the industry of Jin Hai Group.

207
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
It hasn't been officially opened.

208
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
It's really convenient.

209
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
No one is here.

210
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Go and have a look.

211
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Jin Hai Group

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Where are you going?

213
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
So itchy.

214
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
You're so weird.

215
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Help!

216
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Help!

217
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Help me!

218
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Big sister.

219
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
Help!

220
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Ah!

221
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Officer Shi.

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
You're living next door?

223
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm arguing with you.

224
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Is he going to hurt you?

225
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Who are you?

226
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Who is he?

227
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
You don't know my family name.

228
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Shut up.

229
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Sorry, Officer Shi.

230
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
For now,

231
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
stop playing.

232
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
If you can find them this time,

233
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
I'll tell you in time.

234
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Next time, it's not necessarily.

235
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Go and see Mr.

236
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
He wants to talk to you.

237
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
No.

238
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
I have nothing to say to him.

239
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
What do you want to say?

240
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Mr. said,

241
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
he hopes you can go abroad

242
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,880
to have fun, hunt, and be free.

243
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
And he can see your mother.

244
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
You're crazy.

245
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
You dare to say anything?

246
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Why are you staring at me?

247
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Go back and tell Old Man

248
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
to let him know.

249
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
He'll be happy.

250
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
What's wrong with you?

251
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
You're crazy.

252
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
You're crazy.

253
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
You're crazy.

254
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
You're crazy.

255
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
You're crazy.

256
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
You're crazy.

257
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Tell Old Man

258
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
to mind my business less.

259
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
If you dare to

260
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
talk to me,

261
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
don't talk back.

262
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Do you understand?

263
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Go back and tell him.

264
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Yang Tao...

265
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Yang Tao is not...

266
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
But I'm time...

267
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
No.

268
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Yang Tao is back.

269
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Hai.

270
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
I'll go back.

271
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Why are you back?

272
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm here to see you.

273
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Why are you back?

274
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm here to see you.

275
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
I'm here to see you.

276
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm here to see you.

277
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm here to see you.

278
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
I'm here to see you.

279
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
I'm here to see you.

280
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm here to see you.

281
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm here to see you.

282
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
I'm here to see you.

283
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm here to see you.

284
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
I'm here to see you.

285
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
I'm here to see you.

286
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
I'm here to see you.

287
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I'm here to see you.

288
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
I'm here to see you.

289
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm here to see you.

290
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
I'm here to see you.

291
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm here to see you.

292
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
I'm here to see you.

293
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm here to see you.

294
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
I've been thinking

295
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,480
I've talked about many things.

296
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,200
Can you listen to me?

297
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,760
There's nothing between me and Ding Shu Lan.

298
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,520
Don't misunderstand.

299
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,520
Why did you marry me?

300
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,360
Is it because you pity me?

301
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,600
No.

302
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,480
You're kind.

303
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,080
It's because I have a problem in my heart.

304
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,640
When I was a child,

305
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,640
I was like that.

306
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,640
I felt sorry for you.

307
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,120
Then I had Xiao Zhou.

308
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,160
She was so beautiful,

309
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,160
sensible,

310
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,960
and good at studying.

311
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,800
Everyone was crazy about her.

312
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,080
When I was with her,

313
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,480
I didn't know her.

314
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,680
I didn't believe that we were mother and daughter.

315
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,360
She was like you.

316
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
She was also good to you.

317
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,840
It seemed that you two were a family.

318
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,240
I'm an outsider.

319
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,040
You're not an outsider.

320
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,520
Sit back down.

321
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,480
Later, I found out

323
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
that she told me

324
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,760
what she was worried about.

325
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,560
I didn't know what to do.

326
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
I had to let her make her own decision.

327
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,480
She said it's okay.

328
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
She just wanted to tell me.

329
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
What are you cooking?

330
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Fried egg and tomatoes.

331
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,720
And a eggplant.

332
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,280
Green pepper and eggplant.

333
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
Your hair is messy.

334
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,040
Let me help you.

335
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,000
Don't move.

336
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,480
Okay.

337
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,600
Let me wash the eggplant for you.

338
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,400
This one too.

339
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,480
No need.

340
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
Do you remember

342
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,000
when Xiaozhou was a kid,

343
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
when she was in primary school,

344
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,280
our whole family went to take pictures.

345
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,280
You wanted to take a solo picture with Xiaozhou.

346
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,200
But Xiaozhou

347
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,960
didn't want to say anything.

348
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,280
Every picture

349
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
was taken by all four of us.

350
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
Sometimes I wonder

351
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,920
if Xiaozhou also pitied me

352
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,880
and Xiao Hai.

353
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
What she did

354
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
was

355
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
to keep our family together.

356
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,400
Now Xiaozhou is gone.

357
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,760
Our family

358
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
is gone too.

359
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,800
Qiu Hong.

360
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,320
I've been thinking a lot

361
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,440
these days.

362
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm not content with myself.

363
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
In this world,

364
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,560
no one

365
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
gives me more than you do.

366
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,320
But I give you

367
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,280
a little pity.

368
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm a heartless person.

369
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,800
I've never been out of power.

370
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,240
You've been

371
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,720
taking care of everything in this family.

372
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,000
But I don't know how to thank you.

373
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,280
After you left, I realized

374
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,760
that the family's life was gone too.

375
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,560
Now that you're back,

376
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
I feel

377
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,560
relieved

378
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,880
and at ease.

379
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,200
You can

380
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,760
go.

381
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,680
When Xiaozhou was alive,

382
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,440
I felt

383
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,920
I could see my shadow

384
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,920
from her.

385
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,320
He was excited

386
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,760
just like the sun

387
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,040
and covered my eyes.

388
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,520
Except him,

389
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
I can't see anything.

390
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,280
Now I can see

391
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
I lost my family

392
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,280
because of you.

393
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,360
I regret that

394
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
I gave you so little in this life.

395
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,920
If you can give me a chance

396
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
in the future,

397
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,040
I want to live.

398
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
Xiaozhou is gone.

399
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,680
We have lost half our lives.

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
We won't be like before.

401
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,760
We can save the rest of our lives

402
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
and live for our children.

403
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,320
I'm afraid that

404
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
no one will serve me

405
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,680
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

406
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You don't have to pity me.

407
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,480
If you still want to go,

408
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,480
I'll help you persuade the child.

409
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,760
I'm afraid that

410
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
no one will serve me

411
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,040
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

412
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm afraid that

413
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
no one will serve me

414
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

415
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm afraid that

416
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
no one will serve me

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,080
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

418
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,480
I'm afraid that

419
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
no one will serve me

420
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

421
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm afraid that

422
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,280
no one will serve me

423
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

424
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm afraid that

425
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,400
no one will serve me

426
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

427
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
I'm afraid that

428
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
no one will serve me

429
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,320
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

430
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,480
I'm afraid that

431
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,800
no one will serve me

432
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
and pretend to be poor in front of you.

433
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,280
I'm afraid that

434
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,440
none of them will be myself.

435
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,560
She heard the sound.

436
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
Perhaps she already felt

437
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,040
a smilegentle sending away.

438
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,960
What's God's first move?

439
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,540
You used to like belle,

440
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,380
you liked wet beauty with another lady

441
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,140
before your first love worth a veggie?

442
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,820
This isotchnud 얼마.

443
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,940
When did you two meet?

444
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,600
We met a few days ago.

445
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,020
I just saw the math.

446
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,420
You asked yourself,

447
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,680
why am I dating a uneducated man

448
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,300
instead of Ver butcher?

449
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,340
liters of luxury for mixed直?

450
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,060
Just what you said.

451
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
to be a good husband.

452
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,180
But I found that

453
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,020
he is not a married man.

454
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,980
He doesn't know how to live.

455
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,540
In 1991,

456
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,140
Shen Huazhang was sick

457
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,420
at his hometown.

458
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
He didn't attend

459
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,620
the workplace party.

460
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,060
That year,

461
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,460
we heard for the first time

462
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,500
that he was no longer

463
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,100
a rice cooker.

464
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,820
Now,

465
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,980
with the rapid development

466
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,860
of our economy,

467
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,140
the technical level of

468
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,380
the workers' unit is getting higher.

469
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,100
Judging from the employment situation,

470
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,700
only after training

471
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,700
and mastering a practical skill,

472
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,820
you can find a job anywhere.

473
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,260
How many years of work?

474
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,340
I said I would quit my job.

475
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,420
I'm afraid of quitting.

476
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,780
I don't know anything.

477
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,900
Later,

478
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,100
I often

479
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,300
-dressed up as the factory manager

480
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,140
at the workplace party.

481
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,940
I didn't think

482
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,860
anything would happen.

483
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:17,380
She was

484
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,820
Delta Vivien,

485
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,380
I'm not going to work.

486
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,260
I promise I won't quit.

487
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,300
And he introduced me

488
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,460
to the director of the car repair shop, Yang Bao Ge.

489
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,740
Yang Bao Ge was also the director of the car repair shop?

490
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,060
Yes.

491
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,580
Later, he was fired because he fought with a businessman.

492
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,180
He was transferred to the water station.

493
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,140
He knew the child wasn't his.

494
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,300
He always thought the child was Shen Hua Zhang.

495
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,140
Once he was drunk and asked me

496
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,820
to swear that I was not,

497
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,740
I was telling the truth.

498
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,220
June 19th was

499
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,740
Shen Xiao Zhu's night of crime.

500
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,860
Was Yang Bao Ge home?

501
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,700
He went drinking that day.

502
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,260
He came back in the late afternoon.

503
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,900
What was Shen Xiao Zhu doing

504
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,780
that night?

505
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,820
He was drunk.

506
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,540
He was at home.

507
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,140
But Yang Tao said

508
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,940
Yang Tao and Yang Bao Ge

509
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,860
were father and son.

510
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,860
So what?

511
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,380
They were childhood friends.

512
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,580
It's strange.

513
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,900
This morning, Yang Tao

514
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,340
transferred Yang Bao Ge to the foreign country.

515
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,420
This never happened before.

516
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,180
Check if Yang Tao is home.

517
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,460
Check where Yang Tao is.

518
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,460
Okay.

519
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,140
He's in the gym.

520
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,500
Give it to Sui Xiao.

521
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,620
You drink it.

522
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,660
Why is there no pearl

523
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,260
in the milk tea?

524
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,260
Sui Xiao doesn't like milk tea.

525
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,980
It's a cup of milk tea

526
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,420
that has no soul.

527
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,900
You're sure?

528
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,700
Did Li Da Da

529
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,900
trick you?

530
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,100
He must know we're watching him.

531
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,940
I don't think we need to.

532
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,900
He's deliberately

533
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,060
trying to make us give up

534
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,260
our surveillance on him.

535
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,740
He's already hit the top.

536
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,220
He won't do anything.

537
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,020
Where will Yang Tao go?

538
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,220
Somewhere related to Shen Xiao Zhu.

539
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,300
Is Yang Tao Yang Bao Ge's son?

540
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:17,980
No.

541
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,900
Does Yang Tao know?

542
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,300
He's not Yang Tao's son.

543
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,140
Does he know?

544
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,260
No.

545
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,420
It's better if he doesn't know.

546
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,220
You're here.

547
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,620
You're leaving?

548
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,220
It's too obvious.

549
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,060
Why did you pull me here?

550
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,060
Wait.

551
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,340
What are you doing?

552
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,420
What are you doing?

553
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,860
It's a big factory.

554
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,780
How can we find it?

555
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,900
Zheng.

556
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,740
You go to the living room.

557
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,620
We'll go to the industrial area.

558
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,780
Okay.

559
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
East District,

560
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,580
Factory 9.

561
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,460
Where is it?

562
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,900
It's too big. I'm turning the camera.

563
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,020
Did you do it?

564
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,500
Did you do it?

565
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,700
Stop yelling.

566
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,100
Say it.

567
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,460
Tell me.

568
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,060
Did you do it?

569
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
Did you kill

570
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,220
Shen Xiao Zhu?

571
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,220
Yang Tao.

572
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,980
Leave me alone.

573
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,980
I'm about to ask.

574
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,220
Tell me.

575
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,820
Say it.

576
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,820
Did you kill her?

577
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,820
Did you kill her?

578
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
Did you kill her?

579
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
Did you kill her?

580
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,500
Leave it to me.

581
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,260
Say it.

582
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,300
Leave it to me.

583
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,140
I'll ask.

584
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,220
She won't tell you.

585
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,540
She's annoying the police.

586
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,940
We can always

587
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,340
ask her if she's annoying.

588
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,460
Put down your hand.

589
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,740
I didn't do it.

590
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,180
She fell down after she drank too much.

591
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,420
Be quiet.

592
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,180
You're a cop.

593
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,940
You're stupid.

594
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,660
Stupid.

595
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,660
Say it.

596
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,900
Because you're smart.

597
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,340
Iел said

598
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,660
all the scх買

599
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,980
lives well to the people.

600
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,740
My conditions

601
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
are this.

602
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:46,220
My lighting

603
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,900

607
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,960
Can we let go?

608
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I know who you are.

609
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,320
You're dangerous and I make trouble with you.

611
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,400
Don't let the undocumented seafood walk by

612
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,240
and set you free.

613
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,620
Sit.

614
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,540
Thank you.

615
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,520
Find a agent.

616
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,560
Why should they shut...

617
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,820
...their house?

618
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Thank you.

619
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,100
You're used to using your left hand.

620
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,220
My left hand isn't the left side.

621
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,380
My right hand is injured.

622
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
I don't have the strength.

623
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,580
Use your right hand.

624
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,580
Use strength to shake it.

625
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
What are you doing?

626
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,580
To check the wound.

627
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,140
Yang Tao didn't hit me.

628
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,340
I accidentally hit myself.

629
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,020
Don't make things difficult for him.

630
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,420
You hit the cement brick, right?

631
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

632
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,900
Don't play with me.

633
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,380
I'll tell you everything.

634
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,820
The night when Shen Xiaozhou was killed,

635
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,620
I drank too much and broke my leg.

636
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,300
The next day, I was lying in the bathroom.

637
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,820
When I woke up, I was covered in soil.

638
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,140
I didn't know what I was doing.

639
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,620
Did I kill anyone?

640
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,620
If you think that I killed Shen Xiaozhou,

641
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,620
I'll kill Shen Xiaozhou.

642
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,780
I'll give him a life.

643
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,060
I'll do whatever I can.

644
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,260
I'll just force him to do it.

645
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,700
Drink the tea.

646
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,020
You're injured.

647
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,740
It didn't take long to hit your son.

648
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,980
Your father's right hand was injured?

649
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,180
Yes.

650
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,180
I had a machine press it.

651
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,100
It looked fine.

652
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,700
But I broke a few bones.

653
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,620
I can't hold it.

654
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,500
It was easy for me to grab his bottle.

655
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,020
It's easy to grab a bottle from a wine bottle.

656
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,900
You can grab it to this extent?

657
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,220
If it wasn't for pretending,

658
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,340
it wouldn't be him.

659
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,060
The bruises on Shen Xiaozhou's neck

660
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,260
were caused by both hands.

661
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,380
They kept pressing hard.

662
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,300
And the bruise on the right hand was more obvious.

663
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,820
This force is not suitable.

664
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,200
Minx Understands

665
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,300
President Lin,

666
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,140
have you brought the battalion message somewhere?

667
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,940
I'll offer you a commission.

668
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,660
OK, timbin.

669
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,020
Sure, we will do as you tell.

670
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,540
Thanks.

671
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,820
Captain Ren,

672
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,540
It seems that he doesn't seem to be upset.

673
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,540
He's always smiling when he sees someone.

674
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,740
He actually cries too.

675
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,020
It's strange.

676
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,060
He's always treated me like a brother.

677
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,940
He'd tell me if he felt wronged.

678
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,140
It seems that I can help him.

679
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,740
What did he tell you?

680
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,740
Nothing specific.

681
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,940
Just a month or two ago,

682
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
I went to his school to find him.

683
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,140
I was about to set up a business.

684
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,940
He wasn't at school.

685
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,540
He went out to work again.

686
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,340
He was at some factory

687
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,940
playing pipa for people.

688
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,740
He must have been wronged that day.

689
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,940
He didn't do anything.

690
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,740
He told me to burn the pipa.

691
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,340
How are you today?

692
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,940
I'm pretty good.

693
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,540
He cried that day.

694
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,340
He cried for a long time.

695
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Do you think he might have met

696
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,740
some bad guys?

697
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,140
We already know

698
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,340
about these things.

699
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,340
Captain Lian,

700
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,540
the three people we sent out are back.

701
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,340
The witness that Ao Xiaojie told us

702
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,140
only found a girl in the Northeast.

703
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,340
She was found at the mental health center.

704
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,140
What center?

705
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,940
It's the mental hospital.

706
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,140
But this person looks normal.

707
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
Where is he?

708
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,740
He was supposed to be taken to the interrogation.

709
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,540
But he can't stay in a room without windows.

710
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,940
He can't even stay for a minute.

711
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,140
He's just staying in the second floor

712
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,940
with his girlfriend.

713
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,940
Is this the person

714
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,740
who took you to the party?

715
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,940
Yes.

716
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,540
Hao Ge.

717
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,940
But it wasn't a party.

718
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,340
It was just...

719
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,940
just one person.

720
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,340
Was it him?

721
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,140
Yes.

722
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,940
What did he do to you?

723
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,340
Don't be afraid.

724
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,940
Take your time.

725
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,140
No one will hurt you again.

726
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,740
He...

727
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,140
He made me take off my clothes

728
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,340
and stand on the table.

729
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,940
Then,

730
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,140
he tied my hands up

731
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,940
with a rope.

732
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,340
Then,

733
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,540
he hung me up.

734
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,340
You can say that you want to die.

735
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,940
But I can't.

736
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,540
I fell.

737
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,340
Can you tell me more?

738
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,540
My neck.

739
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,340
He tied my neck.

740
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,940
I couldn't breathe

741
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,940
for several times.

742
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
I almost died.

743
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,540
After he tied the rope,

744
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,340
I fell.

745
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,740
Then, he began to change high heels for me.

746
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
He changed several pairs.

747
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,340
He said

748
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,340
that they were imported goods from abroad.

749
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,340
I've never even seen them before.

750
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,340
Foreign goods.

751
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,340
Foreign goods are rare.

752
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
He touched my feet.

753
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,340
And his tongue.

754
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,340
I felt so bad.

755
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,340
I couldn't breathe.

756
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,340
I felt like I was dying.

757
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Then,

758
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
I didn't know anything.

759
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
What happened after you woke up?

760
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
After I woke up,

761
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,340
I was in a car.

762
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,340
He told me

763
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,340
that as long as I dared to speak out,

764
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,340
he would kill my family.

765
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,340
He knew where my hometown was.

766
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,340
He knew what my hometown's door number was.

767
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,340
He gave me money.

768
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
He bought me a plane ticket

769
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
and let me go back to my hometown.

770
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
But...

771
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,340
But I was so scared.

772
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,340
I didn't dare to go out.

773
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,340
I had nightmares every night.

774
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,340
I didn't know what to do.

775
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Will you protect me?

776
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,340
Li Dada is the murderer who killed Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei.

777
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
Is this conclusion okay?

778
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,340
Shen Xiaozhou was also suspected of murder.

779
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
Okay.

780
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
Next, we need to determine

781
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,340
whether we should arrest him or not.

782
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,340
I think

783
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,340
we can arrest him.

784
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,340
But what will we do after we arrest him?

785
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,340
We only have the witness.

786
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,340
The most obvious is to frame him for illegal detention

787
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
and deliberately hurt him.

788
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,340
But we can find direct evidence

789
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,340
that he is connected with three dead people.

790
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,340
Is there any?

791
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,340
Even if we search Li Dada's residence,

792
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,340
are we sure we can find evidence?

793
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,340
How is Li Dada's psychological quality?

794
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,340
Can the trial be broken?

795
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,340
You mean we can't arrest him now.

796
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,340
How do we fight next?

797
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,340
Does his father know about Li Dada's actions?

798
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
Before we get the evidence,

799
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,340
let's pretend he doesn't know.

800
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:55,340
We need to find evidence from Li Dada.

801
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,340
But he is too vigilant now.

802
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
He won't commit another crime.

803
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,340
How do we find it?

804
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,340
Not necessarily.

805
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
What's not necessarily?

806
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,340
Go on.

807
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,340
I mean

808
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,340
Li Dada's personality

809
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,340
doesn't necessarily

810
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,340
prevent him from committing another crime.

811
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,340
I think he is

812
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,340
very arrogant

813
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,340
and even arrogant.

814
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,340
That's right.

815
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,340
He is very arrogant.

816
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,340
Let's take the Liangqin命 case.

817
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,340
The house is not far from the residential area.

818
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,340
We will soon find it.

819
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,340
He probably thinks

820
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
if we can't find it,

821
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,340
the police won't be his opponent.

822
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,340
The traffic controller was caught.

823
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
That's what he gave me.

824
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
No.

825
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,340
I'm just a bandit.

826
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,340
So if the conditions are allowed,

827
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,340
he will definitely

828
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,340
commit another crime.

829
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Director Qiu said this was a dangerous action.

830
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
The foreign student is not suitable.

831
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,340
So he decided to draw people from the special police team.

832
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,340
It's none of my business.

833
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,340
How dare you say that?

834
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,340
This decision has nothing to do with you.

835
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
What can I say about the decision of the leader?

836
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,340
You didn't say a word.

837
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,340
I...

838
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Think about it.

839
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,340
Don't lose my trust in you.

840
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
I...

841
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
Shhh.

842
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,340
I don't know what you said to the company.

843
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,340
I said you have a bad foot.

844
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,340
What's wrong?

845
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,340
Shi Qiangfeng said I have a bad foot.

846
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,340
This?

847
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,340
You still have a bad foot?

848
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,340
Sui Xiao.

849
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,340
It's not a bad foot.

850
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
It's too dangerous.

851
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,340
Am I afraid of danger?

852
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,340
If it's out there, people will say that there's no one in our team.

853
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,340
They will laugh at us.

854
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,340
I think...

855
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,340
Sui Xiao is capable.

856
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,340
And his appearance is a common point of two victims.

857
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,340
Then it's settled.

858
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,340
I'll go find the data.

859
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,340
If you want to wait for Li Dada to make another case,

860
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,340
you have to let him relax first.

861
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,340
We will pass through the unofficial channel

862
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,340
and send out the message.

863
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,340
Saying that Hao Xiaojie has confessed.

864
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:47,340
All the investigation actions against Li Dada have been withdrawn.

865
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:53,340
Then we will give him a perfect target.

866
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,340
According to the situation we have,

867
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:05,340
Li Dada is capable of getting the target's personal information and family background.

868
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:12,340
So we have to create a complete personal background for Sui Xiao.

869
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:18,340
These information must be included in the system to ensure that it can be checked.

870
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,340
His recent experience is that he left home a few months ago

871
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:31,340
and came to Linchuan with his family.

872
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,340
He is currently unemployed.

873
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,340
In addition,

874
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,340
more importantly, his network information.

875
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,340
The personal profile of social network.

876
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:49,340
These days, at least half a year of personal profile.

877
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:55,340
The most important thing about social network is photos.

878
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,340
Selfies and letters.

879
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,340
The real thing.

880
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,340
Part of the photos are taken.

881
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,340
Part of the photos are taken.

882
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,340
Thank you all.

883
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,340
At least 300 photos.

884
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,340
Different seasons, different hairstyles, different costumes.

885
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,340
In addition, the makeup must also change.

886
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,340
Pay attention to the light.

887
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,340
The background of the photo you chose must be consistent.

888
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,340
It must be perfect.

889
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,340
No problem.

890
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,340
You saw a lot of online photos online.

891
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,340
It's actually a P.

892
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,340
Everyone is responsible for the content of the personal profile.

893
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,340
Write it yourself.

894
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Transmit hot iron.

895
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,340
All right.

896
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:48,340
This text should look material.

897
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,340
虛榮的

898
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,340
庸俗的

899
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,340
人云亦云的

900
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,340
都可以

901
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,340
符合人物性格就行

902
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,340
This Li Shiya

903
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,340
English name Lisa

904
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,340
Is an easy-going girl.

905
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:17,340
Finally, the most important thing is to keep it secret.

906
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,340
Don't leak any information to others.

907
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,340
Because this concerns the safety of our female police.

908
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,340
Old Li, if it's the time of the war, you can do the money service.

909
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,340
Let's work.

910
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,340
This is a small one.

911
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
Why can't I do it?

912
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,340
This is good.

913
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,340
Captain, I'll write it.

914
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,340
Let's write it.

915
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
Captain, I'll write it.

916
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,340
Thank you.

917
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,340
The moon is in the sky

918
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,340
The moon is in the sky

919
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,340

00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,340
The moon is in the sky

The moon is in the sky

The moon is in the sky

928
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,340
The moon is in the sky

929
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,340
The moon is in the sky

930
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,340
The moon is in the sky

931
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,340
The moon is in the sky

932
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,340
The moon is in the sky

The moon is in the sky

00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,340
The moon is in the sky

00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,340
The moon is in the sky

00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,340
The moon is in the sky

The moon is in the sky

958
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,340
The moon is in the sky

959
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,340
Entrench

960
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:18,640
Wind

961
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,180
In my memory

962
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,420
Is you

963
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,440
Lying close to the moon

964
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,740
Yes

965
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,840
The whole story

966
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,060
Twins

967
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,700
New to this

968
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,700
wasn't it

969
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,120
You can wake up

970
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,360
The sparkling river

971
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,040
Is still never

972
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,040
Can blow away the misty fog

973
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,040
Is there a moonlight

974
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,040
Can burn the lies from the past

975
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,040
If I can see clearly in the darkness

976
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:02,040
The fate is far away

977
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,040
If I can hear the heartbeat

978
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,040
The heartbeats are silent, the eyes are closed

979
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,040
I want to be the light

980
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:20,040
The light comes from the abyss

981
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,040
I know I'm not lucky

982
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:29,040
But I'm always in the front

983
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,040
The light comes from the abyss
