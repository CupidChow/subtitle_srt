00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,080
Take your arms away.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,720
There's such a��의

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,360
in Huiniang.

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
Really?

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,240
God sunlight as the hair?

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,600

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,940
I'm waiting for you.

13
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
I guess they're coming.

14
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,220
Can you shoot?

15
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,020
Yes.

16
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,860
But we can't spread it.

17
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,220
Let me introduce myself first.

18
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,140
I'm Yao Guangbo.

19
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm the founder of Feng Yun.

20
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,260
I was a reporter in the Times.

21
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,980
I started my own business four years ago.

22
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,420
I entered the self-media industry

23
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,940
and established this company.

24
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,180
Mr. Yao, the number of comments is 16,100.

25
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,580
The forwarding amount is 21,900.

26
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,540
45,000 likes.

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,180
Sirs,

28
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,500
what's the instruction

29
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,540
for the Liling B company today?

30
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,380
Let's

31
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,020
first

32
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,420
delete

33
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,260
the article about the death of a female college student.

34
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,740
Because the case is still in the process of investigation,

35
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,820
the information you published will interfere with the case.

36
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,180
Second,

37
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,780
please explain.

38
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,780
Is there a

39
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,420
fact-based basis for the content of the article?

40
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,620
If so,

41
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,420
where does the source of the information come from?

42
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,860
Is this an order?

43
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,940
It's not

44
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,540
an order.

45
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,260
This is a major criminal case.

46
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,180
You have the obligation

47
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,300
to cooperate with our investigation program.

48
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,860
Obligation?

49
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,860
What about my rights?

50
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,780
The right to know the people,

51
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,540
the right to supervise public opinion?

52
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,340
The case is still in the process of investigation.

53
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,380
Once the investigation is completed,

54
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,980
all the rights you mentioned are here.

55
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,540
They can be used to

56
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,500
implement the case.

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,020
No.

58
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,020
The investigation process needs to be supervised.

59
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,860
The people need to know the people.

60
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Otherwise, how to investigate the case?

61
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Just listen to you?

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,740
Nonsense.

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,460
I don't listen to the industry.

64
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,620
Will you take over the account

65
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,460
and use your power?

66
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,020
For example, let me delete the article.

67
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,900
Is this request reasonable?

68
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,460
This request is reasonable.

69
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,260
Even if I agree,

70
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,780
my 3 million fans won't agree.

71
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,980
Don't forget.

72
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,940
The public opinion has been changed.

73
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
Mr. Yao, the number of comments is 16,300.

74
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,180
The transfer amount is 21,900.

75
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,940
Can you

76
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,460
stop bothering us?

77
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,780
You are so rude.

78
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,500
Mr. Yao,

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
the junior class teacher of Zhang Haoyang replied

80
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,620
that he wanted to use the case of Xiao Tao and Hua Shan

81
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,340
to spread rumors.

82
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,780
There is no such thing.

83
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,580
How do you think?

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,100
Who made the class teacher say that?

85
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,980
Will he have any hidden reasons?

86
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,460
You organize the rumors.

87
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,460
It's objective and reasonable.

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,820
It's not objective.

89
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,700
You think I'm not objective enough.

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,420
Please give me the evidence

91
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,980
and complain about me.

92
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
I'll say it again.

93
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,980
The case is still in the process of investigation.

94
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,620
The information that has not been verified

95
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,180
may make the murderer guilty.

96
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:50,980
Sorry.

97
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,300
I don't understand.

98
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,740
I'm helping you.

99
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,180
Okay.

100
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,740
I'll say the second thing first.

101
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Please explain the source of the information.

102
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,500
It's harder than the first point.

103
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,580
I was a reporter.

104
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,580
Protecting the source of the information is the law.

105
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,260
You government official

106
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,440
is arguing about

107
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
the fact that

108
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,620
the attack

109
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,500
fit this DNA.

110
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,020
This is a trap

111
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,460
that is not ready to be ignored.

112
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,300
What's happening?

113
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,100
Xiao Xu Yuan didn't say anything,

114
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,300
but he can change his mind.

115
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,620
Let's try again.

116
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
Although he owes a lot,

117
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,740
what if Zhang Hao Yang is really in trouble?

118
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,220
Let him feel the anger.

119
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,420
If he's scared,

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,220
what will be the flaw?

121
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,020
This is a double-edged sword.

122
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,980
Brother Li.

123
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,620
You're here.

124
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,100
What do you want?

125
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,020
The things you asked for are ready.

126
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,900
They're all on the gift table.

127
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,220
Put them there.

128
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,900
You can take them yourself.

129
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,500
Okay.

130
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,580
Uncle Shen.

131
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,980
Brother Yuan, look at this.

132
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,140
I caught it in the morning.

133
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,580
Really?

134
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,780
Really?

135
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,860
Hurry up.

136
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,740
I'm going to catch it.

137
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,580
Go.

138
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,260
Brother Shen.

139
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,860
The case is broken.

140
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
What?

141
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,500
Someone caught it.

142
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,300
Who?

143
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,420
The online said

144
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,660
it was Zhang's

145
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,740
and Xiao Zhou's boyfriend.

146
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,180
Bullshit.

147
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,020
Who is Xiao Zhou's boyfriend?

148
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,460
You don't know?

149
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,540
It's said he's a rich man.

150
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,660
Rich man?

151
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
No, look.

152
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,820
What are you talking about?

153
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,460
Uncle Shen, don't believe it.

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,060
The online is full of nonsense.

155
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,380
Okay.

156
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,820
Uncle Shen.

157
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,620
Shen Qiang Hong.

158
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,060
Do you know

159
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,460
Xiao Zhou has a boyfriend?

160
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,340
Not a boyfriend.

161
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,940
A man named Zhang.

162
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,740
The online said it.

163
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,380
The neighbor told me.

164
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,100
I...

165
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,060
Xiao Zhou, he...

166
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,020
He mentioned it to me.

167
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,740
He's just an ordinary friend.

168
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,340
But you mentioned it.

169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,100
Why didn't you tell me?

170
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,340
What is it?

171
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,580
Am I dead?

172
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,980
Xiao Zhou.

173
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,060
Why didn't you tell me?

174
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,940
Xiao Zhou.

175
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,340
Xiao Zhou.

176
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Xiao Zhou.

177
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Xiao Zhou.

178
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
Xiao Zhou.

179
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
Xiao Zhou.

180
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Xiao Zhou.

181
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Xiao Zhou.

182
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Xiao Zhou.

183
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
Xiao Zhou.

184
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Xiao Zhou.

185
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Xiao Zhou.

186
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
Xiao Zhou.

187
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
Xiao Zhou.

188
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Xiao Zhou.

189
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,340
Xiao Zhou.

190
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,340
Xiao Zhou.

191
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Xiao Zhou.

192
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
Xiao Zhou.

193
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Xiao Zhou.

194
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,340
Xiao Zhou.

195
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Xiao Zhou.

196
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,340
Xiao Zhou.

197
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Xiao Zhou.

198
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Xiao Zhou.

199
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,340
Xiao Zhou.

200
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Xiao Zhou.

201
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,340
Xiao Zhou.

202
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,340
Xiao Zhou.

203
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
The post was deleted.

204
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
But the informant still

205
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,340
refused to tell us.

206
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,340
And we found a lawyer who said

207
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,340
whether we should hand in the informant

208
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,340
has nothing to do with the case.

209
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
We can't do well

210
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,340
with Tai Chi.

211
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Taiping,

212
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
who is this informant?

213
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
What do you think?

214
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
You mean

215
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
someone is deliberately

216
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,340
disturbing the world

217
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
and leading us to the case?

218
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,340
What do you think?

219
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
I don't know.

220
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Maybe it's the resentment

221
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
of the society

222
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
for Zhang Haoyang.

223
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,340
So many people

224
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,340
don't understand

225
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,340
our case.

226
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,340
I want to know

227
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,340
what Zhang Haoyang

228
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
is hiding.

229
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
He is under great pressure.

230
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
He may look for

231
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
the exit of the dissolution.

232
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,340
His father found this

233
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,340
old bag for him.

234
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
A fire watch.

235
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
He should have been a soldier

236
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
when he was in the army.

237
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,340
Li Duhuo

238
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,340
is our suspect.

239
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:50,340
He is under

240
00:11:50,340 --> 00:12:12,600
Then Jixiu his

241
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Yes.

242
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,000
Really?

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know.

244
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,960
I don't think there's anything to do with it.

245
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,040
But girls don't think so.

246
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,280
Before Wang Yishan was killed, he had double eyelids.

247
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,000
Where did he get it?

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,920
Mei Yixing's beauty hospital.

249
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,840
Jia Beibei also searched Mei Yixing.

250
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,420
Xie스들

251
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,960
I've told my parents. Doesn't matter.

252
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Why do you have to go to the KTV?

253
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I'm going to find out.

254
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,600
Wake up.

255
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,080
The food is almost in your nose.

256
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Wow.

257
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I made it. Try it.

258
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
What? You want to eat meat?

259
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
No, you can't. I'll buy you some.

260
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Someone posted an article online.

261
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
It's about Shen Xiaozhou.

262
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
There are a lot of comments below.

263
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Who? It can't be that Feng Ying headband again, right?

264
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Still dare to post?

265
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
No, it's just an ordinary netizen.

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
He doesn't involve in the case.

267
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
He's discussing the relationship between men and women.

268
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Someone said that

269
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Shen Xiaozhou returned the money to Zhang Haoyang.

270
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
He brought a fake landlady's goods.

271
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
He was playing with the jade and put a big fish on the line.

272
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Shen Xiaozhou has a rich boyfriend.

273
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
He's still here.

274
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
It means that this rich second generation is not rich enough.

275
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
There must be a richer rich man waiting for him.

276
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
This is an ordinary girl.

277
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,600
The girl can realize the fastest way to get a promotion.

278
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Zhang Haoyang is a helicopter.

279
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
He's a helicopter looking for a rocket.

280
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
What's wrong with this person now?

281
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Don't you believe that there is a pure and kind person in this world?

282
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
People must be open-minded.

283
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
There must be a bad thing.

284
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Whoever doesn't believe it, it's just a fake.

285
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
It must be true that the person is evil.

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Is that interesting?

287
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Shen Xiaozhou is not like that.

288
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Shi Xiaofeng,

289
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
you're sometimes quite cute.

290
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
You're still not going to sleep?

291
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I'll sleep later.

292
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Don't wake him up.

293
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm heating up the milk.

294
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Drink it.

295
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Drink it.

296
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I'll lend the incense to Sister Guo.

297
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I'll give it to her.

298
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
I've already taken out the things.

299
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Rest early.

300
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Brother.

301
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
How is it?

302
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
No.

303
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
No?

304
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
No record of Jiang Beibei?

305
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Is it possible that they are embarrassed to use the fake name to prove it?

306
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
This...

307
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
We are a regular medical institution.

308
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
We are not allowed to use the fake name.

309
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
You can help me take a good look.

310
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I'm a writer.

311
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I won't make any mistakes.

312
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I won't make any mistakes.

313
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
For example, Dr. Wang.

314
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I'll remember it when you say it.

315
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Has Dr. Wang ever said why he has a plastic surgery?

316
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
We don't really use the term plastic surgery.

317
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
It can be called medical beauty or beauty.

318
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
To be beautiful is to be beautiful.

319
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Self-improvement is to be realized.

320
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
To make a new life.

321
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Has anyone given a foot surgery?

322
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
No, no.

323
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Give a foot beauty.

324
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I had a big hope.

325
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
If they both came here, they would have to be forced to do it.

326
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
What a good clue.

327
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Now it's a bad clue.

328
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Not necessarily.

329
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Let me tell you.

330
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Dr. Wang and Jiang Beibei at least had plastic surgery.

331
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Or they said they had a plastic surgery plan.

332
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
That's not a bad clue.

333
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Why don't you go?

334
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
He still has to work overtime.

335
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Sleep for a while when you're sleepy.

336
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Sleep for a while when you're sleepy.

337
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Sleep for a while when you're sleepy.

338
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
You'll wake up in a day.

339
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
That ID card is the passcode for me.

340
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Look at this.

341
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Sea Moon Water Mute.

342
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
The frequency of its umbrella opening and closing.

343
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
It's close to the brain waves when people sleep.

344
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
You'll fall asleep while looking at it.

345
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Does it work on you?

346
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I used to swim.

347
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
You can't sleep?

348
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Didn't you say that?

349
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
People who are calm even when they die?

350
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
People who are calm are not always calm.

351
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I want to eat cold sea food.

352
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm getting a little tired.

353
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
When I was swimming in the sea,

354
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I saw it.

355
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Before?

356
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Did your hometown die?

357
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
No.

358
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
The cloud line also depends on the sea.

359
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
When did you leave your hometown?

360
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
I left when I was in police college.

361
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
My parents are gone.

362
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
I rarely go back.

363
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
By the way,

364
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
in 1995,

365
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,600
there was a murder in the cloud line.

366
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
The victim was also a young woman.

367
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Do you know?

368
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
How do you know?

369
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
When I was in police school,

370
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
my teacher told me about this case.

371
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
In 1995,

372
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
you just graduated from college.

373
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Did you take part in this case?

374
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
In 1995,

375
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I can't remember.

376
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,600
That victim is very poor.

377
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I saw the photos on the news.

378
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I found her in a river.

379
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
It looks like

380
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Shen Xiaozhou.

381
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Really?

382
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
That victim,

383
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
she has a child.

384
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Because of this sister.

385
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
represent them.

386
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Her memory has changed.

387
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
You will see her soon.

388
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Feels like

389
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,600
she's in the angles

390
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
of my eyes.

391
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
You can't explain.

392
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,240
They and others are innocent people.

393
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,760
If you don't道歉

394
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Your prison sentence up to 15 years

395
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
What did he think if I jumped?

396
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
It's too much risk.

397
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm late

398
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,160
But let's take this chance

399
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,160
There's a potential

400
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,520
You don't need to forget him

401
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,800
It's up to you

402
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,400
odies

403
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,120
Therefore

404
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,800
I want to raise my city

405
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,800
How much money

406
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
There are people like you

407
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,520
Everybody

408
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,000
You have a roof up

409
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,240
You can't smoke

410
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,200
In 1995,

411
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
the 725 case.

412
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,480
Do you remember?

413
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
You're asking about this?

414
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,360
What's wrong?

415
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,280
I didn't know

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,920
if the victim

417
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,360
had a child at that time.

418
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,640
A child?

419
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,880
It's been too long.

420
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,160
It's been 20 years.

421
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,280
I can't remember it clearly.

422
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,520
Well,

423
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
I'll check it for you

424
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,800
and call you back.

425
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,480
Okay.

426
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,600
Thank you.

427
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,080
The case is over.

428
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,200
I'll go back to the office.

429
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,800
Okay.

430
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,440
Thank you.

431
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,240
Thank you.

432
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
Thank you.

433
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you.

434
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,840
Thank you.

435
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Thank you.

436
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Thank you.

437
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Thank you.

438
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Thank you.

439
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Thank you.

440
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Thank you.

441
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Thank you.

442
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Thank you.

443
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Thank you.

444
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Thank you.

445
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Thank you.

446
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Thank you.

447
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Thank you.

448
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Thank you.

449
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Thank you.

450
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Thank you.

451
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Thank you.

452
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Thank you.

453
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
Thank you.

454
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Thank you.

455
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Thank you.

456
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Thank you.

457
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Thank you.

458
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Thank you.

459
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Are you all right?

460
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm fine.

461
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,440
Wait.

462
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Wait for me.

463
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Wait for me.

464
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
Hello.

465
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
What?

466
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,360
All right.

467
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,080
Fill me up

468
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
You are Xiao Zhou's father?

469
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Are you willing to kill him?

470
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Say it!

471
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
Are you?

472
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Say it!

473
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Are you willing to kill him?

474
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Are you?

475
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Uncle Zhen, go back with me

476
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Uncle Zhen, Uncle Zhen

477
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Let go of me

478
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
I don't think you should do this

479
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,840
This is illegal

480
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
For Xiao Zhou, illegal is illegal

481
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Xiao Zhou won't let you do this

482
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:18,320
Egg

483
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
acks, are you in there?

484
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Help me locate the phone number

485
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
It's here, you wait for a bit

486
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,440
I don't want to be with you, say sorry

487
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
He wants you very badly

488
00:28:46,920 --> 00:29:01,680
Eat

489
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,400
You

490
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,520
you

491
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,780
for you.

492
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,180
The

493
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,740
You can't be

494
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,360
Searching by writing in your heart

495
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,680
For inspection

496
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,440
OK

497
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,100
Well done

498
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,880
If you are not sure

499
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,360
Good news or bad news

500
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,880
Is it good or not

501
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,840
what do you mean

502
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,800
Come on, pull it out.

503
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,480
It's fine.

504
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,240
Shen Xiaozhou has seen this before?

505
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,800
What?

506
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,160
Where did you get it?

507
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,240
The post I told you about.

508
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
Someone sent this picture.

509
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,520
There's something wrong with Zhang Haoyang.

510
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,800
I'll call the team.

511
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
I'll go with you.

512
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,800
Stop it.

513
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,560
It's your fault.

514
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
What do you mean?

515
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,920
You can beat me.

516
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,080
Boss.

517
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,640
He insisted on coming.

518
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,840
He asked the Feng team.

519
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,440
Where's Xiaoqi?

520
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,000
She took a day off to fix her phone.

521
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Her mom called her to arrange a blind date.

522
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,600
But she was in a hurry.

523
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,080
She broke her phone.

524
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,760
What happened?

525
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,320
Zhang Haoyang is inside.

526
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,040
She really has a secret.

527
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,880
I've seen it.

528
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,480
It should be a place

529
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,200
that does illegal gambling.

530
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,840
It looks like an abandoned warehouse.

531
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,320
But there are traces of life around.

532
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,800
A casino?

533
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,720
No.

534
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,320
It should be a place for poisoning or embezzlement.

535
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,720
I thought it was a place

536
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,040
for murder.

537
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,720
Whatever it is,

538
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,160
we'll get rid of it.

539
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,360
If there's no evidence of Zhang Haoyang's murder,

540
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,680
we'll be shocked if we get rid of him.

541
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,320
I have a judgment.

542
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,800
We'll know after we get rid of him.

543
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,160
Are we enough?

544
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,920
Yes.

545
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,280
I don't think there are many people

546
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,760
in the car today.

547
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,360
There's only one entrance.

548
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,280
But there's a window

549
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,880
on the west side.

550
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,840
It's covered with dirt.

551
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,960
You two,

552
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,320
a group,

553
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,880
go there and guard.

554
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,920
Wait for my signal.

555
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,040
No problem.

556
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,960
This is more suitable.

557
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,560
You two should take care of each other

558
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,200
and protect each other.

559
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,160
Is there a third person at the door?

560
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,960
No.

561
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,560
Anyone who comes here

562
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,800
will be shot.

563
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,680
It's a pity that Xiao Qi didn't come.

564
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,480
This lock

565
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,760
is only 20 seconds.

566
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,560
Do we need to break the door?

567
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,080
No.

568
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,080
We're here to investigate.

569
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,160
We're not here to arrest.

570
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,440
Shi Jiangfeng,

571
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,560
is it in place?

572
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,480
I'll knock the door.

573
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,760
I'll go in

574
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,440
and open the door for you.

575
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,280
Don't.

576
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,920
Who's there?

577
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,880
Shi Jiangfeng.

578
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,520
I'm fine.

579
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,480
Let's go.

580
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,520
One, two.

581
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,760
Move.

582
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,600
What should we do?

583
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,480
Why didn't you shoot?

584
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,400
Are you a fool?

585
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,920
You're hurt.

586
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,200
I'm fine.

587
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,160
Thank God.

588
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,560
Wearing this,

589
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,520
we can use the cold and hot air.

590
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,800
We're all in the fire.

591
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,280
Shi Bai,

592
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,480
put the gun down.

593
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
We're really police.

594
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,760
I'm so sorry.

595
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,160
Deputyeters are all in charge of taking care of이

596
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,160
everybody except for his mother

597
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,880
however,

598
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,480
other officers are thinking about

599
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,900
complete

600
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,960
creaming this together.

601
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,400
Don't worry.

602
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,360
해서

603
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,200
...

604
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,680
Sir.

605
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,800
We're here because

606
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
it's your father's trap.

607
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,400
If we ever bring in

608
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,040
Don't be afraid.

609
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,400
We're not drug dealers.

610
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
Our main business is to make portraits.

611
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,280
Our business is doing well.

612
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
We don't lack money.

613
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,520
What did Zhang Haoyang inject?

614
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,640
It's an anesthetic.

615
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,520
It's soft.

616
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,320
It's for fun for our friends.

617
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,760
It's not a drug.

618
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,880
Then why did you prepare so many knives and sticks?

619
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,120
We thought you were...

620
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,480
enemies.

621
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,040
If we knew you were police,

622
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,360
we wouldn't resist.

623
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,520
Does Zhang Haoyang come here often?

624
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,160
I...

625
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,000
He used to come here.

626
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,880
But he stopped coming here half a year later.

627
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,280
He came here a few times recently.

628
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,360
I saw his story online.

629
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,000
He must be under a lot of pressure.

630
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,120
He came here to relax.

631
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Do you know about that case?

632
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,520
Did he come here on the night of June 19th?

633
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,440
He did.

634
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,920
He stayed here until the second half of the night.

635
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,600
I'm not related to him.

636
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,080
I don't need to make a false witness for him.

637
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,680
He didn't come here alone, right?

638
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,600
Who else?

639
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,360
I can't remember.

640
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,680
There must be a few young people.

641
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,360
I really can't remember.

642
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,720
Take him away.

643
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,280
Yes.

644
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,760
Officer.

645
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,280
I...

646
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,680
Hello.

647
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,360
Hai Ping, I found out.

648
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,880
There's a child who was killed.

649
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,760
A boy.

650
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,160
He was three or four years old in 1995.

651
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,600
Three or four years old?

652
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,880
I'm not sure.

653
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,440
He was raised in a rural area.

654
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,840
He didn't get along with his mother.

655
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,240
Where is he now?

656
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,680
I didn't find him.

657
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,120
Do you need more information?

658
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,480
Help me check again.

659
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,520
Thank you, Old Jiao.

660
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,200
If I can see clearly in the darkness

661
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,880
The clouds are still moving

662
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,440
If I can hear the heartbeat

663
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,400
The dream is like a long echo

664
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,280
I want to be the light

665
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,880
Light up the way in the abyss

666
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:00,800
Only be careful

667
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,160
Memories come with wind

668
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,680
A Mogdala Macagena

669
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,720
The story continues

670
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,720
In the darkness, fate is waiting for us to understand

671
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,720
If I can hear the heartbeat, I will look back for a long time

672
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:14,720
If I want to be the light, the light in my heart will shine

673
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:23,720
I know I'm not lucky, but I always have a chance
