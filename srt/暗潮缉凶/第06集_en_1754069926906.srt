1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
but somehow

2
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,900
she can't keep the secret.

3
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,680
This is human Xinchuan,

4
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,420
he's a son in college.

5
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,920
Yeah.

6
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,960
They're both great people.

7
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
Chief Jing, what did they do wrong?

8
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
Okay.

9
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,560
Come on.

10
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,040
No one wants to help?

11
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,720
No need.

12
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Just this one?

13
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,640
Yes.

14
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,480
Didn't you say...

15
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
I'll go check if there's a back door.

16
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,440
No need.

17
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's go together.

18
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,000
Is anyone here?

19
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,240
Yes.

20
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
We're the police.

21
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,200
Is Chen Hui home?

22
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,440
Yes.

23
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,240
Open the door.

24
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,320
Can you go in and talk?

25
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Where's Chen Hui?

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
Did you want to see him?

27
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
I'm not a good guy.

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,040
I can't do heavy work.

29
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,600
I took a big loan.

30
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,480
Xiao Hui will be home in a few days.

31
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,080
She'll help me take the stuff

32
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,880
to the waste collection station.

33
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
On the night of June 19th,

34
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,520
Chen Hui will also come to help.

35
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,840
Yes.

36
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,600
She usually doesn't stay at home.

37
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
She'll go back to school later.

38
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Today she came back,

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,040
she didn't say anything and stayed.

40
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,720
I think this kid

41
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,680
has something on her mind.

42
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,720
I didn't ask her.

43
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
She didn't say anything.

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Why did you change clothes in the bus?

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,520
Are you still checking?

46
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,400
No.

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,600
She was afraid that the clothes would get dirty.

48
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,040
So she put on old clothes

49
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,400
and went home to change them.

50
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,680
You used to live in the construction site, right?

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Why did you move here?

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,440
Because she's not in good health,

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
she can't find any work to do.

55
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,400
So she started the work of collecting waste.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,240
Everyone knows her in the construction site.

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
Xiaohui felt embarrassed to collect waste.

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
So she moved here.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,760
It's not embarrassing to collect waste.

60
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,200
Why didn't you say it earlier?

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,720
If you explain it clearly,

62
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,160
we'll fire you.

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,320
How much time will it take to watch you for so many days?

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,760
I apologize to you two.

66
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,320
She doesn't like to talk.

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
She's very hard-hearted.

68
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,200
She'll do it when she doesn't know the situation.

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,040
But she won't do anything that an animal does.

70
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
We'll verify what you said.

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,200
Don't worry.

72
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,600
We won't wrong her.

73
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,000
One last question.

74
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,120
Is it true that Shen Xiaozhou

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,320
and a man who drives a sports car

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,560
are a couple?

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Yes.

78
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,160
Okay.

79
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
Comrades,

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
it's late. Let's have a meal.

81
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,480
No need.

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
There's nothing to eat.

83
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Eat less.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Don't waste food.

85
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,240
Let's eat.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,960
What are you doing?

87
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,760
Are you going to save us?

88
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
We have both.

89
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
I shouldn't have written that letter.

91
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,400
I shouldn't have said that about Shen Xiaozhou.

92
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,000
I really want that job.

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm afraid they look down on me.

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,080
It's their fault

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,760
that they look down on you.

100
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,720
You don't need to pursue

101
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
the success in their eyes.

102
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,920
You've done so well.

103
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,320
Maybe you can be a professor in the future.

104
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
But isn't it a success

105
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,200
to be a scientist?

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Think about it.

107
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,120
Do you really want to be

108
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,120
like them?

109
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,240
Do you believe him?

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
What his father said should be true.

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,920
Check the surveillance footage

112
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,640
on the 19th.

113
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,520
Do you sympathize with them?

114
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Not sympathize.

115
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
I understand.

116
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,160
I'm familiar with this group.

117
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,640
My lover is Da Chang's daughter.

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
If it weren't for Chen Hui,

119
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,520
we would have lost the clue.

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
That's good.

121
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
What's good?

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,320
So far,

123
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,800
it's not that kind of case.

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Which one?

125
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,600
To earn a living,

126
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
an honest man

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
killed another honest man.

128
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Murder is murder.

129
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,120
No one can kill anyone.

130
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
You're right.

131
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,960
But there are always some cases

132
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,360
that make people feel very suspicious.

133
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,640
If she adopted you,

134
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,000
you need to becraft her.

135
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Completely free

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
and just GitHub.

137
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,280
You have no right to understand her.

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,280
You know this brand.

139
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
This brand doesn't hold anyone back.

140
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,320
You know it.

141
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,400
This brand,

142
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
does someone see it?

143
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
Goodbye.

144
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,280
Er, you kid.

145
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,160
Why are you and your dad looking for trouble?

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
Let's go.

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
You're awake.

148
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,720
What time did you come back last night?

149
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,320
Why didn't you sleep in the room?

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,120
I came back late.

151
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
He woke up.

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,760
Did he have breakfast?

153
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,240
No.

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,440
I was afraid he would wake you up.

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,400
So I didn't make it.

156
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,320
It's okay. Let him go out and eat.

157
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,320
in the cabin

158
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,080
Go.

159
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
Take your time.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,920
Hurry.

161
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Call Mr. info in the naturopathic Class later.

162
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,440
See if he went there.

163
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,720
Why are you so anti-son laidback?

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,600
Once you get home, don't do the police stuff.

165
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,920
You don't know now.

166
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,520
As an elder, you started to raise your own standard.

167
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,920
Don't forget, you are also young.

168
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Back then, you looked more handsome than the sky.

169
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,320
You were even beaten up by someone.

170
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
You were still stubborn, right?

171
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
I was so harsh.

172
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,320
Do I still look like a bad person?

173
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,720
Sorry.

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I forgot.

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,920
I can't see what you are like now.

176
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,120
But from the first moment I saw you, I knew

177
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,720
that you are not a bad kid.

178
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
This is for you.

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,320
Thank you.

180
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,120
When I was little, I was raised in a farm.

181
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
I was beaten up every day.

182
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,920
My mom couldn't go back home for several times.

183
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,520
She left me a photo.

184
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,720
We lost it too.

185
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,320
When I was 19, I ran out of the house

186
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,720
and went to the city.

187
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,520
It was like that.

188
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I grew up in a muddle.

189
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,920
Back then, I was really embarrassed.

190
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,320
I knew that I was

191
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,520
unreliable.

192
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,720
I had to fight for a place in this world.

193
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,320
A person like me

194
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,920
can walk the right path

195
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,120
and become a police officer.

196
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,320
I am not inferior to Uncle Nima.

197
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
What time is it now?

198
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,320
Let's start the meeting now.

199
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,720
Do you want to have breakfast?

200
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,320
You eat it yourself. I'm leaving.

201
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,920
Be careful on the road.

202
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
The door should be changed.

203
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,920
Don't worry about me.

204
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,920
This kid

205
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,320
is becoming greedy.

206
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,920
Do you often come here?

207
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,520
We often come here to eat.

208
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm not a good person.

209
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm not a good person.

210
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,520
I often come here

211
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,520
to get my goldfish.

212
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,320
Do you come here every day?

213
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Almost every day.

214
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,520
Why are you here?

215
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,320
I'm leaving.

216
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Don't go in yet.

217
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I haven't checked in.

218
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Didn't you go in just now?

219
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
You just became a police officer.

220
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,720
You haven't got your job yet.

221
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,320
How can you get a lot of money if you go in?

222
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,520
I was wrong that day.

223
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I was too fast.

224
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,320
Don't take it to heart.

225
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,120
What are you talking about?

226
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,520
You said I couldn't stop you, right?

227
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
You can stop me.

228
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,320
Let me see.

229
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
What are you doing?

230
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,720
Give me a hand.

231
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
We're even.

232
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Come on.

233
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,120
What are you doing?

234
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,520
Let go of me. I'm going to hit you.

235
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
It's okay.

236
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,120
What are you doing?

237
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Don't you feel ashamed?

238
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,520
Come on.

239
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
Come on.

240
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
Come on.

241
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,920
You're wrong.

242
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,320
Jinghai No. 1 is the largest

243
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,520
and the highest-end shopping district in Linchuan City.

244
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,520
It's beautiful.

245
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,720
It's not just beautiful.

246
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,120
It's also very beautiful.

247
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,320
It's also very beautiful.

248
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
It's also very beautiful.

249
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
It's also very beautiful.

250
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
It's not just beautiful.

251
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,520
It's magnificent.

252
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,120
Mr. Lei, this scenery is invincible.

253
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
It's just a small goal of the first stage.

254
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,920
In the future,

255
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,720
3-7, 4-7, 5-7,

256
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,920
and then a whole city,

257
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
it can be a small city.

258
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,720
Just kidding.

259
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,720
It can be called the Golden Sea City.

260
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,920
Not bad. Not bad.

261
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,320
This set is for the 4th district.

262
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,520
The one you just saw is for the 3rd district.

263
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
How is it?

264
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,120
The layout and the layout are all good, right?

265
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I'll leave this set to you.

266
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,720
You can live with your wife.

267
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,120
There's also a set for your daughter.

268
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,720
It's convenient to eat and wear a door at the same building.

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
But they all have their own space.

270
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
I can't afford it.

271
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,720
You're one of us.

272
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,920
The price can be discussed.

273
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
I'll leave it to you.

274
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,920
I have a meeting.

275
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,920
I can't report it to the people.

276
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,520
I'll leave first.

277
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,320
Take care of Director Yue.

278
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,720
Don't worry, Chairman.

279
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,120
Goodbye.

280
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,520
I won't.

281
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,720
What do you want to say?

282
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,520
You don't want me to check the house, right?

283
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,320
I don't know how to build a house.

284
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
You can't not know.

285
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,120
The virtual market will be the Golden Sea 37.

286
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,920
You have to listen to your opinion on how to build it.

287
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,520
Didn't you say you wanted to build a villa?

288
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,320
Of course, we want to build a villa.

289
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,920
The virtual market is better than the Golden Sea 37.

290
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,520
How can we afford the Golden Sea 37 without a villa?

291
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,120
The place in the sea

292
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,320
should be a private beach.

293
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,920
It's a big deal to build some red-and-white spots.

294
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,520
It's a pity that we lost the case.

295
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,720
People are superstitious.

296
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,520
The richer, the more superstitious.

297
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,920
If this is spread,

298
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,520
it will affect the price.

299
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,320
It will definitely affect the price.

300
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,920
So, Director Yue,

301
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,520
the construction plan of the virtual market

302
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,120
may need to be studied.

303
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,920
Don't build it on the spot.

304
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,320
Wait for two years and build it in the north of the city.

305
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Don't compress the profit space of the Golden Sea 37 anymore.

306
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,720
Okay?

307
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,320
The Golden Sea 37

308
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,720
is a good place to live.

309
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
It's too old-fashioned.

310
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,120
Especially, it's not suitable for the elderly.

311
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,720
At most, sell it to the foreigners.

312
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Let them be the most suitable place to live.

313
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
Director Yue,

314
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,320
this is the situation.

315
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,920
Do you think

316
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,720
there is a possibility of doing some work?

317
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,320
I don't think so.

318
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,920
There is a possibility of doing some work.

319
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,320
I don't have much power

320
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,520
to beat thousands of people.

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,120
I have to protect the sky.

322
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,320
It's too high.

323
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,120
I'm going to faint if I stand for too long.

324
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I'll go back first.

325
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,120
The case of the victim is over.

326
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,920
The victim's identity has been identified.

327
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,320
Jia Beibei

328
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
is a civil servant from a foreign land.

329
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,720
She has no fixed job.

330
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,520
Before she was killed, she was a drunkard

331
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,920
in the bar KTV.

332
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,720
The murderer's criminal method

333
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,520
is very similar to Wang Yishan's case.

334
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,320
She has a family name and no DNA.

335
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,720
Okay.

336
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,120
From the three victims'

337
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,720
professionalism and identity,

338
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
look.

339
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,920
Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei

340
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,120
are both civil servants from a foreign land.

341
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Wang Yishan lost contact with her family long ago.

342
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,920
Jia Beibei is still in the process of investigation.

343
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,320
But from her professionalism,

344
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm afraid she's not from a family

345
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,320
with close relations.

346
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,720
The two of them

347
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,320
are high-risk victims.

348
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
No one will find out

349
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
if they are high-risk victims.

350
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Shen Xiaozhou is different.

351
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,120
She's a college student

352
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,920
and a local resident.

353
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,520
Her parents love her very much.

354
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,320
They'll report the case

355
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,520
if they find her missing.

356
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,320
Normally,

357
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
the victims who choose to be high-risk

358
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,720
will avoid the low-risk victims.

359
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,920
The two leaders

360
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,720
are not the same person who killed Shen Xiaozhou.

361
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
Lin Hai Ping,

362
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
tell me.

363
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I want to wait

364
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,520
for the test report that Guo did.

365
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,120
Isn't it done?

366
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,720
I asked him to do a new test.

367
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
What test?

368
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,520
Gao Lin, come here.

369
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,720
Turn around.

370
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,120
Come.

371
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,520
Come.

372
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
The test is done.

373
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,520
What did you say?

374
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Hurry up.

375
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,720
Lin Hai Ping asked me to re-test

376
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Wang Yishan, Shen Xiaozhou, and Jia Beibei.

377
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,320
The test results of the three victims.

378
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,120
I found some

379
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
minor defects

380
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
in the surface skin and the texture.

381
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,120
Did you test the DNA?

382
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,720
No.

383
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,520
This is a chemical test,

384
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,720
not a biological test.

385
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
I checked the DNA

386
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
of Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei.

387
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,920
The samples of Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei

388
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,520
were tested with

389
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,720
sodium sulfate,

390
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,920
oxygen sulfate,

391
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
and sodium sulfate.

392
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,720
The results are all very good.

393
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,320
The raw material used for the film.

394
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,720
For example,

395
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
the film

396
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,120
should be liquid first.

397
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
Pour it into the container

398
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
and cover the film.

399
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,520
After it solidifies,

400
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
open it,

401
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,920
take out the film,

402
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,120
and pour it into the silicone.

403
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Done.

404
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,720
The murderer cut the film off

405
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,520
to make it easier to make the film.

406
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,320
This is a reasonable guess.

407
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
Take it out.

408
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Shen Xiaozhou's foot is useless.

409
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,920
Qiu Jie,

410
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,720
shouldn't we change the case?

411
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,120
If it's a case, it's a case.

412
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,720
The city police

413
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,120
doesn't need to change it at will.

414
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,920
Although Shen Xiaozhou's case

415
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,720
may have other killers,

416
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,320
the common point is very obvious.

417
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,720
I think if we keep investigating,

418
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,920
there may be a conflict between the two cases.

419
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Then,

420
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,520
one case has two directions.

421
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Is it the same murderer

422
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
who investigated to the bottom?

423
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,720
Lao Zhao,

424
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,920
you investigate Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei.

425
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,120
If necessary,

426
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,920
ask the experts of the provincial court

427
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,120
to draw a psychological portrait of the murderer.

428
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,320
Yes.

429
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,120
You investigate Shen Xiaozhou.

430
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,320
We may need to split up.

431
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
I'll follow that side.

432
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Which side do you want to follow?

433
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,720
I'll follow the team.

434
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,320
There is no clue of the suspect.

435
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,920
We can only re-investigate Shen Xiaozhou's action line.

436
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,920
At the next intersection,

437
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,320
we didn't find Shen Xiaozhou.

438
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,520
He disappeared on this road.

439
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,920
How many possibilities are there?

440
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,720
He called a car.

441
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
Looking at the phone records,

442
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
he didn't call a car.

443
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
Or

444
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
he stopped a rented car passing by.

445
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Or

446
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,120
he got on a bus.

447
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,320
Is there surveillance on this bus stop?

448
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,720
No.

449
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,520
But there is surveillance on the bus now.

450
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,120
There are 8 buses in this bus stop.

451
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,120
They transferred all the surveillance.

452
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,120
And on the afternoon of June 19th,

453
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,520
at 4 o'clock,

454
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,720
no,

455
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
after 3 o'clock,

456
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,720
all the rented cars passing by

457
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,520
including the ones on the side of the road,

458
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,520
how is that possible?

459
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,920
Captain Lin,

460
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,720
is there a possibility

461
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,920
that he entered the shops on both sides

462
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,720
or the residents in the community

463
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,920
and was transferred after he was killed?

464
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,120
So all the shops and residents on this road

465
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,920
have to be checked.

466
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,120
There is another possibility.

467
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,920
He got on a familiar car.

468
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,320
But he didn't call.

469
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,520
If he happened to pass by,

470
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,920
that would be too coincidental.

471
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Sometimes,

472
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
it's just a coincidence.

473
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,720
Go ask

474
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,720
where you can buy a better cemetery.

475
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,920
The scenery should be good.

476
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,520
Then,

477
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,920
I'll go ask.

478
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
We

479
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
bought a cemetery.

480
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,520
A cemetery?

481
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
It's a financial product.

482
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
It's a good thing.

483
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,720
It's a good thing.

484
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,920
It's a good thing.

485
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,320
It's a financial product.

486
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,920
It's said to be a good thing.

487
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,520
We might be fooled.

488
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,120
I went to ask.

489
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,320
That financial company

490
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,120
can't even get the capital now.

491
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,920
A lot of people are fighting with them.

492
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,120
What about the cemetery?

493
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,920
It's empty.

494
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,120
There's no sign.

495
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I wanted to tell you,

496
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,520
but something happened to your family.

497
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,720
I can't...

498
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Teacher, don't worry.

499
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,320
We'll pay for your money.

500
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,720
We can't get it.

501
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,120
We have more money.

502
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,520
I'm trying to think of a way.

503
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
We can't let Xiaozhou

504
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,920
have a place to live.

505
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Uncle Shen,

506
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,920
once Xiaozhou read a novel.

507
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,920
He said he would grow old and not want a cemetery.

508
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
He said

509
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,520
the ashes,

510
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
the flowers,

511
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,120
were buried in the cemetery.

512
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,120
He even saved money.

513
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,720
Xiaozhou said

514
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,920
he knew he saved money.

515
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,520
He never thought about it.

516
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,320
If this is his wish,

517
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,520
then listen to him.

518
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,120
Zheng Hai.

519
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Yes?

520
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,720
Get up and go home.

521
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Get up and go home.

522
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Let's go.

523
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,720
The expert's painting is too thick.

524
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Men live alone between 20 and 40.

525
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
They have a certain economic foundation,

526
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
higher education,

527
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,120
and they work more freely.

528
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,920
There are tens of thousands of single people in the world.

529
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,320
How can we investigate?

530
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,720
They often buy women's shoes and investigate from here.

531
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,520
You think we didn't investigate?

532
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,120
Even small tools like a saw

533
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,920
can't find the source.

534
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,320
What about the general products like women's shoes?

535
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,720
How many shoes do you have to sell a day?

536
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,920
I...

537
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,320
I bought men's and women's shoes.

538
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,920
You only need to buy one pair of tools.

539
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,920
You will definitely find a way to buy information.

540
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,120
But women's shoes are often bought.

541
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,520
It's inevitable that you will have to buy more.

542
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,920
What do you know?

543
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,320
You don't know how to buy women's shoes yourself, do you?

544
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,120
Yes.

545
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,920
I've never bought it anyway.

546
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,120
Also,

547
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,320
do you need to buy raw materials for the footwear?

548
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
This is also a trick.

549
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
You are a guide.

550
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
You only investigated a few cases.

551
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,120
Zero.

552
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,320
January 1st, the original date.

553
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,520
You should learn from your captain.

554
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,120
You should learn the advantage of speaking less.

555
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,320
Let's make a conclusion.

556
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,320
This suspect is a disabled person.

557
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,920
He lost his foot.

558
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,520
You are right.

559
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,920
Maybe he lost two feet and became a wheelchair.

560
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,120
Enough.

561
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Let's get to the case.

562
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Don't say anything more.

563
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
Hey.

564
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,520
Are you interested in this type of murderer?

565
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,720
Yes.

566
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,320
Which police officer is not interested?

567
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,520
Do you know where this type of murderer comes from?

568
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
I know everywhere.

569
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,320
I've also talked about it in school.

570
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,720
You've seen a lot of it on TV, right?

571
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,320
It's pretty good.

572
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,920
But for so many years,

573
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,320
I've never seen a murder case

574
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,520
where the murderer tried his best

575
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,520
to make people lose their minds.

576
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,720
There has never been a case

577
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,920
where it was pushed out by a mere reasoning.

578
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,320
In fact, our case

579
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
is mainly about four wheels, two legs,

580
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,720
and one mouth.

581
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,320
It's a boring repeat of labor.

582
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,320
I know.

583
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,920
Where are we going?

584
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,120
Shen Xiaozhou's funeral.

585
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,920
Are we going to attend?

586
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
All the carriages,

587
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,520
bus,

588
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,320
and the store in the neighborhood

589
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,920
have been checked.

590
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,320
None of them have been found.

591
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,120
Maybe he really met someone.

592
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,520
You think it's the person Chen Hui said?

593
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
I don't know.

594
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,320
Maybe the murderer will appear in the funeral.

595
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,320
Isn't that just reasoning?

596
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,720
No. It's experience.

597
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,720
Can I go now?

598
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:32,880
Do you feel

599
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,320
the situation that way?

600
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,880
The Civil Affairs Bureau agreed

601
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,520
to choose this place.

602
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,920
Many people in the family

603
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,520
went to plead.

604
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,720
Thank you.

605
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,360
It's holiday.

606
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,160
Many students

607
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,480
came from other places.

608
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,200
Xia bouquet

609
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,360
Flower bow

610
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:31,600
Your

611
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,000
Fresh

612
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,580
let

613
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,920
They are playing a show.

614
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,040
There are many people.

615
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,920
Let's go back.

616
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,920
Go back.

617
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,400
Can you stop talking?

618
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,280
Well,

619
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,760
please give this to

620
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Xiaozhou's parents.

621
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,240
I just gave it to them.

622
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,600
They don't want it.

623
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,440
So,

624
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,800
I was going to

625
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,040
work for a company in Yucheng.

626
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,120
It's a little bit of a gift from the company.

627
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
Thank you.

628
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,720
It's beautiful here.

629
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,640
It's

630
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,280
a lonely place.

631
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,960
This is his hospital.

632
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,880
The free-spirited people are not afraid of loneliness.

633
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,600
How do you know he's a free-spirited person?

634
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,840
He looks like me.

635
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,520
Like who?

636
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,120
Like a free-spirited person.

637
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,360
Officer Liang.

638
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,080
Yes?

639
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,920
I have a meeting this afternoon.

640
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
I have to go in advance.

641
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
I hope you can keep the secret

642
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,840
about the hotel thing.

643
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,360
The company is going to be listed soon.

644
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,280
I don't want to have

645
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
unnecessary news.

646
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,000
So,

647
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,240
I understand.

648
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm leaving.

649
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,600
How was your work?

650
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,720
It's beautiful.

651
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,720
So beautiful!

652
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,440
Wait.

653
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,680
Have you seen this person?

654
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,040
No.

655
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,160
I know this person.

656
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,240
Who is he?

657
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,880
His name is Zhang Hao Yang.

658
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,640
Shen Xiaozhou's boyfriend?

659
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,480
No.

660
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,880
He likes Xiaozhou, but he's not her boyfriend.

661
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
I asked you last time. Why didn't you say it?

662
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,520
He's not her boyfriend.

663
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,240
There are many people who like Xiaozhou.

664
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,000
There are several in our department.

665
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,360
He likes Shen Xiaozhou,

666
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,440
but she doesn't like him.

667
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
It's not that I don't like him.

668
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
Are they friends?

669
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,200
I guess so.

670
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,840
Can they go out together?

671
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,520
Sometimes.

672
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,160
Isn't that just a relationship?

673
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,480
It's not a relationship.

674
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,800
Maybe he wants to,

675
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,520
but Xiaozhou definitely doesn't want to.

676
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,320
So Xiaozhou will call me when he comes out to play.

677
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,160
Xiaozhou doesn't want others to know

678
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,560
that he knows Zhang Hao Yang.

679
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,440
Why?

680
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,680
He's a rich second generation, right?

681
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,680
Just because he's a rich second generation.

682
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,200
What do you mean?

683
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,640
He's a short-term rich second generation.

684
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,640
It's the first time I've heard of it.

685
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,160
Xiaozhou thinks he's not grown up yet.

686
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,440
How old is he?

687
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,280
Is he underage?

688
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,560
You can go find him yourself.

689
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
He likes Shen Xiaozhou,

690
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
but she doesn't like him.

691
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,800
It's a strong motive.

692
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,520
Many cases are because of this.

693
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,120
Captain Lin, we've found out.

694
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,920
Zhang Hao Yang's father is Zhang Mo Qing.

695
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,840
You know him, right?

696
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,160
Who?

697
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,920
Which group's boss?

698
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
The famous artist.

699
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,520
Many leaders

700
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,920
have his name on them.

701
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
An artist?

702
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,960
The son of an artist is so vulgar.

703
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,360
Why would he drive a sports car?

704
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,960
He's not just an artist.

705
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,800
Here, Captain Lin.

706
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,720
He has a business.

707
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,840
Who's driving?

708
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,960
Let me.

709
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,480
I've learned it from my uncle.

710
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,240
Come on.

711
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,640
You're just a three-wheel driver.

712
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,480
Give it to me.

713
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,040
I've practiced with my car.

714
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,360
Enough. Stop bragging.

715
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,600
Get the footwear.

716
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,640
Rock, paper, scissors.

717
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,400
Cheng Tian Yi.

718
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,160
Yu.

719
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,240
Yu.

720
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,880
Cheng Tian Yi Yu.

721
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,760
How easy is that?

722
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,400
The wine stored on the shelves

723
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,720
is inherited from the essence.

724
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Because of the essence of the tea,

725
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,360
the wine has a strong fragrance

726
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,360
and a full taste.

727
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,320
It's more comfortable in texture.

728
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,640
And our tea

729
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,960
has a test report and a collection certificate.

730
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,680
The essence is based on the five major standards

731
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,280
and the standard of tea

732
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,320
of Chinese products.

733
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,360
What?

734
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,200
Isn't it just tea?

735
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,280
Hello.

736
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,080
Are you here to pick up the goods?

737
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,000
We're the police.

738
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,680
What's wrong with your hand?

739
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,480
Maybe it's broken.

740
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,240
It's broken.

741
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,560
When was the last time

742
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,720
you met Professor Shen?

743
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,440
The day he was killed.

744
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,440
That afternoon.

745
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,400
What time?

746
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,720
Around three o'clock.

747
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,240
I went to his school.

748
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,200
And he had a club activity

749
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,080
that had just ended.

750
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,360
What did you do?

751
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,640
I just...

752
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
He was going home

753
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,720
from school the next day.

754
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,160
So I asked him

755
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,080
if he wanted to see him off.

756
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,640
And he said no.

757
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,480
So we broke up.

758
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,320
What's your relationship with Shen Xiaozhou?

759
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,640
A friend.

760
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,560
Not a boyfriend?

761
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,600
No.

762
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,240
When did you

763
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,920
meet Shen Xiaozhou?

764
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,960
Last year,

765
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,880
my dad donated a book

766
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,080
to the South Palace.

767
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,040
And on the donation ceremony,

768
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,880
Xiaozhou played a pipa

769
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,320
as a student representative.

770
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,720
We knew each other.

771
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,080
After you knew each other,

772
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,160
you started to pursue her?

773
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,800
You're almost there.

774
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Change me.

775
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,160
Hurry up.

776
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,880
Let's have a coffee.

777
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,680
You?

778
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,520
Come on.

779
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,080
I dare not touch you.

780
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,120
You asked him out every time?

781
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,760
Yes.

782
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,120
For dinner?

783
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,920
For movies?

784
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,240
Did you buy him anything?

785
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,240
I did.

786
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,200
But he didn't take it.

787
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
You want to

788
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,200
make more friends with him?

789
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,800
He doesn't agree, right?

790
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,400
Yes.

791
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,600
Why?

792
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,360
Because...

793
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,560
Because he doesn't like you.

794
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,360
You're so good.

795
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,200
He has everything he wants.

796
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,520
Why should he?

797
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,040
From last year,

798
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,480
he's been pursuing you.

799
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,320
He just doesn't want to

800
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
have a relationship with you.

801
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,040
Is he playing with you?

802
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,160
He's willing to date you,

803
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,080
eat with you,

804
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,160
watch movies.

805
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,680
He just doesn't want to

806
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,440
have a relationship with you.

807
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,480
I don't know what

808
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,920
she's thinking.

809
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,840
Please stop.

810
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,880
Is she

811
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,160
trying to steal your pride?

812
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,080
Is she trying to give you a disadvantage?

813
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,840
No.

814
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,240
She's not that kind of girl.

815
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
I don't deserve her.

816
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,320
You don't?

817
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,080
Did she say that?

818
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,840
No.

819
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,280
She never said that.

820
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,520
I'm not good enough.

821
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,960
I don't know what I want.

822
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,640
I don't have a goal.

823
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,080
She...

824
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:36,920
She doesn't like

825
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,960
people like me.

826
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,760
On the 19th,

827
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,840
the night when Shen Xiaozhou

828
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,560
was killed,

829
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,600
where were you?

830
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,160
I was with a friend.

831
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,400
What were you doing together?

832
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,560
We were drinking.

833
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,800
We drank all night.

834
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,200
You felt bad?

835
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,400
I just refused to send her home.

836
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,680
Is that necessary?

837
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,360
She said

838
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,000
she'd never see me again.

839
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,600
When was that?

840
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,560
On her birthday.

841
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,080
Her birthday?

842
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,800
May 30th.

843
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,920
On her birthday,

844
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,600
you confessed to her?

845
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,400
I'm so stupid.

846
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,280
If I didn't say those words,

847
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,720
I might still be friends.

848
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,760
Then why did you

849
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,920
go to her on the 19th?

850
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,640
I wanted to see her.

851
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,880
I couldn't help it.

852
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,320
You suspect

853
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,800
it was me.

854
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,560
Even if I killed myself,

855
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,520
I wouldn't hurt Xiaozhou.

856
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,960
On the night of the wedding,

857
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,880
all the people who drank with you

858
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,960
gave us their names.

859
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,640
It felt like an act.

860
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,000
She was pretending.

861
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,120
By the way,

862
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,200
on the 19th,

863
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
she saw Shen Xiaozhou.

864
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,120
If she hadn't left,

865
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,360
she would have followed her.

866
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,880
So Shen Xiaozhou

867
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,480
met someone on the road.

868
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,320
Maybe it was her.

869
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,720
Check if there's her car

870
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,400
in the surveillance camera.

871
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,920
Xiao Shu, something happened.

872
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,920
Come back.
