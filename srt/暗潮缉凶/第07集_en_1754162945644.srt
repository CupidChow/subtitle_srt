00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,760
Xiaozhou.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Wait a moment, Uncle.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,720
I'm so tired.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,440
Let's take a break.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,480
It's okay, Dad.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,720
I'll do it.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,720
I'm not tired.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,200
Uncle, two?

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,400
Yes, two.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,840
Here, have some water.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,440
I went to your house just now.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,400
I saw that there was no one at home.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,040
So I brought it to you.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,240
Here.

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,000
The college admission notice.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
You got it?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,960
You got it?

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,840
The admission notice.

22
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,400
Xiaozhou, you're great.

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,480
You're good.

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,560
Here, take it.

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,360
You're a science and engineering major.

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,440
The admission notice.

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,160
The admission notice.

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,200
Liu, take the money back.

29
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,280
No money today.

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,640
Okay, thank you.

31
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,680
It's okay.

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,160
Old Wang, Old Ma, come here.

33
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm treating you today.

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
No money, no money.

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
It's free.

36
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Free.

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,520
Free.

38
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,280
Thank you.

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Thank you.

40
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Thank you.

41
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Thank you.

42
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Thank you.

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
I'll pay for it.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,120
Many people die for this.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,840
But frick you.

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
Thank you for your십 times.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,280
Wait for me.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,200
I don't do this for money.

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,320
It's not for money.

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Why?

51
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,680
Return to the college.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Fine, thank you.

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,840
I'll take over in a minute.

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
No problem.

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,240
Maybe Huayuan Primary School,

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,120
you could have studied at Huayuan High School not to have to do this.

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,540
I might,

58
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,080
but not to do things for money!

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Don't tell me it's because Wancker's here.

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,900
Use it

62
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,600
everything is clear

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,060
She's the one who drove

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,340
The other two kids

65
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,820
have been taken back by their parents.

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,220
The repair costs

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,900
depends on whether the other party

68
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,820
wants to go to the insurance company

69
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,740
or something else.

70
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,940
You can discuss it yourself.

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,980
Thank you.

72
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,020
What about the one who forced us to leave?

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,060
It's said that a car

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,980
suddenly changed the way

75
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,140
and forced their car.

76
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,100
So it hit the roadside.

77
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,980
Don't worry.

78
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,460
If we find their license plate,

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,340
we will take their responsibility.

80
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,180
But you are a driver without a license.

81
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,380
According to the rules,

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,060
you will be sentenced to 16 weeks

83
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,740
and 200 yuan for free.

84
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,220
You are all police officers.

85
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,180
I will be the one

86
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,620
to criticize them.

87
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,060
You do it.

88
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,300
Don't show mercy.

89
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,820
Police officers

90
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,940
are also punished.

91
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,500
They are to be

92
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,820
a role model for other kids.

93
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,660
Right?

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,260
Dr. Shuo.

95
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,580
From today

96
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,420
to the opening of school,

97
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,380
you will be the one to pick up the teacher.

98
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,580
You are not allowed to go out.

99
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,020
I want to go to my grandma's house.

100
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,660
What?

101
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,180
I want to go to my grandma's house.

102
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,940
Impossible.

103
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,540
You are not at home tomorrow.

104
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,260
Why do you care about me?

105
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,340
Stop arguing.

106
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,940
Take her back first.

107
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,900
We will talk about it later.

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,700
Don't argue at night.

109
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,420
Take her to the hospital

110
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,780
for a full-body checkup.

111
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,340
Your son

112
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,820
is not like you.

113
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,180
He is quite personality.

114
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,460
Drive.

115
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,340
Did you get angry just now?

116
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,900
I was in a bad mood.

117
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,020
I was too calm at work.

118
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
I was always cold.

119
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,860
I got angry when I got home.

120
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,420
It's not good to have

121
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,300
a good brother and a family.

122
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,260
Have you been like this

123
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,060
to your son?

124
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,300
Just now,

125
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,340
I was in a bad mood.

126
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,220
Your lover

127
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,740
looked quite harmonious

128
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,780
just now.

129
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,980
He must be very kind.

130
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,660
Fortunately, you

131
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,940
are a really bad mother.

132
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,860
Your lover is really not like you.

133
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,620
Who do you know?

134
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,580
Have you finished?

135
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,580
I'll just talk about it.

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,420
The files of Zhang Hao Yang

137
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,940
and those people

138
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,700
have been sent here.

139
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,620
Why don't you deal with the family first?

140
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,780
I'll go first.

141
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,500
Go.

142
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,820
Jia Wei Wei

143
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,420
came to Lin Chuan in February this year.

144
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,620
She has no relatives or friends

145
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
and has been looking for a job in the local area.

146
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,140
She used to be a waitress at a Japanese restaurant.

147
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,300
She was not good at work

148
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,140
and couldn't learn anything.

149
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,220
She was soon fired.

150
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,380
She usually likes to

151
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,260
post some small videos online.

152
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,060
Order takeout,

153
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,780
put on makeup,

154
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,620
buy some small things,

155
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,780
decorate the rental house or something.

156
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,420
Ying Zi, play the video.

157
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,820
I used a new nail clipper

158
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,300
which is more beautiful

159
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,940
than the previous one.

160
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,900
It makes my feet whiter.

161
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,340
And it's a good nail clipper

162
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,420
for the feet.

163
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,740
And I used a new nail oil.

164
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,380
Is it good?

165
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,220
I really like this color.

166
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,580
Does it make my feet white?

167
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,540
Does it make my skin look good?

168
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,100
Yes.

169
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,500
We are investigating

170
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,100
the source of the original materials.

171
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,700
The retail channels in the county

172
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,060
in Shandong, Dongguan, and Shenzhen

173
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,940
are not

174
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,020
found yet.

175
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,100
This murderer is quite capable.

176
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,500
He is very good at anti-scratching.

177
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,340
He is too good.

178
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,660
There are so many cameras now.

179
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,380
We can't even find

180
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,860
where Jia Weiwei met the murderer.

181
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
According to his last route,

182
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,580
he probably went to the sea

183
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,060
with the murderer.

184
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,820
Wang Yishan.

185
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,500
The last place he disappeared

186
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,500
should be by the sea.

187
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,860
There is such a good place here.

188
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,180
Is the hotel open?

189
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,260
Yes.

190
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,780
Just pay the fee.

191
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,380
Where were you on the night of June 19th?

192
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,300
The night of the murder case, right?

193
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,620
We were drinking.

194
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,380
Was Zhang Haoyang there?

195
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,980
Yes.

196
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,940
I drank for him.

197
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,860
I was heartbroken.

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,220
Where did you drink?

199
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,260
At a friend's house.

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
What's the address?

201
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,340
I don't know.

202
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,620
I don't remember the door number.

203
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,180
Whose house?

204
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,300
I forgot.

205
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,020
I went there to get some money.

206
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,220
Who cares?

207
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,340
Stop talking nonsense.

208
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,740
I'm talking to you.

209
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,620
I'm a witness, not a criminal.

210
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,100
I have no obligation to answer you.

211
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,340
Move.

212
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,540
Or I'll beat you.

213
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,500
Go ahead.

214
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,900
Don't be like this.

215
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,900
You're still working?

216
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,460
Yes.

217
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,940
A advertising company.

218
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,340
Your dad's company?

219
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,300
No.

220
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,100
I want to open an advertising company.

221
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,580
I want to experience it first.

222
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,620
The night of June 19th,

223
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,100
you drank at your house?

224
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,940
Yes, at my place.

225
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,780
I lived there.

226
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,820
What time did you drink?

227
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,780
Around 1 p.m.

228
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,580
I almost didn't get up the next day.

229
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,820
What happened to Zhang Hao Yang's wound?

230
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,700
Wound?

231
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,140
He got drunk.

232
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,420
He was slurred.

233
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,660
He can't get rid of it.

234
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,340
You don't suspect Zhang Hao Yang, do you?

235
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,580
He's not that bad.

236
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,540
He's the fifth-grade youth in our circle.

237
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,540
Really?

238
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,540
You don't know, do you?

239
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,700
Zhang Hao Yang

240
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,900
divorced his parents when he was very young.

241
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,300
He was with his mom.

242
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,100
When he was in high school,

243
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,540
his mom passed away.

244
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
His dad didn't have a son.

245
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,060
So he took him back.

246
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,740
Although he's like us,

247
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,060
he has no worries about his future.

248
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,940
But he's not open-minded at all.

249
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,740
He's very low-key.

250
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,420
When his dad took him to various gatherings,

251
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,580
he was very upset.

252
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,660
Later, he got better.

253
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,020
He started to play with us.

254
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,660
We all know

255
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
he has a target that he's been chasing.

256
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,580
That female college student.

257
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,100
But we've never seen it.

258
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,740
Zhang Hao Yang

259
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,660
doesn't even dare to pick bugs.

260
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,780
He's a killer.

261
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,220
That's impossible.

262
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,460
If there's nothing else, I'll...

263
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,660
Okay.

264
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,860
Do you think he's right?

265
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,860
Let's just report him first.

266
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
The next one

267
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,220
is not a good thing.

268
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,900
Look.

269
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,060
Look.

270
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,180
What will you sell

271
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,100
when you get pairing stuff?

272
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,940
I'll sell the stuff I'm interested in.

273
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,460
Like this,

274
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,980
the sofa and light

275
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,260
in the room are tax- 沒有一樣,了吧?

276
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,580
That an they sell, too.

277
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,520
I'll sell

278
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,460
what I'm interested in anyway.

279
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,860
I just want my family

280
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,780
to live off outside.

281
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,860
And the wine

282
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,660
I took with me that day.

283
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,940
and the wine that day.

284
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,620
I brought it back.

285
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,660
You're the leader of this circle, right?

286
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,300
I can't count.

287
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,260
Everyone recognizes me.

288
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,340
How's your relationship with Zhang Haoyang?

289
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,780
Do you know him well?

290
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,380
Haoyang?

291
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,580
We're buddies.

292
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,500
A'Li said

293
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,900
we shouldn't talk about friends behind his back.

294
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,220
But you asked me.

295
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,020
You asked me.

296
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,300
I have to say

297
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,580
Haoyang is a good person.

298
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,260
He's...

299
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,180
weak.

300
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,220
After he came back to his father,

301
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,060
his life environment changed.

302
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,340
He's a man of his word.

303
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,740
His father wanted him to take over the job.

304
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,740
He's not interested in

305
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,260
the style of calligraphy and jade.

306
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,540
He's quite confused.

307
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,660
Then he met Shen Xiaozhou.

308
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,980
Right? Is it Shen Xiaozhou?

309
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,580
Have you seen Shen Xiaozhou?

310
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,300
Haoyang wanted to meet us.

311
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,260
He's a

312
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,460
But Haoyang also told us

313
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,460
that this girl

314
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,700
helped him a lot.

315
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,340
When he was in trouble,

316
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,420
she gave him a lot of encouragement.

317
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,780
Haoyang said

318
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,700
this girl was like a

319
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,140
flower.

320
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,900
She was bright when she saw her.

321
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,860
I'm so happy.

322
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,380
You and Zhang Haoyang

323
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,980
are so close.

324
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,700
We've talked so much.

325
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,020
We're like

326
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,180
a lot in common.

327
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm confused, too.

328
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,220
This company

329
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,060
is a confused product.

330
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,020
You mean

331
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,380
it's hard to be a rich second generation?

332
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,500
Right?

333
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,860
Well,

334
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,100
I want to apologize

335
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,260
to the two officers

336
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,940
about what happened last time.

337
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,620
I'm sorry

338
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,580
for making you see

339
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,100
my sick side.

340
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,300
But I'm fine

341
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,820
after taking the medicine.

342
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,900
What's wrong?

343
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,260
Shi Jiangfeng's stupid trick

344
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,460
is really going to be used?

345
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,980
Why did he do it?

346
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,420
Experts said

347
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,860
we should investigate it.

348
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,300
Experts said

349
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,620
the murderer often bought women's shoes.

350
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,740
We checked

351
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,380
the shoe stores

352
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,740
and shoe stores.

353
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,860
This is all true.

354
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,220
You really don't understand.

355
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,260
It's a long way.

356
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,540
This is only one tenth.

357
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,980
Luckily, there are few men

358
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,740
who went to buy women's shoes alone.

359
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,860
Did Jia Beibei

360
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,420
borrow money from Gao Lidai before he was killed?

361
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,860
Jia Beibei was killed

362
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,060
because of a large sum

363
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,260
of money in his account.

364
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,580
He probably had more than 20,000 cash.

365
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,900
But he didn't have time to spend it.

366
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,980
I'll take it for you.

367
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,460
Do you know why it's mysterious?

368
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,060
Captain Zhao's hand was broken.

369
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,260
It's a serious injury.

370
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,540
I didn't hit him.

371
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,540
You bought the hammer.

372
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,300
There's a payment record online.

373
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,060
You provided the weapon.

374
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,820
Although you were the first one

375
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,340
to make a mistake when you caught him,

376
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,780
except for the one who hit him,

377
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,060
you might be three or five years

378
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,420
fatter than others.

379
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,860
Ten years or eight years.

380
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,980
Is it a loss?

381
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,340
Show him the photo.

382
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,540
You still have a chance to make up for your mistake.

383
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,260
I've seen it.

384
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Every time I get more than 10,000 cash,

385
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,020
I have to be warm-hearted

386
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,460
and kill Hong Li.

387
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,260
He took her away.

388
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,420
I don't know what happened

389
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,860
later.

390
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,300
Didn't you say you weren't allowed to go?

391
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,660
He said

392
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,300
I had to go to my grandma's house to do the jail.

393
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,180
I've already scolded him about driving.

394
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,100
If he dares to do this again,

395
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:22,980
I'll...

396
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,900
I'll cry for him.

397
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,260
Just let him go.

398
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,340
My dad listens to me.

399
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,540
You two quarreled when you met.

400
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,900
He's in his youth.

401
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,180
Why did you quarrel with him?

402
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,860
I'm doing this for his own good.

403
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,780
He doesn't think so.

404
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,860
He thinks you don't like him.

405
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,460
I don't believe he's so muddled.

406
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,420
I'll go find him.

407
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,300
Don't go.

408
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,140
Hello?

409
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,260
Is it Lin?

410
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,740
I'm Jia from the police team of Huayuan Road.

411
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,100
Your son is driving.

412
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,780
There's a car that suddenly changed to a bad-mouthing car.

413
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,300
We found out that the other person's car is a fake.

414
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,620
So we need to investigate it further.

415
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,740
Do you have the photos?

416
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,780
Yes.

417
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,820
There's surveillance.

418
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,740
This car has something to do with a case I'm investigating.

419
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,460
Okay.

420
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,220
I'll help you with that.

421
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,900
Who is it?

422
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,020
Nothing.

423
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,540
Tell his father

424
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,380
not to run around these days.

425
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,220
He agreed.

426
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,620
I'll cook for you.

427
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,900
I think there's a car following us.

428
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:58,620
Your father beat

429
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,520
you so hard.

430
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,120
He is mad.

431
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,340
Your father beat you till you hit time.

432
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,340
Kong!

433
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,340
Ask for完全变 appear.

434
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,580
The car stopped stopped.

435
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,180
The marriage noodles.

436
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,420
That's what he said.

437
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,540
You did it to Liang Hai Ping's son, right?

438
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,500
I was just scared.

439
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,940
I was just trying to find some trouble for him.

440
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,700
I just wanted to see if he could understand.

441
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,100
Brother, did I do something wrong?

442
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,700
Didn't you say you wanted to move his soft body?

443
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,660
Can you be a little more smart?

444
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Kill Liang Hai Ping directly.

445
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,940
Brother Kun, he's a police officer.

446
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,180
It's too much trouble to kill him directly.

447
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,900
You know he's a police officer too.

448
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,460
It's the same trouble for his family.

449
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,900
The police hates this the most.

450
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,660
Then... then I...

451
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,340
In the future, if you don't have any arrangements,

452
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,780
you are not allowed to touch him, understand?

453
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,380
I understand, I understand.

454
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,220
Go on singing.

455
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,180
Sing, sing, sing.

456
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,140
Ying Qing Qing

457
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,340
is dead.

458
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,300
I'll go.

459
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,740
Qiu Hong, it's time to serve.

460
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,860
It's time.

461
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,260
Give me one.

462
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,580
Give me one.

463
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,020
Give me one.

464
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,940
Sorry, I'm the only one.

465
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,220
I'll wait for a while.

466
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,180
It's okay.

467
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:33,900
It's okay.

468
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,700
Don't worry.

469
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,940
Hai, do you want some jelly?

470
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,580
Hai, do you want some jelly?

471
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,540
Give me your hand.

472
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,420
Stop it.

473
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,500
Shen, why don't you come and help?

474
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,620
Look at you.

475
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,780
Shen can't help you.

476
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,300
Here, give me two.

477
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,900
Zhang Yi, don't you want to eat this?

478
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,300
It's for my old man.

479
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,740
Keep it.

480
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,340
Hai.

481
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,620
Hai, what are you doing?

482
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,300
Here, help me.

483
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,940
Here.

484
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,140
Don't touch it.

485
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,380
Your right hand.

486
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,700
Captain Lin.

487
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,620
Jiang Beibei, the victim,

488
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,620
worked at a Japanese restaurant before.

489
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,820
In the same street

490
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,620
from Zhang Haoyang's restaurant,

491
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,900
he was arrested.

492
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,900
The English house.

493
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,700
Yes.

494
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,140
It's a very expensive place.

495
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,820
He must have eaten there.

496
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,900
Go and report to Chief Zhao.

497
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,620
He's our suspect.

498
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,580
Go.

499
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,180
Chief Zhao.

500
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,820
Captain Lin asked me to report to you.

501
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,980
They're very close.

502
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,900
He must have eaten there.

503
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,820
Thank you.

504
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,660
They must have eaten together on the same street.

505
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,460
In the trash can in Zhang Haoyang's office,

506
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,700
there's a tablecloth from the English house.

507
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,260
It could be a delivery.

508
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,220
Lin.

509
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,460
Sorry to bother you.

510
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,180
We've checked the line

511
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,140
of the high-speed train.

512
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,980
You've checked Zhang Haoyang's location.

513
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,100
Keep checking.

514
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,540
Don't interfere with each other.

515
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,580
I'll bring you the doll.

516
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,980
Otherwise, it's just a job for two people.

517
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,260
Help her.

518
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,820
Hai.

519
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,740
Let's go to Auntie's house.

520
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,500
There's something delicious and fun.

521
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,860
Something delicious and fun.

522
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,540
Don't eat this.

523
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Let's go to Auntie's house.

524
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,940
Hai, let's go with Auntie.

525
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,820
Let's go.

526
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,500
Something delicious and fun.

527
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,300
Let's go.

528
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,700
Let's go.

529
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,660
Let's go.

530
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,780
Hai, let's go.

531
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,660
Let's go.

532
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,700
Hai, let's go.

533
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,740
Hai, let's go.

534
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,620
Let's go.

535
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,900
Let's go.

536
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,620
Don't move.

537
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,900
I'm almost there.

538
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,100
Xiaozhou's case has not been solved yet.

539
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,540
The murderer has not been caught.

540
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,980
He's still in the mood for business.

541
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,980
People want to eat and have fun.

542
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,580
Xiaozhou is gone.

543
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,580
I can't eat anything.

544
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,740
He just left for a few days

545
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,740
I just want to be at home

546
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,020
Can you think of him gently?

547
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
Are we all dying of hunger?

548
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,740
Why are you so eager to take this boat?

549
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,460
Old Zheng, what are you doing?

550
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,660
Are you crazy?

551
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,980
I'm crazy

552
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,180
Are you crazy?

553
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,860
This old Zheng

554
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,940
is very sad

555
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,820
It's good to kill him

556
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,700
Thank you

557
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,620
I won't do business today

558
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,700
Let's go back

559
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,420
Thank you

560
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,260
Let's go

561
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,460
When was the last time you met Shen Xiaozhou?

562
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,060
It was the day she was in trouble

563
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,020
That afternoon

564
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,660
I said I could send her off

565
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,060
She said no need to send

566
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,860
We broke up

567
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,500
You want to get closer to her

568
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,820
She doesn't agree

569
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,940
I'm not good enough

570
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,100
I don't have a goal

571
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,780
Xiaozhou won't fall for someone like me

572
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,940
Shen Xiaozhou

573
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,620
From the class class

574
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,940
To the university entrance to take a taxi

575
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,380
There are 25 to 30 minutes in the middle

576
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,900
According to normal steps

577
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,060
From the class to the university entrance

578
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
It takes at most ten minutes

579
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,300
At least 15 minutes

580
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,060
Didn't you talk to Zhang Haoyang?

581
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
She wants to send

582
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,580
Xiaozhou doesn't know what to send

583
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,860
Fifteen minutes

584
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,380
Can say a lot

585
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,500
Can say a lot

586
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,300
This is the way from the class to the university entrance

587
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,340
On this route

588
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,700
After three o'clock in the afternoon on June 19

589
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,580
All the surveillance videos are transferred

590
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,540
How many times?

591
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
Twenty-three

592
00:25:44,180 --> 00:26:06,540
No

593
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,580
No

594
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,340
What do you think it will be?

595
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,560
I twenty to utilise calligraphy.

596
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,640
Er.

597
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,640
safari's

598
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,560
Its not something human

599
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,500
roickt

600
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,500
Kick

601
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,840
I will

602
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,660
talking about

603
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,700
how appear

604
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,520
with

605
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,460
Is it

606
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,320
helpful

607
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,560
But

608
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,480
but

609
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,500
But

610
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,300
I'm leaving.

611
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,580
Captain Lian, I found it.

612
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,580
Captain Lian.

613
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,300
On the afternoon of the 19th,

614
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,260
at 4.09,

615
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,740
Shen Xiaozhou passed by this way.

616
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,500
Then he disappeared on this road.

617
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,860
At 4.12,

618
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,060
Zhang Haoyang's car

619
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,620
also passed by this intersection.

620
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,860
Next up is this video.

621
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,660
Zhang Haoyang's car

622
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,820
passed by this intersection

623
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,300
at 4.16,

624
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,620
and he got off the car.

625
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,580
He was worried about how to get out.

626
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,420
At this time,

627
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,540
Zhang Haoyang's car appeared.

628
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
Will he get into

629
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,420
Zhang Haoyang's car?

630
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,660
You are a man.

631
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,540
You two can go in.

632
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,420
You are a god.

633
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,900
You can.

634
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,540
My president,

635
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,580
you can treat me gently.

636
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,100
But you can't give up.

637
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,300
You are a god.

638
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,020
You should be more energetic.

639
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,580
He is training his son

640
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,980
to be a card player.

641
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,900
Wait.

642
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,180
I'll give you the money.

643
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,580
Do whatever you want.

644
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,860
We are Chang'an.

645
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,020
We don't need to wait for him to finish training.

646
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,300
Listen.

647
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,340
Let's see how Zhang Haoyang

648
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,220
treats them.

649
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,140
Take it.

650
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,780
If you have any trouble,

651
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,380
I'll help you clean up.

652
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,300
If you have a problem,

653
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,700
I'll help you clean up.

654
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,380
Why are they all like this?

655
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,460
It doesn't matter if you should be in charge or not.

656
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,340
They all are like this.

657
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,460
You are a loser.

658
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,860
You are a loser.

659
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,860
Can you be a little more productive?

660
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,340
Who are you?

661
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,340
We are police.

662
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
There is a case

663
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,860
that wants to invite Zhang Haoyang

664
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,420
to help investigate in the bureau.

665
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,300
What's the matter?

666
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,380
Can't you ask here?

667
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,780
It's a case of law.

668
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,180
Wait for me to confirm with the bureau.

669
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,060
We don't have a bureau chief named Li.

670
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,180
It's urgent.

671
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,940
No need.

672
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
I'll go with you.

673
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,140
Stop.

674
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,460
Please wait.

675
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,780
I have something

676
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,940
to tell you.

677
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,740
Zhang Haoyang

678
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,820
has a congenital concussion.

679
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,620
Please pay attention to the concussion when you ask.

680
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,940
Don't make him too excited.

681
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,220
If possible,

682
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,300
I'll wait for you

683
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,500
at any time.

684
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,140
Please.

685
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,340
We won't be more excited than your concussion.

686
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,540
I asked you here today

687
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,260
to find out

688
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,540
the situation

689
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,860
when you met Shen Xiaorou

690
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,260
on the afternoon of June 19th.

691
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,060
From the beginning to the end,

692
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,060
what did you say?

693
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,940
What are the reactions of the two of you?

694
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,260
Complete the count.

695
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,900
Don't be suspicious.

696
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,140
Let's play a movie.

697
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,100
You dub it.

698
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,220
Okay.

699
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,380
What did Shen Xiaorou tell you?

700
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,140
You look so angry.

701
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,660
She hurt your pride.

702
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,540
Did she say something

703
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,300
worse than your father?

704
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,620
She must be angry.

705
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,340
No.

706
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,060
I'm not angry.

707
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
It's just

708
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,620
I talked to her about

709
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,060
the competition.

710
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,500
Then,

711
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,420
we started again.

712
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,260
But she thinks

713
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,860
it's better not to meet her.

714
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,380
I'm

715
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,180
quite desperate.

716
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,020
I'm quite excited.

717
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,700
You're very excited, right?

718
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,140
You're so excited

719
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,980
that you don't want to live anymore?

720
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,900
Does Shen Xiaorou

721
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,380
know you're sick?

722
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
She knows.

723
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,340
Is that why

724
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,260
she doesn't want to accept you?

725
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,580
If it wasn't for this,

726
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,380
she probably wouldn't have cared about me.

727
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,820
Is Shen Xiaorou

728
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,540
so important to you?

729
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,780
She's my spiritual pillar.

730
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,900
You heard

731
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,620
what my father said to me.

732
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,380
He thinks I'm a loser.

733
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,460
He's right.

734
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,540
I have nothing to say against him.

735
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,580
I really don't know what I want to do.

736
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,460
Only Xiaozhou

737
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,700
has been encouraging me

738
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,460
to try different ways.

739
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,780
Xiaozhou is gone now.

740
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,220
It doesn't matter what path I choose.

741
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,420
After you and Shen Xiaorou

742
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,860
separated that afternoon,

743
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,940
what path did you choose?

744
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,460
What path?

745
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,340
The way home?

746
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,540
You chose the same path as her.

747
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,140
Have you been following her?

748
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,260
How is that possible?

749
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,940
I don't even know where she's going.

750
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,780
Shen Xiaorou is

751
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,180
missing from these two paths.

752
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,380
Did she get in your car?

753
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,980
No.

754
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,380
You mean

755
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,180
I could have picked her up?

756
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,300
Shen Xiaorou.

757
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,460
Who is she?

758
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,500
I got nothing to say against her.

759
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,940
hl

760
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,700
Hannibal.

761
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
He would know

762
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,460
her clothes.

763
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,380
Maybe it would be my fault for life.

764
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,580
She's not Han so how can I getV There's one person

765
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,020
I want to evil like her.

766
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,760
,

767
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,580
His car?

768
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,020
His car, his residence, his office,

769
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,380
and all the other places.

770
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,460
There's a movement.

771
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,060
This is the head of the automatic payment

772
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,420
of the Jinwu Road Construction Bank.

773
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,020
Is the proof Sha Hongli?

774
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,860
Well...

775
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
I can't recognize it.

776
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,780
But

777
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,740
the bank's gate

778
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,060
found the car of Sha Hongli.

779
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,780
It's easy to get caught.

780
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,740
Just forget it.

781
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,300
Work overtime and add points.

782
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,140
Find him at the fastest speed.

783
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,180
Work overtime and catch him.

784
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,900
Let's go.

785
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,540
We have a mission.

786
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,540
Okay.

787
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,420
Wait.

788
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,580
Let him try.

789
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,260
Let him do it.

790
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,020
Kill him.

791
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,260
Just try.

792
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,820
Just try.

793
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,820
Don't.

794
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,620
Just try.

795
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,260
Listen to me.

796
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,140
Try again.

797
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,780
I'll tell you what.

798
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,300
Come on, try.

799
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,620
Tao.

800
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,460
Li.

801
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,780
I've prepared the box.

802
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,260
It's a box.

803
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,460
If it's not enough, I'll send you in.

804
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,380
Enough.

805
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,940
I'm not that good.

806
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,700
I can't get you in the car.

807
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,460
Thank you.

808
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,020
Chen Wei.

809
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,100
Thank you.

810
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,060
How's your business?

811
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,660
It's okay.

812
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,980
I'll go to the car.

813
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,460
Okay.

814
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,580
You're here for the money.

815
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,780
Tao, what's wrong with your waist?

816
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,660
I was moving things the other day.

817
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,380
I didn't have time to work.

818
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,020
I got it flared.

819
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,060
You're a man and you're flared.

820
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,580
You should move heavy things.

821
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,860
By the way, Tao.

822
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,260
I heard that your new wife is a college student.

823
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,660
She didn't graduate from high school.

824
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,020
Why are you so arrogant?

825
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,300
Tell me about it.

826
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,100
What's wrong with college students?

827
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,860
There are many college students in our factory.

828
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,660
Uncle Shang.

829
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,060
Anyway...

830
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,100
Say it.

831
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,300
Have a drink.

832
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,380
It's a bit early.

833
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,580
Tao.

834
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,340
The car can't be put down.

835
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,460
Why don't you pull it first?

836
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,300
Okay.

837
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,020
I'll come back later.

838
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,740
Okay.

839
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,620
Take it easy.

840
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,140
Uncle.

841
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,380
I'm leaving.

842
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,900
I'll wait for you.

843
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,540
Okay.

844
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,180
See you.

845
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,780
See you.

846
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,500
See you.

847
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,020
See you.

848
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,540
See you.

849
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,060
See you.

850
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,540
See you.

851
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,060
See you.

852
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,580
See you.

853
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,060
See you.

854
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,540
See you.

855
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,060
See you.

856
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,540
See you.

857
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,260
See you.

858
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,700
Brother Shen.

859
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,780
Brother Shen.

860
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,180
Shen.

861
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,620
Stop drinking.

862
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,980
Go home.

863
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,060
Shen.

864
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,260
I don't have a home.

865
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,900
Come on.

866
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,900
Drink it.

867
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,220
Brother Shen.

868
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,220
I can't hear you.

869
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,300
You're drunk.

870
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,060
I dare not hear you.

871
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,380
You're looking for trouble now.

872
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,620
Brother Shen.

873
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,220
It's not your fault.

874
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,860
Don't move.
