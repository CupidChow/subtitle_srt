00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
Japan

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,100
ν

3
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,540
dazu

4
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,600
Name

5
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,080
is Pomon

6
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
retro

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm so happy.

8
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you, son.

9
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You don't have time to cook breakfast.

10
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Have some.

11
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is good.

12
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sister Guo said that

13
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you like fish.

14
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I've already fried fish this morning.

15
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know if it's right for her taste.

16
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You made it.

17
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No one doesn't like it.

18
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go out and play today.

19
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You talk to her more.

20
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't be a big boy.

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're so small.

22
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Look.

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Director Li is the second-class director.

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know if she can make it.

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's make friends with her first.

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Uncle can take care of her when she goes to school.

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She needs to study hard.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No need to take care of her.

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Put down your phone.

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You slept at 1.30 last night, right?

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You have to sleep before 12.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I didn't say that.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How do you know?

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You arrived home at 2.30 last night.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Did I say something wrong?

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How do you know?

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're at home and you're wearing a camera.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Get in the car.

40
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You slept for 3-4 hours this morning.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you sleepy?

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm fine.

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Give me a tea cake.

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't eat now.

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have to take pictures and post them on the comments.

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're doing well today.

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're doing well.

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sit tight.

49
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What are you doing?

50
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't care about anything today.

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where is Ning?

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm busy.

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Old Shui, you should go home.

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Morning.

55
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Morning.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Fresh.

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hai, you were a little blind when you were a kid.

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I like to eat.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm going home today.

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Xiao Zhou graduated.

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How much is a kilo?

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
35.

63
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Two for you.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
60.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then...

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll go home.

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm going home.

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm going home.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm going home.

70
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going home.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm going home.

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Then...

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hai, you know sister Teng.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're a good brother.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Come on.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Here.

77
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Take that basket.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Xiao Zhou, are you looking for a job now?

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I found it.

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
A new company.

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Environmental.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Professional.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Xiao Zhou is a high-class student.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And it's 985.

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can earn a lot every month.

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
More than 10,000.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No question.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Our factory.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your family is the best.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Do you want to buy a pair?

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No hurry.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to buy it in the business.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Great.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's fresh.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll take it.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Two kilos.

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's wrong?

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What are you doing?

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is a lot.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Xiao Zhou saved money.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You bought too much.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's not happy.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Give it to me.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
50 yuan.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Give it to Xiao Zhou.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
To celebrate.

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Thank you.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, take it.

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Brother.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is okay.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Give me two.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's broken.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you want it?

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is a truck.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's broken.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What's broken?

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How can two people break it?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll do it.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll send you away.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I bought it.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's pretty.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't lose.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Stop fighting.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Stop fighting.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Did you pay the bill?

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why do you fight?

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This factory doesn't open.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Money doesn't come out.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What to fight?

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't take it out this month.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Guang Zi.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Listen to me.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Take ID card.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Go to the police station and change your name.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's called Guang Zi.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Can you win?

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's called Shun Zi.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tonghua Shun.

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Or...

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Call it Hua Zi.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Call it Hua Zi.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll call you.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll call you grandson, okay?

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Really?

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Take it.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Tell life.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You don't do it.

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're trapped.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,240
I have to take care of this.

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
If I can't go today,

155
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
I'll just let you go.

156
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
What am I?

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,760
He's the director of the teaching department.

158
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
You're an officer after all.

159
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
Come back as soon as you can.

160
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,080
Okay.

161
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't move.

162
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,120
You evil people!

163
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,040
Get lost.

164
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,280
Get lost.

165
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,240
Police.

166
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
Who called the police?

167
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,560
I did.

168
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,960
You're just in time.

169
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,520
Okay, leave it to me.

170
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,320
Let's use words.

171
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,000
Help me out.

172
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,640
Please show your ID.

173
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,960
Why?

174
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,380
urgent progress

175
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,440
No

176
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,700
You're correct

177
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,620
I'm a master

178
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,200
i agree

179
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:28,740
Raise

180
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,860
Too dark

181
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,700
Okay, press it

182
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,700
I sold it

183
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,840
Your dad will definitely be worried about something.

184
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,400
He won't need to go.

185
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
He didn't think about me.

186
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,080
Of course not.

187
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,200
He doesn't like to beg.

188
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,480
He doesn't know how to chat.

189
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
He's just talking about social obstacles.

190
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
How can you be a cop when you talk about social obstacles?

191
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,800
He forgets about the obstacles when he works.

192
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,160
You.

193
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,480
Dad.

194
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,200
Is there a traffic record?

195
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,120
No.

196
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,200
Are you not afraid of collision?

197
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,120
This is not a collision.

198
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,400
This is a two-time crash.

199
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,560
It was the first time

200
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,360
that you could not stop the car when the speed was too fast.

201
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,520
You turned left.

202
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
So there is a crack on the right side of the car.

203
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,920
At that time, your speed was at least 90 miles per hour.

204
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,920
No one dared to touch the word.

205
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,640
The second crash was after you stopped the car,

206
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,360
you turned back immediately

207
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,760
and hit the car again.

208
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,480
This is a virtual crash.

209
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,920
You said it one by one.

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,880
You said it was a crash.

211
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,240
I said it was a collision.

212
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't help it.

213
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I can't help it.

214
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,760
I can't help it.

215
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
Call the police later.

216
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I have something to do.

217
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,960
Don't do it.

218
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,840
I'm now

219
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,160
warning you.

220
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,760
If you resist,

221
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,880
I will take force.

222
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
I'm warning you.

223
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Second warning.

224
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
There are so many cameras now.

225
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,320
How do you think you can force me?

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,240
Third warning.

227
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
Third warning.

228
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,000
Fourth warning.

229
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,160
Fifth warning.

230
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,280
She was happy.

231
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,560
Fourth warning.

232
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,920
Fifth warning.

233
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Seventh warning.

234
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,160
I have told you,

235
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
it's evil director movies

236
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,360
and they bring me so many clues.

237
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,480
Act like it's connected to

238
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,120
other things.

239
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,160
Teacher Lin,

240
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,760
if we continue toessment the video,

241
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
we might find that

242
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:59,520
It's hard to follow someone at a House of

243
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm not in a bad mood

244
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,200
You mean you think you're bad

245
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,680
I think okay

246
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,320
what

247
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,480
people

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,440
Our king's Cool Man

249
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,240
Ivad by the top

250
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,120
Don't fall

251
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,240
Don't fall

252
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,040
Don't fall

253
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,160
Don't fall

254
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Stop!

255
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Stop!

256
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Stop!

257
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
What are you looking at?

258
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Hurry up!

259
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
You walked and he flew down.

260
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
I didn't scare him.

261
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
He flew down and I walked this way.

262
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
That's not how you walk.

263
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Right?

264
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
He came up with his horse.

265
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Stop!

266
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
Stop!

267
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
What are you doing?

268
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Stop!

269
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Stop!

270
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Stop!

271
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Stop!

272
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Stop!

273
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Get out!

274
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Don't come back!

275
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Stop!

276
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
What are you doing?

277
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Stop!

278
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Stop!

279
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Stop!

280
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
It's okay.

281
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
It's okay.

282
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
It's okay.

283
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
It's okay.

284
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
It's okay.

285
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
It's okay, Hai.

286
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
It's okay.

287
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Sit down.

288
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
It's okay.

289
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
It's okay.

290
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
It's okay.

291
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
You...

292
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Sit down.

293
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Sit down.

294
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Come on.

295
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
I'll tell you a story.

296
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
I'll tell you a story.

297
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Come on.

298
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Listen to the story.

299
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
I'll tell you a story.

300
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Listen.

301
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Your sister will be back soon.

302
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Wait for her here.

303
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
I'm going to cook.

304
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Good boy.

305
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
These are for the school tour.

306
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Yes.

307
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
I like them.

308
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
Now I really like them.

309
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Have a taste.

310
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Since all these days,

311
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
I've defeated you.

312
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
We still have something very important.

313
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Yes.

314
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
There's a prize from the hospital.

315
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Now your mom will Free China.

316
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,340
shouting

317
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,100
ambulance

318
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,500
the shower

319
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,460
needs to keep the steam

320
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,060
if leaving

321
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,260
how can it invite instant death

322
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
what a coincidence

323
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,480
no other option

324
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Yan Shou

325
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
It's him

326
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Where's Hai?

327
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Where's Hai?

328
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
He's not in the room

329
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Can you leave?

330
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I have to make a note

331
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm afraid today

332
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
You have to adjust the seat

333
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
OK

334
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Master Wen

335
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Did you see Hai?

336
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
No

337
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
No

338
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Thanks

339
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
What's wrong today?

340
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
This

341
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
I just said that

342
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,120
that a group of people

343
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
must have scared Xiaohua.

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,160
She is usually frightened.

345
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,080
She is always in the room.

346
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,240
How did she get out today?

347
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
I should have given her some medicine just now.

348
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,840
Come on, lean back.

349
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,520
Wang Yu, don't touch it.

350
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,520
Come on.

351
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,280
Slowly, come on.

352
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,880
Lean back.

353
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,720
Wang Yu, don't touch it.

354
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,600
Come on.

355
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,280
How are you?

356
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Come on, slowly.

357
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,920
Don't cry.

358
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,320
Call your brother-in-law.

359
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,880
Don't cough.

360
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,720
Aunt Zhang,

361
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,320
did you see our Xiaohai?

362
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,760
Xiaohai didn't see him.

363
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,840
Didn't he go for a walk with them?

364
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,360
Which way did those people go just now?

365
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
I guess they went to the prison.

366
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,680
Don't call.

367
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
I'll tell him.

368
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,120
This is...

369
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
This is...

370
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,760
This is...

371
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,240
This is a flight carrier.

372
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,720
Where did he go?

373
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Have you thought it over?

374
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,560
I know who you are after.

375
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,440
Isn't it because I drove a sports car?

376
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,200
Is there a punishment for driving a sports car?

377
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
You think too much.

378
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,760
No matter what car you drive,

379
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
you can't drive a sports car.

380
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
You can't drive a sports car.

381
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,840
You can't drive a sports car.

382
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,080
You can't drive a sports car.

383
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,800
No matter what car you drive,

384
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,960
as long as the accident you told me

385
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,080
can match the traces of the scene,

386
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
it's fine.

387
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,200
I'm hurt.

388
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,160
Is this a violent law?

389
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,240
No.

390
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
It's a standard law.

391
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,960
I'll do a physical examination.

392
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,800
Okay.

393
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Wait a minute.

394
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,560
Captain Lian.

395
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Captain Lian Hai Ping.

396
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
I'm the agent

397
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,760
you just brought back.

398
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
Let's find a convenient place to talk.

399
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,680
Let's talk here.

400
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,760
This accident,

401
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
the camera didn't capture it.

402
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,320
There's no video evidence.

403
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,280
In fact, it's a political test.

404
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,240
To put it bluntly, it's your statement.

405
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,920
And the victim's statement.

406
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
Yes.

407
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,720
It's mainly yours.

408
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
So,

409
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,360
you can't take the blame.

410
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,560
You can't take the blame.

411
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,640
You can't take the blame.

412
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
You can't take the blame.

413
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
You can't take the blame.

414
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Captain Lian.

415
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,040
This is a big and small matter.

416
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Wait.

417
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,720
Since we've mentioned the case,

418
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
let's

419
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
make a record.

420
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Shen.

421
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,360
Hai bit me.

422
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,640
Where did you meet him?

423
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,240
He was walking over there.

424
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
He was blabbering

425
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,360
and asked to pick up his sister.

426
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,320
When I called him,

427
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
he was anxious.

428
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Thank you.

429
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Hai.

430
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Hai.

431
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Hai.

432
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,720
You...

433
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,160
Hai.

434
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,240
You didn't tell us

435
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
that you were anxious.

436
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Hai.

437
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,840
The last month has arrived.

438
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Slowly come down.

439
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,640
Hai.

440
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,280
Hai.

441
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,200
No rush.

442
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,480
They'll wait a moment.

443
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,560
Wait for the next class.

444
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,260
Next class.

445
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,360
I'll send you directly to go to the hospital.

446
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,860
They compensation you a lot.

447
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,760
Let's go.

448
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,160
Lin.

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,440
Aren't you on vacation?

450
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
I ran into some problems.

451
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,760
So I decided to leave the house quickly.

452
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,440
L Italian.

453
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Yes.

454
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Sorry.

455
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,640
It's a random call.

456
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I'll take it.

457
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Give him a hug.

458
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Hurry up.

459
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,480
Forget it. Let's go.

460
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Yes.

461
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Huo Qing.

462
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,480
Here. Wipe it.

463
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,040
Officer.

464
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,040
These shoes are imported from Italy.

465
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
I'll take 200.

466
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
It's okay.

467
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,760
It's just a pair of shoes.

468
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
Throw it away if it's dirty.

469
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,560
Don't mess with me.

470
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Everyone.

471
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Captain.

472
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Hai Bing.

473
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Come with me.

474
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
The frame is not fixed.

475
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Come on.

476
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Shi Xiangfeng.

477
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I'm here to report.

478
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,320
If I remember correctly,

479
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,280
it's the second squad, right?

480
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,040
Yes.

481
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,840
Second squad.

482
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
The main squad.

483
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,640
Zhao went to chase the escape with the second squad.

484
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,400
I'll go with you to the third squad first.

485
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,120
You have to go now.

486
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,920
We just received the report.

487
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,600
Someone in the gas factory made trouble.

488
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
He deliberately hurt people.

489
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,280
The injured have been sent to the hospital.

490
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
They are being rescued.

491
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,400
The suspect escaped to the old factory.

492
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,680
The crowd is surrounded.

493
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
You go.

494
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,680
Is the third squad the main squad?

495
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,160
Part of the main squad is in Hai Bing's hands.

496
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Go.

497
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,960
Comfortable.

498
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,080
You look like a dog.

499
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,880
You go on a blind date after work.

500
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
I'll take a look at the photos.

501
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:31,080
I'll give you a

502
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
First day.

503
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Get the key first.

504
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,760
The car is about to leave.

505
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,080
Please be careful.

506
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,400
Please be careful.

507
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
Welcome to the train.

508
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
The train will depart soon.

509
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,920
Please get on the train.

510
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,320
The train will depart soon.

511
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,200
The train will depart soon.

512
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,720
Please get on the train.

513
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,280
The train will depart soon.

514
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Stop waiting, right?

515
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,040
It's time to go home and cook.

516
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,280
Hello.

517
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,160
The user you dialed is power off.

518
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,560
It's power off.

519
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,440
Did we not meet Xiao Zhou

520
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,600
when we came out?

521
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
Did he go home alone?

522
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,640
Hai.

523
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,040
Hello.

524
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,080
The user you dialed is power off.

525
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,560
It's still power off.

526
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,080
The user you dialed is power off.

527
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,880
How about calling Yue Chun Xia?

528
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,360
Okay.

529
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,000
Hello.

530
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,240
Chun Xia.

531
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
It's Uncle Shen.

532
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,280
Is Xiao Zhou still at school?

533
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
His phone is power off.

534
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,800
Okay.

535
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,360
Okay.

536
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Okay, thank you.

537
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,920
Chun Xia said

538
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,200
Xiao Zhou didn't go back to the dormitory last night.

539
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,600
Then...

540
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,120
Why don't you go to the school?

541
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,480
Yes.

542
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,640
I'll go and have a look.

543
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,920
Look at Yue Chun Xia.

544
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,560
Don't tell her about her father.

545
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,800
Mr. Yue won't allow it.

546
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,000
Mr. Yue won't allow it.

547
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,040
Stop!

548
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Stop!

549
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Stop!

550
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Stop!

551
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Stop!

552
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Stop!

553
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Stop!

554
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Stop!

555
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Stop!

556
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,040
This time, the captain, Yue Hong Bin, was hit.

557
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
The specific situation is unknown.

558
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Stop!

559
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,040
The school's factory used to be a chemical factory.

560
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Later, it was changed to a chemical factory.

561
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,600
The liberation was always

562
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
the beginning of our city.

563
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,840
But now it's changed.

564
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,840
It's changed to a company.

565
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
People don't like to call it a chemical factory.

566
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,240
They call the factory director.

567
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,640
They say it's close.

568
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,640
There are tens of thousands of workers and their families.

569
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,040
Drive slowly.

570
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Not all cars know to let the police.

571
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,040
A few years ago, the factory was shut down.

572
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Many workers were working.

573
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,040
The old city area was waiting for the demolition and renovation.

574
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Stop!

575
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
I'll take the road.

576
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Listen, if you drive like this, the police will scold you.

577
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Stop at the back.

578
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Stop.

579
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Xiao Qi, you drive.

580
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
No problem.

581
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:36,740
Don't even Veterans'

582
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Get in.

583
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,040
Uncle...

584
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Is Xiao Zhou back?

585
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
Mr. Shan.

586
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,280
Chen Cody.

587
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,300
Uncle Shen.

588
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,400
He didn't come back last night?

589
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,080
No.

590
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,520
Had you seen Shizuó of Black Cat Club before?

591
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,360
No.

592
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,060
No.

593
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,480
They asked everyone in our lasts department before,

594
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,960
never saw him.

595
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,000
Then I'll go back first.

596
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Let's not report it to the police.

597
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Move aside.

598
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,440
Move aside.

599
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Calm down.

600
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,000
Hurry.

601
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,440
Don't come over.

602
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,040
Don't come over.

603
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,560
Do you hear me?

604
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,680
Don't come over.

605
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,440
Don't act rashly.

606
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,000
Calm down.

607
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,840
Calm down.

608
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay.

609
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,520
I won't run today.

610
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
I chased you for a day and you still chase me.

611
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,720
It's an old water treatment station.

612
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,760
What's wrong with me?

613
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,120
What's wrong with me?

614
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,400
What are you?

615
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,440
We don't understand.

616
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
Luo is a hero.

617
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,760
He's our big hero.

618
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,640
He, Yue Hongming,

619
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
sold the first batch of their products to the developers.

620
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,320
We need to pay a high price

621
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,760
to buy a house.

622
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,880
How much does he know?

623
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,600
He's a human.

624
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,000
I said he's a human.

625
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,240
He can't be the factory manager.

626
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Guang Zi, come down.

627
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,280
The power is all over the place.

628
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,400
You go down.

629
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,840
The bones are all gone.

630
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,520
Come down.

631
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,760
What's in the pond?

632
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,080
It's not as scary as he said.

633
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,280
This is the last power plant of Wushui.

634
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,440
The waste water

635
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,120
has reached the standard of the sea.

636
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,920
It's not good to drink directly.

637
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,520
But it's not poisonous.

638
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,320
Besides, it's been in the sky for years.

639
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,280
In addition to the rain and the flood,

640
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,520
it has been washed away.

641
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,920
It's okay.

642
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,800
The waste water is in the sea.

643
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,840
If it's washed away,

644
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,880
it's over.

645
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,840
Come down.

646
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,120
Sir, he's lying.

647
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,000
Everyone, listen up.

648
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,880
The wind blows the water away.

649
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,560
The war is over.

650
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,280
The army is dying.

651
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,160
Come on.

652
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,120
I'll die.

653
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,200
I'll go back from the back.

654
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,160
The war is over.

655
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,360
I'll go back.

656
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,920
I'm a hero.

657
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm a big man.

658
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,920
Where is Guang Zi's family?

659
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,400
There's a mother in his family.

660
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,640
It's not convenient to walk.

661
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,600
I don't think he knows about this.

662
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,760
I'll get my mother here.

663
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,200
Don't come back.

664
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
Don't take me away.

665
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,120
Guang Zi.

666
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,760
I'm a policeman.

667
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,200
Who do you love?

668
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,480
Listen to me.

669
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,160
Mr. Yue is in the hospital now.

670
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,560
There's no life-threatening danger.

671
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,600
Put down your things.

672
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
You come here first.

673
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,240
I tell you, Guang Zi.

674
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,320
You haven't made any big mistakes

675
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,240
so far.

676
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,680
You're so far from the dead end.

677
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,200
So many people are watching.

678
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,520
I don't care how many wars you have.

679
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,200
I'm a big hero now.

680
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,840
I understand.

681
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Hurry up.

682
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,960
Go.

683
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
Hurry up.

684
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,520
Be careful.

685
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,440
Be careful.

686
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Be careful.

687
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,560
Back up.

688
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,000
Brother.

689
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,160
Brother.

690
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,040
Give me your hand.

691
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,720
Come on.

692
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,360
Don't move.

693
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,120
Don't move.

694
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,280
Don't let the water fall.

695
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,960
Get up.

696
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,760
Come with us.

697
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,320
There's someone under the water.

698
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,560
There's someone.

699
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,680
Don't worry.

700
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,400
Maybe he's missing.

701
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,680
Most of the time,

702
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
he'll be back in one day.

703
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,880
His classmates and teachers

704
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,800
didn't see him yesterday afternoon.

705
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,120
My daughter is very sensible.

706
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,320
She never says hello to me.

707
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,600
Wait a minute.

708
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,880
I'll sort out the situation

709
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,440
and report it to the person in charge.

710
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,360
Okay.

711
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,160
What's under the water?

712
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
You saw it.

713
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
I didn't notice.

714
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,320
Let's go back and have a look.

715
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,400
You're hurt.

716
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
What?

717
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,040
It's okay.

718
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,360
It's just a small wound.

719
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Don't get down.

720
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
It's really okay.

721
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,840
I'll go and deal with the wound first.

722
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,880
No need.

723
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Let's go and have a look.

724
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Come back.

725
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm responsible for your safety.

726
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I'll go.

727
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
I'll go.

728
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
I'll go.

729
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
It's over.

730
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Let's go.

731
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Let's go.

732
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Let's go.

733
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
The one above, come down.

734
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
The car is coming.

735
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,400
Is there something under the water?

736
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
No, there's nothing.

737
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Let's go.

738
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Let's go.

739
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
