1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Att Marie

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Fried Chicken Breast.

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,520
Mom.

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,880
Come on.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
Xiaozhou, you're back.

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,560
I'll cook for you.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Mom, come out.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,680
What's this?

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,920
Isn't it broken?

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,640
It's new.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Why did you buy it?

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,160
It's a waste of money.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,640
It's not a waste.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Look at your hands.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,480
They're all washed.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,520
You can use it to wash them.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,480
Listen to me.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,320
Xiaozhou.

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,880
How much did you buy it?

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,560
I don't know.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
Your daughter can afford it.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,880
Look at you.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,440
Just study hard.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
You don't have to make money.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,080
I know.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Mom, try it.

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,200
Press start after you get the mixture.

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,360
I'll press it now.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,000
Right.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,440
Come on.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,520
Kid.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,800
Come on.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,760
It's broken again.

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,280
It's broken again.

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,800
Come on.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,280
Come on.

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,480
Come on.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,280
You can't pay me back.

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,960
Put me in change.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,600
What?

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm worried

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
that my little brother

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,320
will always live in evil.

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Xalu,

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,480
don't worry.

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
I'll still take you to him

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,600
but it worth more.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,760
But let alone Dongshan,

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,640
there's no return

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
from Dongshan.

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,320
Darwin and Leonardo

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,440
are dangerous to children.

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,680
They always wish their

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,760
children to become the heroes.

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,760
I'll turn on the light.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,940
And turn your Southwestern Betty off.

57
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,580
Who said that?

58
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,840
If you chase after her,

59
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,040
we're in the wrong.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,720
Then we're in trouble.

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,080
What are we going to do?

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,320
And when can you fortunately face the zombie after this?

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,960
Women shouldn't be brought here...

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,120
From Li Wrong

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,600
One wear made accident.

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,840
advisor?

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,320
Rang.

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
there was a blue warehouse committed in Ping Ning zone.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Last July,

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,360
the victim is very similar to Sheng He Zhe.

71
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
I think

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,240
it's possible the murderer is the one.

73
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,480
Last July,

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,940
a victim from the Ping Ning Zone

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
is called Jin Yuan.

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
Yes.

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
The wearer is......

78
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,160
Imprisonment and physical cantidad

79
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,920
to pay the criminal price

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
He died of heart failure.

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
He didn't have a heart attack or a fracture.

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Did you participate in that case?

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
No.

84
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Then why are you so anxious?

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I know all the cases that haven't been solved.

86
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
There's nothing wrong with it.

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Then I'll continue to investigate tonight.

88
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Don't be anxious after the case is solved.

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Solving cases is not a process that can be solved in one go.

90
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,960
It depends on patience, not on passion.

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm a warm-hearted person.

92
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
I can't be cold-blooded.

93
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
uity

94
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,960
I'll sit here.

95
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
OK.

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Go on.

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Listen to music.

98
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
desde fir lah

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Open the door well

100
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Quickly open

101
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I want to large

102
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Often get up and go to bed

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Hurry up needles

104
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Wait wait

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,920
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,320
When was Shen Xiaozhou last time she came back?

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,520
Last Sunday.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
What happened when she came back?

109
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,280
Nothing.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
She comes back every week

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
to help us.

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,440
Hai misses her sister too.

113
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
He asked her a few days ago.

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,160
Speaking of which,

115
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,920
she's her sister,

116
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,200
and she's her sister.

117
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,080
Did Shen Xiaozhou

118
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,160
give her family money?

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,640
Yes.

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,760
I asked her to keep the flowers.

121
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,080
She bought the washing machine.

122
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,880
Where did she get the money from?

123
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,080
She used to go out to work

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,320
and do housework.

125
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,680
Did she ever bring money?

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,160
Bring money?

127
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
No.

128
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
She's careful with her spending.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,080
She can save money.

130
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,480
How's your relationship with your neighbors?

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Did you have any conflicts

132
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,400
or offend anyone?

133
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,440
No.

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,080
Our neighbors are all good.

135
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Did Shen Xiaozhou tell you

136
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,080
about her worries at school?

137
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,200
She only said good things.

138
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Then why did she bring money?

139
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,400
Have you seen this girl?

140
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,920
Her name is Wang Yishan.

141
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,480
Has Shen Xiaozhou

142
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,160
mentioned that name before?

143
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,120
Is she Xiaozhou's classmate?

144
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
No.

145
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Okay.

146
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
He doesn't like to clean up.

147
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
He doesn't let me clean up either.

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
He said he couldn't find anything when he cleaned up.

149
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
He's useless and environmentalist.

150
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
That's how Xiaozhou is.

151
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
He can do whatever he wants.

152
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Did he have a boyfriend when he was young?

153
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
No.

154
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
He didn't say he did.

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
No.

156
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Does he have a computer?

157
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Yes.

158
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
He didn't bring it back.

159
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
What kind of computer?

160
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
It's...

161
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
It's like that.

162
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Okay.

163
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Okay. I got it.

164
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
I checked the office.

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,320
It's not a phone number or a social account.

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I don't know what it is.

167
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,320
I guess it's a password for a network account.

168
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
There are too many registrations.

169
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
I can't remember.

170
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
There's dust on the paper.

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
He Ming has been there for a while.

172
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
It has nothing to do with his death.

173
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Maybe.

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Shen Xiaozhou was supposed to go home on the 20th.

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Why did he show up at the police station at night?

176
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
He didn't come back by himself.

177
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,320
He could have been moved to another place.

178
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
If he wasn't killed here,

179
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
why would he come here to do something?

180
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I think he's the kind of murderer who chooses his target randomly.

181
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
He used a saw to cut off his feet.

182
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
That's a pervert.

183
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
He's not a big fan of the police.

184
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Shen Xiaozhou was hit by a murderer near the police station.

185
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
It was a deserted place with no one.

186
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
It's a perfect place for a crime.

187
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Go to the south of the city

188
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
under his time line.

189
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Police,

190
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
can you tell me how Xiaozhou died?

191
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Did Shen Xiaozhou die and go into the water?

192
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
There's gunshot in his lungs.

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
It means he had a stroke under the water.

194
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
It might be short-lived.

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
But he was too weak.

196
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
He didn't swim up to the sea.

197
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
It hurts.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
I'm going crazy if I keep stepping on it.

199
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
It doesn't hurt.

200
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
He's unconscious.

201
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
It doesn't hurt.

202
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
It doesn't hurt.

203
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
It doesn't hurt.

204
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,960
He然後要再洗衣匙

205
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Hope it'll just be for the sacrifice of a tiny HP%

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Shen Xiao Zhou's father

207
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I love my daughter.

208
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
As a father,

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
I don't love my daughter.

210
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
That's not necessarily the case.

211
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,920
I was a tutor in the third year.

212
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,280
Shen Xiaozhou is the best student I've ever seen.

213
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
It's really amazing.

214
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Yue Chunxia.

215
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
These two are police officers.

216
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Police officers?

217
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,440
Have you found Xiaozhou?

218
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,920
Is this Shen Xiaozhou's?

219
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,840
Yes.

220
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,920
Chunxia, come out.

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you have a computer?

222
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
I'll look for it.

223
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,040
No.

224
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,840
No.

225
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
You're not an environmental expert?

226
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,640
No.

227
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,920
I'm a business manager.

228
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,520
Do you know if Shen Xiaozhou has borrowed

229
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,360
school loans?

230
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,600
No.

231
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,240
Why would he borrow money?

232
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,760
Xiaozhou doesn't usually spend much.

233
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,840
When was the last time you saw Shen Xiaozhou?

234
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,760
That day.

235
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,280
On the 19th.

236
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,800
When I left home this morning,

237
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,720
he was still tidying up his luggage.

238
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,840
What time?

239
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,800
Around 8.30.

240
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,800
He was found in the fire station.

241
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,120
But...

242
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,440
But he said he would only be home on the 20th.

243
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,640
Your father is Yue Hongbin, right?

244
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,640
If your father hadn't been beheaded,

245
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,120
we wouldn't have found him.

246
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
What happened to my father?

247
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,840
It's holiday.

248
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
Many students are home.

249
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,360
Actually, Shen Xiaozhou's father came yesterday

250
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
and made a phone call.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,560
We can only ask him now.

252
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
Maybe on the 19th,

253
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,040
someone else saw him.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
I saw Shen Xiaozhou on the 19th.

255
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,640
Chen Hui, you're here.

256
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,720
Chen Hui and Shen Xiaozhou are in the same class.

257
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,280
They are the best students.

258
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
Isn't Shen Xiaozhou the best?

259
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,560
In general, yes.

260
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,160
They are both good at everything.

261
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,800
Sometimes, Chen Hui is better.

262
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,040
When did you

263
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,240
meet Shen Xiaozhou on the 19th?

264
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,120
In the afternoon.

265
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
There's a farewell party at the Environmental Protection Club.

266
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,640
Shen Xiaozhou is the president.

267
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,240
At seven o'clock.

268
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,720
I left early

269
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,680
at half past one.

270
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,440
Do you know when the farewell party ended?

271
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,240
That Haifeng

272
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,680
investigated the meeting five times.

273
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,080
Many students posted videos on their phones the other day.

274
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,200
You can call the young

275
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,320
gather if you need advice.

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Did something happen to Shen Xiaozhou?

277
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,640
to the west gate of the school.

278
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,640
Is there surveillance at the school gate?

279
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,440
Yes.

280
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,960
Besides,

281
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
this student also took a video.

282
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,160
Do you want it?

283
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,120
Send it to me.

284
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,880
Thank you.

285
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,600
Okay.

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Everyone knows that

287
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm the victim of a bloody battle.

288
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,400
Do you remember

289
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,840
the environmental awareness

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,920
that we didn't have

291
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,880
half a century ago?

292
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,120
Is it this gate?

293
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,760
How many gates do you have in the school?

294
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,560
Three.

295
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,920
Is it her?

296
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,320
It's her.

297
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,320
Why does she still know

298
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,560
a friend in the back?

299
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,560
It should be a mobile phone call.

300
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,200
She just checked her phone.

301
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,800
If it's a friend,

302
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,440
she should be in the front row.

303
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,280
Shen Xiaozhou is so tight.

304
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Will she call a car?

305
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,520
Shouldn't she be in a bus?

306
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,160
If she is a real person,

307
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,400
she may call a car

308
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,920
when she is about to be late for the appointment.

309
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Her destination is a key clue.

310
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
I'll send this image to Sui Xiao

311
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,800
and let her handle it.

312
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,920
The mainland

313
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,720
should be able to recognize this license plate number.

314
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,040
Take pictures with a public phone.

315
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,640
Don't use your personal phone.

316
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,400
Tea leaves.

317
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,400
It's very sacred.

318
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,240
Tea leaves.

319
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,200
It's very sacred.

320
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,080
After the image was clearly processed,

321
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,560
one person still couldn't see it clearly.

322
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
I tried all the possibilities.

323
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
The last car I locked

324
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,520
was a fast car from Xuncheng.

325
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,960
I've asked them for the form.

326
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
They rejected it and said they'd give it to me tomorrow.

327
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,000
Blow it again tomorrow.

328
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
This car

329
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,120
will be transferred to the Xuncheng on March 13.

330
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,840
Okay.

331
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,120
Thank you.

332
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,120
Sui Xiao is quite capable.

333
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,240
You're her schoolmate.

334
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,400
She should be a higher rank than you.

335
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,360
I've arrived.

336
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,960
I'll wait for you here.

337
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,040
Okay.

338
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
You should go back.

339
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,640
Okay.

340
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,040
Go.

341
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
You can't stay in bed at night.

342
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
Can you do it yourself?

343
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,480
No problem.

344
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
There's a nurse here.

345
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,520
Okay.

346
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,840
Okay.

347
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,280
Call me if you need anything.

348
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,440
Okay.

349
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
I'll get going, Dr. Tian.

350
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,200
Thank you, thank you.

351
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,960
For you.

352
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,640
Go ahead.

353
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,680
Thanks.

354
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,360
Be careful.

355
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Thanks.

356
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,720
Okay.

357
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,160
I'll do my best.

358
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,840
Okay.

359
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,120
Please come inside.

360
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,980
Don't you forget it

361
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
Awesome

362
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,340
I saw the case of my mother in 1995.

363
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
I knew how she died.

364
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
I finally knew

365
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,380
what kind of person she was.

366
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,140
Her life

367
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
was pretty bad.

368
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,020
Although the case was solved

369
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,340
and the murderer was caught,

370
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
it was just that

371
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,620
she was too young when she died.

372
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,540
I was only four years old that year.

373
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,460
I was too young

374
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
to see her.

375
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,700
And I saw...

376
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
What did you see?

377
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,820
Nothing.

378
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,220
When she died,

379
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,820
she didn't even leave a word to me.

380
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,540
She didn't leave a word.

381
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,020
It doesn't mean she doesn't miss you.

382
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,860
If she sees you like this now,

383
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,020
don't be so happy.

384
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,500
It's a pity she can't see you.

385
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,340
You...

386
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,100
Have you checked your father's whereabouts?

387
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540
No.

388
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,500
Now that technology is so advanced,

389
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,140
if you want to know...

390
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
I don't want to check.

391
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
I don't want to know either.

392
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,340
Throwing a woman aside

393
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,020
must be a bastard.

394
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,900
It doesn't matter.

395
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
What about you?

396
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,900
Tonight,

397
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
I'll stay here.

398
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,460
I'll go to bed alone.

399
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Dad.

400
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Dad.

401
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Dad.

402
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
It's okay.

403
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,620
You'll be discharged soon.

404
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Don't cry.

405
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Don't cry.

406
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
It's okay.

407
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,780
Dad, Xiaozhou.

408
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Xiaozhou is dead.

409
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Xiaozhou is dead.

410
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,740
Look at her.

411
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,900
When you didn't have

412
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,500
any environmental awareness

413
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,300
millions of years ago,

414
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,460
a message with pride

415
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,740
was sung by manager Xu,

416
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,260
the darkness

417
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
is illusioning.

418
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,340
The iron was pork in the sea.

419
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,060
they don't know

420
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,420
that many workers' health

421
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,980
is getting worse.

422
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,900
My brother

423
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,380
is a victim of pollution.

424
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,940
I really hope

425
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,540
he can have a healthy life.

426
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,940
I think

427
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
environmental protection

428
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,620
is a self-saving system.

429
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Everyone knows

430
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,700
that the earth doesn't need us to save it, right?

431
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,620
What we need to save

432
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,860
is ourselves.

433
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,460
And self-saving

434
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,140
is actually to clear

435
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,460
and improve those things

436
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,780
that are corrupting our human ecosystem.

437
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,060
Although our current profession

438
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,900
is considered one of the four major health professions,

439
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I think

440
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,620
the profession we will be in in the future

441
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,700
sometimes I think

442
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,580
is like doctors

443
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,620
or police.

444
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,020
They are saving lives.

445
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,700
We are, too.

446
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,020
We should feel proud of ourselves for it.

447
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,300
And this profession

448
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,180
is worth our life.

449
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,280
Bos creation

450
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

451
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

452
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

453
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

454
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

455
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

456
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

457
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

458
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

459
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

460
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

461
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

462
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

463
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
I'm not sure if I can be your girlfriend.

464
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,460
The wind starts to sway.

465
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,460
I still can't reach it.

466
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,460
The despair of love is gone.

467
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,460
I can't find the answer to your question.

468
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,460
Hope is the weakest fragrance.

469
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,460
The snow is falling.

470
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,460
The wind is getting colder.

471
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,460
The truth is being covered in snow.

472
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
The sound of the water is boiling.

473
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:39,460
Waiting for the rain to stop.

474
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,460
We haven't found the first scene yet.

475
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,460
We've searched the whole place several times.

476
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
There's nothing.

477
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,460
We've got a reply from Xincheng.

478
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,460
On March 13th, Wang Yishan didn't call this car.

479
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Shen Xiaozhou's destination that day was

480
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,460
Lvcheng Environmental Technology Company in the development area.

481
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Lvcheng?

482
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Lvcheng is the company he was supposed to work for.

483
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,460
The car just left halfway, and the trip was cancelled.

484
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
Where's the driver's information?

485
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,460
I've found a bunch of excuses, but I haven't given them yet.

486
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
Shen Xiaozhou's trip was cancelled,

487
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
and he got a call.

488
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
It's 4.05.

489
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
The caller is Yue Chunxia.

490
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
Yue Chunxia?

491
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
He didn't mention this yesterday.

492
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,460
I've checked all the communication records and call records of Shen Xiaozhou.

493
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
There's no contact with Wang Yishan.

494
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
I'll say it.

495
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
It's random.

496
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
Let's go.

497
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,460
Ask Yue Chunxia.

498
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Ask them for the driver's information.

499
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,460
If it doesn't work, ask Captain Feng.

500
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
Okay, I'll ask the director.

501
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,460
I watched Shen Xiaozhou's video yesterday.

502
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,460
I didn't expect that

503
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,460
he had a high evaluation of the police.

504
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
He's a high-ranking officer.

505
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,460
And a doctor.

506
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
Does he think

507
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
he's a hero

508
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
in the 90s?

509
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Do you know the 90s?

510
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,460
The TV series.

511
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,460
No matter what era it is,

512
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,460
as long as the girls who like doctors and the police

513
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
are generally good people.

514
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Why?

515
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Maybe they all hope that the world is better.

516
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Have you seen many girls like this?

517
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Not many.

518
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
When you were a police officer,

519
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
were you popular?

520
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
No.

521
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,460
At that time, you must have a high taste.

522
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
High standards. No requirements.

523
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Are you okay?

524
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
I have a question.

525
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Please recall.

526
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
On the afternoon of June 19th,

527
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
did you and Shen Xiaozhou

528
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
make a phone call?

529
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
Yes, I did.

530
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
Why didn't you say it yesterday?

531
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,460
Did he say anything?

532
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Nothing.

533
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
I asked him where he was.

534
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,460
I wanted to go shopping with him.

535
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
He said he had something to do.

536
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,460
And his phone was about to run out of battery.

537
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,460
He hung up without saying a word.

538
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,460
He didn't say where he was going.

539
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,460
He called a car.

540
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
Why did he suddenly get off the car on the way?

541
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Do you know?

542
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
Yes.

543
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Xiaozhou said he met a rogue driver.

544
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
I found out the driver's information.

545
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,460
His name is Wu Bo.

546
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:21,780
He has a

547
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,460
This is the address of his registration.

548
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,460
Let Lao Zheng and Xiao Qi take people to meet.

549
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,460
I'm enough to catch him.

550
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Catching people is not fighting.

551
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,460
The purpose of fighting is to control people.

552
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
Do you think I will act impulsively

553
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,460
because you saw my file?

554
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,460
The police should try to avoid getting hurt.

555
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Let's rest for a day.

556
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,460
If you get hurt, I won't rest.

557
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,460
The police's responsibility

558
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
is to eliminate the criminal

559
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,460
as much as possible.

560
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,460
Not to make yourself happy.

561
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Personal heroism

562
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,460
is not suitable for the police.

563
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,460
They have been released.

564
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,460
Captain Lian, this is the landlord.

565
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,460
Did you report to Chief Zhao?

566
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,460
Chief Zhao?

567
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,460
They seem to have found

568
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,460
clues about the high-speed train.

569
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
They have to pull out all the clues.

570
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
They have to go.

571
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Where is Wu Bo's car?

572
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,460
I didn't see the red car.

573
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
Is it not at home?

574
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,460
Maybe he parked the car in another place.

575
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Keep both sides of the building.

576
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
Don't get past people first.

577
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
This way.

578
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
This way.

579
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
This way.

580
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
This way.

581
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
This way.

582
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
Ten.

583
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Nine.

584
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
Seven.

585
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
Six.

586
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Nothing.

587
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
What's the smell?

588
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
It stinks.

589
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,460
What's this?

590
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Goldfish meat.

591
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
Lü Bin.

592
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
This guy can make up for it.

593
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,460
How many days has it been put in?

594
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
I haven't been back for a long time.

595
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Less than two days.

596
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,460
The weather is hot and the flowers are blooming fast.

597
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Wu Bo should have left

598
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
the night before.

599
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
This company doesn't check criminal records.

600
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,460
Anyone can be a driver.

601
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,460
They've been running around the world for two years.

602
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,460
They're robbing the market.

603
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
They can turn the wheel.

604
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
They can all be drivers.

605
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
Look.

606
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
They have to be honest in a few years.

607
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
Captain Lin.

608
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
Is this the first scene?

609
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
No.

610
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,460
There's only one footstep on the ground.

611
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Will they be back?

612
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
It's past ten o'clock at night.

613
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
There's an environment around.

614
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
How likely will it be to be found

615
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
if a person is back?

616
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
What about this?

617
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,460
This is a document.

618
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
You can see it on the ground.

619
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
We'll check it.

620
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Okay.

621
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
Let Sui Xiao check

622
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
Shen Xiao Zhou's specific size

623
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
of that notebook and computer.

624
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
It must be exact millimeters.

625
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
Okay.

626
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
There's one more.

627
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:33,900
verdict.

628
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,460
If I can feel the darkness

629
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,460
I will always be in the east

630
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,460
If I can hear the heartbeat

631
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,460
I will always be in the west

632
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,460
How I wish to be the light

633
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,460
I will light up the way

634
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,460
I will light up the way

635
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,460
I will light up the way

636
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,460
I'm still speechless

637
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,460
i want to hold your hand

638
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,460
I truly believe

639
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,460
It's worth it

640
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,460
After the games

641
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,300
I'm sorry.

642
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,100
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,900
I'm sorry.

644
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm sorry.

645
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,460
I'm sorry.

646
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,460
I'm sorry.

647
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,460
I'm sorry.

648
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,460
