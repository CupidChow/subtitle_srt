1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
And free medicine.

2
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
Hello?

3
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
Boss, he's not here.

4
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm here too.

5
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Who asked you?

6
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,080
Hello, Zhou Xiao Nan?

7
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,480
Yes.

8
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm the doctor at third hospital.

9
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Our director re-watched your film.

10
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,000
I suggest you come over today.

11
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,760
You'd better be there before he gets off work.

12
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,640
Okay, I'll go now.

13
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,440
Go in.

14
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,600
Xiao Nan.

15
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,360
Sit.

16
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,640
Sit.

17
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,040
I've checked all your recent cases.

18
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,560
Why have you been injured so many times?

19
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,840
Your fingers and bones were broken.

20
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,520
You even had blood loss under your skin.

21
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
The shoulder joint was dislocated.

22
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,000
The tissue was injured.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
The spleen was torn.

24
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,560
Are you a doctor or...

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Don't worry.

26
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm a police officer.

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,600
The injured patient is in the clinic.

28
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
The doctor is in charge.

29
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,160
We'll take care of the injured patients.

30
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,480
There's no report.

31
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,040
We have to take care of them.

32
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,320
Your injuries

33
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,560
were caused by beating and sex, right?

34
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
This is a crime.

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,000
You're not a local, are you?

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Where are you from?

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,680
Sichuan.

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,760
Are your parents still here?

39
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Can you not tell them?

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
Do you want to go home?

41
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,280
I do.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
I've saved a lot of money.

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
I can't go back.

44
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,520
You can.

45
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
As long as we catch the person who hurt you,

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,680
you can go back.

47
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
But the premise is

48
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
you have to tell me

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,920
everything you know.

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
None of them can escape.

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,760
I've told him

52
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,120
to go back and continue working.

53
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,320
Pretend nothing happened.

54
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,640
We'll act as soon as possible.

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Is he okay?

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
I think he's okay.

57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
He's quite strong.

58
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
What are you thinking about?

59
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Fang Li.

60
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I'm here.

61
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
I'm here.

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm here.

63
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm here.

64
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
I'm here.

65
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm here.

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
They have the keys to your room.

67
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,600
Several people came that night.

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Did you see Miss Ao?

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,320
Someone said

70
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
Brother Hao hates us.

71
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
They don't.

72
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,480
Hello, Ma.

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Qin, I...

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
Do you remember

75
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,600
the case that the captain had done?

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,040
It was the case of Miss Ao's company.

77
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
The one who performed in the high-end building?

78
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Yes.

79
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
The check board was changed.

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
What happened?

81
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,120
I heard that it was related to the death of a person.

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,560
A special agent was missing.

83
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,040
Could it be that Miss Ao

84
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,760
was killed by someone secretly?

85
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,440
I can't tell you.

86
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,760
Don't let me make mistakes.

87
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,120
But I'll make a personal judgment.

88
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,960
This guy, Miss Ao,

89
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
is a man of his word.

90
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,080
Why are you asking about this?

91
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,480
It's okay.

92
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,320
I'm just worried.

93
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
I'm just worried.

94
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm just worried.

95
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm sure.

96
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll ask you to watch the movie.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Get out.

98
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,880
Where is Miss Ao?

99
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
I'll teach you how to make a heart.

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
Come on, tell me.

101
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,880
Thank you, Brother Bao Yi.

102
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,520
You're being too sweet.

103
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,200
I'll make a heart for you.

104
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,480
I'll make a heart for you.

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Make a big one.

106
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,800
Come on, I'll teach you.

107
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Make a heart.

108
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I'll make a heart for you.

109
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I'll make a heart for you.

110
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Make a heart.

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Yes.

112
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Make a heart.

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,440
Make a heart.

114
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
Yes.

115
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,320
Just now,

116
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,160
you brushed this in the yellow river.

117
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,320
I brushed it in the blue waves.

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,760
You can just compare this.

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Got it?

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who is it?

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So annoying.

122
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
What are you doing?

123
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,240
Brother, you're still so good at this?

124
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,560
Come on.

125
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Make a heart for my brother.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,400
Go out.

127
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Let them go out.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay.

129
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,680
Dayong,

130
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,560
you show them the small room.

131
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Let's play for a while.

132
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,800
You guys, follow me.

133
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,760
Brother,

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,040
is my interview successful?

135
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,240
Can I be the anchor?

136
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,880
You want to learn the ancient Chinese to be the anchor?

137
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Go ahead.

138
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Go ahead.

139
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Brother,

140
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
what's up?

141
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
What's up?

142
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Come with me.

143
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Where?

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Back to the team.

145
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Surrender.

146
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,160
No, I...

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
I have to know

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,880
what I've done.

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,360
We were ignorant before.

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
We did impulsive things.

151
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,360
But at least we know

152
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,560
what we can't do.

153
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,880
What did I do?

154
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,840
You did what no one else did.

155
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
The more you say, the more confused I am.

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
Except Shen Xiaozhou,

157
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,720
do you know Dr. Wang and Jiang Beibei?

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,240
No.

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,720
I've never heard of them before.

160
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Really?

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,960
You're the anchor

162
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,640
that made them the anchor

163
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,240
in this interview?

164
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,560
Brother, wait a minute.

165
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
I'll think about it.

166
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,040
You said

167
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Shen Xiaozhou died, right?

168
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Then the two people you just mentioned,

169
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
are they dead too?

170
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,280
No, brother,

171
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,480
don't scare me with this.

172
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
You're a cop now.

173
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,800
I am.

174
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
Yes, I'm a jerk.

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,160
But I'm still the jerk you know.

176
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,760
I, Ouyang Xiaojie, won't hurt women.

177
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
Tell me the truth.

178
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
How did you manage this girl?

179
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,840
How else can I manage her?

180
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
We're just hired people.

181
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm the boss, they're employees.

182
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
Our company's culture

183
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
is to respect each other.

184
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Humanistic management.

185
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Bullshit.

186
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,240
Ouyang Xiaojie,

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,040
sexist,

188
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,840
scary, and dangerous.

189
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
This is a human-based relationship.

190
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm not a human being.

191
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm a cop.

192
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,640
This is a job for human beings.

193
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,640
Shi Jiangfeng,

194
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,440
you're a cop now.

195
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,040
Every word you say now

196
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
is important.

197
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,040
You can't talk nonsense.

198
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,840
You're a jerk, you know?

199
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
You don't believe me?

200
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Fine, let's get to the point.

201
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
I'll call all the girls out for you.

202
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
You can ask them, okay?

203
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,040
You asked?

204
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,840
Who told you?

205
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,440
It's Ying Tao, right?

206
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
She didn't say anything.

207
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,640
That means someone spilled dirty water on me, brother.

208
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,840
Brother, I...

209
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,240
They want me to get a small reward.

210
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Don't talk nonsense.

211
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,040
You know my personality.

212
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,640
If I don't have evidence,

213
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,440
I won't come to you.

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
Now,

215
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,840
has Lu Xia been surrounded by the police?

216
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,000
Would someone say yes,

217
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,840
and then relieves me?

218
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,040
There won't be a kind person.

219
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,240
You have such big wings

220
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,640
and lony arms.

221
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,240
Did someone give you atoll?

222
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
No.

223
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,440
Because what you said is wrong,

224
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,240
they won't believe a 좋 슈 longest lie,

225
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,440
although it can be real.

226
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,840
Miss Ao can be said to be unaware of it.

227
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
It's all done by her subordinates.

228
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,800
She's done it all.

229
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,040
And then she's broken it down.

230
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,800
Sir.

231
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,560
I request to be the first to get Miss Ao out of the prison.

232
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,360
I have the same idea.

233
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,920
But you can't deliberately set up a trap.

234
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,120
That's not your character.

235
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,640
If you go against the rules,

236
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,160
she'll notice it.

237
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,080
I understand.

238
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,400
I'll do as I please.

239
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,680
You think I can't take you away alone.

240
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,320
Brother.

241
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,120
You used to be my brother.

242
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,400
You're still my brother.

243
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,040
I'll go wherever you say.

244
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,920
I'm doing this for your own good.

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,560
I understand.

246
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,720
When the main force comes up,

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
the mood will be different.

248
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,960
Brother, I have another request.

249
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,600
Let's sing a song before we leave.

250
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,400
It's been a long time since we sang it.

251
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
Let's sing it together.

252
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,240
I don't know how to sing.

253
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,240
It's okay.

254
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:01,960
Come on.

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,600
You sit.

256
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,560
I'll sing.

257
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,360
You listen.

We've raised the volume.

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,000
It's okay.

271
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
Get well soon.

272
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,600

Li Yongan, she's out of energy.

278
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,040
Let's fight on the street.

279
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,320
Let me go.

280
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
Let me go.

281
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,920
What are you doing?

282
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,840
I don't want to fight with you.

283
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,560
You're not afraid of me.

284
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,760
Let me go.

What are you doing?

287
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,200
Just pull back.

288
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,220
Let her go.

289
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,200
Let her go.

What are you doing?

292
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,300
Coming at you!

293
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,860
Go away.

294
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,460
I don't need anything.

295
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,100
Wang Xiaojie, do you know what you're doing?

296
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Go, go, go.

297
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,020
Go.

298
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,980
Don't wait for me.

299
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,220
Don't move.

300
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,980
Come on, hold him.

301
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,260
Be honest.

302
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,500
Don't move.

303
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,340
Hello.

304
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,500
Is this Lin Hai Ping?

305
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,060
Yes, who is this?

306
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,940
Ma Chao Qun.

307
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
The East City team has retired.

308
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,980
Shi Qiang Feng is very familiar with me.

309
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,900
Old Ma, I remember you.

310
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,660
What's up?

311
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,340
Are you investigating

312
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,140
a man named Ao Xiaojie?

313
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,420
He's in good health.

314
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,020
One needle is not enough, right?

315
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,780
No, one more needle.

316
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,540
Brother,

317
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,820
will Lin Zhen be in trouble?

318
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,260
Here's the thing.

319
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,420
Shi Qiang Feng is close to Ao Xiaojie.

320
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,500
But he doesn't know the location of Ao Xiaojie.

321
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,860
Ao Xiaojie is very cunning.

322
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,220
He's very cunning.

323
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,900
He did a lot of things that were suspicious.

324
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
But Shi Qiang Feng

325
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,460
is very smart.

326
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,380
I'm afraid he can't beat the enemy.

327
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,220
Does he have a mission tonight?

328
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,380
I've been calling him for several times but he didn't answer.

329
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,580
Don't worry.

330
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,820
Shi Qiang Feng won't be too reckless.

331
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,860
Let's go.

332
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,260
Brother, let's go to sleep.

333
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,180
I'm not in pain.

334
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,420
You guys, get out first.

335
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,020
I'm afraid you'll laugh.

336
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,260
My skin is also twitching.

337
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,740
I'm not at ease.

338
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,020
Please tell Dr. Gao

339
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,780
to come back to the hospital.

340
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,340
Okay, don't worry.

341
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,460
Hello.

342
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,060
The number you dialed is power off.

343
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,020
If anything happens,

344
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,900
arrest him immediately.

345
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,460
The water is so hot.

346
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,860
Go! Don't let him escape!

347
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,220
Where is Shi Qiang Feng?

348
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Don't run!

349
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,220
Don't run!

350
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Don't run!

351
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
Don't run!

352
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
Don't run!

353
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Don't run!

354
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Don't run!

355
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Don't run!

356
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Don't run!

357
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Don't run!

358
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
Don't run!

359
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,220
Don't run!

360
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Don't run!

361
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
Don't run!

362
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Don't run!

363
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,020
Don't run!

364
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,380
Stop!

365
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,220
Catch up with me!

366
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,140
Stop!

367
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,540
Don't move!

368
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,540
Go!

369
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,120
Stop!

370
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,660
Officer.

371
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,200
It was a real police phone call.

372
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,080
Protect your own safety

373
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,760
Xu Ran, I'm sorry

374
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,840
I didn't mean to hurt you

375
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,720
Zhou Ren

376
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,260
There's is a black hole in the wall.

377
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,340
Teacher.

378
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,540
Stop.

379
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,060
Cornell.

380
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,860
Wake up.

381
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,860
Cindy.

382
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,820
What is he doing?

383
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,460
He's worried he'll pass out.

384
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
Yes.

385
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Yes.

386
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
The tracker.

387
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
The tracker.

388
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
The tracker.

389
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
The tracker.

390
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
The tracker that is tracking Shi Jiangfeng

391
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
should be on the run-away street.

392
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,460
The location of the wall is moving.

393
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
It's on Baoshan Road now.

394
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,460
The tracker.

395
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,460
The tracker.

396
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Where...

397
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,460
Where are we going?

398
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
To the hospital.

399
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I want to catch the tracker.

400
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
It's okay. Someone is chasing him.

401
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
Don't be afraid of him running away.

402
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,460
You can catch him even if he runs away.

403
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Am I...

404
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
going to die?

405
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,460
Nonsense.

406
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,460
You must be fine.

407
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,460
We're almost at the hospital.

408
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,460
Hold on.

409
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
The tire seems to be dead.

410
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
It's been a long time.

411
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
The car in the back is not Wang Yang.

412
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Can you learn to change tires?

413
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,460
What are you talking about?

414
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
You don't need me to do this job.

415
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Okay.

416
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,460
Take the gun and go quickly.

417
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
Hurry up.

418
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Hurry up.

419
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,460
What is this?

420
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Be careful, guys.

421
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Be careful.

422
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
Brother Tian, run.

423
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Hit him.

424
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460
Hit him.

425
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,460
Hit him.

426
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
My friend.

427
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
My friend.

428
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,460
There's a police, Kun.

429
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,460
Go.

430
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,460
Go.

431
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Kun, the police are here.

432
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Go.

433
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
There's a police, Kun.

434
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,460
Go.

435
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,460
Where's Miss Ao?

436
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
I don't know.

437
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
She ran away.

438
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
Come out, Miss Ao.

439
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Come out.

440
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Come out.

441
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
Come out.

442
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Come out.

443
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Come out.

444
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
Come out.

445
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Come out.

446
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
Come out.

447
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,460
Come out.

448
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
Come out.

449
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Come out.

450
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,460
Come out.

451
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Come out.

452
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
I know.

453
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
The person you're similar to my mom.

454
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,460
Why?

455
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
Break up with her.

456
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
It's her and me.

457
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
You can't enter.

458
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,780
the human form.

459
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,020
Gu,

460
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,600
what's the result of

461
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,360
the needle after hat yesterday?

462
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,520
Yes.

463
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,500
Are there any findings

464
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,760
in Sheng Xiaozhu's body?

465
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,740
No.

466
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,260
Only one range in Shen Xiao Zhuo and so is Mr. L misbehaved.

467
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,360
How is the little SH Qiaowen?

468
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Still awake.

469
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,480
The doctor said

470
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,000
we got the rescue on time

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and he wasn't killed.

472
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,020
Within a few minutes,

473
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,460
the normal person stopped breathing and stopped beating.

474
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,580
This guy fell in love with Liang Zhen.

475
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,060
His life is so hard.

476
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,380
You really went all out

477
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,380
to post on WeChat?

478
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
What?

479
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,500
This is a birthday gift from your dad.

480
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,300
Can you go by yourself?

481
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,340
I have something to do.

482
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,300
I have homework.

483
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,380
Stop talking nonsense.

484
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,580
Just look around.

485
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,860
How is it?

486
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,780
What do you think?

487
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,300
Just be honest.

488
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,660
My dad is really good at giving gifts.

489
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,060
You little brat.

490
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,740
Mom,

491
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,980
how did you know my dad?

492
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,700
I didn't tell you.

493
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,860
Someone else introduced me to him.

494
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,100
Then how did you know him?

495
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,860
Look at my dad.

496
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,580
He's so handsome.

497
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,060
This is my specialty.

498
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,660
Although your mom is not a professor,

499
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,820
she is good at looking at people.

500
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,740
When we first met,

501
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,620
your dad was so calm.

502
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,500
He was like a tree.

503
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,900
I knew right away

504
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,180
that he was a good person.

505
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,300
He didn't have any bad things in his eyes.

506
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,260
He was even blushed when he talked.

507
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,500
Besides,

508
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,420
your dad was very energetic when he was young.

509
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,820
He was handsome.

510
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,940
He's not bad.

511
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,140
Honestly,

512
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,460
at first, I thought he was a little

513
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,660
boring.

514
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,100
Sometimes I say a hundred sentences,

515
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
he can't reply to three sentences.

516
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,820
Okay.

517
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,300
That's it.

518
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,660
But later,

519
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,700
I got to know him better.

520
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,940
I thought with him,

521
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,420
how could I be so...

522
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,220
How could I be so calm?

523
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,780
Yes, I'm calm.

524
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,060
I've never lost my mind when he's around.

525
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,020
Look at this.

526
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,140
Isn't it better?

527
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,300
Then why are you so relieved

528
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,020
when my dad doesn't say anything?

529
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,460
Aren't you worried?

530
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,340
At first, I was worried, too.

531
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,460
But later, I knew

532
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,660
if he had any trouble,

533
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,300
he would tell me

534
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,020
when he was bored

535
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,380
and exhausted.

536
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,620
He told me everything

537
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,140
to his wife.

538
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,540
I was

539
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,940
driven out by him.

540
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,100
I was in a hurry.

541
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,220
Your dad

542
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,820
is not easy to think

543
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,660
when he's with others.

544
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,220
It seems complicated, right?

545
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,660
In fact, his intelligence

546
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,300
is used in his work.

547
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,620
Life is simple and cruel.

548
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,500
You know

549
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,660
he will never lie to you

550
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,780
or harm you.

551
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,660
He won't do anything to you.

552
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,420
Because he can't get over his own level.

553
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Because he did something to you,

554
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,540
he has to pretend.

555
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,780
Your dad is the worst at pretending.

556
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,780
He might meet someone

557
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
and hit on him.

558
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,980
He might make it difficult for him.

559
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,780
He might pretend to be strong.

560
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,020
That's not necessarily.

561
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,180
I think he's lying to you

562
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,380
for your own good.

563
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,900
Who lied to me?

564
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,420
What did your dad say?

565
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,140
He went to my dad's house.

566
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,220
I thought it was something else.

567
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,420
I know.

568
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,500
He taught you.

569
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,860
He's so dedicated to solving cases

570
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,260
after we left.

571
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,740
You guessed it?

572
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,660
I've known it for so many years.

573
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,100
He's worried that we should cooperate with him.

574
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,780
You went to my dad's house

575
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,500
more often when you were a kid.

576
