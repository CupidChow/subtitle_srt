1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
longer.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,820
The

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,840
cost of a

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,040
meat

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,260
It's laughing.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,500
Are you feeling sad?

7
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,480
How is it?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't look. Look at your car.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why didn't you change in the bathroom before going out?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the bathroom time.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You think I deliberately took it off for you to look at?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Eat more meat.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not going to eat meat.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to eat meat.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to eat meat.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to eat meat.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to eat meat.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to eat meat.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Drink.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What do you mean?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What do you mean? You all made it public.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Old rules. Drink it all.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let us get some energy.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Stop it.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You want to kill me?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Drink. Drink.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stop drinking.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Drink. Drink.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Drink. Drink.

Drink. Drink.

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Drink. Drink.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you doing?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why aren't you drinking?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I still want to drink.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Drink. Drink.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000

Drink. Drink.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why can't we find the right person?

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're just a womanizer.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why do you have to

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
meet a kindergarten teacher?

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The kindergarten teacher

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
is with the kids every day.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He must be the warmest

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and brightest person in the world.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There are too many

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
social shadows

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that the police have encountered.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I thought that the two of them...

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're being selfish.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can't always think of

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the other person.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No. I can warm her up.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm usually a good driver.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm good at cooking.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't tell her

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
about my work.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then we get off work

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and live together.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How good is her life

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
if she lives a happy life?

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's right.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Life

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
has to be fun.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If the two of them live together,

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
your wife will be angry.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But she's also

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
a warm person.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Zhang, they're out.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Shi Jiangfeng said that he always

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
takes a girl with him.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Please try to get in line.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He won't be in the case today.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Come back.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Very good.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Get some people from the seaside.

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is what I just saw.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Very good.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Almost done.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You do it.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How can I do it?

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can't talk less.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Almost done.

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You do it.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How can I do it?

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You can't talk less.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I love you.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I love you.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I love you.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I love you.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I love you.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She's in there.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Be careful.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't get too close.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't get too close.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If there's a danger, send a signal.

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We'll rush in immediately.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How can it be so dangerous?

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going in.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You two are almost there.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a pity that I can't go in.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's okay.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is the first day.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't think I can see her.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother Wang, are you alone?

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's boring to drink alone.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Can you treat us to a drink?

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Go away.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Go away.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Brother, sit down.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Brother, have you seen her?

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll call you back.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's too noisy.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We should go in.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is the place where Li Dada chose the target.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,600
There will be no

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm going in.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going in.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going in.

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm going in.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm going in.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going in.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going in.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going in.

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going in.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm going in.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going in.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm going in.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm going in.

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going in.

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going in.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm going in.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm going in.

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going in.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going in.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going in.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going in.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going in.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm going in.

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm going in.

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going in.

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going in.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going in.

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going in.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm going in.

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm going in.

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I dropped something.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This?

194
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is not mine.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Isn't it?

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is it bright?

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,160
you're not rozmallant forthoroughly.

198
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,520
That riff is really Michelle Dadou.

199
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,640
When she's found,

200
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,840
she won't be so smooth.

201
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,600
Don't be constantly.

202
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,040
It will Romanize.

203
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
Do you really make it or not?

204
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Let me tell you.

205
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,720
It is fake!

206
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,800
Don't know where to buy it.

207
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,680
Give you back yours.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not mine. Why should I try it on?

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If it's suitable, then try it on.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Is the cost of this fan so high?

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't want any cost.

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I just want to find a suitable ankle for her.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If yours is suitable, I can give you a hundred.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is it that big?

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Then I'll try it on for you.

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's too hard to take off.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Your shoes are not designed well.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll give you a pair later.

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's nice and easy to wear.

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You don't want to take me home now, do you?

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't even know what you're calling me.

224
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm not that bad.

225
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
A chain that can recognize you has already been made.

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's on.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's on.

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's on the Internet. Did you see it?

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I saw it.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Li Shiya.

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Is this your real name or your Internet name?

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Of course it's my real name.

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
My Internet name is Lisa.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're alone.

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Why are you here so late?

236
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Can your family rest assured?

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a mess.

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's all black and white.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No one is in touch.

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why are you here?

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Do you like the sea?

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Come on.

243
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm here to visit.

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A man is blowing up the net.

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He's over a million a year.

246
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I came and saw that there was no house.

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But I think it's pretty good here.

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I plan to stay for a couple of days.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I have a house.

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is it big?

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Is it by the sea?

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There are a few houses by the sea.

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're not an estate agent, are you?

254
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How is it?

256
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm doing well, right?

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's great.

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The information is very accurate and comprehensive.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it's very confident.

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If I didn't know you, I would have believed it.

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I didn't expect it to be done so quickly.

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What are we going to do?

263
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Didn't you add his WeChat?

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Wait for him.

265
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,560
The last time Li Dada

266
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
very easily

267
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,840
noticed our Ding Shao.

268
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,160
I guess

269
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,960
he knew

270
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
the information

271
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,920
about our car.

272
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
Now Sui Xiao

273
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,720
has established a connection with him.

274
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,040
I think

275
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,840
we can borrow a few cars from outside.

276
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000
Six.

277
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,560
We can take them at any time.

278
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,840
Okay.

279
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,960
Prepare six groups of people and six cars.

280
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,320
Those who drive

281
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
will be the old guys.

282
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,720
Six cars will be on the road at the same time.

283
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,600
Okay.

284
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,960
Who is the commander

285
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,760
in the main camp?

286
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,800
Commander Lian.

287
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,040
I'm in the front line.

288
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,960
It's a matter of mind.

289
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,160
The first one goes first, the second one goes first.

290
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,520
The second one

291
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,080
is better than me.

292
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Good.

293
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,840
Sui Xiao did well this time.

294
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
He got the first one.

295
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Do you want to

296
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,720
make more trouble tonight?

297
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,040
I don't think so.

298
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,800
Li Dada is making a choice.

299
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,920
If he doesn't make a choice,

300
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,240
it's useless for you to go.

301
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,120
If he makes a choice,

302
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,360
he will contact Sui Xiao.

303
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,200
Then wait.

304
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,680
It's almost ten o'clock.

305
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,280
If you want to contact him, you should have contacted him earlier.

306
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
Ten o'clock is the time for you to rest.

307
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,800
For us young people,

308
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,200
the night has just begun.

309
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,720
You are a few years younger than me.

310
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,040
Don't pretend to be a next generation.

311
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,320
Captain Lian.

312
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
If he doesn't contact me,

313
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,720
will we waste our time?

314
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,080
If he gives up,

315
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,320
at least you are safe.

316
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,480
We are thinking of a way.

317
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,520
But we have made such a big effort.

318
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,200
I don't want to lose.

319
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,120
Is there something wrong with this hotel?

320
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,960
Am I not good enough?

321
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,840
I already�

322
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,680
Searching, look for someone

323
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,280
Did you say I dads were done?

324
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,240
Yeah

325
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,300
Lay off

326
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,540
Who?

327
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,260
I am going to start a construction

328
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,800
Team leader

329
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,200
Li De da asked to see me

330
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,800
See you tonight

331
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,440
To where?

332
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Doctor of

333
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
basta

334
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Boss

335
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,880
Get in the car.

336
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,800
Li Da Da is not driving the usual car.

337
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,360
Attention, all teams.

338
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,240
Check the license plate number.

339
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,160
Roger.

340
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,880
Sir.

341
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,320
Let's go.

342
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Where are we going?

343
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,960
You can go to the big house by the sea.

344
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,400
Shouldn't we go there during the day?

345
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,840
We can't see anything at night.

346
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
You said you wanted to see the sea in the morning

347
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
when you wake up tomorrow.

348
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,200
You are so careful.

349
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,560
Report, car 2.

350
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,880
Li Da Da is on the right.

351
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
Follow the car 3.

352
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
We are going to the big house by the sea.

353
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
How can we go to the city?

354
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
It's still early.

355
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
But you are so crazy.

356
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
I hope you can drive at night.

357
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,440
You are the most likely to drive at night.

358
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
I want to drive.

359
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
I want to fly.

360
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
What's going on?

361
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
What's going on?

362
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,360
Li Da Da's phone is in the car.

363
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,960
Is our detection platform useful?

364
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,280
There may be some interference in Li Da Da's car.

365
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,480
He just turned it on.

366
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,600
Did he wake up?

367
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,720
Did Li Da Da find out?

368
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,080
Should we cancel the operation?

369
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
We will arrest him immediately.

370
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,520
You decide.

371
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I support.

372
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
No.

373
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Keep following.

374
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,040
This should be Li Da Da's habit.

375
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,160
Groups,

376
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,440
report to me at any time.

377
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
Roger.

378
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
Their car is out of the highway.

379
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
Car 3, turn right.

380
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,080
Car 4, ready.

381
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Roger.

382
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Damn it.

383
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Let's go.

384
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Hurry up.

385
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Follow up.

386
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Oh no.

387
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Car 4, report.

388
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
We just followed the wrong car.

389
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
There was a car with the same number as the target vehicle.

390
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
There is only one difference after the car was hit.

391
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
One is B, the other is 8.

392
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Where did this car come from?

393
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Which intersection did you follow this car?

394
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
The intersection before the two intersections.

395
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Car 5, turn right.

396
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Go to Xing Ke Road.

397
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Go to Ping An Road.

398
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Car 6, go to Jing San Road.

399
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Go to Xing Fu Road.

400
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Go back.

401
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Go straight to find the target vehicle.

402
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Car 3, turn left.

403
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Go to the south.

404
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Other vehicles are searching for the southeast direction.

405
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Go back.

406
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
This time, the car is arranged by Li Da.

407
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
The operation is failed.

408
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Don't say a word about this car.

409
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Car 6, report.

410
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
We just saw a car with the same number as the target vehicle.

411
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
The car just passed the intersection.

412
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Which direction is the damaged road?

413
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
I followed the car to the north.

414
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Pay attention to the gang.

415
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Adjust the position again.

416
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Open the distance.

417
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Don't follow up.

418
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,320
The target has left the city.

419
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
There are few cars on the road.

420
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,400
It's easy to get caught.

421
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,920
Please get in a few cars.

422
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,600
No. 1 and No. 2 cars.

423
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,400
Keep following the target.

424
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,680
The other cars are one kilometer away.

425
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
Wait for my order.

426
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,200
Our No. 3 car is in front of No. 2 car.

427
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,520
I request to join the first team.

428
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,000
No. 3 car.

429
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,240
Listen to my order.

430
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,200
Xiao Qi must be...

431
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,000
Mr. An.

432
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Did you invite the car?

433
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,320
He only said No. 1 and No. 2 cars.

434
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,600
He didn't say that there must be a person in the car.

435
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,200
You've been through it.

436
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Don't worry.

437
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
Just follow him.

438
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
He wants to go to hell.

439
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Let him go.

440
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,400
Maybe he will die and be reborn.

441
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
How is it?

442
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,800
Si Yuqiao's monitoring channel has recovered.

443
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
This should be his tomb.

444
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,000
The villas are all built by the Party.

445
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The government has ordered to demolish them.

446
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
Let's go.

447
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Wow, what a big house.

448
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,600
I can't see the sea.

449
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,600
I saw it when I woke up tomorrow morning.

450
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,000
There's still no signal.

451
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The signal hasn't been seen yet.

452
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
Are you hungry?

453
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,800
I'll go get some food.

454
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Are you hungry?

455
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll go get some food.

456
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
What kind of wine?

457
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Beer.

458
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
Okay.

459
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,000
Wait for my news.

460
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
We'll act after we get the evidence.

461
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,800
Why is there no electricity?

462
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,200
Don't worry. I've prepared a surprise for you.

463
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Look behind you.

464
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't panic.

465
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Everything's going fine.

466
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,000
What if we see these?

467
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,900
Doesn't matter.

468
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,600
I thought you were Якubovikov Guliyev.

469
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,200
How do you know that?

470
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
It'srato poorly known as he is an astroepat pepper.

471
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Maybe you knew him,

472
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,100
Maybe you just know he isn't a kid.

473
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,000
China has always been good.

474
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,920
If we go in now,

475
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
we'll be like the last time we were at the police station.

476
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,200
We can't stop him.

477
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,000
What should we do?

478
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We can't see or hear.

479
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,240
We'll be in trouble if we move.

480
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,280
I heard the landing gear was smashed.

481
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,920
Open it.

482
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,320
This is a high level.

483
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,920
I don't know how long it will take.

484
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
I'm already leaving.

485
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,240
Wait.

486
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,680
Xia Fang.

487
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,000
If you can't bear it,

488
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,040
don't go in later.

489
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,600
Shi...

490
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
Shi Qiang Feng, give me some time.

491
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,280
I need about one to two...

492
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,720
Go in.

493
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,600
Qiang Feng, you guard here.

494
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
I'll go with Lin Zi.

495
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,080
I promise you to take Xiao Qi to the second floor.

496
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,280
Yes.

497
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,480
You're not here.

498
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
There's no one on the second floor.

499
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The basement.

500
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,480
Don't move.

501
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,280
Police.

502
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,760
Don't move.

503
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,600
Put the water in.

504
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,400
Hands off.

505
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Where are you?

506
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Put the electric saw down.

507
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,440
Here.

508
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,160
Is he a police?

509
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,400
What's wrong?

510
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Don't panic.

511
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,880
He's still alive.

512
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,040
Get up.

513
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,280
He's awake.

514
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,840
Put it down.

515
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,760
Listen to me.

516
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,680
He's scaring me.

517
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,400
This is a big hole.

518
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
If my wrist shakes a little,

519
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,000
he can't save me.

520
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,200
Put the electric saw down first.

521
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Okay.

522
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,880
Put the gun down first.

523
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,280
Okay.

524
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,160
Put it down.

525
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,760
Put it down.

526
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
Give it to you.

527
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,120
Forgive him.

528
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Kexin.

529
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,000
It was this.

530
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,080
A piece of work of his own.

531
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,280
What if something bad happens,

532
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Don't take him away

533
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,260
So I can't open almost all the unboxing boxes

534
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,240
What's that?

535
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,160
Her evidence was burnt

536
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,320
Team Feng

537
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,160
Team Lian

538
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,820
Team Feng

539
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,120
Can you open it?

540
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,840
How can you just plop open the unboxing, Bad Qi

541
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
You took the tools

542
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:24,880
powered

543
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:24,940
J

544
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,960
Step over

545
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,280
Corey

546
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,780
This shouldn't be pure work

547
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,180
is also a way to open and close.

548
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,260
This bastard has cleaned up quite well.

549
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,060
Captain Lin.

550
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,220
It's fake.

551
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,020
It should be a fake version of Beibei.

552
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,580
It's still not enough.

553
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,860
Keep looking.

554
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,020
Got it.

555
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,420
Stop beating.

556
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,260
Turn off the light.

557
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,420
Let's go.

558
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,700
You're awake.

559
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,420
Are you dizzy?

560
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,500
Not yet.

561
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,060
Did you catch him?

562
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,340
Yes.

563
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,620
I'm sorry.

564
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,260
Are we going to be late?

565
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,380
No.

566
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,620
I'm fine.

567
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,540
We're both

568
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,060
the most stubborn people in the world.

569
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,260
Hello?

570
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,900
Dad.

571
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,460
My mom is going home.

572
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,380
My dad kicked her out today.

573
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,340
He said he didn't care.

574
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,220
Then you can come back.

575
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,260
Can we go back?

576
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,060
Are you okay?

577
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,340
I'm fine.

578
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,420
I'll take you to dinner tonight.

579
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,020
This guy didn't say anything.

580
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,540
He's waiting for the lawyer.

581
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,300
The evidence is confirmed.

582
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,140
It's useless to come here.

583
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,140
He can't do it

584
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,660
if he wants to buy the money.

585
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,380
Captain Feng, right?

586
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,700
I'm Li Longhe.

587
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,940
These two are the vice-captain of the special investigation team,

588
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,780
Zhao Hougang,

589
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,140
and Lian Haiping.

590
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,260
Hello.

591
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:30,980
Hello.

592
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,380
I'm sorry

593
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,540
to bother you.

594
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,300
I asked

595
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,660
to meet you.

596
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,420
But you can rest assured.

597
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,380
I've already expressed

598
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,700
my feelings to the police.

599
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,660
I respect the law

600
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,860
and the evidence.

601
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,620
It has caused great harm

602
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
to society and life.

603
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,180
I...

604
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,620
I'll try my best to make up for it.

605
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,660
But

606
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,820
I won't ask for a compensation.

607
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,140
You caught him

608
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,020
to pay back to society.

609
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,180
You also

610
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,540
cut a bad tumor

611
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,900
for our family.

612
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,540
This tumor

613
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,460
is my son.

614
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,180
He has been

615
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,420
so mean to me

616
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,660
for many years

617
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,500
and I have no right to forgive him.

618
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,140
I'm sorry.

619
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,060
Terrific!

620
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,380
He caught his son and gave it to us

621
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,780
Is he the only son?

622
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,580
He has a little son and studies abroad

623
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,980
It is said that he donated millions of dollars to this school

624
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,540
Then Li Dada is his wife

625
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,820
Officer, can Li Dada's case be interrogated again?

626
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,020
Excuse me

627
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,420
I've thought about it

628
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,180
I admit it

629
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,420
What are those two called?

630
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,220
I did it

631
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,580
And that Shen Xiaozhou

632
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,940
I killed him

633
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,420
Shen Xiaozhou was killed by you?

634
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,940
Yes

635
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,980
What time, what location, what way?

636
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,780
Do you want to ask so detailed?

637
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,860
I was dizzy when I killed him

638
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,100
I can only remember a big thing

639
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,140
I met him that day

640
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,300
It was by the sea

641
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,580
He was alone at night

642
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,860
I gave him a cup of orange juice

643
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,340
He was drunk

644
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,980
He was dizzy and took it

645
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,340
As for where and how

646
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,740
Didn't you all go?

647
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,740
Didn't you all see it?

648
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,300
I did something else

649
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,780
I said it

650
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,140
I put the student card of Shen Xiaozhou on the driver

651
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,620
I wanted him to be a scapegoat

652
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,140
But he failed

653
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,140
I asked Shuijun to do the black work of Zhang Haoyang

654
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,500
Ou Xiaojie is a scoundrel

655
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,540
A useless man

656
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,780
What else?

657
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,380
Help me think

658
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,740
There is a man called Kun, right?

659
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,620
Where is he?

660
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,380
He has long gone

661
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,820
If he can catch you, then go

662
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,340
He is not innocent

663
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,180
We found out that there was a car

664
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,460
Just like you

665
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,820
Did you arrange it?

666
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,180
Are you a police?

667
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,100
You are so stupid

668
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,340
I want to find out that you are sitting here with me

669
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,540
Who do you think you are?

670
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,500
Where are you?

671
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,060
That night

672
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,460
You and Shen Xiaozhou met by chance

673
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,700
Yes

674
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,380
You choose Shen Xiaozhou's way and standard

675
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,060
It's totally different from other victims

676
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,420
It's risky to choose Shen Xiaozhou

677
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,540
This is not your style

678
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,060
Why do you kill him?

679
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,540
I have been loyal to him for a long time, okay?

680
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,740
I saw him play the pipa for the first time in the club

681
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,940
I like him

682
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,940
I can't control it

683
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
I can't let go of it if I have a chance

684
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,780
Club? What club?

685
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,940
What club?

686
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,740
Ao Xiaoqiu's company

687
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,260
Why did you meet for the first time?

688
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,380
Before Shen Xiaozhou was a anchor

689
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,020
You must have seen him

690
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,500
You introduced that relationship

691
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,700
Right?

692
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,860
Can't I?

693
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,260
Anyway, he is my type

694
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,540
I can't control him

695
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,620
I have to do it

696
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,300
I can't control myself

697
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,820
I am a pervert

698
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,180
I have been a witness in a well-known spiritual organization

699
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,820
Did you find it?

700
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,740
I was a pervert in my childhood

701
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,860
My mom was a pervert

702
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,820
My dad found me and beat me to death

703
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,700
I was worse

704
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,220
When I saw the beautiful foot

705
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,060
I can't control the bone

706
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,620
I would rather swallow it

707
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,820
You have a mental problem

708
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,380
I just finished

709
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,820
Please

710
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,740
My mom is getting tired

711
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,940
My mom's now

712
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,740
She still lives in the seek teammates away from China

713
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,580
Take her back.

714
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,840
It's two-sided.

715
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,220
What Li Longhe wants to say is good.

716
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,200
I think it's all arranged by him.

717
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,100
How many dollars itское spend?

718
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,400
Early access of mental health test.

719
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,500
I just know it may not be this easy.

720
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,980
Waiting for us here.

721
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,380
or other comrades-in-arms

722
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,660
to fight

723
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,300
This case said

724
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,780
We should be happy

725
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,220
to have broken such a big case

726
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,220
Why can't I be happy

727
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,620
Captain Yan

728
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,540
Did you find me

729
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,900
any results of the ten-hour case?

730
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,320
Duan Bengjian

731
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,180
You said that

732
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,820
he was going to a chak struggling at adam

733
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,100
What is a 282?

734
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,860
Is it the chak or the Club?

735
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,020
Which Club?

736
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,820
That's where I took him

737
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,900
I like him.

738
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
I can't control him.

739
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,900
Okay?

740
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Let's eat.

741
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Here, one for mom.

742
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
One for Xiao Huai.

743
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,580
One for Xiao Zhu.

744
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,220
Eat.

745
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,300
The sun rises and sets in the clouds

746
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,500
The darkness is about to be settled

747
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Only a lamp is left

748
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Still lonely in the dark

749
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I'll spend my life

750
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Is there a gust of wind

751
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,500
That can separate you from the fog?

752
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Is there a firework

753
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,100
That can burn the world of lies?

754
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,100
If I can see through the darkness

755
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,100
The dark clouds are moving

756
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,100
If I can hear the heartbeat

757
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:48,100
The heart is in a vague echo

758
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,100
How I wish for this light

759
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:58,100
Light up the way that comes in the abyss

760
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,100
The truth is invisible

761
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:06,100
But there is a way forward

762
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,100
Memories are like the wind

763
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,100
That can cut through the cold of the night

764
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,100
The story is moving

765
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,100
The old dream is being built

766
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,100
A prison is being built

767
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,100
I'll spend my life

768
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,100
Is there a gust of wind

769
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:44,100
That can separate you from the fog?

770
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,100
Is there a firework

771
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,100
That can burn the world of lies?

772
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,100
If I can see through the darkness

773
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,100
The dark clouds are moving

774
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
If I can hear the heartbeat

775
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,100
The heart is in a vague echo

776
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,100
How I wish for this light

777
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Light up the way that comes in the abyss

778
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
The truth is invisible

779
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:29,100
But there is a way forward
