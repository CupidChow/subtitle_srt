1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
To be honest Be honest

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,480
Fold

3
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,260
Flip it

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,140
Here

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,580
During this phase, it will become a little boat

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,060
Xiaochuan, Xiaozhou

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's call it Xiaozhou

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,980
Let's go on a trip after I graduate

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,180
Where?

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,900
Anywhere

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,500
We haven't traveled yet

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,620
Go, wherever you want

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,500
Ok

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,020
Travel is not worth it

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,540
You haven't started work yet

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,540
If you want to spend money

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,060
Let's go on a trip

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,340
Great

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,020
Brother, let's go on a trip

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,300
Travel, where do you want to go?

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,180
Look at me

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,300
Beijing, ok?

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,420
Brother, look at me

24
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,500
Look at me

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,180
Beijing

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
Beijing

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
Beijing

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,500
Beijing

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,660
Take me to Beijing, ok?

30
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,980
Ok

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,980
Come on

32
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,060
Brother, bye

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,420
Ok, bye

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,580
Brother, I will come back

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,900
I'm back to school

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,220
Did you bring the eggs?

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,500
In my bag

38
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,780
Bye

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,140
Xiaozhou, when will you come back?

40
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,700
20th, dad, mom, brother

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,780
Bye

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
Xiaozhou

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Xiaozhou

44
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,580
Xiaozhou

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,580
Xiaozhou

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
Xiaozhou

47
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Xiaozhou

48
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,580
Xiaozhou

49
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Xiaozhou

50
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,580
Xiaozhou

51
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Xiaozhou

52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Xiaozhou

53
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,580
Xiaozhou

54
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,580
Xiaozhou

55
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Xiaozhou

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
The End

57
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,580
Li Dada didn't tell the truth

58
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,940
The first time he met Shen Xiaozhou

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,940
Should be at Han Chao Club

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,300
But he deliberately hid this statement

61
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,580
I checked

62
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,140
Han Chao Club belongs to Jinghai Group

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,580
You think Li Dada didn't kill Shen Xiaozhou

64
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,580
Another person

65
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,500
Then why did he report it?

66
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,540
I don't know

67
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,940
I want to continue to investigate

68
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,580
Since we have found Shen Xiaozhou

69
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,140
Another abnormal life profile

70
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,140
Should be clear about the details

71
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,060
Li Dada's case

72
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
Zhao Hougang is not responsible for it

73
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,060
He admitted the crime

74
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,700
Don't inform Shen Xiaozhou's family yet

75
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,060
Then continue to investigate

76
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
I'm back

77
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Jinghai Group

78
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Did you eat?

79
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
No

80
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Didn't you say you would take us out to eat delicious food?

81
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Yanyan is with the waves

82
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Thousands of miles

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Where is the spring river?

84
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,740
Wu Yueying

85
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Don't tease my dad

86
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,740
My mom made it early

87
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
We both finished eating

88
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Yue Zhao Hua Lin

89
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Street 4

90
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,820
The cloud is flowing in the wind

91
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
I rely on you

92
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Part of it

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm curious

94
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
I came back to be a song

95
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I posted a Weibo that night

96
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Or someone's special

97
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
I actually just

98
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
I don't know what that is

99
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
I don't know what that is

100
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Remember I told you

101
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Cloud line

102
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
20 years ago

103
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,900
I don't know that girl

104
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
She has a child

105
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Do you want to hear

106
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
My favorite profession

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Is the police and doctor

108
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
Because he saves people every minute

109
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Every minute

110
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Make this world more lovely

111
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Believe me

112
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
You can do it

113
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
You will be a good cop

114
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
If one day

115
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I want to go by myself

116
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Don't ask me why

117
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
what

118
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Why are you here

119
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Didn't I go to the tea

120
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,780
Where are you now

121
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,780
Where do i go

122
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,780
ACT has approved

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Do you have any questions for me

124
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
No need.

125
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,500
If you think it's time to investigate, then investigate.

126
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,900
There's still some time.

127
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,300
Let's go to a place first.

128
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,300
The dead can't open their mouth to speak.

129
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,700
Have you thought about this question?

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,100
There are tens of billions of people in the world.

131
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,300
But the only ones who can open their mouth to speak

132
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
and help them find justice

133
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
are the police officers who are in charge of the case.

134
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Sometimes there's only one, but no one else.

135
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,300
They are the only bridge between justice and them.

136
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,100
They are their only hope.

137
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,700
So you must catch the right person.

138
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,900
Since I was a police officer, I've been telling myself

139
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,500
that I'll be the first to file a case.

140
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,300
The first case you encountered was in 1995 in Yunxian, right?

141
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,700
He was my mom.

142
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,300
I saw your name on the record.

143
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,900
The record says that you two were in a relationship.

144
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,500
When I got into the police university, the first summer vacation,

145
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,300
he proposed to break up with me.

146
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,700
It was very sudden and decisive.

147
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
After that, I didn't hear from him for three years.

148
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,900
After that, I graduated and was assigned to the court.

149
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,300
When I went home to visit my family,

150
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,300
I happened to run into his case.

151
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,300
I learned about his experience in those years.

152
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,900
I finally understood why he had to break up with me.

153
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,700
He didn't want to leave me in that kind of life.

154
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,900
That kind of life is too bad.

155
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,500
If there really is such a day,

156
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:23,300
it means that I've left the best of me to you.

157
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Just remember it.

158
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Do you think that

159
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,300
he looked like Shen Xiaozhou at the time?

160
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
Very much.

161
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
But I never knew

162
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
that he had a child.

163
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
I

164
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,900
didn't know that he had a child.

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
He's not your son.

166
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,900
With your sharp eyes, you never checked my DNA.

167
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
I hesitated.

168
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
You hesitated.

169
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
How did you get rid of me?

170
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
You checked my DNA.

171
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,300
To be honest, I was quite happy at first.

172
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,300
I thought you abandoned my mom.

173
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,700
Because you look a little cold.

174
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Later, I understood you.

175
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,900
I hope you are really the one.

176
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,500
It's best this way.

178
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,300
If it's true,

179
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
I'll delay the achievement.

180
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
How did you and my mom know each other?

181
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
That year, I met Li Yunchuan.

182
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
His name is Li Yunchuan.

183
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
He was in the senior year.

184
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
He had already studied for two years.

185
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
He didn't come to school.

186
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
Every time I saw him,

187
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
I thought he was a student.

188
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
He didn't like to wear school uniforms.

189
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
He didn't like to have long hair.

190
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
He didn't have nails.

191
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
He liked to ride a bike like a boy.

192
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
He sat on the road and drank soda.

193
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
He ate lamb skewers.

194
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
He is two extremes.

195
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
But I like him at once.

196
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Maybe people who are nervous

197
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,300
are more attracted by those who are free.

198
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Because they want to be like you.

199
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
What's strange is

200
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
he noticed me.

201
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
He knows my name.

202
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
You want to see the sea?

203
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
You can call me Lian Haiping.

204
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
You're old and don't be stupid.

205
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Who is better than you?

206
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
I got to know him.

207
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,300
I realized he didn't mean to pretend.

208
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
The family is in a bad situation.

209
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
Without mom,

210
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Dad is always on the table.

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,300
I think he should be angry with the world.

212
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
So...

213
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
So he made himself look like

214
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
a bad girl.

215
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
In fact, it's a self-protection.

216
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
When he was with me,

217
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,300
he was so real and cute.

218
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
The police and the doctor,

219
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
are you talking about him?

220
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
I've never been in a relationship.

221
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I like to make trouble.

222
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
You're a good boy.

223
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
It's okay.

224
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Just do it.

225
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Just like before.

226
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Is that case hard to solve?

227
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
No.

228
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Soon the suspect was locked up.

229
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,300
He's been pestering her for years.

230
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
He's a lawless scoundrel.

231
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
He does everything bad.

232
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
What he wants,

233
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,300
is rarely what he can't get.

234
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
But he didn't listen.

235
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
He was afraid that he could resist.

236
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Until one day,

237
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
he was chased and jumped into the river.

238
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
It's reasonable.

239
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Because I have this relationship with him,

240
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
I can't participate in the investigation.

241
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
But I can't let go.

242
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
I can't leave.

243
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
I secretly joined the arrest.

244
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
And I hurt the murderer.

245
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
I shouldn't be so impulsive.

246
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
I should do better.

247
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
I should find more evidence

248
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
to prove my innocence.

249
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I didn't go to the provincial court.

250
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
I chose a new position.

251
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
And I'm here.

252
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
I'm released.

253
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I didn't expect you to have a chance

254
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
to be a good man.

255
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
I just want to see you.

256
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
I have time to go home.

257
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
To see your wife.

258
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
I'll send you the address.

259
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Yes.

260
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
He came to our place

261
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
to be a performance guest.

262
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
He's a college student.

263
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
He wants to make some money.

264
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
He's the son of President Zhang.

265
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
He's the son of Zhang Haoyuan.

266
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
He introduced him here.

267
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
He plays the pipa very well.

268
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
The guests have good feedback.

269
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
It's about half a year.

270
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
He has one or two performances a month.

271
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Just performances?

272
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
No other shows?

273
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Of course not.

274
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Just performances.

275
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
We're a high-level club.

276
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
We don't have that kind of stuff.

277
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Besides, playing pipa

278
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
is also a way to promote our traditional culture.

279
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Right?

280
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Is there surveillance at the show?

281
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
No.

282
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
We're all guests.

283
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
We have to protect their privacy.

284
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
You're breaking the rules.

285
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
No matter how high-level the club is,

286
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
it's also a public entertainment place.

287
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Why don't you monitor it?

288
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Monitoring?

289
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Yes.

290
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,300
There are several big shows outside.

291
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Can you show us the footage?

292
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Well...

293
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Officer, I heard that this case has been solved.

294
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Is it necessary?

295
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Whether it's necessary or not,

296
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
you or I know.

297
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
This is the first time he's been here.

298
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
It's a video.

299
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Look, he's dressed up.

300
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Traditional Chinese clothing is high-class art.

301
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Take out all the surveillance footage.

302
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
You should avoid it.

303
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Okay.

304
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Okay.

305
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Look.

306
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
What would you like to drink?

307
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Spring water.

308
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Enjoy.

309
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
It's okay.

310
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
It's been kept for three months.

311
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Look at June 2.

312
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
I'm afraid we can't find anything.

313
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
In such a place,

314
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
bad things are done by the police.

315
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
Not necessarily.

316
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Not everyone will pay attention to where the surveillance is.

317
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
He's here.

318
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
He's here.

319
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
He came by himself.

320
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
He's out.

321
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,300
He came out in less than 20 minutes.

322
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
He hasn't changed.

323
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,300
He hasn't started performing yet.

324
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
He's finally back.

325
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
How long has it been?

326
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
28 minutes.

327
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
What does he have at hand?

328
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
Money?

329
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
What did he do here?

330
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
This is Li Longhe's car.

331
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,300
How can Shen Xiaozhou know Li Longhe?

332
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Could it be Li Dada?

333
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
There's a driver.

334
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Li Dada drives by himself.

335
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,820
He won't use this car

336
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,540
After Shen Xiaozhou left here

337
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,220
He went to Yang Tao

338
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,700
Yang Tao said

339
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,260
He was in a bad mood

340
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,220
And cried

341
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,260
How many secrets does Shen Xiaozhou have

342
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,620
That we don't know

343
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,780
Sorry, sorry

344
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,420
You didn't call me before

345
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,100
The chairman is not in the company

346
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,460
I came here for nothing

347
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,900
Where is he now

348
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,260
We can go to him

349
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,100
Tell me first

350
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,740
Ok?

351
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,860
I'll tell you

352
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,500
Sorry, it's not convenient

353
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,420
Just give me an address

354
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,260
This is not convenient either

355
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,940
What convenient

356
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,780
We are police

357
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,380
I know, comrade police

358
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,980
It's really not convenient

359
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,140
I'm not good enough

360
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,180
So

361
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
Please ask the director of the bureau

362
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,140
Call our chairman

363
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,420
Ask him in person

364
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,660
Interesting

365
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,380
Officer, wait a minute

366
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,100
Chairman personally approved

367
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,300
This is his address

368
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,760
Which Constitution

369
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,060
Let's drop the oil first

370
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,780
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
You're really something.

372
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,300
You let them take over the whole place.

373
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
This place

374
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,220
will be destroyed sooner or later.

375
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Your Chairman.

376
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Captain Lian.

377
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
You're here.

378
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,720
My son just got caught.

379
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,420
He's just on vacation.

380
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
Here, have a taste.

382
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,540
Green organic pollution.

383
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,140
I only eat my own vegetables now.

384
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,660
What kind of fertilizer do you use?

385
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Garlic.

386
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
Young man.

387
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,620
What do you think organic means?

388
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
It's the taste of my childhood.

389
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,140
Since you know we're coming,

390
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,420
I'll be frank.

391
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,220
Shen Xiaozhou may not be Li Dada's killer.

392
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,660
Do you know Shen Xiaozhou?

393
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,260
Yes.

394
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Good.

395
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Are you in the car?

396
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,260
Yes.

397
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,500
He was in the car for 28 minutes.

398
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,820
What happened?

399
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,820
If you can speak a little slower,

400
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,740
I'll be more willing to answer.

401
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
Excuse me.

402
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,620
What happened in these 28 minutes?

403
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,980
You're talking too much.

404
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,220
A few months ago,

405
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,940
when Shen Xiaozhou first came to the club

406
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
as a guest,

407
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,460
I noticed him.

408
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,820
He was well-educated and well-educated.

409
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,260
He was born with a good will.

410
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,860
He's also good at studying.

411
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
It's rare.

412
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,540
As I got to know him more and more,

413
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,420
I started to respect him more.

414
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,460
Later, I wanted him to work for our group.

415
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,420
That day in the car,

416
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,780
I gave him a contract.

417
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,340
I told him that

418
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,340
as long as he signed it,

419
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,500
it would be done.

420
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Contract?

421
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,940
Unfortunately, he refused.

422
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,660
He said it wasn't his profession.

423
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,420
He wanted to do his own profession.

424
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,980
By the way, I also invited him

425
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,540
to come to the Green Ecological Park.

426
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,180
I wanted to hear his opinion.

427
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,580
He gave a five-star review

428
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,260
to this tomato.

429
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,700
Did he return the contract to you later?

430
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,620
No.

431
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,220
Without signing the contract,

432
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,660
it's useless.

433
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,860
Then, June...

434
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Then,

435
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,500
on June 19,

436
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,260
the night of the crime,

437
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,860
do you know where Li Dada is?

438
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,260
I don't know.

439
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,980
I rarely contact him.

440
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,220
We rarely meet.

441
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,860
Where were you at that time?

442
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,340
Where was I on June 19?

443
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Check it for me.

444
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,740
June 19,

445
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,540
at night,

446
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,980
you went to meet

447
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,980
our representative from theスolons.

448
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,780
This is the video.

449
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,540
Jinhai No.1 sold well.

450
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,380
I gave awards

451
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,220
to those who were outstanding.

452
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,500
The meal was expected.

453
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,980
The chairman was there as well.

454
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,300
It was sold out by eleven.

455
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,940
Is there another problem?

456
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,460
I've been waiting all this time.

458
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,460
Can I contribute a pack of organic protein to Gui Bao's brother?

459
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,460
There's a toilet here.

460
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
No need.

461
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Brother,

462
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,460
I've heard about you.

463
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,460
You're the best at solving cases.

464
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,460
I've always respected the cause and the effect of peace.

465
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
I respect you.

466
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
I respect you.

467
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
The cause is the cause.

468
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,460
During the peace period, the police are the cause.

469
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,460
I'm sorry.

470
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Tinkai No. 1 is selling very well.

471
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
You can go and have a look if you have time.

472
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
If you like it, tell me.

473
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,460
But we'll follow the process.

474
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
I won't let you make mistakes.

475
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Thank you, Chairman.

476
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
My lover has really been there.

477
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,460
I'll definitely go and have a look if I have time.

478
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,460
Welcome.

479
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Thank you.

480
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Gui Bao's brother

481
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
This is not a proof.

482
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,460
There's a video and a house certificate.

483
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,460
There was a surveillance camera at the gate of the farm.

484
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,460
It's been taken down now.

485
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,460
There's a mark on the door.

486
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Why did you take it down?

487
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,460
I'm afraid people will know who came to Nongzhou on the 19th.

488
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
Shen Xiaozhou has been there?

489
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
No way.

490
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,460
It's dozens of kilometers away.

491
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,460
And we don't even know how Shen Xiaozhou left that street.

492
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
And the contract.

493
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
We haven't seen it either.

494
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
What?

495
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,460
Shen Xiaozhou didn't return it to Li Longhe.

496
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,460
He didn't throw it away.

497
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,460
He's not at school.

498
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,460
Could he be at home?

499
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,460
We didn't notice it last time.

500
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,460
What if he was wearing it on the day of the crime?

501
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
You think about it.

502
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Why would he wear it?

503
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,460
And is it really a contract?

504
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,460
Get back where it is.

505
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
Come on.

506
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
Are you okay?

507
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
He's back?

508
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,820
I've added a paper bag with cowhide paper.

509
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,540
It's about this big.

510
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,860
I've never seen it before.

511
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,540
Like this.

512
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,860
Like this.

513
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,500
Xiaozhou used this before.

514
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,420
He didn't want to throw it away.

515
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,300
It's for Hai.

516
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,100
Xiaozhou made this when he was a kid.

517
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,260
He lost it to Hai.

518
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,740
Hai.

519
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,380
Hai.

520
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,260
Can I have one?

521
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,500
Can I have one?

522
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,700
Sure.

523
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,340
Hai.

524
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,700
Hai.

525
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,020
Did Xiaozhou give you this USB?

526
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,420
Hai.

527
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,020
Here.

528
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,140
No.

529
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,980
No.

530
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,460
No.

531
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,700
Yes.

532
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,180
This USB shouldn't be broken.

533
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,740
Sometimes, Xiaozhou would come back with a computer

534
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,700
to write a thesis.

535
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,260
He used it to save it.

536
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,500
He shouldn't have left it.

537
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,460
Did Chen Xiaozhou put it in by himself?

538
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,900
I don't know.

539
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,100
This...

540
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,940
This is...

541
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,340
This is...

542
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,460
This...

543
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,180
This...

544
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,380
This is...

545
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,220
This is...

546
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,060
He said there were bad guys on TV.

547
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,260
Stealing USB.

548
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,220
Bad guys on TV.

549
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,340
Stealing USB.

550
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,900
Right?

551
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,420
Yes.

552
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,700
Hai.

553
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,300
Can you go to the police with us?

554
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,940
Yes.

555
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
Hai, he...

556
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,220
We need to get some fingerprints.

557
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,260
We go to the police.

558
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,660
To the police.

559
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,700
To the police.

560
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,580
To the police.

561
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,700
Okay.

562
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,900
Let me write it.

563
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,620
Hai.

564
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,220
What are you holding?

565
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,340
A little cover.

566
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,940
A little cover.

567
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,100
Okay.

568
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,300
Director Lian.

569
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,140
Xiaozhou has a clue.

570
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,300
Okay.

571
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,860
Director Lian.

572
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,500
The four fingerprints on the box.

573
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,740
Only Xiaozhou and Hai's fingerprints on this USB.

574
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,740
No other people's fingerprints.

575
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,260
Hai won't lie.

576
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,980
Xiaozhou won't take it if he doesn't give it.

577
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,380
Open it.

578
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,260
Okay.

579
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
I need a password.

580
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,780
Can you crack it?

581
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,060
It takes time.

582
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:08,900
Okay.

583
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,300
Okay.

584
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,380
261830

585
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
It's open.

586
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,300
How do you know?

587
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,220
Xiao Zhou.

588
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,340
Xiao Zhou.

589
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,460
Is there any special meaning in this number?

590
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
It seems like...

591
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,940
It seems like it's the birthday of our family.

592
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,980
Xiao Hai is 18th.

593
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
Xiao Zhou is 30th.

594
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Xiao Zhou.

595
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,740
Do you have a diary or a chat log?

596
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,100
It's all professional information.

597
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,020
Is there any hidden file?

598
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,620
It's all here.

599
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Let's share it.

600
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,460
Let's look for it together.

601
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
Okay.

602
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,020
You can go back after you finish eating.

603
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,380
Okay.

604
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
Thank you.

605
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Thank you.

606
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,100
It's all your fault.

607
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm sorry.

608
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,740
Why didn't I notice anything?

609
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,100
I feel like I've read half of the environmental protection.

610
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,900
I didn't understand anything.

611
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,260
I'll go back to sleep.

612
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,700
So,

613
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,900
Li Long He's suspicion can be eliminated?

614
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,780
We still need to investigate.

615
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,260
He's not here to fight against the evil.

616
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,580
What else can he do?

617
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,860
Between him and Shen Xiao Zhou,

618
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,620
it's not as simple as he said.

619
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Hai Piao.

620
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,140
I shouldn't have reminded you of your experience.

621
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,860
Did you invest too much personal feelings

622
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,500
into this case?

623
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
What do you mean?

624
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,500
You've been looking for evidence that it wasn't Li Da Da

625
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,140
who killed Shen Xiao Zhou.

626
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,660
If Shen Xiao Zhou was really killed by him,

627
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,580
shouldn't you come up with your own logic

628
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,260
and re-evaluate it?

629
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,940
It's a case of a rush.

630
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
It's a rush.

631
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,980
It's okay to follow.

632
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,620
Qiu Ju and I can give you time to work.

633
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,100
The problem is we have to have a deadline

634
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
to make a statement.

635
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,660
Give me two more days.

636
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,300
This is the testimony of the case

637
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,100
of Li Da Da killing Shen Xiao Zhou.

638
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Look.

639
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,180
The details are basically correct.

640
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,740
There's nothing I want to know.

641
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,980
What do you want to know?

642
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,540
I want to know

643
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,500
what happened to Shen Xiao Zhou

644
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,980
when he was killed

645
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,460
at 4 p.m. on June 19th.

646
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Yuan De.

647
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
If you have time,

648
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,940
check the USB drive carefully.

649
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,540
See if there's anything hidden.

650
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Okay.

651
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,700
I keep thinking

652
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,140
there's something

653
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,900
that he wouldn't

654
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,020
write down this password.

655
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,340
Maybe he wrote it

656
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,100
to be on the safe side.

657
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,420
To be on the safe side?

658
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,540
Leave it to us.

659
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,620
Should the police

660
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,060
put personal feelings into the case?

661
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,100
The old police

662
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
will never put personal feelings

663
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,740
into the case.

664
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,260
If they don't,

665
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,660
it's a kind of self-protection.

666
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,420
But can you control it?

667
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,180
The deeper you investigate,

668
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,420
the deeper you get into it.

669
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Sometimes,

670
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,780
in the most desperate,

671
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,180
in the darkest place,

672
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,260
you need to be strong

673
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,700
and keep going.

674
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,020
Don't flinch,

675
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,740
as if your heart is having trouble breaking.

676
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,380
Once you're satisfied and calm,

677
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,020
you feel so much better.

678
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
So,

679
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Have you seen this person?

680
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
No, I haven't seen him.

681
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
I haven't seen him.

682
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
Thank you.

683
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,300
Come on, get in the car.

684
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Come on, get in the car.

685
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,340
Come on, get in the car.

686
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
Come on, follow me.

687
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,420
Is there anyone else? Follow me.

688
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,460
Brother, do you have a car?

689
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Police, is your car an ambulance?

690
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
I...

691
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,700
Yes, no.

692
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,420
Police, I'm just a civil servant.

693
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
I'm not a police.

694
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
I'm a car inspector.

695
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,820
Do you come here every day?

696
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Where do you park your car?

697
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
I...

698
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,820
I'm a case inspector.

699
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
To be honest.

700
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,900
To Qianlong Bay.

701
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
I don't come here every day.

702
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
I only come here once a week.

703
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Once a week?

704
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,820
No wonder.

705
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,820
Yes.

706
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,820
I'm here to let the workers in the village and the police station

707
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
go into the city to buy things.

708
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,820
15 yuan per person is enough.

709
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,820
Did you come here on June 19th?

710
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
June...

711
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,820
I'll check the schedule.

712
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
June 19th.

713
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
June 19th.

714
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
Coming.

715
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,820
Have you seen this man?

716
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,140
He's so similar to this man.

717
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Did he really go to Li Yunhe?

718
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
He's here.

719
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
He's here.

720
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
He's here.

721
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,140
He's here.

722
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,140
He's here.

723
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,140
He's here.

724
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,140
He's here.

725
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
He's here.

726
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,140
He's here.

727
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,140
He's here.

728
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,460
We need to get the evidence of Shen Xiaoshu going to Li Yunhe's house.

729
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,460
Then we can confirm it.

730
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,460
Get your luggage in the car.

731
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,460
Hurry up.

732
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,460
Be careful.

733
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,460
He got off the car here.

734
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Can I go now?

735
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Go.

736
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,460
Six kilometers from Li Yunhe's farm.

737
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
So far.

738
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,460
How did he get there?

739
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Ask them.

740
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,460
If someone has pulled Shen Xiaoshu,

741
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,460
they will remember.

742
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Master, have you pulled this man?

743
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
I don't remember.

744
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,460
Hello, police.

745
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,460
Have you seen this man?

746
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,460
No.

747
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Master, have you pulled this man?

748
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
No.

749
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,780
I haven't seen him.

750
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Who didn't get off the car today?

751
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
There is.

752
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,780
Our car's owner, Xiang, didn't come today.

753
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,780
How many days has he not got off the car?

754
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,780
About 30 days.

755
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
He's been here for a long time.

756
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
He's been here for a long time.

757
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,780
He's been here for a long time.

758
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,780
He's been here for a long time.

759
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
About 30 days.

760
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Do you have his phone number?

761
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Hello, the number you dialed is busy.

762
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
It's off.

763
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Can you take us to him?

764
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
We'll pay the car fee.

765
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
The police are so polite.

766
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
No need to pay.

767
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Xiang.

768
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
Xiang.

769
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Don't knock.

770
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,420
No one.

771
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,420
He left early the day before yesterday.

772
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,420
Look, I told you.

773
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
He went to the third floor.

774
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Did you see him go?

775
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,420
I saw the car go.

776
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
It's still not dawn yet.

777
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,420
Besides, his car is good.

778
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
He's riding a bicycle.

779
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
Where are his parents?

780
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
His parents are gone.

781
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,420
He has a girlfriend.

782
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
He works in the provincial city.

783
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Where does he work in the provincial city?

784
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,420
Xiang is so good.

785
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,420
He sells seafood in a high-end restaurant.

786
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,740
I heard that a foreign crab can sell more than 1,000 yuan.

787
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,740
I was joking with him.

788
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
This is not crab.

789
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
This is for food.

790
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,740
Why doesn't he follow the provincial city?

791
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,740
What does he do in his hometown?

792
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,740
He's tired of working in the provincial city.

793
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Our police station is busy.

794
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,740
There are many cars.

795
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,740
Xiang has been thinking about it.

796
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,740
He said he would come back to marry his girlfriend after two years.

797
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,740
He will also open a farm.

798
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,740
There are seafood here.

799
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,740
Why do we eat foreign food?

800
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,740
He should be back.

801
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,740
He usually goes there for two or three days.

802
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,740
If Xiang sent Sheng Xiaozhou,

803
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,740
I'm afraid they have already found Xiang.

804
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,740
How do they know Xiang?

805
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,740
You forgot.

806
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,740
There was a surveillance camera at the gate of the farm.

807
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Xiang's car is easy to recognize.

808
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Xiang was threatened by them.

809
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
We have to find him.

810
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,740
You're back.

811
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,740
Captain Lian.

812
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,740
I have a new discovery.

813
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,740
I have read Xiang's USB drive several times.

814
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,740
Most of them are academic papers.

815
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,740
The title and content are clearly marked.

816
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,740
But these two files are different.

817
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
I just copied them out.

818
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,740
These two papers

819
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,740
mainly talk about the soil pollution of a chemical plant.

820
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,740
The title is not clear.

821
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,740
And the content has been deleted.

822
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
Someone deliberately deleted the name of the chemical plant

823
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,740
and the name of the environmental assessment agency.

824
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,740
I have to find out the name of the chemical plant.

825
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
I have to find out the name of the chemical plant

826
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
and the name of the environmental assessment agency.

827
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
But I found that

828
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,740
Look.

829
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
Isn't this very familiar?

830
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,740
Local?

831
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,740
Yes.

832
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,740
This chemical plant

833
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,740
is no longer a chemical plant.

834
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,740
It has been used as a commercial housing.

835
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,740
It's now...

836
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,740
Jinghai No. 1?

837
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,740
Yes. And I also found that

838
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,740
the environmental assessment agency for Jinghai No. 1

839
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,740
is Lv Cheng Environmental Protection Technology Company.

840
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,740
Lv Cheng?

841
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,740
The conclusion of these two reports is

842
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,740
that the soil pollution of the chemical plant

843
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,740
has been repaired and is no longer harmful.

844
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,740
But I always feel something wrong.

845
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,740
I don't understand.

846
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,740
What does this mean?

847
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,740
I don't understand either.

848
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,740
I just feel very suspicious.

849
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,740
The environmental assessment agency for Jinghai No. 1

850
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,740
is Lv Cheng Environmental Protection Technology Company.

851
