1
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,040
In an old documentary,

2
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,360
видно is talking about how she fell

3
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,000
at the stroke of a畫 and broke her glass.

4
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,240
This really brings you back Dynasty's childhood.

5
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,480
Now we're starting to investigate

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
if the Journalist really uncommonly

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,880
tries to go abo r,

8
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,760
even if required,

9
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
we're still surviving in Stargazer.

10
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,440
It can only meet the need of the While paper collection Team

11
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,620
I remember them.

12
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,260
Yes, such as your dad,

13
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,300
I bonsai farmers.

14
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,460
Many people could tell

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
you from behind.

16
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,900
Liking favored me.

17
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,620
So I couldn't tell to do this.

18
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,900
So now I'm enlisted,

19
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,540
and you'll be starting to get back to work.

20
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,020
And I just think

21
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,060
I should come back today.

22
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,220
So when will the show be aired?

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,740
Never mind.

24
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,820
Jesús,

25
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm also thinking about

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,900
business matters.

27
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,820
And for the television film contest,

28
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
You guessed it right.

29
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
He's out.

30
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Captain Lin, Hu Yongde is out.

31
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
He didn't take anything with him.

32
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
He looks like he's going home.

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Watch out. Be careful not to get lost.

34
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Okay.

35
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Let's go.

36
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
Yue Chunxia wants this kid.

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
It means he can't let go of Hu Xiangze.

38
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Can he?

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
He has to.

40
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
I just saw Shiniang and her brother.

41
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Why are they here?

42
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
It's okay.

43
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Give me a piece of paper.

45
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
It's gone.

46
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Are you okay?

47
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Xi,

49
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
do you think the car in front of you

50
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
and the toilet

51
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
are the most important things in your life?

52
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Or are they the most important things?

53
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
They are the most important things.

54
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
The most important things.

55
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Zheng,

56
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
my mom wants me to quit

57
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
and go to work as a professional.

58
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
I heard there's a lock down in our neighborhood.

59
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
They bought two houses.

60
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
Yes.

61
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
It's good.

62
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
You see, the bar is open.

63
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
We're not busy. We earn a lot.

64
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
And we're all convenient

65
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
in terms of public security and security.

66
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Yes.

67
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
Your technology is a blow to the party.

68
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
You have to look forward to it.

69
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
You're a real man.

70
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
I just want to be a cop.

71
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
At this moment tonight,

72
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
I won't change anything.

73
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
I know.

74
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
Can you hear me?

75
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
The police are looking for him.

76
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
He's a little nervous.

77
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Do you know who he is?

78
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Yes, I'll take him with me tonight.

79
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Can you handle it?

80
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
Yes.

81
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Don't move.

82
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
What's going on?

83
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
What's going on?

84
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
What's going on?

85
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Don't chase.

86
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Are you hurt?

87
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Go find Yue Chunxia.

88
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Why are you in such a hurry?

89
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Just go.

90
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Where's Yue Chunxia?

91
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
I can understand.

92
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
A girl

93
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
wants a complete family.

94
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
With her lover.

95
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
With her child.

96
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
A happy life.

97
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
There's no room for regret.

98
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
But the premise

99
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
is that the lover

100
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
really loves you.

101
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
She wants the child

102
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
to live the same life.

103
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Are you on the same page?

104
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
You're still too young.

105
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
You may not think so far.

106
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Even if you live that kind of life,

107
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
there's a big secret in your heart.

108
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
You're always sad.

109
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
You're too heavy

110
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
to be happy.

111
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Time can't be filled with guilt.

112
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
The pressure will only get bigger.

113
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
After all, Shen Xiaozhou

114
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
is your best friend.

115
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
We've been watching her for a long time.

116
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
She can't run away.

117
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Hello, Chunxia. Are you ready?

118
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
I can't pick you up now.

119
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
You call a taxi and come here yourself.

120
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Hello?

121
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Did you hear me, Chunxia?

122
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Is there a signal?

123
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Chunxia.

124
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Why don't you talk?

125
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
You won't regret it, will you?

126
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Listen to me.

127
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
I've arranged a passport for you.

128
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
We'll go to a place

129
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
where no one will bother us.

130
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
And think about our child.

131
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
You have to listen to me now.

132
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
Come with me now.

133
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Do you understand?

134
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Don't be a fool, Chunxia.

135
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
You won't come with me, will you?

136
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
But don't say a word to the police.

137
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Or I won't be able to save you.

138
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
I'll give you one more chance.

139
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
I'll wait for you for an hour.

140
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
This is from Hu Xiangze, right?

141
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
A small gift.

142
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
My lucky crystal.

143
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
He took it to engrave my name.

144
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Did Shen Xiaozhou give it to you

145
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
after something happened?

146
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
What Shen Xiaozhou encountered

147
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
was not an ordinary heart attack.

148
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
It should be this kind of multi-face physical.

149
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
Mom!

150
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Mom!

151
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
What's going on?

152
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Why did they take Chunxia away?

153
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Chunxia!

154
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
When did your father find out?

155
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
You can keep it to yourself.

156
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
When we first went to your house,

157
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
he already knew.

158
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Mom!

159
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
What should I do?

160
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
I don't know what to do.

161
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
What did you say?

162
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
We were on the same side.

163
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
You take her back.

164
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:27,740
I'll go to the

165
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
house.

166
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Mr. Hu.

167
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Where are we going?

168
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
You're going to wait for me there?

169
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
It's okay. We'll go for you.

170
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Okay.

171
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
Go!

172
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Captain.

173
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
There's no movement here.

174
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
All the entrances are blocked.

175
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
We can't protect them as long as they're here.

176
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
You guys, get out!

177
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
Do you know where Li Longhe is?

178
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
No.

179
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Captain.

180
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
Captain.

181
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
No.

182
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
No.

183
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Captain.

184
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
I don't have it.

185
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Captain.

186
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Move the entire farm

187
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
around.

188
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
Yes.

189
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
Captain Zhao.

190
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
I can't find it.

191
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
No car.

192
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
Report.

193
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
No car.

194
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
How is that possible?

195
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
Report. No car.

196
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
After dinner,

197
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,740
Li Longhe picked up two cucumbers in the garden.

198
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
No car was found.

199
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,740
Inform the city immediately.

200
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,740
Set up a checkpoint at all the railway and airport roads.

201
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Okay.

202
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Okay.

203
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,740
Hello, old man.

204
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Are you a local?

205
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Yes, I am.

206
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,740
I remember there is a tunnel in Tielong Bay.

207
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Do you know it?

208
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
It's a few miles away.

209
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
It's useless to go there.

210
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
The tunnel is closed.

211
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
We can't go in.

212
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Have you been there before?

213
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
Where is the tunnel going?

214
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
It's quite deep.

215
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
I can't figure out the direction.

216
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
It takes half an hour to get to the bottom.

217
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Can you take me there?

218
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,740
Sure.

219
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
Keep searching.

220
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
Turn around and find the tunnel.

221
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Tunnel? Where?

222
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
The air-raid shelter.

223
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Air-raid shelter?

224
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
It's a big project.

225
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Have you ever been there?

226
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,740
It's not impossible.

227
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
Follow me.

228
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
If the air-raid shelter is open,

229
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
you'll be in trouble.

230
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Let's go.

231
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Okay.

232
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Aren't you going to ask?

233
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,740
We'll wait.

234
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
If there's any misunderstanding,

235
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
we should make it clear.

236
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
I have to go on a business trip.

237
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Be honest.

238
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Why don't you check where it is?

239
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
If there's a misunderstanding, just tell me.

240
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,740
Yue Chunxia has already told us.

241
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
When you called her,

242
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
we were right next to her.

243
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Did I say anything?

244
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,740
It's normal for me to go out with my girlfriend, right?

245
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,740
What did she say to you?

246
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
She's still pregnant.

247
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Her blood pressure is unstable.

248
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
It's emotional.

249
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,740
She said that she was going to go out with her girlfriend.

250
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,740
She said that on the day of June 19th,

251
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,740
there was a dispute between you and your family

252
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,740
because of the miscarriage operation in Qingzhou.

253
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,740
During the time, you answered a phone call

254
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,740
and threw it away and went back to Linchuan.

255
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
You're smart.

256
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
You didn't go to a high speed.

257
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,740
But there was also a surveillance camera on the road.

258
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,740
After a few hours,

259
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,740
you returned to the hotel in Qingzhou.

260
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,740
The first thing you did was apologize to her.

261
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,740
What happened?

262
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Chunxia, I was wrong.

263
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,740
I've never wanted this child.

264
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,740
I fell in love with you since I met you.

265
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,740
I want to have a home for you.

266
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,740
I want to marry you and have a child with you.

267
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,740
I've always been happy.

268
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,740
The government will never change.

269
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,740
But something happened to me recently.

270
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,740
It will jeopardize my career.

271
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,740
It will even destroy everything I've done in all these years.

272
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,740
So I'm worried about our future.

273
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,740
I'm not going to fight with you.

274
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,740
I even want to take our child.

275
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,740
What happened?

276
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Chunxia, I'll tell you something.

277
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,740
You have to be prepared.

278
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,740
I've been through a project that has been changed.

279
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,740
It's a very serious problem.

280
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,740
Shen Xiaozhou found out.

281
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,740
He's going to the relevant department to sue us.

282
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,740
If he succeeds,

283
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,740
I will go to jail.

284
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,740
I might never be able to live in peace.

285
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,740
And your father's long-term renovation plan

286
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,740
will be ruined.

287
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,740
I was just going to handle this matter.

288
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
I persuaded him.

289
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,740
I begged him.

290
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,740
It's a pity.

291
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,740
I couldn't convince him.

292
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,740
How serious is this?

293
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,740
If you can't convince him, I can convince him.

294
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,740
I'll go.

295
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,740
Shen Xiaozhou.

296
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,740
He's dead.

297
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,740
I really like him.

298
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,740
I really like him.

299
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,740
He's so good to me.

300
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Xiaozhou is prettier than me.

301
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,740
He always likes me.

302
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,740
I'm different from Xiaozhou.

303
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
I don't have any pursuit.

304
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,740
I don't want to do any big business.

305
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,740
I don't want to be like my classmates.

306
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,740
I'm looking for a job.

307
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,740
I have to work from 9 to 7.

308
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,740
I don't have time for myself.

309
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,740
I want to be with my lover.

310
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,740
I want to take care of my child.

311
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
I want to make cakes.

312
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
I want to travel with him.

313
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,740
He can give me everything I want.

314
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,740
I'm so lucky to be with him.

315
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,740
I'm graduating soon.

316
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,740
My dream is coming true.

317
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,740
I can't live without these dreams.

318
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,740
I can't.

319
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,740
If something happens to each other, I'm done.

320
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,740
I want to be with him.

321
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,740
I want to be with him.

322
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,740
I miss Xiaozhou.

323
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,740
I try to convince myself every day.

324
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,740
For Xiaozhou.

325
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,740
But I don't dare.

326
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,740
I can't do it.

327
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Xiaozhou is dead.

328
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,740
But my life has just begun.

329
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,740
Officer Lin.

330
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Can Xiaozhou forgive me?

331
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,740
It's my fault.

332
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Can Xiaozhou forgive me?

333
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,740
Can she forgive me?

334
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,740
I'm wrong.

335
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,740
Will Xiaozhou understand me?

336
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,740
Most of them are right.

338
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Except for Shen Xiaozhou.

339
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,740
I'm afraid she's just thinking about it.

340
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,740
She's crazy.

341
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,740
She wants to use this way to lock me up.

342
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,740
She's afraid of losing me.

343
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Yes. I went back to Lidang.

344
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,740
But I did it for the company.

345
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,740
I didn't see Shen Xiaozhou.

346
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,740
You didn't see Shen Xiaozhou?

347
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,740
No.

348
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Then you didn't go back to the virtual reality?

349
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,740
I... Why did I go there?

350
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,740
When did you go back to the virtual reality?

351
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,740
Ten years ago.

352
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,740
Ten years ago?

353
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Did you remember it?

354
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,740
Yes.

355
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,740
I just went to the water treatment room in the virtual reality.

356
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,740
It's where we found Shen Xiaozhou.

357
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Because I saw her.

358
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,740
I saw her.

359
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,740
Because I saw a design drawing of the water treatment project.

360
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Yes.

361
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,740
When you were in the PhD, you were one of the designers.

362
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,740
I found a manual valve switch on that drawing.

363
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,740
I found a manual valve switch on that drawing.

364
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,740
When the water treatment was running normally,

365
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,740
the valve switch was controlled by the electric motor.

366
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,740
When the valve switch was turned on,

367
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,740
the water in the pool would flow from the bottom to the deep sea.

368
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,740
It's been wasted for so long.

369
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,740
Of course, the electric circuit can't be used.

370
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,740
It can only be used manually.

371
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,740
The murderer who killed Shen Xiaozhou

372
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,740
wanted to push her into the sea.

373
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,740
He wanted to push her into the sea.

374
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,740
He wanted to push her into the sea.

375
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,740
I think

376
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,740
he was familiar with the design of the pipe in the pool.

377
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,740
I think he was familiar with the design of the pipe in the pool.

378
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,740
It's a pity that the transmission device is broken.

379
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,740
The valve switch is not open.

380
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,740
I've already taken the fingerprint.

381
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,740
I've already taken the fingerprint.

382
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,740
The result of the comparison has come out.

383
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,740
You still insist that you haven't been to the pool for 10 years.

384
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,740
You want Li Longhe to come and save you, right?

385
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,740
You want Li Longhe to come and save you, right?

386
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,740
We're almost there. It's just ahead.

387
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,740
There's a car.

388
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,740
The pipe is closed.

389
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
Stop.

390
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,740
Get out of the car.

391
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Go.

392
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Go.

393
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Go.

394
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,740
Go.

395
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,740
Where's Li Longhe?

396
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,740
He hasn't come out yet.

397
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,740
He hasn't come out yet.

398
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Captain.

399
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,740
He's still here.

400
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,740
That's good.

401
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Yes.

402
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
Where did you hide it?

403
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,740
The police station.

404
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
The police station.

405
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
Xiaoya.

406
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Where did you hide it?

407
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Captain, there's a problem with this car.

408
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Didn't you search the car?

409
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
I just moved it.

410
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
Everyone, get out.

411
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
Open it.

412
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
Police.

413
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
Raise your hands slowly.

414
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Come on, hold your head.

415
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Pull it out.

416
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,740
Come on, one, two, three.

417
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Slow down.

418
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,740
I feel bad.

419
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
Why are you hiding in there alone?

420
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
I can't breathe.

421
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,740
It's okay. You breathe first.

422
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
It's okay.

423
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Tell me where Li Longhe is.

424
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Do you know where Li Longhe is?

425
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
I'm so hungry.

426
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,740
Linzi, move the car.

427
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
Don't move.

428
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
Don't move.

429
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,740
Where you were going,

430
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,740
our people have already gone.

431
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,740
Don't move.

432
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,740
This is the video of the first time you came back.

433
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
Don't move.

434
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,740
You're on the ground, aren't you?

435
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,740
We're filming.

436
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,740
This is their own gun.

437
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,740
This is a pin.

438
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,740
This is a bomb.

439
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,740
This is probably a destroyed bomb.

440
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Look at this.

441
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,740
This is before we were in the real-life arrest.

442
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,740
Their buried pit has been dug.

443
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
It's here.

444
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,740
Come on.

445
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,740
They buried a person there.

446
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,740
His name is Sha Hongli.

447
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,740
His nickname is Lao Sha.

448
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
Have you heard of him?

449
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,740
I think that place

450
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,740
should be able to find more people.

451
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,740
There are no fake passports or tickets.

452
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,740
They didn't plan to send you abroad.

453
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,740
That day,

454
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,740
in Qingzhou, the phone I received was from Li Ronghe.

455
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Cheng Xiao, stop messing around, okay?

456
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
We have a lot of opportunities in the future.

457
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,740
The timing is really not right. Do you understand?

458
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
Okay.

459
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,740
Mr. Li.

460
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Shen Xiaozhou just came to me.

461
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,740
It's still the same thing.

462
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
They all gave me the last pass.

463
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,740
Okay. I'm in Qingzhou now.

464
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,740
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

465
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,740
Didn't you destroy the data?

466
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
How did he get it?

467
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,740
This is really my fault.

468
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,740
I didn't clean it up.

469
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,740
Because one day, Xiaozhou was about to go to the company

470
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,740
to take some professional information.

471
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,740
She said she wanted to go home and study.

472
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Then I let her take it herself.

473
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,740
I really didn't expect her to take it all.

474
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Come in.

475
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Mr. Gu.

476
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
Xiao Tao.

477
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,740
Didn't we talk about this a lot?

478
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Senior.

479
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,740
You can do it yourself.

480
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,740
The project is all in the ground.

481
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,740
I'm going to have a meeting.

482
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Don't open those hidden files.

483
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,740
I'll go.

484
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,740
Are you comfortable?

485
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Or did you leave a hand?

486
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,740
I'm comfortable.

487
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,740
How can I do this?

488
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,740
Now she did the test.

489
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
This girl.

490
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
I don't care where you are now.

491
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,740
Come back to me right away.

492
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Listen.

493
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,740
I don't want to see her again.

494
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,740
Okay.

495
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Don't worry.

496
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
I'll think of something.

497
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,740
I'll give you an address.

498
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,740
After half an hour,

499
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,740
I'll send Shen Xiaozhou there.

500
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,740
There's no surveillance.

501
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Remember, don't take your phone.

502
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
Don't tell me anything.

503
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
What do you mean?

504
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
What do you mean?

505
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
What do you want me to do?

506
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Mr. Lu.

507
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,740
What do you mean?

508
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,740
Mr. Fang Gang made it very clear.

509
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,740
You understand.

510
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
You...

511
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,740
I'm sorry.

512
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,740
I'm sorry.

513
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
I'm sorry.

514
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
I'm sorry.

515
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,740
You should be in Qingzhou.

516
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,740
Oh.

517
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,740
I have something to do.

518
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Where's Chunxia?

519
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,740
She went home.

520
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,740
Go to the car.

521
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Go.

522
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,740
Go.

523
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
Xiaozhou.

524
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Don't be so anxious.

525
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,740
Even if you have to re-evaluate

526
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,740
and repair the soil again,

527
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,740
you need time.

528
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,740
At least the house of Jinghan 1

529
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,740
should stop selling immediately.

530
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,740
It's not as simple as you think.

531
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,740
Stop selling immediately.

532
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,740
How do you explain to the buyer?

533
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,740
How do you explain to the owner of the property?

534
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
We can't have an impact.

535
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,740
But how does this matter

536
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,740
have an impact?

537
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
Isn't it, Brother?

538
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,740
Xiaozhou.

539
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,740
I beg you.

540
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,740
For my sake,

541
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
can you let go of this matter?

542
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
I've talked to Chairman Li.

543
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
We will soon

544
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
give you a proper result.

545
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,740
But this matter,

546
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,740
from what I told you until now,

547
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,740
has been over half a month.

548
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,740
The house is still being sold.

549
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,740
Will you really handle it?

550
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,740
Jinghan 1 is so big.

551
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,740
It can accommodate 20,000 to 30,000 people.

552
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,740
I've shown you the residual pollution index.

553
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,740
The residual pollution index is so high.

554
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
It may cause a chicken, cancer,

555
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,740
or even a threat to the next generation.

556
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,740
This is a big deal, Brother.

557
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,740
How can you say it so seriously?

558
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
Isn't it serious?

559
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
Use your professional judgment to tell me.

560
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,740
Xiaozhou.

561
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,740
You're on leave from school after graduation.

562
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,740
When you're at work,

563
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,740
we'll talk again, okay?

564
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,740
I can still tell you.

565
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,740
I'll give you 10%.

566
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,740
20.

567
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
Do you think this is okay?

568
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
You...

569
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
You want to raise my salary?

570
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Then I have to thank you.

571
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,740
We've been discussing this.

572
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,740
I understand you.

573
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,740
It's important to you.

574
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,740
There's something else.

575
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,740
A reward.

576
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,740
And if something happens to you at home,

577
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,740
the company will take care of it.

578
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,740
And I'm just like you.

579
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,740
I understand you.

580
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,740
I'm sorry, Brother.

581
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,740
I don't plan to work here anymore.

582
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,740
Don't say that, Xiaozhou.

583
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,740
Xiaozhou, I know you still trust Brother.

584
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,740
Really.

585
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,740
Otherwise, you have so much evidence.

586
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,740
You could have reported us to the relevant department.

587
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,740
I really appreciate you.

588
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,740
I'm sorry.

589
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,740
I'm sorry.

590
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,740
You can follow me from now on.

591
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,740
You can do a big experiment.

592
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,740
You can realize all your ideas.

593
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,740
We can do it together.

594
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,740
I trust you.

595
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,740
But I'm doing this for the daily wage.

596
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,740
What about the daily wage?

597
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,740
The daily wage is about to be developed.

598
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,740
If anything happens to the Group,

599
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,740
the neighbors of the factory

600
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,740
and the uncle and aunt

601
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,740
will have to wait

602
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
until they have their own new house.

603
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Brother, I'm begging you.

604
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
It's not too late.

605
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,740
There are so many ways.

606
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,740
Whether it's physical repair

607
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
or chemical cleaning,

608
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,740
you can try.

609
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,740
It's not that simple.

610
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,740
Do you know how much it will cost?

611
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,740
Do you know how much it will cost?

612
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,740
Do you know?

613
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,740
Do you know how much it will affect us?

614
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,740
Do you know how much it will affect us?

615
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,740
Do you know?

616
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,740
If you don't care,

617
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,740
then I have no other way.

618
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,740
How could we not care?

619
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,740
How could we not care?

620
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,740
The world is in the clouds

621
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,740
The dark is about to fall

622
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,740
The truth is turning

623
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,740
The love is still

624
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,740
struggling

625
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,740
It's a life of courage

626
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,740
Is there a storm

627
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,740
that can

628
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,740
separate you from the rest

629
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
Is there a firework

630
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,740
that can

631
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,740
burn the lies

632
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,740
that have been

633
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,740
in the past

634
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,740
If I can

635
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,740
feel the love

636
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,740
in the dark

637
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,740
The fate is still

638
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,740
moving

639
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,740
If I can

640
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,740
hear the heartbeat

641
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
and see the

642
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,740
smile that has been

643
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,740
in the dream for a long time

644
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,740
How I wish to be the light

645
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,740
In the world

646
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,740
I have lit up the way

647
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,740
I came

648
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,740
to light up

649
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,740
The truth is

650
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
but there is always

651
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,740
a way

652
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,740
The memories are like the wind

653
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,740
that cuts through the rain

654
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,740
The story

655
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,740
is moving

656
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,740
The tension

657
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,740
is spreading

658
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,740
like a prison

659
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,740
I'm trapped

660
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,740
Is there a storm

661
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,740
that can

662
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,740
separate you from the rest

663
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,740
Is there a firework

664
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,740
that can

665
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,740
burn the lies

666
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,740
that have been

667
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,740
in the past

668
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,740
If I can

669
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,740
feel the love

670
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,740
in the dark

671
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,740
The fate is still

672
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,740
moving

673
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,740
If I can

674
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,740
hear the heartbeat

675
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,740
and see the

676
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,740
smile that has been

677
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,740
in the dream for a long time

678
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,740
How I wish to be the light

679
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,740
In the world

680
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,740
I have lit up the way

681
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,740
The truth is

682
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,740
but there is always

683
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,740
a way
